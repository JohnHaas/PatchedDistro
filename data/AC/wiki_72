Chantal Sutherland

Chantal Sutherland (born February 23, 1976 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian model, television personality and jockey in North American Thoroughbred horse racing. She is referred to as the Danica Patrick of horse racing. She is known for her appearances on the reality tv show, Jockeys on Animal Planet, as well as being the poster girl for the Del Mar racetrack. During an interview on Sky Sports in the lead-up to the Dubai World Cup race, she said that her primary vocation was jockey.
Early Life/Career.
Sutherland grew up in the Toronto, Ontario area where her father owns a horse farm. As a young girl, she played competitive field hockey and was invited to try out for Canada's junior World Cup team. She rode horses in equestrian events but after graduating from York University with a degree in communications and psychology, she decided to explore the opportunity to ride Thoroughbreds in flat racing.
Beginning in the year 2000, the Del Mar Racetrack's Del Mar Thoroughbred Club marketing team went through a major shift in their marketing direction. They realized they had to attract a more youthful audience as well as a female audience. They focused Del Mar as a fashionable destination, using social media and other avenues to market the racetrack. They hired jockey and model Chantal Sutherland to be the new face of the Del Mar racetrack.
Their strategy worked as over 13 years later Del Mar has changed their demographics and audience attendance.
On October 9, 2000, at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Sutherland won her first career race. The following year, she was voted the Sovereign Award as Canada's top apprentice jockey, repeating in 2002 when she was one of Canada’s highest-paid female athletes, earning $5.7 million in purses in eight months. She finished third in the Woodbine standings that year with 124 victories with earnings of $5,751,417. She finished 31st in the national earnings title in that same year as she earned $5,968,460 with victories of 136 and had 754 mounts. She remained in Canada until the end of 2004. In the winter of 2004, she rode the winter months in the Maryland Circuit riding at Laurel Park Racecourse.
In 2005, she went to race in Florida and New York, where jockeys Angel Cordero, Jr., Shane Sellers and Edgar Prado helped her hone her skills. She rode the winter meet at Aqueduct in 2007. Her highlight in New York was a victory in the Tom Fool Handicap with Smokume at Belmont Park. During her time in New York, she rode for Hall of Fame trainer H. Allen Jerkens and trainer Todd Pletcher. In 2006, she partnered Gigawatt to win the Grade 3 Miami Mile Handicap.
Sutherland quickly became a top rider in Canada, but she realized that riding in Canada was never going to land her in the Kentucky Derby or the Breeders' Cup races. She then relocated to Southern California. 
In 2007, she returned to Canada to ride at Woodbine after a 2-year stint in the New York and Florida circuit. She finished seventh in the Woodbine standings with 69 victories out of 572 mounts with earnings of $3,246,387. She finished 77th in the national earnings title that same year with 79 victories out of 668 mounts with earnings of $3,480,229.
From December 2007 to April 2008, Sutherland competed at Santa Anita Park in California. Retired U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens said: "She has become the queen of the longshots. She has won several photos against top jockeys, which shows she is a strong finisher." Allen Gutterman, Santa Anita racetrack's head of marketing, said Sutherland "could become the best female jockey since Julie Krone." Sutherland returned to Toronto for the 2008 racing season, and on August 9 she rode five winners on a single race card. In the summer of 2008, she rode future Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird to stakes wins in the Silver Deputy, Swynford and Grey stakes at Woodbine and finished 12th aboard Mine That Bird in the 2008 Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita. She also rode Van Lear Rose in that year Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies to finish sixth. She rode the 2008 Oak Tree meeting as she left Canada in October 2008 to ride in California as it lasted for 6 months out in California as she rode also the 2008 Hollywood Park fall meeting and the 2009 Santa Anita meeting.
In 2008, she finished seventh in the Woodbine standings with earnings of $4,947,630 and had 89 victories out of 590 mounts. She finished 38th in the national earnings title with earnings of $5,937,965 and with victories of 116 out of 832 mounts.
She got publicity when she was one of the jockeys featured on the reality tv show Jockeys on Animal Planet. It lasted for two seasons.
Sutherland had an on-again-off-again relationship with Hall of Fame jockey Mike E. Smith for six years, until 2010. Although engaged at one point, they broke the engagement in June 2010, two weeks before they raced each other at the Queen's Plate in Woodbine. In August 2011, the two were paired in a match race nicknamed the "Battle of the Exes". 
Sutherland finished second in the 2009 Woodbine jockey standings with earnings of $7,588,868 with victories of 139 and had 981 mounts. She finished in 2009 22nd in the national earnings title as she earned $7,451,964 with victories of 159 and had 1,131 mounts. She was a finalist for the 2009 Sovereign Awards for Outstanding Jockey of the year.
Sutherland rode the 2010 Woodbine meet in Canada, though she has enjoyed some success in California, winning both the Grade 2 Santa Ynez Stakes and the Grade 2 El Encino Stakes. It was her best year on earnings wise and peak position wise which placed her 13th on the National Earnings List with $8,778,038 on earnings with 152 wins.
Since 2011, she now rides daily on the Southern California Circuit. In March 2011 Sutherland rode Game On Dude in the Santa Anita Handicap and won by a nose in a victory that was as controversial as it was historic. It included a 12-minute stewards’ inquiry due to heavy contact between her horse and two others at the top of the stretch. Ultimately the results were upheld by a 2-1 vote, making her the first female jockey to win "the Hundred Grander". In the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 5, 2011, she again led in the stretch with Game On Dude, as she sought to become the first women jockey to win the Classic. However, she was passed by Drosselmeyer, ridden by Smith, near the wire and finished 2nd to her ex-boyfriend.
On March 31, 2012, riding Game On Dude, she made history as the first woman jockey to ride in the world's richest horse race, the $10 million Dubai World Cup. 
Sutherland married businessman Dan Kruse in May 2012, just nine months after meeting him on a blind date.
In July 2012, once again on board Game On Dude, Sutherland became the first female jockey to win the Hollywood Gold Cup.
On Sunday October 21, 2012 at Woodbine Race Course she announced her retirement from the sport of horse racing as a jockey.www.woodbineentertainment.com She returned to racing in July, 2013 at BetFair Hollywood Park.

Ferrari F92A

The Ferrari F92A was a Formula One car designed by Jean-Claude Migeot for the Ferrari for use in the 1992 Formula One season. There were two versions of the car, the original version raced in the first eleven races of the season, with the updated F92AT version racing in the latter stages of the season. The car was driven by Jean Alesi for the entire season, and by Ivan Capelli for most of the season, before he was sacked and replaced by Nicola Larini.
The car was most famous for its "double-flat bottom" floor that made it difficult to drive. The car only achieved two podiums and a total of 21 points. The F92AT version was introduced at a test day in August held at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit and first appeared in the championship at the Grand Prix of Belgium. The new version incorporated a seven-speed transverse gearbox, with a modified front suspension. It also included a more rigid engine mounting system and an up to date version of the underwing. The best results were two third places by Jean Alesi.
The F92AT driven late in the season by Nicola Larini carried the team's first attempt at an active suspension. This gave Larini's car a 30 kg weight disadvantage to team mate Jean Alesi's version. Unfortunately this was too much for Larini and the team to overcome with Larini only placing 12th and 11th in his only drives with the team.
The F92AT was replaced for the season by the Ferrari F93A.
On 16 August 2013, Codemasters announced that the F92A would be one of several Ferrari F1 cars set to feature in the classic edition of "F1 2013". Jean Alesi and Ivan Capelli are the listed drivers of the car within the game.

Wang Cong'er

Wang Cong'er (, c. 1777-1798) was a female Chinese leader of anti-Manchu White Lotus Rebellion during the reign of the Qing dynasty.
Early life.
Reportedly born in 1777, Wang Cong’er was a native of Xiangyang City.
White Lotus Sect.
The White Lotus Sect originated during the Yuan Dynasty. Wang Cong’er led the uprising of the White Lotus sect against the Qing regime. She reportedly used Kung Fu and acrobatics, and fought with a sword in each hand. Intent on avenging the death of her husband at the hands of the Qing, Wang led an army of men into battle against the Qing army. Though Wang’s peasant troops were at an obvious disadvantage, they overcame and surprised the Qing troops repeatedly by using guerrilla tactics. The contemporary records of the Qing Court stated that "the deadliest of all the rebels are those led by Madam Wang, wife of Qi" and "it is said that all the rebel factions from Hubei and Shanxi were stirred up by Wang".
The Qing General Ming Liang eventually recruited local landlords to build forts and lock civilians inside whenever rebels were in the area, cutting off support from civilian sympathizers who were a key part of the rebels' supply chain. In 1798 the Qing forces, with an increased number of warriors, ambushed Wang Cong’er and her fighters in the mountains near Yunxi, Hubei. After thousands of her men were defeated, Wang was forced to retreat. With no escape route available, she reportedly jumped to her death. Despite being defeated, Wang Cong’er has been credited with creating a precedent for revolts against Chinese imperial rule.

Egypt–Turkey relations

Egyptian–Turkish relations are bilateral relations between Egypt and Turkey. Egypt and Turkey are bound by strong religious and historical ties, but diplomatic ties between the two have remained extremely friendly at times and extremely strained at others. For five centuries, Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire, whose capital was Constantinople in modern-day Turkey. Turkey established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1925 at the level of Charge d’ Affaires and upgraded its mission in Cairo to Ambassadorial level in 1948. Both countries have embassies and consulate generals in the other's capitals. Both countries have signed a free trade agreement in December 2005. Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean. A natural gas deal between Egypt and Turkey—the largest joint Egyptian-Turkish project to date, estimated to cost $4 billion—is being implemented. On 16 April 2008, Egypt and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding to improve and further military relations and cooperation between the two countries. Relations however have been quite tense on many occasions in history of both countries including the Nasser era in Egypt in the 50s and 60s. It has also strongly deteriorated in the period following the ouster of the Egyptian Islamist president Mohamed Morsi by the military on July 3, 2013. On 23 November 2013, the Egyptian government expelled the Turkish ambassador in Cairo after a months-long diplomatic crisis.
Diplomatic relations.
Relations during the Nasser era in Egypt.
In the midst of the Cold War and during the rule of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, relations between both countries have soured dramatically due to Turkey's membership in the British-led Baghdad Pact, whom Nasser viewed as a major threat to his efforts to eliminate Western presence in the Arab world, and because of the growing influence of Nasser's Pan-Arab ideology, called Nasserism. In addition, Turkey was the first Muslim majority country to recognize the State of Israel, Egypt's arch rival at the time, showing even more its clear alignment to the West. In 1958, Egypt entered a brief union with Syria, Turkey's southern neighbor with whom it shared longtime diplomatic and border disputes, causing severe tensions between the two countries with Turkey responding by its engagement in a secret "peripheral alliance" with Israel. The tensions reached their peak in 1957 prior to the unification with Syria when Nasser, fearful of a Baghdad Pact toppling of the Syrian regime, sent a contingent force to assist Syrian forces that was dispatched near the Syrian-Turkish border as a response to a Turkish threat of incursion when a huge number of troops amassed along the border. This near-confrontation between Egyptian and Turkish troops marked a dark spot in both countries' relations and eventually led to both sides withdrawing, ending the possible escalation of the crisis.
Relations during the Erdogan era in Turkey.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made his first three days official visit to Egypt on 12 September 2011, and was accompanied by six ministers and approximately 200 businessmen. This visit was considered a diplomatic success and was met with much enthusiasm by Egyptians. CNN reported some Egyptians saying "We consider him as the Islamic leader in the Middle East", while others were appreciative of his role in supporting Gaza. Erdogan was later honored in Tahrir Square by members of the Egyptian Revolution Youth Union, and members of the Turkish embassy were presented with a coat of arms in acknowledgement of the Prime Minister’s support of the Egyptian Revolution.
A week after he left, Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu proclaimed his vision of a strategic alliance between Egypt and Turkey which he described as an “Axis of Democracy”. However, some voiced concerns that the Egyptian revolution was not fulfilled and that Erdogan was seeking his own country's strategic interests. It was feared that by forming an alliance with the military junta in Egypt during the country’s transition to democracy, Erdogan may have tipped the balance in favor of those that stand between the Egyptians and their freedom.
Post June 30 revolution tensions.
Following the Egyptian revolution in early July 2013 that ousted former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi who was strongly backed by Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), signs of strained relations rose between the newly appointed government of Egypt and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government in Turkey culminating with the August clashes when Egyptian security forces raided pro-Morsi protest camps organized by the Muslim Brotherhood resulting in hundreds of fatalities. The incident resulted in both countries recalling their respective ambassadors and was met with several verbal assaults by Turkey's PM who described the event as anti-democratic and called it a "massacre" while suggesting that Egypt's leaders should be put under "fair and transparent trial". This was followed by a suspension of military exercises involving the two countries. Erdoğan also accused the Egyptian military of conspiring with Israel to topple Morsi's government at an expanded meeting of the provincial chairs of his ruling AKP and claimed to possess "proof" for that: “This is what has been implemented in Egypt. Who is behind this? Israel. We have evidence”. The claim was denied by Egypt's interim government describing it as "baseless" and intended to "strike at the unity of Egyptians" with Presidential spokesperson Ahmed Muslimani saying that "agents of the West should not give lessons in patriotism".
In response to Erdoğan's statements, Egypt's interim president Adly Mansour announced on his Twitter account on August 17 that Egypt decided to sign the international document recognizing the Armenian Genocide:
“Our representatives at the United Nations will sign the international document that acknowledges the Armenian genocide, which was committed by the Turkish military, leading to the deaths of one million.”
In addition, dozens of Egyptian articles have been published condemning Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide and urging the country's new leaders to recognise it. There have also been calls to erect a memorial monument commemorating the victims of the genocide in Cairo.
On 23 November 2013, the Egyptian government expelled the Turkish ambassador to the country, Huseyin Avni Botsali, and recalled their ambassador from Ankara indefinitely after several months of tensions with Turkey's ruling AKP-led government. In response, Turkey also barred the Egyptian ambassador, who was out of the country at the time, and declared him a persona non grata. The declaration came a day after Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeated his criticism of Egypt's interim government and his call for the urgent release of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. The Egyptian authorities accused Ankara of meddling in the country's internal affairs by raising public opinion against the government and backing proscribed organizations that are bent on destabilizing the nation.

Bolton East by-election, 1960

The Bolton East by-election, 1960 was a by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of Bolton East in Lancashire on 16 November 1960. It was won by the Conservative Party candidate Edwin Taylor.
Vacancy.
The seat became vacant when the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament Philip Bell, QC, was appointed as a County Court Judge. He had held the seat since the 1951 general election.
The by-election saw the decision of the Liberal Party to field a candidate, which broke a local pact which had held for 10 years whereby the Liberals left the Bolton East seat alone, and in return the Conservatives did not stand in Bolton West; the pact had achieved its objective of preventing the Labour Party from winning either.
Result.
Taylor was elected by a margin of 641 votes over Labour candidate Robert Howarth, with the Liberal candidate Frank Byers securing a quarter of the vote. Dissension within the Labour Party over nuclear disarmament was thought to have helped Taylor win.
At the 1964 general election, a more organised Labour campaign in Bolton East saw Taylor voted out by a margin of more than 3,000 votes (with the Liberals simultaneously losing Bolton West by roughly the same margin).

List of UEFA club competition winners

The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is the governing body for association football held in Europe. It currently runs three club competitions: the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup. UEFA was also responsible for the Cup Winners' Cup and the Intertoto Cup, until their discontinuation in 1999 and 2008, respectively. Together with Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL), it also organized the Intercontinental Cup, which was last held in 2004, before its replacement by FIFA's Club World Cup. 
The only team to have won every confederation club competition is Juventus of Italy. They received "The UEFA Plaque" on 12 July 1988, in recognition of winning the three seasonal confederation trophies (European Champions' Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup). Juventus eventually won the European Super Cup for the first time in 1984, its first Intercontinental Cup in 1985 and the Intertoto Cup in 1999. Their Italian rivals, Milan, are the club with the most titles won in European competition, having won a total of 17 titles. Spanish club Real Madrid – which holds the record for the most European Champions Clubs' Cup victories – is the second most successful club, with 15 titles, while Barcelona is third, with 12 titles. Italian clubs are the most successful, having won 48 titles, but closely followed by Spanish clubs, with 46 titles.
While the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is considered to be the predecessor to the UEFA Cup, UEFA does not recognize it officially, and therefore successes in this competition are not included in this list. Also excluded are the unofficial 1972 European Super Cup, and the Club World Cup, a FIFA competition.

General Sir Mowbray Thomson (1832 – 25 February 1917) was a British Army officer.
He was born in 1832, and travelled to India at an early age. In 1853 he joined the 53rd Bengal Native Infantry – a regiment with Indian troops and white officers - as a subaltern, and in early 1857 moved with the regiment to Cawnpore.

He was invalided home, heavily wounded, and promoted to brevet-major. On returning to duty he was given a civilian post as political agent at Manipur, and later appointed Governor-General's agent for Wajid Ali Shah, the former King of Oudh. He retired in 1885, with the Army rank of major-general, and was promoted to full general in 1894.

Mendocino Presbyterian Church

__NOTOC__
The Mendocino Presbyterian Church is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Presbyterian church building located at 44831 Main Street, in Mendocino, California. Built of coast redwood, it sits on the Mendocino headlands overlooking the Pacific Ocean; its board and batten exterior walls, tall side-entrance bell tower, steep gabled roof and lancet windows are typical of many Carpenter Gothic churches. Its stained glass windows were made by local stained glass artist Leone McNeil Zimmer.
The church is California Historical Landmark No. 714 and is also a contributing property in the Mendocino and Headlands Historic District which was added on July 14, 1971, to the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The church was designed by architects S. C. Bugbee & Son of San Francisco and was built between 1867-1868 at a cost of $10,000 by contractor Albert Maxwell. On July 5, 1868, it was formally dedicated. It served as the model for the more elaborate Church of the Good Shepherd, Berkeley that S. C. Bugbee's son Charles L. Bugbee designed in the late 1880s.
In 1947 parts of the movie Johnny Belinda, which starred Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres, were filmed on the premises and the church received enough money to buy a new roof.
Current status.
Today the church is an active congregation in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and is one of the oldest continuously-used Protestant churches in California.

Gentle on My Mind (1967 Glen Campbell album)

Gentle on My Mind is the sixth album by American singer-guitarist Glen Campbell, released in 1967 by Capitol Records.
Background.
The centerpiece of the album is "Gentle on My Mind". Campbell heard songwriter John Hartford's original version on the radio and fell in love with this song about memories of a lost love. At the time, Campbell was under contract with Capitol Records as a solo artist but had little success in establishing a name for himself in the public eye. Campbell gathered some of his fellow session players from the famous "Wrecking Crew" gang (which included Leon Russell) to come into the Capitol studio to record a demo version that he could pitch to his producer. Between phrases and stanzas, Campbell would yell instructions to the players. He then left the rough recording for his producer to listen to. His producer fell in love, not only with the song, but with the recording itself. Without telling Campbell, he took the tape back into the studio and removed the unwanted verbiage from between the phrases. He then released the demo recording, which became a mega-hit for Campbell when it was released. Hartford’s inspiration for the song came from watching the film Dr. Zhivago. He would later remember, "I know watching the movie gave me a feeling that caused me to start writing, but as far as saying it came from that, I don't know. It just came from experience. While I was writing it, if I had any idea that it was going to be a hit, it probably would have come out differently and it wouldn't have been a hit. The song came real fast, in about 15 minutes. It was a blaze, a blur."

In 1967, Campbell won two Grammy Awards in the categories Best Country & Western Recording and Best Country & Western Solo Vocal Performance, Male for "Gentle on My Mind". In 2008,

I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying

I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying was a 1963 hit by The Miracles on Motown's Tamla label. It was a "Billboard" Top 40 Pop hit,reaching # 35 on that chart, and a Top 20 hit on its R&B chart, peaking at # 17 . It was written and produced by Motown's main songwriting team, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, and was the follow-up to the group's Top 10 pop hit, "Mickey's Monkey", written by the same team.
The smash success of that song, according to Motown policy, automatically gave Holland-Dozier-Holland the green light to write and produce the Miracles' next release, which resulted in this song. Like "Mickey's Monkey", "I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying" features a "live party" feel. The song's title is a play on the old expression, "I Gotta "Laugh" to Keep From Crying", highlighting the all-too-human tendency to escape from heartbreak or personal pain by dancing, laughing and having a good time. Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, as the song's narrator, portrays a young man trying to get over the heartbreak of a recent breakup with his girl: "Gather 'round me, swingers and friends...help me forget my hurt within...I lost the only girl I've ever loved...the only one I'm thinking of...and I've gotta dance to keep from crying..." Holland-Dozier-Holland later went on to write another Top 20 hit for the Miracles in 1966, "(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need", which was the last song to bill the group as "The Miracles" before their name was officially changed to "Smokey Robinson and the Miracles". "I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying" has inspired cover versions by The Who and Jimmy James, and was included on the group's albums "The Miracles Doin' Mickey's Monkey", "I Like It Like That" (withdrawn from the U.S.), "Greatest Hits from the Beginning", and several other Miracles "greatest hits" albums and CD anthologies.
The song was ranked Number 356 out of the "1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made" by the American rock critic Dave Marsh, who wrote: "no band ever cut a deeper groove than the Motown group does here". The British rock journalist Jon Wilde ranked it Number 6 among his top ten favourite songs in 2007, calling it "pure Motown gold and the greatest party-on record there ever was".

Elmwood Park (Omaha)

The Elmwood Park neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska is a historically significant area that was developed in the late 19th and early 20th century. It extends from Leavenworth Street on the north to Center Street on the south; from South 50th Street on the east to South 72nd Street on the west. Home to ethnic Swede celebrations through the 1950s, today the neighborhood's park hosts the city's "Shakespeare on the Green" festival.
History.
Before the neighborhood was created, the area was the focus of the first court trial ever held in the Nebraska Territory. The case took place in 1857 when F.M. Woods brought a case against J. Pentecost for land theft. Defended by Nebraska Territorial politician Edward Morearty, Pentecost won the trial.
In the 1880s C.C. and J.E. George laid out Happy Hollow Boulevard and developed the area south of Dodge and west of 50th to Elmwood Park. They filled in the creek that ran along 50th Street and added sidewalks and streetlights. Homes in the area reflected the Colonial, Georgian and Tudor Revival styles. Omaha annexed Elmwood Park and the surrounding neighborhood on April 24, 1917.
Park and boulevard.
In 1889 H.W.S. Cleveland recommended that Omaha acquire a park large enough to shut out city sights and sounds in order to refresh the senses. Elmwood Park, founded in 1889 at 802 South 60th Street, was one of Omaha's largest parks through the 1950s. Soon after the city acquired an initial donation of land for the park, the "Omaha Bee" described it as a "wild and romantic place... containing a wooded ravine that followed the course of a small stream." They continued, "There are all manner of shady nooks in this dell, and some of the largest forest trees in this section of the country are to be seen in it." The park, along with Happy Hollow Boulevard, was part of Cleveland's parks and boulevard plan for Omaha. Today the boulevard runs north from Elmwood Park past the University of Nebraska at Omaha campus and Memorial Park, onward to Benson. A Moorish Castle-style pavilion was built in 1890 for $5,586. Originally an open air structure, it was condemned in 1939 as unsafe and closed, leading to its enclosure sometime later. 
In 1912 a local businessman donated a totem pole to the park that stood there through the 1930s, and the park was the site of camping grounds through the 1950s. The Elmwood Park Golf Course was opened in 1916, and featured ravines, grassy fields and roadways throughout. By 1917, the park had grown to , and it was the second largest in the city. From the late 19th century through the 1930s an annual park was held for Omaha's African American community at the park, with as many as 10,000 people attending. The University of Nebraska at Omaha relocated from its North Omaha campus to a parcel next to the park in 1937, sealing the park's size permanently. In the 1940s native Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett set up a golf ball stand at the golf course in the park. Renovated again in 1987, the city spent $100,000 from a bond issue to replace windows and repair restrooms at the pavilion. The park received a $1 million renovation in 1993, and in 2000 the Peter Kiewit Foundation made a significant grant to the city that allowed the city to renovate the park’s historic spring area, improve the swimming pool and create new entrance signage.
Today Elmwood Park includes the 18-hole golf course, two baseball fields and a swimming pool. There are also paths and trails for biking and walking; a lagoon, picnic areas, restrooms, the historic pavilion, open spaces and a historic marker.

Battle of Littleferry

The Battle of Littleferry (also known as the Skirmish at Golspie) took place during the Jacobite rising in 1746, just before the Battle of Culloden. Scottish forces loyal to the British government defeated a Scottish Jacobite force.
Background.
Following the Skirmish of Tongue where a significant amount of money and urgent supplies had been captured from the Jacobites by forces under Captain Hugh Mackay, a strong force of Jacobites was sent north in an attempt to recover the supplies. This Jacobite force comprised some of their best fighting men; the MacGregors, Coll Macdonnell of Barrisdale, the Mackinnons and the Jacobite Mackenzies under George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie. This force arrived too late to be of any assistance to their allies who had been captured at the Skirmish of Tongue.
William Sutherland, 17th Earl of Sutherland was loyal to the Hanoverian government, but he had not raised and armed his clan quickly enough to take action against Prince Charles Edward Stuart. This led to a suspicion in London that Sutherland might be disloyal. However, the Jacobites also questioned Sutherland's loyalty, and the Jacobite Earl of Cromartie was sent with 500 men against the Earl of Sutherland. Cromartie's force stormed Dunrobin Castle; the Earl of Sutherland narrowly escaped them through a back door of the castle.
The battle.
The Earl of Cromartie and his force decided to re-join the main Jacobite force under Prince Charles at Inverness. However he and his men were attacked, with vigour at Little Ferry by two Highland Independent Companies, one from the Clan Sutherland and one from the Clan Mackay, led by Ensign John Mackay of Moudale.
Believing that all of Sutherland's followers had dispersed, the Jacobite officers had allowed their men to march ahead of them, confident that they, the officers on horseback, could quickly catch up with the marching men. However, there were still some Sutherland men in the hills above Dunrobin. Led by Ensign Mackay, the Sutherland men came down from the hills near Golspie, attacking into the gap between the rebel officers and their soldiers. Most of the Jacobite officers were captured; many of the men were killed, and the rest were driven onto the beach, where several were drowned trying to swim Loch Fleet. Most of Cromartie's men were either killed or taken prisoner and thus denied the Prince much needed reinforcements.
An account of the Battle of Littleferry was written by Angus Mackay in his book "The Book of Mackay":
A few days before Culloden, Cromartie got orders to rejoin the Prince at Inverness with all his forces, but as he was marching towards the Little Ferry, Ensign John Mackay with a handful of men intrepidly attacked him. Mackay's boldness encouraged others of the Sutherland militia, who were in the hills near at hand, to take part in the affray, with the result that Cromartie was defeated and all his troops were either killed or captured. Mackay pistol in hand forced his way into Dunrobin Castle, into which Cromartie fled, and notwithstanding the efforts of the Countess of Sutherland, who was suspected of favouring the rebels and especially Cromartie, made a prisoner of the earl whom he found hiding under a bed. 
Aftermath and significance.
Cromartie, who had been captured and detained at Dunrobin Castle was put on a vessel that carried him to London. Cromartie, along with Lord Kilmarnock, Lord Lovat, and Lord Balmerino were all impeached of high treason, tried, and condemned. Cromartie was later pardoned, but the others were executed.
Despite this victory, some in the government in London were still inclined to associate the Sutherlands with the Cromartie rebels that they had defeated. The Earl of Sutherland spent several years before his death in 1750 attempting to obtain compensation from the government for the damage done to his estates by the rebels.
Angus Mackay writes of the significance of the Battle of Littleferry in the "Book of Mackay" as being more than is generally realized by the fact that Cromartie's Jacobite force would have provided much needed help to the Jacobites at Culloden and was prevented from doing so.

Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 6895

Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 6895, an Itek Air Boeing 737-219 Advanced (registered as EX-009), was a charter flight operated on behalf of Iran Aseman Airlines which crashed on 24 August 2008 (at 20:30 local time) near Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan while en route to Imam Khomeini International Airport, Tehran, Iran. It crashed while returning to the airport of origin after experiencing technical difficulties.
Reports state that members of the crew reported "technical issues" with the plane shortly after take off. Within 10 minutes the crew reported a severe loss of cabin pressure. When they attempted to make an emergency landing, the aircraft crashed approximately from the airport runway and burst into flames. The United States Air Force sent ambulances and fire apparatus with firefighters and medical personnel from its base at the airport in response to a request for assistance. The victims included ten members of a Bishkek high school sports team (AKA Kyrgyzstan National U18 Basketball Team).
Casualties.
There were 90 people on board (83 passengers and 7 crew) of whom 68 died. At least 22 are reported to have survived, including 2 crew members. The victims included ten members of a Bishkek high school sports team (AKA Kyrgyzstan National U18 Basketball Team).
Investigation.
The Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) attempted to retrieve data from the flight-data and cockpit voice-recorders, which were badly damaged in the fire which destroyed most of the aircraft. While disassembling the casing, both the mechanisms of the tape recorder and the tape media in the voice recorder were found in damaged condition, but the MAK attempted to read the data from the damaged media.
The MAK has drawn final conclusions. The report claims that the forward left cabin door was not closed completely, and that the person who closed it was an engineer who was not listed among those (in the Cabin Attendant Manual) who were supposed to close the door. The report concludes that the aircraft originally lost cabin pressure due to this error, but that it was just a contributing factor to the crash. The plane could have landed with reduced pressure, but the pilot failed to maintain visual contact with the runway, failed to properly monitor altitude and ignored automated warnings about terrain proximity (TAWS).
It has been reported that both the captain and co-pilot have been sentenced to five years and five years and two months respectively in a penal colony for the crash.
Aircraft.
The crashed plane first flew on June 16, 1980 and was delivered on July 1 of the same year to Air New Zealand as ZK-NAS. In 1995, it changed hands to Copa Airlines, and in 2003 again changed hands to Phoenix Aviation. In 2005, Phoenix Aviation was rebranded as AVE.com, and in April 2006, it changed hands to Itek Air.
Itek Air, along with all air carriers certified by the authorities with responsibility for regulatory oversight of Kyrgyzstan, is included in a European Union list of banned airlines for safety concerns and is therefore not permitted to fly over the territory of the EU. In May 2008, EX-009 passed a full technical inspection.

Angiomyxoma

Angiomyxoma is a myxomatous tumor involving the blood vessels.
It can affect the vulva and other parts of the pelvis.
Aggressive angiomyxoma was originally described in 1983, but the term "angiomyxoma" dates back to at least 1952.
Although it is a benign tumour and does not 'invade' the neighbouring tissue, it has a tendency to recur after surgical excision so it is termed as aggressive. The recurrence can be as close as six months from initial resection. It will not be surprising to find cases coming to tertiary medical centers with history of having a labial mass (sometimes misdiagnosed as gartner's cyst) and have multiple surgical excisions from various doctors. There is no proven medical therapy and people have tried various sorts of chemotherapy like Tamoxifen, Leuprolide and even full blown chemotherapy.

Afatinib

Afatinib (INN; trade name Gilotrif, previously Tomtovok and Tovok) is a drug approved in much of the world (including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia) for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), developed by Boehringer Ingelheim. It acts as an angiokinase inhibitor.
Medical uses.
It has received regulatory approval for use as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, although there is emerging evidence to support its use in other cancers such as breast cancer. 
In October 2010 a Phase III trial in NSCLC patients called "Lux-Lung 5" began with this drug.
Fall 2010 interim results suggested the drug extended progression-free survival threefold compared to placebo, but did not extend overall survival. In May 2012, the Phase IIb/III trial "Lux-Lung 1" came to the same conclusion.
Phase II results for breast cancer that over-expresses the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2-positive breast cancer) were described as promising by the authors, with 19 of 41 patients achieving benefit from afatinib. Double-blind Phase III trials are under way to confirm or refute this finding. Her2-negative breast cancers showed limited or no response to the drug.
Adverse effects.
Adverse effects by frequency:<br>
Very common (>10% frequency):
Common (1-10% frequency):
Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency):
Mechanism of action.
Like lapatinib and neratinib, afatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that also irreversibly inhibits human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinases. Afatinib is not only active against EGFR mutations targeted by first generation TKIs like erlotinib or gefitinib, but also against those not sensitive to these standard therapies. Because of its additional activity against Her2, it is being investigated for breast cancer as well as other EGFR and Her2 driven cancers.

Albert VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Albert VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (died 9 January 1475) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen.
He was the youngest son of Albert IV, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, but the eldest child of his second wife Elisabeth, daughter of Gebhard XI, Count of Querfurt.
Life.
Still a minor when his father died in 1423, Albert was bypassed as heir to Anhalt-Köthen by his older half-brothers, Adolph I and Waldemar V. After Waldemar's death in 1436, Adolph became the sole ruler of Anhalt-Köthen. Albert had to wait until the succession of the Köthen line was in jeopardy (almost 37 years) before he could assert his right of inheritance.
By 1471, Adolph's three sons had all acted on their intention to become priests; in consequence, they could not produce further heirs. The only two other living agnates of the family were Albert and his infant son. Adolph made a contract with his cousin George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by which his oldest son Waldemar VI was made Adolph's co-ruler ("Mitherr") in half of the principality. But under the terms of the contract, Adolph's half-brother Albert VI would inherit his part of Köthen upon Adolph's death and become the new co-ruler with Waldemar.
Adolph died in 1473 and Albert finally became one of the rulers of the principality with the title of "Lord of Köthen," but his reign lasted only fifteen months. On his death, he was succeeded by his only son Philip, who co-ruled with his cousins, the sons of Adolph I.
Marriage and issue.
In Alsleben on 27 March 1454 Albert married with Elisabeth (d. Querfurt, 18 September 1482), daughter of Günther II, Count of Mansfeld. They had seven children:

Emma (Kenyon novel)

Emma is a 1955 novel by F. W. Kenyon published by Thomas Y. Crowell Company.
This novel recounts the historical relationship of Emma, Lady Hamilton and Admiral Horatio Nelson (Lord Nelson) in the late 18th century from Emma’s point of view. It covers the period of time from when she was 16 (~1777) to shortly after Admiral Nelson’s death (~44 years old in 1805). The novel starts out a little slowly but then picks up enough speed to be an enjoyable read. Unfortunately, with so little known about the real life people 200 years after the fact, one is left thinking the book is nothing but a complete fictional rendering surrounding a misty historical figure. While it is undoubted that the author took some normal literary liberties to flesh out the book, the characters and situation are true to recorded history.

David Bedell-Sivright

David Revell "Darkie" Bedell-Sivright (8 December 1880 – 5 September 1915) was a Scottish international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cambridge and Edinburgh Universities. Bedell-Sivright was one of the true characters of the sport of rugby and was chosen to lead a British Isles team on a tour of Australia. A surgeon by profession, he joined the Royal Navy during the First World War, and died on active service during the Gallipoli Campaign.
Personal history.
Bedell-Sivright was born in Edinburgh in 1880 to William Henry Revell Bedell-Sivright of North Queensferry. Bedell-Sivright was educated at Fettes College. before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1899 to read medicine. He later completed his medical training at the University of Edinburgh.
There are many tales surrounding Bedell-Sivright, and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. It is said that in 1909 he became Scottish amateur boxing champion, that after one international he rugby tackled a cart horse in Princes Street in Edinburgh and once lay down on the tram tracks in the city and held up the traffic for an hour as no policeman would approach him.
On 25 January 1915 Bedell-Sivright was commissioned as a surgeon in the Royal Navy. He was posted to the Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division stationed at Gallipoli during the Dardanelles Campaign in May 1915. He was loaned to the Royal Scots Fusiliers from 8 to 20 June, and was then posted to the Portsmouth Battalion of Royal Marine Light Infantry. After a period onshore in the trenches while serving at an advanced dressing station, he was bitten by an unidentified insect. He complained of being fatigued and was taken offshore and transferred to the hospital ship HMHS Dunluce Castle. Two days later, on 5 September, he died of septicaemia and was buried at sea off Cape Helles. He is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.
Rugby career.
Bedell-Sivright first came to note as a rugby player, when he represented Cambridge University in the Varsity matches between 1899 and 1902, winning four sporting Blues during the period. Bedell-Sivright was first capped for Scotland in 1900 in a match against Wales at St Helen's, Swansea. A turning point in Welsh rugby, the home team won 12-3, but the selectors stuck with Bedell-Sivright and he would win another 21 caps for his country scoring three tries.
Bedell-Sivright would later be chosen to tour with two different British Isles team. The first was the 1903 tour of South Africa under the captaincy of fellow Scottish international Mark Morrison. Although at the centre of the British Isles pack, Beddel-Sivright did not play in any of the test games. 1903 also saw Bedell-Sivright selected for his first match with invitational touring side the Barbarians. He played for a total of five games for the Barbarians between 1903 and 1907.
In 1904, surprisingly on the request of the England Rugby Board, Bedell-Sivright was selected to lead out a British Lions team on a tour of Australia. Although he only played in one test game, because of a broken leg, he was so impressed with the country he decided to settle there. After a year he became bored of 'jackarooing', decided to leave Australia and headed back to Scotland to study medicine. While studying at in Edinburgh, he joined the University Rugby team, captaining them for two season in 1906/07 and 1908/09.
He was the brother of John Bedell-Sivright who played for Cambridge University RFC, and gained a single international cap in 1902.
Bedell-Sivright was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2013 during an induction ceremony that honoured players from the British and Irish Lions (which maintain the history of the British Isles team) and Australia, following that year's Lions tour to Australia.

James Rankin (RAF officer)

James E. Rankin (7 May 1913 – 1975) was a British RAF flying ace of the Second World War. 
Rankin was born in Portobello, Edinburgh on 7 May 1913 although his family later moved to Lancashire. He joined the RAF in 1935 and following training at No 2 FTS, he joined No 25 Squadron and later flew with the Fleet Air Arm with No 825 Sqn on HMS Glorious. After service with the Fleet Air Arm he became an instructor with No. 5 OTU. 
Early in 1941 he was promoted to Squadron Leader and attached to No. 64 Squadron to gain operational experience. He claimed a third of a Junkers Ju 88 shot down and 2 damaged in his short spell with the Squadron. In February 1941 he then took command of No. 92 Squadron, then equipping with the new Mark V model of Spitfire. 
During the fighter sweeps of the summer, his score mounted rapidly. In June 1941 he was awarded the DFC for 9 victories. On 14 June he shot down and killed 18-kill ace "Obfw" Robert Menge of III./ JG 26. In September 1941 he became Wing leader at Biggin Hill and received the DSO in October.
In December 1941 Rankin was posted to HQ Fighter Command, and in April 1942 returned to lead the Biggin Hill Wing for a second time until December 1942. After a spell at the Central Gunnery School, in August 1943 he commanded No. 15 Fighter Wing, and then 125 Wing during the Normandy landings of June 1944.
Rankin scored 17 victories against enemy aircraft, as well as five shared kills, three probable and two shared probable kills, 16 damaged and three shared damaged and the destruction of a V-1 flying bomb. With the exception of one shared destroyed, one damaged and two shared damaged, the rest of his total score was achieved while flying the Spitfire Mark V.
In 1948 he was Air Attache, Dublin. and in 1954 was Officer Commanding, RAF Duxford.
He retired from the RAF in 1958.

Dani Kouyaté

Dani Kouyaté (born June 4, 1961) is a film director and griot from Burkina Faso, which "BBC" describes as "Africa's most important film-making country".
Biography.
Kouyaté was born in 1961 in Bobo-Dioulasso. He is the son of one of the first Burkinabé actors, Sotigui Kouyaté, and is a member of the Mandeng ethnic group. Kouyatés have served as griots for the Keita clan since the 13th century. The Kouyatés guard customs, and their knowledge is authoritative amongst Mandengs. Keitas have to provide amenities to Kouyatés, who in turn should not hesitate to ask for Keita help. The word Kouyaté translates as "there is a secret between you and me".
The junior Kouyaté trained at the Institute Africain d'Education Cinématographique in Burkina Faso's capital of Ouagadougou before travelling to France for five years of study at the Sorbonne where he obtained a Master's degree in Cultural and Social Marketing. He also received a degree from the International School of Anthropology in Paris, and an advanced degree in Cinema from the University of Paris at St. Denis. From 1990 to 1996 Kouyaté toured the United States and Europe as part of "La Voix du Griot" ("Voice of the Griot"), a storytelling theater show founded by his father. He began his film career in 1989 with the short film "Bilakoro", which was co-directed with Issa Traoré de Brahima.
In 1992 he was co-founder of the film production company Sahelis Productions with Sékou Traoré and Issa Traoré de Brahima.
He directed a number of other short films before the release of his first full-length feature, "Keïta! l'Héritage du griot" in 1995.
Sundjata Keita's 13th century epic, "Sundjata", was Kouyaté's inspiration for the film, which depicts a middle-class family in Ouagadougou. He shot it in Ouagadougou, Sindou, and Ouahabou. His father played the central role of Djeliba Kouyaté, who was imagined as an old dying man by Dani Kouyaté, though was portrayed as more forceful than that. "Keïta!" received the Best First Film Prize from the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (Fespaco) and was awarded the Junior Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. In a 1995 interview, he reflected on the experience and commenting on traditional society, saying:
In 1999 he created several episodes of the Burkinabé television series "A Nous La Vie" (roughly "Let's grab life"). The second feature film Kouyaté directed was "Sia, le rêve du python", released in 2001. It "operates simultaneously on three levels: as a visually compelling, exciting story set in a mythical past; as a political allegory, in which the events of the past are a continual commentary on Africa today; and as a rumination on the power and value of myth and legend." His father played the complex General Watigué, and the junior Kouyaté performed as a musician, strumming his guitar and playing several percussion instruments.
He also directed the award winning film "Ouaga-Saga" (2004), which premiered at Fespaco in 2005. It tells the story of 11 Burkinabés struggling to overcome poverty to realise their dreams. Kouyaté had five weeks to film this, though it took longer to complete.

Caroline Reboux

Reboux made an art form out of high fashion hats which were re-emerging in France to supplant the bonnet in the mid-19th century. She promoted the hat as an essential accessory for women's fashion. 
Like many of her customers, Reboux was self-invented: she put it about that she was the fourth child of an impoverished noblewoman and a man of letters, who was orphaned and came to Paris to live.
Queen of the milliners.
Reboux, the "Queen of the Milliners." made a name for herself in millinery in the later part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century in Europe and the United States. She employed as many as 150 workwomen at any one time. She is also closely associated with the origins of haute couture and her hat designs ranked at the same level as that custom fashion. 
Reboux opened a shop at 9, avenue Matignon, Paris, in 1865 where she worked throughout her life. Retaining this shop as her base, she opened other stores in Paris and London. She assisted others that she trained to open shops in New York and Chicago. She was known for over fifty years as the queen of creative fashion hats. Her designs were as much sought after as those of Charles Frederick Worth, considered the father of haute couture. 
Reboux was the first person in fashion design to add a veil to a woman’s hat and launched it in the 1920s. She also started the vogue of colored veils. Reboux made many fashionable hats for the theater. 
Reboux is the creator of the cloche hat and popularized it in the 1920s. She designed the unstructured felt hat which first appeared in the 1920s. Reboux would create the hat by placing a length of felt on a customer's head and then cutting and folding it to shape. She was always one of the leading exponents of the form. 
Reboux also did innovative unique models up-dating past modes such as the large-brimmed straws known as Gainsborough hats, and the turban-like toques in the manner of Mme Vigée-Lebrun's sitters. 
Reboux worked with most of the major fashion designers of Europe and provided women hats for their design collections. A notable business practice of Reboux was to divide half the profits of her business among the head cashier, the forewoman, the directress of the workroom, and the head manager. Reboux was appointed to represent Parisian commerce at the Paris World’s Fair of 1900. During Reboux's life she maintained a great friendship with the fashion designer Madeleine Vionnet. The Caroline Reboux business finally closed its doors in 1956. More than 300 creations by Reboux are preserved at the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris.
Famous clients.
Marlene Dietrich was a faithful customer of Reboux, from whom she bought her trademark berets, which had never been worn by women before. The exhibition of Marlene Dietrich "Birth of a Myth" was held at the fashion museum Musée Galliera (Paris) in 2003 exhibing fashions of Reboux. There are today headdresses signed "Caroline Reboux" in the vitrines devoted to Marlene Dietrich at the Deutsche Kinemathek film museum of Berlin. Many famous designers of fashion of the 20th century were trained by Reboux. 
Reboux creations from the 1860s attracted the attention of Princess Pauline von Metternich and the Empress Eugénie. The famous American milliner Lilly Dache trained under Reboux for five years. Elsa Triolet was also a regular store customer on Avenue Matignon, sometimes accompanied by Louis Aragon.
After death.
Wallis Warfield Simpson, Duchess of Windsor, wore a blue Mainbocher outfit
and a halo hat by Reboux for her wedding to the former King of England, Edward VIII at the Château Candé, Monts, June 3, 1937. 
Reboux's business continued leadership under Mme. Lucienne after her death in 1927. The shop was well known for making the head-fitting felt cloche the status symbol of fashion for many years. The shop was famous for making hats that were noted for profile brims, dipping low on one side, forward-tilt tricorns, open-crown lamé turbans, and flower bandeaus.
Reboux in fiction.
The name 'Reboux' is mentioned in "Thérèse Desqueyroux", a novel written by François Mauriac and published in 1927: « Anna de la Trave was wearing an overcoat of light grey cloth and a felt hat without ribbon or trimming of any sort ('though,' said Madame de la Trave, 'it costs more like that than the hats we used to have with all those feathers and aigrettes. But, of course, it's the very finest quality felt from Lailhala's — a Reboux model.') »

Berwick and East Lothian by-election, 1978

The Berwick and East Lothian by-election, 1978 was a by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of Berwick and East Lothian in Scotland on 26 October 1978. It was one of two UK parliamentary by-elections held on that day, and was won by the Labour Party candidate John Home Robertson.
Vacancy.
The seat had become vacant when the Labour Member of Parliament (MP), John Mackintosh had died at the age of 48 on 30 July 1978. He had held the seat since the October 1974 general election, having previously been MP for the seat between 1964 and the February 1974 election.
Candidates.
The Labour candidate was 29-year-old John Home Robertson, a farmer who had been a member of Berwickshire District Council since 1974. The Conservative Party candidate was Margaret Marshall. The Scottish National Party fielded Isobel Lindsay, this caused some tensions within the SNP as the national leadership chose her as the candidate, as they were entitled to do, but they did not choose the person the local SNP organisation had selected to fight the next general election. The Liberals selected Tam Glen.
Result.
The result was a victory for Home Robertson, with an increased majority of 3,112 votes. This was well against the general trend of by-elections in the 1974 Parliament, which had been against Labour. It also saw a decline in the SNP vote, continuing a trend at a few other elections earlier in the year.
Home Robertson held the seat until its abolition for the 1983 general election, when he was returned for the new East Lothian constituency. He went on to represent the Scottish Parliament constituency of East Lothian.

Líbero Parri

Líbero Parri Romero (born 18 January 1982) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.
Over the course of a career spanning 12 years he appeared in a total of 211 games in Segunda División and scored 34 goals, representing seven clubs mainly Albacete (four seasons in the category, five in total). 
In La Liga he played 57 matches, with Albacete, Valencia and Racing de Santander.
Football career.
Parri was born in Burjassot, Valencian Community. A gifted attacking player who emerged from Valencia CF's youth system, he never established himself with the local side's first team. During the 2000–01 season he made his first two – and only – La Liga appearances, against CA Osasuna and Racing de Santander, and finished the campaign with neighbouring side Elche CF.
After another second division loan Parri was acquired by Albacete Balompié, where he would play four years, including 2003–04's top division, also being loaned in 2004–05 to Racing Santander also in the main category. From 2007 to 2009 another two seasons in the second level ensued, at Cádiz CF and Levante UD, the latter also in his native region (loaned by Cádiz).
In August 2009 Parri broke ties with Cádiz, but stayed in the second division, quickly penning a one-year contract with Gimnàstic de Tarragona. In late June 2010, he was released after one unassuming season – 14 games out of 42, 271 minutes of play.

Pre-Illinoian

The Pre-Illinoian Stage is used by Quaternary geologists for the early and middle Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods of geologic time in North America from ~2.5–0.5 Ma (million years ago), a period of ~.
North America.
As the oldest stage in the North American regional subdivision of the Quaternary, the Pre-Illinoian precedes the Illinoian Stage. Researchers have identified 11 distinct glacial stages during the Pre-Illinoian Stage. 
The Pleistocene prior to the Illinoian stage had previously been subdivided into the Nebraskian, Aftonian, Kansan, and Yarmouthian stages (ages). However, detailed studies of these stages revealed that the assumptions and criteria on which they were defined proved to be wrong to such a point that these stages became meaningless in terms of the actual glacial–interglacial record. 
For example, instead of two glaciations having occurred prior to the Illinoian Stage, researchers found that 11 distinct glaciations had occurred. In addition, what was presumed to have been a single volcanic ash bed, which was used to correlate and differentiate between Kansan and Nebraskan glacial deposits, was found to be three volcanic ash beds of greatly differing ages. Similarly, paleosols used in the definition of the stages were found to have been greatly miscorrelated, as they consisted of paleosols of greatly differing ages. Because of these and other major problems, the concepts on which the Nebraskian, Aftonian, Kansan, and Yarmouthian (Yarmouth) stages are defined were discredited. North American geologists discarded these stages as unusable and merged them into the Pre-Illinoian Stage.
Great Britain.
The Pre-Illinoian stage is contemporary with the Bramertonian, Pre-Pastonian, Pastonian, Beestonian, Cromerian, Anglian, Hoxnian, and lowermost Wolstonian stages of the British Isles combined. The end of the Pre-Illinoian stage has been correlated to the end of Marine Isotope Stage 9 at 300,000 BP. More recent geologic mapping, coring, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of Illinoian glacial tills (Glasford Formation) and outwash (Pearl Formation) of the Illinoian Glacial Lobe in North-central Illinois demonstrates that the start of the Illinoian stage and end of the Pre-Illinoian stage correlates with the beginning of Marine Isotope Stage 6 at 191,000 BP.

Indian Deep Space Network

The Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities that supports the interplanetary spacecraft missions of India. It is located at Byalalu, a village about from Bangalore, India. It was inaugurated on 17 October 2008 by the former ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair. The antenna was designed and commissioned by Hyderabad-based Electronics Corporation of India Limited at a cost of Rs 62 crore to Rs 65 crore (about 13 million US dollars).
Other similar networks include ESTRACK of the European Space Agency, the Deep Space Network of the United States NASA, the Soviet Deep Space Network, and the Chinese Deep Space Network.
Introduction.
The network consists of a fully steerable and a DSN antenna which improves the visibility duration when compared with the existing ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC). The Indian Deep Space Network implements a baseband system adhering to Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Standards thus facilitating cross-support among the Telemetry Tracking Command (TTC) agencies.
The two antennas at the complex have built-in support facilities. A fibre optic link will provide necessary communication link between the DSN Station and SCC / NCC/ ISSDC. The 18 m antenna has provision to receive two downlink carriers in S-Band and two carriers in X-Band (RCP and LCP), whereas the uplink is either RCP or LCP. It has a G/T of 30/39.5 dB/k (45° elevation, clear sky) for S/X-Band.
The 32 m antenna is of a wheel-and-track design. The antenna is designed to provide uplink in both S-Band and X-Band (20 kW) either through RCP or LCP. The reception capability will be in both S-Band and X-Band (simultaneous RCP and LCP). It can receive two carriers in S-Band and two carriers in X-Band. The system will have a G/T of 37.5/51 dB/k (45° elevation, clear sky) for S/X Band. The station may be controlled remotely from the ISTRAC Network Control Centre (NCC).
The IDSN facility in Byalalu also houses the ISRO Navigation Centre (INC). It was launched on 28 May 2013 by V. Narayanasamy. The centre will become active on 12 June 2013, at the time of launch of IRNSS-1, the first of the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System series of satellites. The INC has a high stability atomic clock. It will be used to co-ordinate across 21 ground stations in India.
Antennas.
32 m antenna.
The first antenna is a 32-meter Deep Space Antenna. The wheel and track 32 m antenna is a state-of-the-art system that supported the Chandrayaan-1 mission operations. It is currently supporting Mars Orbiter Mission This is co-located with 18 m antenna in the IDSN site at Byalalu. A fibre optics / satellite link will provide the necessary connectivity between the IDSN site and Spacecraft Control Centre / Network Control Centre. This antenna is designed to provide uplink in both S-Band (20/2 kW) and X-Band (2.5 kW), either through RCP or LCP. The reception capability will be in both S-Band and X-Band (simultaneous RCP & LCP). It can receive two carriers in S-Band and one carrier in X-Band, simultaneously. The system will have a G/T of 37.5/51 dB/K (45° elevation, clear sky) for S/X-Band. The base-band will adhere to CCSDS Standards facilitating cross-support among the space agencies. The station is also equipped for remote control from the ISTRAC Network Control Centre (NCC).
18 m antenna.
The second antenna is an 18-meter Deep Space Antenna. A fibre optic / satellite link will provide the necessary communication link between the IDSN Station and Mission Operations Complex (MOX) / Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC). This antenna is capable of S-Band uplink (2 kW) and both X-Band and S-Band downlink. This system has provision to receive two downlink carriers in S-Band and one carrier in X-Band (RCP and LCP) simultaneously, whereas, the uplink is either RCP or LCP. The system will have a G/T of 30/39.5 dB/K (45° elevation, clear sky) for S/X-Band. The base-band system will adhere to the CCSDS Standards. The station can be remotely operated from ISTRAC Network Control Centre (NCC).
11 m antenna.
The third antenna is an 11-meter terminal antenna which was built for the ASTROSAT Mission. It started tracking satellites in July, 2009.
Chandrayaan-1.
The Indian Deep Space Network has been built to track and support India's first lunar mission Chandrayaan-1, an unmanned lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), India's national space agency. It was launched on 22 October 2008. The IDSN was used for tracking, orbit control and housekeeping operations of India's lunar mission for its entire duration of operation (Planned was 2 years though achieved only 312 days). IDSN began to track Chandrayaan 17 minutes after its launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Launch Centre at Sriharikota, when the satellite separated from the launch vehicle.
Mars Orbiter Mission.
IDSN is being used to track the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) also known as Mangalyaan. The launch window available is for about 20 days starting 28 October 2013.

Bolzano Transit Camp

The Bolzano transit camp () was a Nazi concentration camp active in Bolzano between 1944 and the end of the Second World War. It was one of the largest Nazi "Lager" on Italian soil, along with those of Fossoli, Borgo San Dalmazzo and Trieste.
History.
After the Allies signed the Armistice with Italy on September 8, 1943, Bolzano became the headquarters of the Prealpine Operations Zone and came under the control of the Nazi army. When the internment camp in Fossoli became vulnerable to Allied attack, it was dismantled, and a transit camp for prisoners headed for Mauthausen, Flossenbürg, Dachau, Ravensbrück and Auschwitz was set up in Bolzano.
Operational from the summer of 1944 and located in buildings previously occupied by the Italian Army, the transit camp hosted about 11,000 prisoners from middle and northern Italy in its ten months of activity. Although the camp's population consisted mostly of political opponents, Jewish and gypsy deportees also passed through its barracks.
A portion of the prisoners—approximately 3,500 peohe "Lagers", while the rest were assigned to work "in loco" as free labour, either in the camp workshops and labs, in local firms, or in the apple orchards.
The interned prisoners were freed between April 29 and May 3, 1945, when the camp was closed to prevent the advancing Allied troops from witnessing its living conditions and (presumably) to eliminate evidence. The SS troops destroyed all documentation relating to camp activities before withdrawing, following the standing order that no trace be left behind.
The camp.
The camp was originally set to host 1,500 people. For this purpose, two sheds were divided into six blocks, one of which was reserved for women. The camp was then progressively enlarged until it reached a stated capacity of 4,000 prisoners.
As was customary in Nazi internment camps, each block was assigned a letter and a specific "type" of prisoner. In block A lived permanent residents, who were treated somewhat better than the others because of their involvement in essential camp activities (especially administration); in blocks D and E were kept political prisoners, regarded by the Nazis as the greatest danger and therefore kept segregated from other prisoners; block F was reserved for women and the occasional child.
Jewish male deportees, whose transit was often short-lived, were crammed in block L. There also was a prison block hosting approximately 50 inmates.
The camp was directed by the Verona SS, whose chief was the "Brigadeführer" (brigade general) of Gestapo Wilhelm Harster; the camp's executive directors were Lieutenant Titho and Marshal Haage, who headed a garrison of German, Swiss and Ukrainian soldiers.
Sub-camps.
Bolzano camp was the only one, in Italy, to have attached forced-labour camps. Of these, the most important ones were in Meran, Schnals, Sarntal, Moos in Passeier and Sterzing.
Resistance.
As in most camps where political prisoners abounded, a resistance movement arose, organized along three axes:
Trials.
In November 2000, the military court of Verona sentenced Michael Seifert, a Ukrainian SS known in the camp as "Misha", to life in prison for the atrocities he committed against deportees, particularly those held in the jail block.
The relative recency of this trial is due to the fact that the case had remained hidden for decades and resurfaced with the discovery of the so-called "armadio della vergogna" (lit., "the wardrobe of shame") in 1994. Among the prisoners that Seifert and his accomplice Otto Sein tortured was a young Mike Bongiorno, an American POW who would go on to become one of Italy's most beloved TV figures after war.
Seifert, who had emigrated to Canada after the war, had to face 18 counts of murder and 15 additional counts of misconduct. He was tracked down in Vancouver, only days before the trial was to begin, by a reporter working for the "Vancouver Sun", who acted upon information provided by the "Associazione nazionale ex deportati politici nei campi nazisti (ANED)" (National Association of former political deportees to Nazi internment camps).
His story was reconstructed by the Italian historians Giorgio Mezzalira and Carlo Romeo in the book entitled "Mischa, jailer of the Bolzano lager".
A separate trial of the camp directors, Titho and Haage, had taken place in 1999, with a different outcome: Titho was absolved for lack of evidence, while Haage was sentenced posthumously .

Cricket at the Asian Games

The team sport of Cricket became a medal sport at the 2010 Asian Games. The last time cricket featured in a major multi-sport event was at the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The gold medal was won on that occasion by South Africa, who defeated Australia by 4 wickets in the final with New Zealand winning the bronze medal. At a general meeting of the Olympic Council of Asia, held in Kuwait on 17 April 2007, it was announced that cricket would be included as a medal sport in the 2010 Asian Games to be held in Guangzhou. Matches would be played on a Twenty20, 20-overs per side format.
Following the announcement, Asian Cricket Council Chief Executive Syed Ashraful Huq said "Cricket will receive a major boost across Asia and in particular China, as a result of this enlightened decision. The Asian Cricket Council pledges its support to the Guangzhou games organizers in order to make the event a success."
Asian cricketing powerhouses India and Pakistan have been the drivers behind the inclusuion of cricket in the Asian Games. The Test status nations in the Asian Cricket Council, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka would compete with the initial plan that the Associate teams such as Hong Kong would also be invited to play in the inaugural competition. China will compete as the host nation which serves as a boost for the Chinese Cricket Association which has boldly stated its ambition of China becoming a force in one-day cricket by the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
The plans for including Associate/Affiliate nations in the Asian Games was later changed, along with the format that the competition would take place in, changing from 50 over matches to Twenty20 matches. It was decided that the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup would serve as the pre-tournament qualifying competition. Afghanistan qualified as winners of the tournament along with the national teams of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

<doc id="19012961" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19012961" title="Soldat Louis">
Soldat Louis

Soldat Louis are a French rock group originally from Lorient, who mix the traditional music of Brittany with typical rock music instruments - electric and acoustic guitar, drum kit, etc. - as well as the traditional bagpipes ("biniou braz" in Breton) and bombard. The two founding members, who are still playing in the group today, are Renaud Detressan (alias Gary Wicknam) and Serge Danet (alias Soldat Louis, “Private Louis”).
History.
Soldat Louis's first album, "Première bordée" appeared in 1988. The band played as support to the solo singer-songwriter Renaud, in his series of concerts at the Zénith in Paris the following year. The first single from that album, “Du rhum des femmes”, projected them to national exposure, with the single selling 750,000 copies, and the album went double gold. During the "golden age" of the French Top 50, "chansons de comptoir" (bar songs) were à la mode (""Allez viens boire un p'tit coup à la maison"" etc.) and Soldat Louis found themselves associated with this musical style. 
Their second album was released two years after their first: ""Pavillon Noir"", however, did not achieve the same success, and nor did any of the albums that followed. Despite disappearing from the mainstream media, Soldat Louis continued, having changed their line-up (except for the two founding members), to tour concert halls around France, also releasing several more original albums, best-ofs and live albums.
Song themes.
Although the chanson “Du Rhum des femmes” saw the group labelled by the French public as composers of "chansons à boire" (drinking songs), the rest of their repertoire, which achieved less success, consists of more delicate songs (“Pavillon noir”), nostalgic (“Encore un rhum”), humorous (“Martiniquaise”), or even weary (""T'es mon secret""). Other lyrics equally reveal the group to be politically engaged, such as the pamphlet-like “C'est un pays”, celebrating the Breton identity, as well as “Bobby Sands”, about the Provisional Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands, who died in prison on Hunger Strike.

Sala Silver Mine

Sala Silver Mine () is a mine in Sala Municipality, in Västmanland County in Sweden. The mine was in continuous production from the 15th century until 1908. Additional mining occurred in 1950-1951 and also in 1945-1962 in Bronäs Mine, located nearby.
Geology.
The Sala ore is mainly known for its high silver content though the ore also contained economic amounts of lead and zinc. The zinc was hosted by the mineral sphalerite while lead was hosted by the mineral galena. Silver occurred as a native phase rarely but was mainly hosted by complex antimonides and sulphosalts, dispersed in the matrices of galena and sphalerite, invisible to the naked eye but visible in microscope. The silver content in typical galena-dominated Sala ore was about 0.15% to 1%, the latter being one of the highest contents of silver in galena ever reported. In the sphalerite-dominated ore, the silver content is only about 0.015-0.02%, which was still enough to exploit and would even be at present days, given that a sufficient tonnage of metallurgically advantageous ore could be found.
The bedrock was created about 1,89 billion years ago during the paleoproterozoic era. The host rock to the mined ore is dominated by white dolomitic marble, proximal to the ores commonly rich in skarn minerals such as tremolite, serpentine, diopside and chlorite, giving the dolomitic marble at Sala a characteristic green colour. ~ 100 meters away from the mine, more pure white dolomitic marble poor in skarn minerals is extracted at the Tistbrottet dolomite quarry.
History.
The mine has had three major heyday, the main one in early 16th century, a second less significant one in the mid-17th century and a last one in the late 19th century. The last period involved re-organisation of the mine organisation (a transition from state-owned to company-owned) as well as the introduction of several new technological innovations, e.g. leaching methods employed on older mine tailings. These innovations produced temporal production peaks, yet a general lack of high-grade ore made continued production uneconomic which finally led to closure. At most, 3-5 million tons of rock were mined from which ~ 450 tons of silver and about 35,000 tons of lead were extracted. The maximum depth of the mine is 318.6 metres and the length of the mine is ~ 700 metres, the width is ~ 100 metres.
The town of Sala emerged as a miners settlement near the mine, first in the form of a small mining village in the early days, then moved to its present location on order from the king. The king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden gave the town its privileges in 1624. Around Sala there are numerous lakes and dams with canals, constructed to supply the mine with hydro-power for driving machines for water pumping, ore hoisting and ore smelting. None of these machines are preserved to present days.
Earlier, granite ('Sala granite') was extracted to be used as bricks for construction material northeast of the mine. Several foundations for the buildings in the mine area are built from Sala granite.
The mine was owned during later years by AB Svenska Metallverken in Västerås and Avesta Jernverks AB that until 1962 extracted lead and zinc and very little silver. The extraction was made in a mine not physically connected to the old mine. Since 1988 is the mine owned by the municipality of Sala and serves as a mine museum.
Today.
Today the mine functions mostly as an attraction, where guided tours down in the mine are arranged. In the big empty rooms in the mine, concerts and other entertainment are arranged. One of these rooms can be availed of as a bedroom, allowing for a unique overnight stay. New test-drillings have been made lately, because it is believed that a second silver treasury exists around the old one. During the 18th century people searched for the second treasury, but its depth made it hard to find. Around the old mine, cracks and erosions have caused danger for people visiting restricted areas.
Above ground, the old buildings are still used, but today they are mostly souvenir shops and museums, like an art gallery and a police museum. In July every year, the "Mine's days" are arranged and in December there are Christmas markets every weekend until Christmas.
In March 2008, the mine was visited by the Swedish crown princess Victoria, who left her signature down in the mine as her father, Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, had done previously.
In August 2013 a Canadian exploration company applied for a mining lease covering a second zinc-lead-silver ore approximately 100 meters west of the historic mine.

Rob Adam

Dr Robert Martin Adam is Group Executive: Nuclear at the Aveng Group.
Early life.
His father, James Adam, was a metallurgist and Rob grew up in mining towns. He finished school at Bishops, a private school in Cape Town.
Studies.
He obtained a BSc (Hons) degree with distinction in chemistry and the Gordon Percy Memorial Prize for the top honours student from the University of Cape Town in 1978. In 1980, after two years working in carbon fibre technology in England, he returned to South Africa and was employed by the South African Council for Higher Education. His task was to develop distance learning courses in physical science and mathematics in English for people whose first language was not English.
In 1981, he was imprisoned for 10 years for activities on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC). While serving his sentence, he obtained BSc (Hons) and MSc degrees in theoretical physics, both with distinction, through the University of South Africa (UNISA). He received the UNISA national scholarship awarded to the top masters student at that university, to do a PhD in theoretical nuclear physics. He was released from prison in 1990 and shortly thereafter received his PhD degree from UNISA. After a short period of working with Professor Harry Fiedeldy, his PhD supervisor, he was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship by the Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam). He returned in 1993 to take up a post in the Department of Physics at the University of Natal.
Anti-Apartheid work.
In 1979, while in London after his initial studies, Rob Adam became a member of the African National Congress (ANC), then banned by the Apartheid regime. After joining the ANC he returned to the country: "What the ANC did for me was give me a way to go home again, in a way that I found acceptable."
On 22 September 1981 he and Mandla Elliot Themba of Soweto, a fellow ANC member, was arrested because of their ANC membership and involvement in underground work for the organisation. During the trial they were represented by the legendary human rights advocate, George Bizos, who also represented Nelson Mandela and many other political activists. Adam's father testified in mitigation of sentence that Adam had become aware of the evils of the compound system while the family lived on a mine in Namibia, and that "his strong sense of concern and compassion led him to his ANC commitment." On 1 June 1982 Adam was sentenced to an effective 10 years imprisonment, and Themba to five years.
The "Mail & Guardian" summarises his experience in prison as follows:
While in Pretoria Central Prison he studied further and later obtained his doctors degree in theoretical nuclear physics.
He was released on 9 February 1990, together with many other political prisoners as part of the steps towards a democratic South Africa.
Career in government.
In 1995 he was appointed as a chief director in the Department of Art, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST). In 1996 he was promoted to the post of Deputy Director-General for science and technology.
In 1999 he became the Director General of DACST, under Minister Ben Ngubane. In 2002 this department was split into two, the Department of Art and Culture and the Department of Science and Technology (DST). He continued as the Director General of DST, in the latter period under Minister Mosibudi Mangena. He held this position until 2006, when he took up the position of the CEO of the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa.
While in government he had been responsible for driving activities such as the drafting of the Green and White Papers on science and technology; the "Position Paper on the Information Society"; and various statutes including the National Research Foundation Act, the National Advisory Council on Innovation Act, the Legal Deposit and the National Libraries Act and several international technical co-operation frameworks. He managed the "Research and Technology Audit"; "Research and Technology Foresight" project; reviews of 12 science, engineering and technology institutions; the restructuring of museums and cultural institutions; the distribution of budgets to science councils; an investigation into South Africa's science journals; and science and technology agreements with more than 22 countries.
He worked towards South Africa being awarded the contract to build and run the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) Telescope. South Africa was recently awarded the lion's share of this project in competition with Australia. SKA is a radio telescope and must be based in an area where there is very little man made radio interference. The site chosen in South Africa is in the Karoo, north-west of Carnarvon.
NECSA.
Dr Adam was appointed CEO of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA) in 2006. It has its premises at Pelindaba outside Pretoria and is established by legislation to be South Africa's main research and development organisation in the field of nuclear technology, as well as carrying out other functions on nuclear issues on behalf of the South African government. It operates the Safari Research Reactor.
Family and personal life.
He was married to Liz Gavin and has two children.
He is a grand nephew of Sir James Rose-Innes, the second Chief Justice of the Union of South Africa.

Swimming at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships

The swimming events of the 2001 World Aquatics Championships were held in a temporary pool at Marine Messe in Fukuoka, Japan in July 2001. This edition of the championships featured 20 events for both men and women, including the introduction of a 50 m event in all strokes and equality in the distance freestyle events, with both men and women swimming both 800 and 1500 m.
The swimming event resulted in eight world records and Australia topping the medal tally with 13 golds, although the USA claimed 26 total medals to 19 for Australia. The men's FINA Trophy (top individual performers) was awarded to Australia's Ian Thorpe for his three individual wins and three world records. Inge de Bruijn (The Netherlands) won the women's FINA Trophy for three individual wins. Australia swept the men's relays and won two of three of the women's relays, although were subsequently disqualified in the women's 4×200 m freestyle for a post-race infraction – jumping into the pool before all teams had finished.
The Seiko timing system used for the swimming events at the championships experienced some faults with the touch pads throughout the eight days of competition causing controversy amongst teams and media.

Stefan Böhm (other last name versions: Beym, Bem) (December 25, 1741 – February 26, 1813) was a Warsaw executioner.
After leaving medical studies on University of Königsberg he became an official in Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł lands. Then he joined the Bar Confederation and was seriously injured in the head during a battle with Russian forces in Tyniec. He was saved and fled to Lidzbark Warmiński, where he lived with the local executioner, named Mueller, who taught him this profession.
In 1793, after working as a supervisor over one of the bridges over the Bug River, Böhm was pressured by President of Warsaw Ignacy Wyssogota Zakrzewski to take a job as the Warsaw executioner, which post vacated after Jan Mueller, brother of Libdbark executioner.
Böhm was very popular among the Warsaw citizens. There was even a saying: "you'll go to Stefanek for a dinner", which means of course being executed by him.
Böhm carried out most of executions on Targowica Confederation leaders during Kościuszko Uprising.

Deforestation in Colombia

Colombia loses 2,000 km2 of forest annually to deforestation, according to the United Nations in 2003, although some suggest that this figure is as high as 3,000 km² due to illegal logging in the region.
Deforestation results mainly from logging for timber, small-scale agricultural ranching, mining, development of energy resources such as hydro-electricity, infrastructure, cocaine production, and farming. Around one-third of the country's original forest has been removed as a result of deforestation.
Deforestation in Colombia is mainly targeted at primary rainforest which covers more than 80% of the country. This has a profound ecological impact in that the country is extremely rich in biodiversity with 10% of the world's species, making it the second most biologically diverse country on Earth.
Causes and effects.
One of the main causes of deforestation in Colombia is the national Plan Pacifico which is intended to raise revenue to develop the economy. The plan includes exploitation of the country's rainforests for the extraction of precious natural resources for exportation.
Under the regime of President Virgilio Barco Vargas (1986-1990), a development scheme was initiated involving $4.5 billion in investments to develop the Colombian Pacific Coast in Choco Department. Around 2.2% of the total forest area in Colombia began to be removed each year for wood and to make paper or to provide the clearings needed for palm plantations and agricultural production and commercial shrimp farming. In a concerted effort to enhance trade, Plan Pacifico has attempted to complete the 54 kilometer missing section of the Pan-American Highway between Colombia and Panama spanning the ecologically rich Darien Gap. The construction of the Puente Terrestre Inter-Oceanico (PTI), the land bridge between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans near Panama, consisting of a railway, road, canal, and oil pipeline has had a major impact on the environment and forest removal in the region. Other plans for road construction throughout Chocó which intended to catapult economic production in Colombia have had unintended negative consequences.
The economic potential of the region has resulted in international competition for access to the Colombian market with transnational corporations taking an active role in Colombia's deforestation through petroleum and mineral extraction in coordination with the national plan. 
The Japanese government has directly financed the construction of a road which links the Pacific coast to inland forest regions to facilitate trade.
Deforestation has been responsible for the erosion of riverbanks which have affected the levels of river beds, which has had negative impacts on aquatic life and fish stocks as well as on transportation and navigation because of silting. This forest clearing also accounts for great habitat destruction for creatures dwelling in the Columbian forests. For example, the cotton-top tamarin is considered to be critically endangered, and ranks highly on the list of "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates." Habitat destruction through forest clearing is the main cause of this collapse, and cotton-top tamarins have lost more than three-quarters of their original habitat to deforestation. Local initiatives, like Proyecto Tití for cotton-top tamarins, have been created to raise awareness of such cases.
The current administration is expanding palm oil and sugar cane production by encouraging large scale plantations, and demand for agrofuels has also had a significant impact on Colombia's forests, biodiversity, and local communities. Exploitation of communities through palm oil expansion has often resulted in violence and abuse of human rights. NGOs working in Colombia have recorded 113 deaths as a result of land-based conflicts over palm oil production in Curvaradó and Jiguamiandó River Basin in the Chocó region, where paramilitaries associated with plantation companies have been accused of exploiting lands collectively held by Afro-Colombian communities. The coastal lowland forests of Chocó province that are most affected by palm oil production are amongst the most biodiverse forests on Earth, home to 7,000 to 8,000 species, with over 2,000 endemic plant species and 100 endemic bird species. 
The biologically rich forests of Colombia's Pacific Coast have also been affected by gold mining and cocoa production. One figure obtained in the mid-1990s estimated that gold mining activities were responsible for the clearance of 800 square kilometres of forest per year in Colombia, in addition to increased siltation in rivers and mercury contamination.
The cultivation, production, and distribution of illegal narcotics in Colombia has also had a profound impact on deforestation and loss of biodiversity in the country. An estimated are allocated each year to grow coca, marijuana, and opium poppies resulting in the direct removal of primary forest to provide for the trade. Particularly affected are the forests of the Colombian Andes where at least 73% of this precious ecosystem has been affected by drug cultivation and migration of people for illegal resource extraction. The area is of prime importance for Colombia's water supply, and a disruption of soils and the water table arising from the removal of forest cover is of major concern to the climatic patterns of the country.
Poverty and inequality in land tenure and use also play a role in deforestation in Colombia. Privileged landowners who make up just 3% of Colombia's population own over 70% of arable land, while 57% of the poor farmers barely survive on just 2.8% of the land. Inequality and poverty in Colombia are worsened by the fact that the country is striving to develop its market economy with cash crops for export to generate income, increasing the marginalizion of farmers at a local level.
Response.
Colombia has made great strides in protecting vast areas of land from deforestation through the creation of national parks; however, enforcement is by no means completely effective. The sale of protected land though government corruption is not uncommon. One notorious example is the attempted government conversion of the Tayrona forest on Colombia's Atlantic Coast into a national park in 1980. When the Tayrona National Natural Park was established, 90% of the land was under government control, but by 1990, 80% of the park had been expropriated through illegal logging and selling of land illegally by corrupt administrators.

Evan Mackie

Wing Commander Evan "Rosie" Mackie, DSO, DFC & Bar, was a New Zealand fighter pilot and ace of the Second World War.
Many New Zealand pilots who served overseas enlisted in the RAF; Mackie chose to join the RNZAF and as such he was the highest scoring member of that service.
Born in October 1917, 'Rosie', (so named when in the RAF because of his ruddy complexion) trained as an electrician before the war. Mackie joined the RNZAF in January 1941, and on completion of flying training was posted to the No 485 (NZ) Squadron in the UK in early 1942. On 26 March he shared in destroying a Bf 109, and a month later probably destroyed a FW 190. His Spitfire was hit by flak in the port wing but he returned to base safely.
In March 1943 he was posted to North Africa, to No. 243 Squadron, flying the Spitfire Mk V. He was shot down over Pont du Fahs area on 24 April, but returned on foot to Allied lines the next day. He was awarded the DFC in May, and achieved success in combat through April- October 1943. On 7 April the squadron intercepted fifteen Ju 87's with Bf 109 escort. The Spitfires shot down five, Mackie claiming two. Three days later he claimed a Bf 109 and in the next month claimed another two destroyed and share in a third. He was subsequently awarded the DFC.
In June 1943 the squadron moved to Malta to participate in the invasion of Sicily. Mackie was promoted to Acting Squadron Leader and given command of the unit. A Bf 109 was claimed on 4 July (of II./JG 77) and another Bf 109 of I./JG 53 on 5 July, while 2 Italian-flown Junkers Ju 87 of 121 "Gruppo" and a Reggiane Re 2002 of 5 "Stormo" were shot down on 13 July. In November he was posted to command No. 92 Squadron, returning, tour-expired, to the UK in February 1944.
He then joined 274 Squadron flying the Hawker Tempest in December 1944 at Volkel in Holland. On 24 December 1944, he shot down an FW 190 over the Malmedy area (the Fw 190 A-9 "White 6" of 28-kill ace "Hpt". Wolfgang Kosse, 13./JG 3, who was killed).
His combat report read;
""I was flying No. 2 to Talbot Leader in Red Section on a patrol Julich-Malmedy and while we were returning to base and approaching Eindhoven, I noticed approx. 8 Typhoons flying in the opposite direction at about . They were in open formation. When almost abreast of these A/C at about I noticed one of the Typhoons suddenly break formation and dive into the ground on fire and I did not see anybody bale out. I then noticed the machine which had been flying behind that one, had moved behind another Typhoon, which then began shedding large pieces and losing height. Although we were not close enough to these aircraft to identify one of them as an enemy, I realised that this particular one must have been, so I immediately jettisoned my long-range tanks and gave chase.
"There was no R/T communication between myself and the other members of the section, as I had not heard the order to change to channel 'A'. The E/A lost some height then pulled vertically upwards. I identified it as a short nosed FW190 and opened fire with four cannons at a range of about closing to . I then broke off the attack as I was then rolling over on to my back. I gave about a 2 1/2 sec. burst and numerous strikes were seen on the wings and centre section of the FW190 by myself and F/L Malloy who was flying Red 3. After I broke away, S/L Baird stated that the FW190 levelled out, going very slowly, dropped a wing and then spun into the ground approx. SE of Eindhoven, where it blew up."" "
In early January 1945 Mackie was given command of 80 Squadron at Volkel. He destroyed a Bf 109 on 23 January 1945, and shot down a FW 190 near Hanover on 7 March. He then became No. 122 Wing Leader in April 1945. He then destroyed two Arado AR 96 trainers on 9 April and shared in the destruction of a FW 190 six days later. On 4 May 1945 Mackie led 486 Squadron over the Kiel-Haderslev area, and they claimed three Fiesler Storch Fi 156 aircraft destroyed on the ground.
Mackie scored 20 air victories, as well as 3 shared kills, 2 probables, 10 damaged and 1 shared damaged, with 3 destroyed and 2 shared destroyed on the ground during the war. Of this final total, 12 kills, three shared destroyed, two probably destroyed, seven damaged and one shared damaged, was achieved while flying the Spitfire Mark V and Mark VIII. Mackie was also credited with 6.5 kills in the Hawker Tempest.
Following the war Mackie declined roles in the military, preferring to return home to New Zealand and continue his career as an electrician, eventually becoming Chief Inspector for the Tauranga Power Board. Shortly before he died in 1986 he was interviewed extensively by Max Avery who subsequently, with the assistance of Christopher Shores, published a biography "Spitfire Leader" focusing mostly on his military service.

2002 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 2002 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 70th in the National Football League. The team improved upon their previous output of eleven wins, going 12–4 and making the playoffs for the third consecutive year. 
The Eagles' record gave the team a tie for the best record in the NFL, and due to tie-breakers, gave them the number-one seed in the NFC, a first-round bye, and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs.
The Eagles suffered their worst upset in franchise history at home in the 2002 NFC Championship Game by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who eventually won the Super Bowl. The Eagles defeated the Buccaneers in the two season prior in the NFL playoffs in easy fashion. Many experts thought that the Conference Championship game would not be any different. The game is known in Philadelphia sports lore as "Black Sunday." The game was the last ever game to be played at the Vet for football.
Regular season.
Week 1.
The Eagles' season of high expectations began with a loss to the Tennessee Titans after the team blew a 24–10 halftime lead. The Titans scored on their first possession on 14-yard reception by Eddie George. Philadelphia took advantage of a muffed punt to extend a drive and scored on an 18-yard touchdown pass to James Thrash. The Eagles then executed a successful onsides kick and running back Duce Staley found the end zone on a 7-yard pass. Following a Tennessee field goal, the Eagles scored again early in the second quarter on an 11-play drive when Donovan McNabb completed his third touchdown pass – this one for 7 yards to Chad Lewis. A fumble recovery by the Philadelphia defense allowed a field goal before halftime to make the score 24–10 Eagles. Unfortunately, the Eagles offense and defense would go cold in the second half and the Titans would dominate the rest of the game. Joe Nedney kicked a 47-yard field goal for Tennessee, and the Eagles punted after a 15-play drive. Steve McNair completed his second touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter (the two-point conversion failed) and it was now 24–19. On Tennessee's next drive, McNair drove the Titans down the field and Eddie George punched it in from 2 yards out with 3:12 to play. The two-point conversion succeeded and Philadelphia now trailed 27–24. The Eagles' offense got two more chances, but failed to score. McNabb had two interceptions to go with his three touchdowns. Rookie Brian Westbrook, playing in his first game, led the team with 42 rushing yards on 8 carries.
Week 2.
The Eagles crushed the Steve Spurrier-led Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football by a score of 37–7. Philadelphia found the end zone on their first two drives. Donovan McNabb scored after he was flushed from the pocket on 3rd and goal, and he hit Jeff Thomason for a short touchdown pass on the next possession. Washington's only points came early in the second quarter on a 90-yard punt return by Jacquez Green. The Eagles added three field goals before the half to open up a 23–7 lead. McNabb, despite the fact that he was late hit on the play, completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to James Thrash in the third quarter. Dorsey Levens broke a 47-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to make it 37–7. The Eagles outgained the Redskins 451–179, and the defense forced three turnovers. The most drama probably occurred in the fourth quarter when a strange airborne substance, which turned out to be pepper spray used by stadium security, began making players and fan cough near the Philadelphia sideline. McNabb threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns and Thrash had 107 receiving yards and a touchdown.
Week 3.
Overcoming a slow start, the Eagles blasted the Dallas Cowboys 44–13 in their home opener. David Akers booted a 51-yard field goal early on, but Reggie Swinton returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for the Cowboys. Dallas took a 10–3 lead on a field goal, but the Eagles bounced back in the second quarter. Donovan McNabb hooked up with receiver James Thrash on a 35-yard touchdown and he took it in himself from two yards out four minutes later as Philadelphia moved into the lead 17–10. Akers made a short field goal before halftime to make it 20–10. In the third quarter, McNabb looked to run, but instead threw to a wide open Antonio Freeman for a 59-yard touchdown play. Then, Brian Westbrook threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Todd Pinkston on a trick play, and the route was on. McNabb added a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Pinkston after a 17-play drive that consumed eight minutes. McNabb threw for 287 yards and three touchdowns. The defense collected four turnovers (to give them 11 for the season at that point) and sacked Quincy Carter four times.
Week 4.
Philadelphia overcame another slow start with another big second quarter and a big effort from safety Brian Dawkins to defeat the expansion Houston Texans 35–17. David Carr completed a 23-yard touchdown to Corey Bradford to give Houston an early 7–0 lead. Following a David Akers field goal, the Eagles took control in the second quarter behind two short rushing touchdowns by Duce Staley (with the first being set up by a Dawkins fumble recovery) and another field goal to go up 20–7 by halftime. Philadelphia then used a trick play to score its next touchdown. With a punt formation in, the direct snap went to Brian Mitchell who started to run and then flipped it past the defense to Dawkins, who raced 57 yards for the score. After the two-point conversion, the Eagles led 28–7. The Texans came back with another touchdown to Bradford and a field goal to close to 28–17, but Donovan McNabb (who signed a 12-year contract extension the week before the game) sealed the deal with a 38-yard touchdown to James Thrash. Dawkins became the first player in NFL history to record a sack, recover a fumble, intercept a pass, and catch a touchdown pass in the same game. McNabb, who had early accuracy issues, threw for 259 rds. The defense sacked Carr seven times.
Week 5.
Another sloppy performance against an AFC opponent meant a 28–25 defeat for the Eagles in Jacksonville. Trailing 6–0 after a pair of field goals by the Jacksonville Jaguars, Philadelphia took the lead on 4-yard touchdown pass to Chad Lewis. With less than two minutes left in the half and Jacksonville set to punt, the Eagles were flagged with too many men on the field resulting in a Jaguar first down. Mark Brunell took his team quickly down the field and fired a touchdown to Kyle Brady. The two-point conversion gave Jacksonville a 14–7 halftime lead. After a David Akers field goal, Jacksonville receiver Jimmy Smith beat Bobby Taylor and took the ball to inside the Eagle 5-yard line, leading to an easy Jacksonville touchdown. Later in the fourth quarter, Jaguar return man Bobby Shaw took a punt back for a touchdown (the third return for a touchdown against the Eagles in four weeks) to make it 28–10 and put the game out of reach. Donovan McNabb, who was sacked five times and was visibly ill in the fourth quarter, rallied the Eagles to two late touchdowns, but Philadelphia came up three points short. McNabb rushed for 100 yards and Duce Staley rushed for 82. The defending NFC East champion Eagles fell to 3–2 as they went into the bye.
Week 7.
Duce Staley and the defense turned in great performances as the Eagles scored a big win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Philadelphia scored first on a 30-yard field goal by David Akers, however the Bucs took the lead when Derrick Brooks picked up a Donovan McNabb fumble and returned it 11 yards for a touchdown six minutes into the first quarter. In the second quarter, after Brian Mitchell returned a punt into Tampa Bay territory, McNabb hit Todd Pinkston on a fly route for a 42-yard touchdown and a 10–7 lead. The Eagles and Bucs traded field goals in the third quarter as the Philadelphia defense (ranked #2 in the league behind Tampa) preserved the narrow lead. In the fourth quarter, McNabb scored on a short run himself on a long drive to give the Eagles a 20–10 lead. Staley rushed for 152 yards on 24 carries, while the defense registered four sacks and knocked Tampa quarterback Brad Johnson out of the game with cracked ribs. The win made the Eagles 4–2 with an undefeated record against opponents in their conference.
Week 8.
After a big win over Tampa Bay, the Eagles did not let down, defeating the New York Giants at home on Monday Night Football 17–3. A 27-yard kick by David Akers gave the Eagles a 3–0 lead. Tiki Barber's 31-yard run in the second quarter set up a field goal for New York, but the Eagles answered with two more field goals to take a 9–3 lead. The Giants best chance to score was broken up when safety Blaine Bishop stripped Charles Stackhouse near the goalline, knocking the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. In the fourth quarter with the ball on Giant 40-yard line on third down, Donovan McNabb was flushed from the pocket and took off on a 40-yard scramble down the left side for a touchdown, picking up key blocks from John Welbourn and Todd Pinkston. McNabb completed the two-point conversion to Chad Lewis. McNabb rushed for 111 yards and Duce Staley picked up 126 yards. The Eagles went 5–2 and took a two-game lead in the division race.
Week 9.
The Eagles overcame a halftime 13–7 deficit to defeat the Chicago Bears in a cold, blustery day in Champaign, Illinois. Trailing 3–0, the Eagles drove down the field aided by several Chicago penalties. A 5-yard rush by Donovan McNabb gave the Eagles the lead, but Chicago came back with a 6-yard Anthony Thomas touchdown run and a 53-yard field goal before halftime. In the second half, the Eagles defense clamped down, pressuring Bears quarterback Jim Miller and holding Chicago scoreless. David Akers booted four second half field goals to give the Eagles their winning margin, 19–13. The defense sacked Miller three times and McNabb threw for 209 yards and rushed for 46 plus a touchdown. The win made Philadelphia 6–2.
Week 10.
Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts trounced the Eagles 35–13 in their worst loss since 1999. Philadelphia scored first on a field goal, but then Manning began to pick apart the Eagles' defense, driving the Colts to two first-quarter touchdowns. The Eagles got another field goal in the second quarter to make it 14–6, but the Colts put the game away in the third quarter when Manning completed touchdown passes to Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison. The only Eagle touchdown would be a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Thomason. Manning would go 18-for-23 with 319 passing yards and three touchdowns, rookie running back James Mungro carried for 114 yards and two scores, while Harrison and Wayne each had over 100 receiving yards. McNabb was 27-for-47 with 281 yards. The Eagles fell to 1–3 against the AFC and 6–3 overall.
Week 11.
In probably the gutsiest performance of Donovan McNabb's career, the quarterback played an entire game on a broken ankle and threw four touchdown passes to lead the Eagles past the Arizona Cardinals 38–14. On the third play from scrimmage, McNabb was sacked by LaVar Woods and Adrian Wilson, resulting in what was initially believed to be a sprained ankle. With Arizona ahead 7–0, McNabb (who was limited to either throwing quickly or handing off), took the Eagles down the field and completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to James Thrash. He found Dorsey Levens for another short touchdown in the second quarter. Jake Plummer and the Cardinals tied the game at 14–14, but McNabb hit Todd Pinkston with a 27-yard pass to give Philadelphia a lead it would not relinquish. Just before halftime, McNabb completed his fourth touchdown pass – a 9-yarder to Duce Staley. In the second half, the Eagles added a field goal and a 9-yard touchdown run by Thrash. McNabb had gone 20-for-25 for 255 yards and four scores, while Staley contributed 136 rushing yards. After the game, x-rays revealed that McNabb had actually broken his ankle. The injury would keep him out until at least the playoffs. Despite a 7–3 record, the prevailing belief was that the Eagles' Super Bowl run had been derailed with the loss of McNabb.
Week 12.
On a Monday Night game in San Francisco, the Eagles won in an improbable 38–17 blowout over the 7–3 49ers in the team's first game without Donovan McNabb. Backup Koy Detmer led the Eagles to a touchdown early in the second quarter, completing a 25-yard touchdown pass along the sideline to Todd Pinkston for the lead. Brian Mitchell followed with a 76-yard punt return touchdown (his NFL-record 13th) to make it 14–0 Philadelphia. After the 49ers scored on a Terrell Owens touchdown reception, Detmer made it 21–7 with a touchdown strike to Antonio Freeman. Detmer dove the ball in himself in the third quarter to open up a 28–10 lead for the Eagles, but during a drive later in the quarter, Detmer dislocated his elbow and was taken from the field in obvious pain. Third-string quarterback A.J. Feeley entered the game and immediately hit Chad Lewis with a short touchdown pass for Philadelphia's fifth touchdown. Owens would catch one more touchdown, but the defense, which had four sacks, mostly held the San Francisco offense in check. Detmer had statistically the best night of his career, throwing for 227 yards and two touchdowns. Pinkston had 6 catches for 94 yards. The Eagles went to 8–3 with a 7–0 record within the NFC.
Week 13.
A strong defensive effort helped the Eagles defeat the St. Louis Rams 10–3 in a rematch of the 2001 NFC Championship Game. Cornerback Bobby Taylor returned a Kurt Warner interception 23 yards for a touchdown. David Akers kicked a 31-yarder in the second quarter to give Philadelphia a 10–0 lead. The Rams could only muster a field goal over the entire game. The Eagles picked off two passes (including one by Troy Vincent that ended a late St. Louis scoring threat) and recovered three fumbles. N.D. Kalu had half of the team's eight sacks of Warner, and Marshall Faulk was held to 29 yards rushing. A.J. Feeley, with 181 passing yards, was efficient in his debut by avoiding any interceptions. The Eagles improved to 9–3 with the win.
Week 14.
The Eagles won again behind third-string quarterback A.J. Feeley, downing the Seattle Seahawks 27–20. The Seahawks drove for field goals on their first two possessions to take a 6–0 lead. Brian Mitchell had a good return on the ensuing kickoff, Feeley then converted a couple of big third downs before connecting with James Thrash for a 6-yard touchdown pass. In the second quarter, Duce Staley broke a 21-yard touchdown run to make it 14–6 Eagles. Two David Akers field goals later, and the Eagles led 20–6 at halftime. Rookie Sheldon Brown picked off Matt Hasselbeck and Feeley followed with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Todd Pinkston. After Seattle narrowed the score to 27–13, Akers missed a fourth-quarter field goal that would have put the game away. Hasselbeck responded with another touchdown pass to make it 27–20, but the Eagles recovered the onside kick and ended the game. Philadelphia sacked Hasselbeck four times and intercepted him three times. Staley rushed for 100 yards, while Shaun Alexander gained 123 for Seattle. Feeley threw for 190 yards and two touchdowns, while Pinkston had 7 catches for 88 yards. The Eagles had now won a season-high four straight games and were 10–3.
Week 15.
Playing in the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, the Eagles clinched their second straight NFC East title after an easy 34–21 win. On Washington's first drive, rookie safety Michael Lewis recovered a Stephen Davis fumble for the Eagles. Duce Staley scored on a 38-yard catch-and-run to give Philadelphia a 7–0 lead. The Eagles added a field goal and a short Staley rushing touchdown in the second quarter to go ahead 17–0. Ahead 17–7 in the third quarter, Eagle linebacker Carlos Emmons recovered a fumble, and after not being touched by the Redskins, proceeded to return it 44 yards for a touchdown. Washington went three-and-out, and A.J. Feeley led the Eagles on an 80-yard drive capped off by a 6-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman to bury the Redskins 31–7. Washington scored two "trash time" touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Feeley threw for 220 yards and two touchdowns, and Staley had 106 yards from scrimmage and a pair of scores. Philadelphia's defense forced and recovered three fumbles. The Eagles were now amazingly undefeated since the McNabb injury and were playoff-bound with an 11–3 record. Despite Koy Detmer being healthy enough to start vs Dallas, Andy Reid decided to stick with A.J. Feeley, who was having success .
Week 16.
The Eagles brushed aside the hapless, Dave Campo-led Dallas Cowboys 27–3 at Texas Stadium. Duce Staley ran it in from 5-yards out in the first quarter and Todd Pinkston caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from A.J. Feeley in the second quarter as the Eagles went to halftime with a 17–0 lead. The Eagles defense harassed Dallas quarterback Chad Hutchinson throughout the game, sacking him seven times and holding him to 128 passing yards. A Joey Galloway punt return inside the Philadelphia 10-yard was wasted for Dallas when the Eagles defense held and forced a turnover on downs. The Cowboys got on the board with a field goal on their next drive, and were deep in Philadelphia territory on their next drive when Shawn Barber intercepted Hutchinson and returned the ball 80 yards to put the game away. David Akers added his second field goal as the Eagles went ahead 27–3. Staley and rookie Brian Westbrook combined for 111 rushing yards. Feeley had 253 passing yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. Antonio Freeman had four catches for 82 yards. Philadelphia went to 12–3, 11–0 within the NFC.
Week 17.
With the New York Giants playing for a wild card berth and the Eagles playing for homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, the Giants edged the Eagles 10–7 in overtime. Philadelphia moved down the field on their opening drive, scoring on a 20-yard reverse to James Thrash, but their offense would struggle throughout the rest of the game. The Giants moved the ball well, with Tiki Barber rushing for 203 yards and receiving 73 yards. However, Barber had three fumbles lost that helped keep New York off the board until the fourth quarter, when rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey took the ball away from safety Brian Dawkins in the air in the end zone. With the score tied and five minutes left, Dawkins stripped Barber (his third fumble) and the Eagles recovered at the Giant 26-yard line, but David Akers missed a 35-yard field goal and the game went to overtime. On their first possession, the Giants maneuvered into Eagle territory and Matt Bryant kicked the 36-yard game winner. The Giants outgained the Eagles 461–209 and A.J. Feeley had his worst game of the season, going 13-for-25 for 150 yards with an interception. The Eagles finished the season 12–4, and still received homefield advantage throughout the playoffs when the Green Bay Packers were defeated the next day.
Playoffs.
Divisional.
After enjoying a first-round bye, the Eagles opened up their playoff quest against the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons, led by second-year quarterback Michael Vick, went 9–6–1 during the season. Though they stumbled towards the end of the season, losing three of their final four, the Falcons upset the 12–4 Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the Wild Card round 27–7. For the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb was back under center after missing the final six games with a broken ankle.
Seven minutes into the game, on Atlanta's second possession, Vick was intercepted on the left side by cornerback Bobby Taylor, who returned the ball 39 yards for a Philadelphia touchdown. McNabb led the Eagles to field goals on their next two drives, and by the middle of the second quarter, it was 13–0 Philadelphia. The Falcons got on the board with a 13-play drive capped by a short Jay Feely field goal. After the Eagles punted, Vick took the Falcons on a 9-play drive in two minutes to set up a 52-yard Feely field goal to end the half with the score 13–6.
After a 51-yard field goal miss by David Akers in the third quarter, the Falcons drove into the Philadelphia red zone. On second down, Vick took off on a dash towards the end zone. Brian Dawkins delivered a crushing hit that left both players sprawled on the turf, but Vick had reached the end zone and it appeared the game would be tied. However, a holding call negated the touchdown and two plays later, Feely missed a short field goal. In the fourth quarter, McNabb guided the Eagles down the field with a series of short passes and on 4th and 1 from the Atlanta 35-yard line, he found James Thrash over the middle and Thrash sailed untouched into the end zone for the game-sealing touchdown. Ahead 20–6, Philadelphia drained the clock on their next possession and Vick threw an interception to Dawkins to end the game.
McNabb was an efficient 20-for-30 for 250 yards and a touchdown in his return. He also had a 19-yard scramble on the Eagles' first drive. The defense played a strong game, sacking Vick three times, holding Warrick Dunn to 45 yards rushing, and limiting Atlanta to just two field goals. Vick had 274 passing yards, but he threw two interceptions.
NFC Championship.
The Eagles were dealt a crushing upset 27–10 defeat in the NFC Championship Game by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The favored Eagles appeared destined to win the conference title and propel themselves into the Super Bowl. They had beaten the Buccaneers at home in each of the last two postseasons and in October 2002, they had defeated Tampa Bay 20–10. The Buccaneers had never won a road playoff game and were 1–22 in games under 40 degrees (it would be 26 degrees at kickoff). Moreover, the game would be the final one for the Eagles at Veteran's Stadium.
Brian Mitchell returned the opening kickoff 70 yards for the Eagles. Two plays later, Duce Staley broke through the middle for a 20-yard touchdown in the game's first minute. The Eagles led 7–0, the Philadelphia crowd was deafening, and the Eagles now looked certain to cruise to victory. The Buccaneers recovered quickly, driving for a 48-yard Martin Gramatica field goal on their first possession. The Eagles punted on their next drive, pinning Tampa Bay at their own 4-yard line. On 3rd-and-2 from the Tampa 24-yard line, quarterback Brad Johnson hit Joe Jurevicius on a crossing route over the middle. Jurevicius badly beat veteran safety Blaine Bishop, who was playing injured, on the coverage and ran down the sideline all the way to the Eagle 5-yard line. The 71-yard play turned the tide of the game and Mike Alstott finished the drive with a touchdown to put Tampa Bay ahead 10–7. In the second quarter, Philadelphia drove into the Tampa Bay red zone and tied the game with a 30-yard David Akers field goal. However, the Buccaneers began a 12-play drive on the ensuing kickoff that ended in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brad Johnson to Keyshawn Johnson, making it 17–10 Tampa Bay. Donovan McNabb took the Eagles back into Tampa Bay territory before halftime, but Simeon Rice sacked McNabb and recovered the resultant fumble.
On the Eagles' first possession of the third quarter, McNabb lost the ball again on a sack, this time near midfield. With a minute left in the third quarter, Tampa Bay added another field goal to take a 20–10 lead. Philadelphia had trouble moving the ball throughout most of the second half as their hopes faded. With less than four minutes to play, the Eagles drove to the Tampa Bay 10-yard line, but McNabb was intercepted by Ronde Barber who returned the ball all the way for a touchdown to end the game.
McNabb was 26-for-49 for 243 yards with an interception and two fumbles lost, while Johnson was an efficient 20-for-33 for 259 yards and a score. Staley was held to 58 yards rushing, while the Eagles defense did manage to hold the Buccaneers to only 49 rushing yards. The heartbreaking loss, which was made all of the more painful when Tampa Bay went on to easily defeat the Oakland Raiders in the Super Bowl two weeks later, is consistently rated as the worst in Philadelphia sports history.

This is a list of books by Mercedes Lackey, arranged by collection.
Valdemar universe.
Some of the trilogies follow on chronologically from each other, while others are set a considerable number of years apart from the others - overall the books span some 3000 years of history.
"Heralds of Valdemar".
This set consists of the original trilogy, the very first Valdemar books published, and a prequel trilogy.
"Arrows" trilogy.
The first written and published of the Valdemar novels, these center on the character Talia, who from the moment of being Chosen by her Companion Rolan becomes the very special and hard-working "Queen's Own Herald".
Prequels.
These center on the Weaponsmaster Alberich (in the first two books) and the thief Skif (in the third book), telling the stories of their not-entirely-voluntary enrollments as Heralds. The order in which they were written differs from the internal chronology.
"The Mage Winds".
These follow on from the original "Heralds of Valdemar" trilogy and center on Princess Elspeth completing her transformation from "the Brat" to a fully-fledged Herald. Secondary protagonists include Skif and a new character Darkwind.
The latter part of "Kerowyn's Tale, By the Sword" fills in the events that happen after "Arrow's Fall" but before "Winds of Fate".
"The Mage Storms".
This next trilogy follows on the "Heralds of Valdemar" story and centers around the characters Karal and An'desha as Velgarth is threatened by a repetition of the Cataclysm described in "The Mage Wars" trilogy. This trilogy also focuses on the threat posed to Valdemar by the vast Eastern Empire and the development of the newly formed Alliance between Valdemar and its surrounding nations.
"Darian's Tale".
The "Owl" trilogy takes place several years after the events of "The Mage Storms" and follows the character Darian. The story focuses on the repercussions of the mage storms on Valdemar's northern border and centers on new tensions between the Kingdom and invading barbarians from beyond the Ice Wall.
"The Last Herald Mage".
These occur some centuries before the "Heralds of Valdemar" books, telling the life story of Vanyel Ashkevron; by the time of the "later" books he has become legend, thus explaining some of the small inconsistencies. This series was also consistently nominated for the Lambda Literary Prize, with "Magic's Price" winning in 1990.
"Vows and Honor".
These precede the "Heralds of Valdemar" books and center around the characters Tarma and Kethry. These characters appeared first in Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword and Sorceress series and were revisited in subsequent short stories. Two of these short stories are woven into the "Vows and Honor" books as part of a longer narrative. The original "Vows and Honor" pair of books were linked together with "By the Sword" (published long before "Oathblood") as a trilogy.
The third volume, "Oathblood", is made up entirely of short stories in place of a longer narrative. With its publication, nearly all of the Tarma and Kethry stories were available together in a single compiled volume for the first time. The single missing story, "A Dragon in Distress", was co-authored with Elisabeth Waters and was originally published in the Sword and Sorceress series, volume XII. The story is missing from the compilation novel "Oathblood" due to the setting of the story taking place in Elisabeth Waters's world, not Mercedes Lackey's Velgarth.
The contents of "Oathblood" are as follows:
In the books and short stories, Tarma is a sword-wielding Shin'a'in clanswoman. Kethry is a magic-user who carries a sword with unusual properties. The nature of this sword, Need, is explored in later series set in Valdemar. At the time of the "Vows and Honor" books, all that is known is that it is magic, protects female bearers, and can pressure its owner into assisting other women. The overarching goal for the two women is to accumulate resources enough to regenerate Tarma's almost-destroyed clan. As the titles of the books suggest, emphasis is laid on the importance and consequences of oaths in at least one story from each book. The setting of the books is generally in the lands south of Valdemar such as Rethwellan, although there is a brief sojourn in Valdemar in "Oathbreakers". Despite limited time in Valdemar, there were references in the first two "Vows and Honor" books to the Companions of Valdemar which laid early hints to their nature. The introduction of a fourfold deity (Tarma's Goddess) was something of a novel idea at the time of publication.
"Kerowyn's Tale".
This is a stand-alone novel which connects the "Vows & Honor" sub-series to the "Heralds" and other trilogies; it introduces the character Kerowyn who features therein. Kerowyn is the granddaughter of Kethry from the "Vows and Honor" sub-series.
"The Mage Wars".
Co-written with Larry Dixon. These are set in pre-history, some 2000–3000 years earlier. They describe the events which set off "The Mage Storms". It involves gryphons, creatures created by the mage Urtho (Mage of Silence). Co-protagonists are Skandranon Rashkae, a princely but proud ebony gryphon, and Amberdrake, a Healer of spirit and mind called a kestra'chern.
"Collegium Chronicles".
This series marked Lackey's novel-length return to Valdemar after a 5-year hiatus. It covers the founding of the Heralds' Collegium.
"Brightly Burning".
"Brightly Burning" ISBN 978-0-613-63021-4
is a stand-alone novel, set somewhere between "Collegium Chronicles" and the "Heralds" books; it describes another legendary character briefly referred to in the latter, Lavan Firestorm. The book was published in May 2000.
Anthologies and other publications.
Various anthologies were published from 1997 onwards featuring some short stories by Lackey and other authors she invited to write about the Valdemar universe. A companion book was also produced about the universe.
"Elves on the Road" universe.
This universe is set in warp-modern time featuring elves and magic.
Bedlam's Bard.
Lackey wrote the first few in this series with Ellen Guon and the latter part with Rosemary Edghill.
Diana Tregarde.
The main character, Diana Tregarde, is an American witch, practicing a fantasy version of Wicca; by virtue of her position as a "Guardian" Diana has access to more magical power than many and she is required to give her help when someone asks it of her. Her magical abilities do not pay the bills, however, and so Diana makes her living by writing romance novels. In the stories, Diana must protect others from angry deities, vampires and a sorceress who intends to remain eternally young.
The character Diana Tregarde first appeared in two short stories, "Satanic, Versus..." and "Nightside", which were originally written for inclusion in the "" roleplaying game. The short stories were first published in "Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine":
The books were published under Tor's horror imprint rather than its fantasy. At the time of publication, positive depictions of what Wiccans and, more generally, neopagans believed and did were rare. In the mid-nineties, Lackey's books generally were regularly cited as examples of pagan-friendly fiction. Lackey wrote that she had no plans for further books in the series because they did not sell well; nonetheless, she incorporated several elements of the Guardian mythos, including the apartment building where Diana lived, into later books in her "Bedlam's Bard" series.
In the collection "Bedlam's Edge" Lackey notes that she placed the Diana Tregarde world with her "SERRAted Edge" and "Summoned to Tourney" world with the intention of forcing anyone who believed Diana Tregarde and the Guardians were real to also have to believe in elves, dragons, and other patently fantastical things.
The SERRAted Edge.
The SERRAted Edge: Doubled Edge.
The Doubled Edge series is set several hundred years earlier than the other SERRAted edge books. The storyline is historically based, surrounding Elizabeth I's parentage, birth, and rise to power. In the fictional series, the Light court elves try to bring Elizabeth safely to the throne, while the Dark court elves hope for the misery of religious persecution from her half-sister Mary. "This Scepter'd Isle" revolves around Henry VIII's illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, and the later three focus on Elizabeth.
Sacred Ground.
"Sacred Ground" (1995)
Sacred Ground is a non-series novel in contemporary milieu concerning Native American magic. The main character, Jennifer Talldeer, is a private investigator. She is also Kestral-Hunts-Alone, an apprentice shaman learning modified tribal magic from her grandfather. She is called in to investigate possible sabotage at a local construction site where Indian artifacts have been found. Initially a run-of-the-mill investigation, it quickly spirals into a mess involving an old flame, Medicine and Native spirits running amok and an ancient evil once defeated by Jennifer's ancestor that has come back seeking revenge.
Much like Diana Tregarde, Jennifer is an independent woman and a powerful magic worker who also has mundane problems.
In her short story "After Midnight" Lackey insinuates that the novel was an attempt to recover the spirit of the Diana Tregarde novels after the fiasco with a few fans believing the novels were based on real events <http://www.mercedeslackey.com/features_laststraw.html>. However, Sacred Ground also did not sell well, and Lackey took a break from dark fantasy.
Secret World Chronicle.
"The Secret World Chronicle" is a series of "braided novels," based on characters and ideas created by Lackey and Libbey in an on-line role-playing environment, transposed into an entirely new setting. Although there are plans to set future works in different eras, "Invasion" is set in the present-day in a world where "metas" (short for metahumans, that setting's term for superheroes) first appeared during World War II and now play an important role in keeping the world safe. In "Invasion," the world is invaded by a mysterious force of armored Nazi soldiers, some of whom are subsequently found not to be human.
While "Secret World Chronicle" is not set in the same world as the "SERRAted Edge" and "Bedlam's Bard" series, it does share certain elements in common with those books; one of "Invasion's" central characters, Victoria Victrix Nagy, is referred to as a Knight of Underhill.
The first book of "The Secret World Chronicle" began serialization in podcast form in September, 2006, read aloud by actors Adam Higgins and Laura Patterson. Beginning in 2007, the series continued to be read by voiceover artist Veronica Giguere. In Spring 2009, the series was sold to Baen Books with a publication date of 2011 for the first book, and 2012 for the second.
"The Halfblood Chronicles" with Andre Norton.
This series of novels is set on a world where both elves and dragons arrived from dimensional portals onto a world where humans were native. The dragons remained hidden and elves subjugated the humans. The story follows the exploits of a group of half-blooded humans attempting to fight the elves.
The Elemental Masters.
Set in an earth where magic exists during the early 20th century, these stories follow magicians who control the powers of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These stories are based loosely—sometimes "very" loosely—on various fairy tales. Although these books all take place in the same "world" and all include the same established system of Elemental Magick, the first book, "The Fire Rose," can be distinguished in that the story takes place in the United States rather than in England, and the set of characters are not interrelated as are those in the following books. "The Wizard of London" can be considered a prequel to the other stories set in England and takes place during the Victorian Era.
Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms.
A fantasy series that deals with the more mature side of fairy tales. In the Five Hundred Kingdoms (almost certainly a literal name), the destiny of witches, knights, princesses and such are regulated by The Tradition, a magical force that is one of the primary sources of magic. Fairy Godmothers, Champions and Wizards are responsible for ensuring that The Tradition is upheld with a minimal loss of life. As with "The Black Swan," place-names suggest that these books are set in a fantasized version of late-medieval Europe. The Five Hundred Kingdoms series is published as part of Harlequin's Luna imprint, targeted at female romance-science fiction/fantasy readers.
"Free Bards" universe.
Bardic Voices.
The Free Bards had their genesis in the story "Fiddler Fair," originally written for an Andre Norton shared-world anthology titled "Magic in Ithkar". The Ithkar series did not continue after its second volume, so Lackey rewrote, changed, and expanded the story into a setting of its own in "The Lark and the Wren". "Fiddler Fair" may be found in the Mercedes Lackey short-story collection that is also titled "Fiddler Fair."
The Dragon Jousters.
The books primarily follow the story of Vetch (or Kiron, from the second book onward), and centers initially around a war between the neighboring countries of Alta and Tia, both of which use Dragon Jousters as their most powerful weapons. The books are based on the predynastic period of Ancient Egypt and (very loosely) the myth of Atlantis. This series began with a short story entitled "Joust" which was published in The Dragon Quintet (ISBN 076531035X). This short story was later expanded into the following series with the first novel holding the same name as the short story that began the series.
Obsidian Trilogy.
This series primarily follows the adventures of Kellen Tavadon during the third war between the races of light and the Endarkened.
Enduring Flame.
New series, set 1000 years after the events in Obsidian Mountain (Obsidian 1-3); and following an entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of cameo appearances by major characters Jermayan and Idalia, and the continued presence of Ancaladar the Dragon.
The universe of the Obsidian Trilogy and Enduring Flame Series contains many mythological creatures, and contains several types of magic, each with its own dynamics, strengths, and weakness. The High Magic and Wild Magic are used by the protagonists, while the Dark Magick is an old magic practiced by a race of demons called the Endarkened.
There are several types of mages featured:
Wildmage- A mage who was given the "Three books of Wild Magic". They can do a wide variety of things, however, each spell has two prices that depend on the size of the magick:
A physical price, that usually gets the Wildmage tired but it can get him killed.
And the MagePrice, that requires the people involved to do a deed as dictated by the gods of wild magic.
Both prices can be shared by other people if they want.
Knight-Mage- A type of wild-mage which only appears during the direst of times. Most of their magic is in the ability to excel in the various forms of warfare. However, what comes naturally to a regular Wild Mage often comes with difficulty to a Knight-Mage, as a result of their martial focus.
High Mage- A mage who practices "High magic", also known as war magic. They must be trained to use their magic, otherwise the magic will kill them. High Magery involves decades of training of the Magegift to gain mastery, and differs from the Wild Magic in that it is heavily ritualized and requires vast amounts of supporting equipment for all but generally the simplest of spells (unless one has mastered High Magic).
Elvenmage- Litlle information is told about them, but they are similar to Wildmages
Dark Mage- A Wildmage or Elvenmage that has been tainted or shadow-touched. Many believed that they were in the right, while others were just greedy. Dark Mages serve the Endarkened.
The Endarkened- A race of demons who use a powerful magic which derives power from the suffering and death of others. They were originally Elves who were tainted by "He-Who-Is", the main antagonists in the Obsidian Trilogy. The Endarkened had immortality.
All kinds of mages, except the Endarkened, can bond themselves to dragons, creating a mind-link with them and having access to their almost unlimited source of power. Usually both dragon and bonded have to accept the bond, however, Dark Mages use spells to force the bond, so, the dragons used to run away from them.
The Dragon Prophecy.
The Dragon Prophecy trilogy is set in the same world as Enduring Flame and The Obsidian Trilogy.
"The Bard's Tale".
Based on The Bard's Tale computer role playing game series.
"Sword and Sorceress series" Short Stories.
All Mercedes Lackey stories written for the "Sword and Sorceress series" anthology involve Tarma & Kethry as the main characters. With the notable exception of "A DRAGON IN DISTRESS", all of these short stories have subsequently been published in a compiled Tarma & Kethry novel called "Oathblood" (April 1998, ISBN 0-88677-773-9). The reason this story was left out of the compiled novel is due to the fact that the setting for "A DRAGON IN DISTRESS" takes place in Elisabeth Waters's world, not Mercedes Lackey's Velgarth.
Shadow Grail.
Written with Rosemary Edghill, Shadow Grail is a young adult fantasy series about Spirit White, a teenager who has lost her family in an accident and is sent to Oakhurst Academy, where all the students have magical powers.

Rohrbrunn

Rohrbrunn () is a village in Burgenland, Austria. It belongs to Deutsch Kaltenbrunn in the district of Jennersdorf. Rohrbrunn is located near the border of Styria by the river Lafnitz.
History.
Rohrbrunn was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. It belonged to Vas county. The small village has been inhabited by ethnic Germans since its establishment in the Middle Ages. According to the Roman Catholic ecclesiastic administration Rohrbrunn always belonged to the nearby parish of Deutsch Kaltenbrunn.
"Nádkuth" was given to Ferenc Batthyány in 1524. The ownership of the noble Batthyány family lasted about 350 years. In 1605 the army of Stephen Bocskai destroyed almost the whole village.
In 1851 Elek Fényes recorded that Rohrbrunn was populated by 428 people (almost exclusively Roman Catholic Germans). There was a toll-house in the village due to its proximity to the border of Styria. The Batthyánys remained the main landowners. The peasants earned their livelihood from growing wheat, tobacco, hemp and fruits or making a small amount of wine.[http://www.arcanum.hu/fszek/lpext.dll/rmf/Infobase/1b73/1b8f?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0]
Alois Brunner, one of the most infamous Austrian Nazi war criminals, was born in Nádkút in 1912. In World War I a total of 31 men perished.
Name.
In 18th and 19th century sources both the traditional German and Hungarian names of the village are mentioned. Rohrbrunn and Nádkút have the same meaning: "reed-well" which refers to the marshes of the Lafnitz valley. The German name was recorded in 1427 as "Rohrprunn". [http://www.vasidigitkonyvtar.hu/vdkweb/vm_tortenetfoldrajz/helysegek.html] The Hungarian name was recorded as "Nádkuth" in 1524. The German version became the sole official name of the village after 1920.

2002 Tennessee Titans season

The 2002 Tennessee Titans season was the 43rd season overall and 33rd with the league. The team improved upon their previous season's output of 7–9, managing eleven victories. The Titans qualified for the playoffs, but were unable to reach the Super Bowl, instead losing to the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Conference Championship.
Notable Games.
For the third time in their history the Titans opened a football season in a different football division, this time in the debut Sunday of the AFC South after their AFL era in the league's Eastern division and then spending 32 seasons in the AFC Central. The Eagles, defending NFC East champs, gave up a 14-yard Steve McNair touchdown to Eddie George, but then behind three Donovan McNabb touchdown throws they raced to a 24–10 halftime lead. The Titans then shut down the Eagles offense as McNair and George helped score 17 unanswered Titans points, finishing up a 27–24 Titans win.
For only the second time since leaving Houston, the former Houston Oilers flew to Texas for football. The Cowboys were hosting the ex-Oilers a week after losing to Houston's present-day NFL squad, but fell behind 10–7 at the half. The game turned against the Titans in the third quarter as Dexter Coakley picked off McNair and ran back 52 yards for a touchdown; McNair later knocked himself out of the game when he ran to the sidelines and crashed into an equipment storage wagon, suffering a concussion. Quincy Carter connected with Joey Galloway from 38 yards out and wrapped up a 21–13 Cowboys win.
This game marked the first time the Titans played against a former division foe from the old AFC Central, the Cleveland Browns. Tim Couch opened up the scoring on a 14-yard throw to Andre Davis in the first quarter. Eddie George and McNair answered with a pair of touchdowns, then Andre Dyson picked off Couch and ran the ball back 16 yards for a 21–7 halftime lead. Dennis Northcutt ran back a punt 74 yards for a Cleveland score in the third quarter, and in the fourth a McNair score to Kevin Dyson was answered by two Couch touchdowns, forcing overtime, and Phil Dawson finished it off from 33 yards out and a 31–28 Browns win.
The 0–6 Bengals blew a chance to win late amid a 30–24 Titans lead when, at the Titans goal line, Corey Dillon tripped over Matt O'Dwyer and fell a yard short of a touchdown. The gaffe wiped out a 138-yard day by Dillon and the now-3-4 Titans had gathered momentum to finish out the season.
The Titans made their first trip to Indianapolis since winning in the 1999 playoffs and raced to a 23–0 lead. The Colts fumbled in the second quarter and Keith Bulluck ran back a 61-yard touchdown. Steve McNair threw only 19 times with 14 completions for 92 yards and one touchdown, while Peyton Manning had to throw for 327 yards for two fourth-quarter touchdowns. Still, he was unable to lead a comeback, and the Titans won by a final score of 23–15.
Present Titans quarterback Steve McNair played despite missing practice due to injuries incurred throughout the season, and matched up against the man who would eventually captain the Titans under center, Kerry Collins. The 6–5 Giants took a 10–7 lead after a Collins score to Dan Campbell, while McNair grabbed the Titans a 14–10 halftime lead on two touchdown throws. A second Collins touchdown (to Ron Dixon) was followed by an exchange of field goals, a missed Joe Nedney FG try, a Tiki Barber rushing score marred by a missed two-point try, and McNair touchdown throw to Frank Wycheck and McNair two-point run with seven seconds left in regulation. In overtime the Titans clawed downfield and Nedney finished it off after five minutes on a 38-yard field goal and a 32–29 Titans win.
The former Oilers returned to Houston for the first time since 1996, and a game of field goals ended in a four-yard Eddie George touchdown run, his first in Houston since a six-yard touchdown against Jacksonville in December 1996 at the Astrodome. The win wrapped up Tennessee's first division title in two years and first in the AFC South.

Basshunter is eating at the cafe and hands Aylar a leaflet, inviting her to the street race he's taking part in. On race day it seems Aylar has another admirer, who happens to be the man Basshunter is racing against. Basshunter wins the race (in a custom Mazda RX-8). Later at night Aylar and her friends attend a party. Basshunter gets Aylar's attention by singing on stage and the pair kiss.

Philip, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Philip, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (31 May 1468 – 13 November 1500) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen.
He was the only son of Albert VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Günther II, Count of Mansfeld.
Life.
In 1475, after the death of his father, the six-years-old Philip inherited the principality of Anhalt-Köthen as "Mitherr" (co-ruler) with his cousins Magnus, Adolph II, and Waldemar VI according to the terms of the succession contract signed in 1471 between Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen and George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.
Philip never married or had children, and his branch of the Anhalt-Köthen line became extinct with him.
Eight years after his death (in 1508), his cousins and successors Magnus and Adolph II renounced their rule in favor of Waldemar VI, who died shortly afterwards. Waldemar's only surviving son, Wolfgang, was the last ruler of the old principality of Anhalt-Köthen.

Medical diagnosis

Medical diagnosis (often simply termed diagnosis) refers to both the process of attempting to determine or identify a possible disease or disorder (and diagnosis in this sense can also be termed (medical) diagnostic procedure), and to the opinion reached by this process (also being termed (medical) diagnostic opinion). From the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests. It is a major component of, for example, the procedure of a doctor's visit.
History and etymology.
The history of medical diagnosis began in earnest from the days of Imhotep in ancient Egypt and Hippocrates in ancient Greece. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation-olfaction, interrogation, and palpation. A Babylonian medical textbook, the "Diagnostic Handbook" written by Esagil-kin-apli (fl. 1069-1046 BC), introduced the use of empiricism, logic and rationality in the diagnosis of an illness or disease. The book made use of logical rules in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis. Esagil-kin-apli described the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.
The plural of diagnosis is "diagnoses", the verb is "to diagnose", and a person who diagnoses is called a "diagnostician". The word "" is derived through Latin from the Greek word διαγιγνώσκει, meaning to discern or distinguish. 
The practice of diagnosis continues to be dominated by theories set down in the early 20th century.
Medical diagnosis.
Medical diagnosis or the actual process of making a diagnosis is a cognitive process. A clinician uses several sources of data and puts the pieces of the puzzle together to make a diagnostic impression. The initial diagnostic impression can be a broad term describing a category of diseases instead of a specific disease or condition. After the initial diagnostic impression, the clinician obtains follow up tests and procedures to get more data to support or reject the original diagnosis and will attempt to narrow it down to a more specific level. Diagnostic procedures are the specific tools that the clinicians use to narrow the diagnostic possibilities.
Diagnostic procedure.
A diagnosis, in the sense of diagnostic procedure, can be regarded as an attempt at classification of an individual's condition into separate and distinct categories that allow medical decisions about treatment and prognosis to be made. Subsequently, a diagnostic opinion is often described in terms of a disease or other condition, but in the case of a wrong diagnosis, the individual's actual disease or condition is not the same as the individual's diagnosis.
A diagnostic procedure may be performed by various health care professionals such as a physician, physical therapist, optometrist, healthcare scientist, chiropractor, dentist, podiatrist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. This article uses "diagnostician" as any of these person categories.
A diagnostic procedure (as well as the opinion reached thereby) does not necessarily involve elucidation of the etiology of the diseases or conditions of interest, that is, what "caused" the disease or condition. Such elucidation can be useful to optimize treatment, further specify the prognosis or prevent recurrence of the disease or condition in the future.
Diagnostic opinion.
However, a diagnosis can take many forms. It might be a matter of naming the disease, lesion, dysfunction or disability. It might be a management-naming or prognosis-naming exercise. It may indicate either degree of abnormality on a continuum or kind of abnormality in a classification. It’s influenced by non-medical factors such as power, ethics and financial incentives for patient or doctor. It can be a brief summation or an extensive formulation, even taking the form of a story or metaphor. It might be a means of communication such as a computer code through which it triggers payment, prescription, notification, information or advice. It might be pathogenic or salutogenic. It’s generally uncertain and provisional.
Indication for diagnostic procedure.
The initial task is to detect a medical indication to perform a diagnostic procedure. Indications include:
Even during an already ongoing diagnostic procedure, there can be an indication to perform another, separate, diagnostic procedure for another, potentially concomitant, disease or condition. This may occur as a result of an incidental finding of a sign unrelated to the parameter of interest, such as can occur in comprehensive tests such as radiological studies like magnetic resonance imaging or blood test panels that also include blood tests that are not relevant for the ongoing diagnosis.
General components.
General components, which are present in a diagnostic procedure in most of the various available methods include:
Specific methods.
There are a number of methods or techniques that can be used in a diagnostic procedure, including performing a differential diagnosis or following medical algorithms. In reality, a diagnostic procedure may involve components of multiple methods.
Differential diagnosis.
The method of differential diagnosis is based on finding as many candidate diseases or conditions as possible that can possibly cause the signs or symptoms, followed by a process of elimination or at least of rendering the entries more or less probable by further medical tests and other processing until, aiming to reach the point where only one candidate disease or condition remains as probable. The final result may also remain a list of possible conditions, ranked in order of probability or severity.
The resultant diagnostic opinion by this method can be regarded more or less as a diagnosis of exclusion. Even if it doesn't result in a single probable disease or condition, it can at least rule out any imminently life-threatening conditions.
Unless the provider is certain of the condition present, further medical tests, such as medical imaging, are performed or scheduled in part to confirm or disprove the diagnosis but also to document the patient's status and keep the patient's medical history up to date.
If unexpected findings are made during this process, the initial hypothesis may be ruled out and the provider must then consider other hypotheses.
Pattern recognition.
In a pattern recognition method the provider uses experience to recognize a pattern of clinical characteristics. It is mainly based on certain symptoms or signs being associated with certain diseases or conditions, not necessarily involving the more cognitive processing involved in a differential diagnosis.
This may be the primary method used in cases where diseases are "obvious", or the provider's experience may enable him or her to recognize the condition quickly. Theoretically, a certain pattern of signs or symptoms can be directly associated with a certain therapy, even without a definite decision regarding what is the actual disease, but such a compromise carries a substantial risk of missing a diagnosis which actually has a different therapy so it may be limited to cases where no diagnosis can be made.
Diagnostic criteria.
The term "diagnostic criteria" designates the specific combination of signs, symptoms, and test results that the clinician uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis.
Some examples of diagnostic criteria are:
Clinical decision support system.
Clinical decision support systems are interactive computer programs designed to assist health professionals with decision-making tasks. The clinician interacts with the software utilizing both the clinician’s knowledge and the software to make a better analysis of the patients data than either human or software could make on their own. Typically the system makes suggestions for the clinician to look through and the clinician picks useful information and removes erroneous suggestions.
Other diagnostic procedure methods.
Other methods that can be used in performing a diagnostic procedure include:
Diagnostic opinion and its effects.
Once a diagnostic opinion has been reached, the provider is able to propose a management plan, which will include treatment as well as plans for follow-up. From this point on, in addition to treating the patient's condition, the provider can educate the patient about the etiology, progression, prognosis, other outcomes, and possible treatments of her or his ailments, as well as providing advice for maintaining health.
A treatment plan is proposed which may include therapy and follow-up consultations and tests to monitor the condition and the progress of the treatment, if needed, usually according to the medical guidelines provided by the medical field on the treatment of the particular illness.
Relevant information should be added to the medical record of the patient.
A failure to respond to treatments that would normally work may indicate a need for review of the diagnosis.
Additional types of diagnosis.
Sub-types of diagnoses include:
Overdiagnosis.
Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of "disease" that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient's lifetime. It is a problem because it turns people into patients unnecessarily and because it can lead to economic waste (overutilization) and treatments that may cause harm. Overdiagnosis occurs when a disease is diagnosed correctly, but the diagnosis is irrelevant. A correct diagnosis may be irrelevant because treatment for the disease is not available, not needed, or not wanted.
Errors in diagnosis.
Causes and factors of error in diagnosis are:
Lag time.
When making a medical diagnosis, a "lag time" is a delay in time until a step towards diagnosis of a disease or condition is made. Types of lag times are mainly:

Gertrude Spencer-Stanhope

Gertrude Spencer-Stanhope (1857–1944) was an English sculptor and painter. She was the niece of John Roddam Spencer-Stanhope and the cousin of Evelyn Pickering de Morgan, both of whom were noted pre-Raphaelite painters.
Life and career.
Mary Gertrude Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope was the eldest of 11 children. Her mother was born Elizabeth Julia Buxton, the daughter of Sir John Jacob Buxton. Her father was Sir Walter Spencer Stanhope, who owned Cannon Hall in Barnsley from 1873 to 1911.
The Cannon Hall estate had been in possession of the Spencer family, and later the Spencer-Stanhopes, since 1660. In 1951 the last surviving member of the family sold the house to the Barnsley Council. It was opened to the public as a museum in 1957. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration in 2007, Cannon Hall Museum featured 19th-century artists from the Spencer-Stanhope family in the exhibition "Painters of Dreams". Bronze sculptures by Gertrude Spencer-Stanhope were exhibited along with paintings by John Roddam Spencer-Stanhope and Evelyn De Morgan, and ceramics by William de Morgan, Evelyn's husband. Also highlighted were the ballroom at Cannon Hall and "Fairyland" in the pleasure grounds, which had been designed by Sir Walter and Gertrude's sister Cecily. "Painters of Dreams" ran from May 23 to September 9, 2007.
Works.
Gertrude Spencer-Stanhope exhibited paintings during the period 1886–1909 at both provincial and London galleries, but these works are not now well-known.
She produced perhaps only three bronze sculptures. In early 2006, the bronzes entered public ownership as part of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council's Acceptance in Lieu program, which allows art and heritage objects to satisfy inheritance tax in the UK. The three — a female nude, a Pan (on view online and archived), and a lyre-playing Orpheus — were allocated to Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council for display at Cannon Hall Museum. The works are regarded as "fine examples of the small-scale domestic bronze that was popular in late 19th century Britain," and are notable also because women rarely had the opportunity to work as sculptors at the time.
Spencer-Stanhope is also thought to have been the artist who painted the panels for the pulpit in Christ Church, Isle of Dogs. The work shows the influence of her uncle's pulpit panels in St. James the Great Church, Flockton, Wakefield; two panels appear to be imitations, with the third taking a more definably original approach. (The painted mural over the chancel arch is tentatively credited to John Roddam.) Gertrude had given the pulpit, installed in 1907, in memory of her brother Edward, but the particular connection of the Spencer-Stanhope family to Christ Church is unknown.

Fayette County Courthouse (Ohio)

The Fayette County Courthouse is a historic courthouse building located at 110 East Court Street in Washington Courthouse, Ohio. On July 2, 1973, it was added to the National Register.
History.
The area that is currently Fayette County was once part of the Virginia Military District and was established as a county in 1810 from part of Ross County. The county seat was placed at Bloomingburg and court was held in the hoe of John Devault. The county seat was moved to Washington courthouse in 1812 and a wooden structure was built that year. This building was replaced by a brick structure in 1813, and ultimately burned downed in 1828. 
The county rebuilt at the same site in 1828, erecting a structure with and an additional wing measuring 14 x . This was soon deemed too small and a new courthouse was designed by architect David W. Gibbs and began construction in 1882. The courthouse closely resembles the county courthouse in Marion. The courthouse was completed in 1885 and has served the county since.
Exterior.
The Second Empire style building rises three-stories on its square foundation. The ground floor consists of smooth stone blocks and rectangular windows. The building contains central projections with smooth stone blocks on all faces with a flight of stairs accessing the entrances. The entrances are set into a recessed arched alcove with two long arched windows on the fronts. Above the alcove is a small balcony topped by a pediment, which is supported by four Ionic columns. The pediment contains a tympanum decorated witha wreath surrounded by flags. A balustrade lines the balcony. The second floor contains arched windows set into rusticated stone blocks. Decorative carved wreaths are set between each window. The third floor is lined with smooth stones and is pierced by long rectangular windows topped by a small square window above. A decorative frieze runs along this floor between the windows and Corinthian pilasters frame each window. The roof is supported by an entablature with dentil moldings and a bulstrade lines the flat roof. A central tower rises on a solid bricked drum, the drum supports an arched and pillared bell tower. The bell tower is topped by a four faced clock which supports a dome rising to a statue.

Matt Lalli

Matt Lalli (March 27, 1986) is an American professional lacrosse player for the Boston Cannons of Major League Lacrosse.
Lalli attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, where he lettered in lacrosse, hockey, football and soccer. He scored 51 goals and 30 assists as a senior, and was named a high school All American and Player of the Year by the "Princeton Packet" and the "Trentonian".
Lalli played lacrosse at Colgate University, where he scored 21 goals and 23 assists as a freshman to lead the team in scoring, and followed that with 26 goals and 18 assists as a sophomore. He scored 22 goals and 27 assists as a junior, the second-highest point total in the Patriot League. As a senior he scored 20 goals and 27 assists, leading to his selection as a 3rd team All American and his participation in the North - South All Star Game. Lalli led Colgate to its first-ever share of the Patriot League title in the 2006 season, and helped the team to a berth in the NCAA tournament.
He was selected in the 2nd Round of the 2008 Major League Lacrosse Draft as the 16th pick overall by the Dragons. He played in eight games for San Francisco, scoring 10 goals and five assists, including five goals scored in a June 14, 2008 game against the Denver Outlaws.
In his first Next level Lacrosse summer league game on June 15, 2009, at the Stevens Institute of Technology site, Matt was held to just 1 point (0 g, 1 a), and assist, but did tally two groundballs and maintained a tremendous field presence. Matt's team, Team Turbo, did take a commanding victory in the game(10–4), regardless of his lackluster play.
In his second regular season games against the Orcas on June 22nd, 2009, Matt began to step his play up and tallied 5 total points (4 g, 1 a), and helped set the pace of the game with his hard work riding the Defense all night long.
After the first two games on Team Turbo, Chris Ford had this to say: "I would really like to get me a piece of that." Cousins, Chris and Brian Lalli, commented as well. "Our Dad always wished we had been as good as him."
Matt finished the 2009 Next Level Lacrosse summer league strong by quarterbacking the offense to its second overall league championship, although his performance in the championship game was not good enough to earn him MVP honors.
Within the next week, Matt led his club team, Power-Tek Lacrosse, to the #1 seed in the War at the Shore Lacrosse Tournament in Brick, NJ, heading into the Championship Sunday, which was eventually rained out. Determined to continue his governing play, Matt brought his heavy-underdog club team to the finals of the Lake Placid Lacrosse Tournament the very next weekend, where they would eventually lose to the former collegiate All-American stacked Graph-Tex team-where the highlights can be found on insidelacrosse.tv.
A begrudged Matt Lalli spent the entire winter off-season dedicated to come back bigger, faster, stronger for the 2010 summer season, beginning with the Next Level Lacrosse Summer League 2010. Matt brought more of his former Colgate cronies to the roster and shepherded the squad to an 11–1 record and repeat championships, although for the second time in as many years, he was not awarded MVP honors. This made the fire in his belly burn stronger- the following weekend at the 2010 War at the Shore Tournament in Brick, NJ, Matthew, yet again, led the Power-Tek squad to a 3–0 on the first day at the tournament, setting up a #1 seed for championship Sunday. While many argued it was the strong play of the team's defense that truly carried the team, only allowing 8 goals in the first 3 games, and 23 goals in 7 games, all the players and spectators knew deep down it was Matt's abilities on the field that led to the team's birth in the Championship game against Mesa Fresh, where they would eventually fall short and lost the game by 4 goals.
Undeterred, Matt came back strong the following weekend with Power-Tek at the 2010 Lake Placid Lacrosse Tournament, where the team eventually came to a repeat championship match against an even stronger Graph-Tex team from the previous year. Although the squad had the lead late in the 3rd quarter. The 4 Tewaarten Trophy winners, and 18 past and present collegiate All Americans of the Graph-Tex Squad was too much for Power-Tek and eventually beat P-Tek 8–6, where Matt's cousin, Chris Lalli, was awarded the Sportsmanship award for his lack of harassment of the referees for the first time in his career. For this award, Chris was awarded a brand new Brine Voyce strung lacrosse head with Brine F15 shaft, which should suit him well seeing he is a goalie.

Ronald Theodore Reuther

Ronald Theodore Reuther (1929–2007) was a committed naturalist who spent decades managing and improving several major zoos, and was an aviation enthusiast. Armed with a Bachelor of Science in Wildlife Conservation, Reuther held curator and director positions for the Micke Grove Zoo, the Cleveland Zoo, the Indianapolis Zoo, the San Francisco Zoo, and the Philadelphia Zoo. As Director of the San Francisco Zoo, Reuther was instrumental in the creation of a project to teach the gorilla Koko sign language. As a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Reuther helped to advance the transformation of zoos into research centers, and to promote the conservation and care of wildlife. As an aviation enthusiast, Reuther founded the Western Aerospace Museum and pursued the study of his personal interest in the disappearance of pilot Amelia Earhart.
Early life.
Ronald Theodore Reuther was born in Miami, Florida on December 25, 1929. As a young boy, he developed an early love of animals and a fascination with flight. He raised racing pigeons, ducks and chickens in his backyard, and would spend time at the beach with his brother and sister watching the birds at the shore. "The birds flying on the beach was a big part of his flying idea." said his wife, Gerry Elkus.
After the start of World War II, Reuther's family moved to the Bay Area where he later attended San Francisco's Lowell High School. During this period he became active in naturalist concerns. During the summer of 1945, Reuther worked on a game bird farm in Napa, California. He also helped establish the Western Bird Banding Association, and worked to help stop the indiscriminate shooting of California sea lions by the U.S. Coast Guard at Point Reyes. Ron would also spend a great deal of time at the San Francisco Zoo visiting his uncle Carey Baldwin, who was its director for 23 years.
After graduating from high school, Reuther attended the University of California-Berkeley to study Wildlife Conservation. During this period, Ron continued to work on advancing the study of wildlife by establishing the Point Reyes Bird Observatory. He also worked with the U.S. Public Health Service, as a Field Biologist, studying the epidemiology of encephalitis. As a field biologist, he spent time in California and Japan studying the natural history of birds.
Reuther received his Bachelor's Degree in Wildlife Conservation in 1951. He went on to do some graduate work studying Zoology at the University of Arizona, and Paleontology at the University of California-Berkeley.
During Reuther's graduate work, he served in the Reserve Officers Training Corps for the U.S. Air Force. In 1954 he officially joined the Air Force and became a pilot. For the next two years, Reuther flew B-26 Bombers and C-119 "flying boxcars" during tours of duty in Europe and North Africa.
Reuther remained active in the Air Force Reserve for most of his life, until he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1981. Reuther received the Meritorious Service Medal.
Zoological career.
In 1957, Ronald Reuther moved back to California and became the first director of the fledgling Micke Grove Zoo in Lodi, California. His philosophy that zoos were meant to educate the public on the importance of animal conservation was quite new at the time. Part of his approach was the insistence that zoos charge admission in order to generate money to do the work.
After a year at Micke Grove Zoo, Reuther moved to Ohio to take the position of General Curator for the Cleveland Zoo. While there, Reuther authored "The Official Guide Book - Cleveland Zoological Park". From 1962 to 1964 he was the Director of the Indianapolis Zoo, moved back to Cleveland to become its zoo's Assistant Director from 1964 to 1966, then moved back to California to become the director of the San Francisco Zoo.
While director of the San Francisco Zoo, from 1966 to 1973, Reuther transformed the zoo from an amusement center, to a center of education and research. When he arrived at the zoo, he was faced with a meager budget, and a volunteer veterinarian. "First of all, there just be facilities and staff—then you go on from there, to match what other zoos already are accomplishing" Reuther said in 1968. By 1973, he had increased the zoo's budget by 50 percent and hired a full-time veterinarian and full-time zoologists.
In 1972, Reuther saved the life of a baby gorilla, born at the zoo, by taking her home and nursing, the pneumonia-stricken ape back to health. The following year, Reuther allowed the baby gorilla named Hanabi-Ko, better known as Koko, to become the centerpiece of a project by Stanford University graduate student Francine Patterson, who famously went on to teach Koko to communicate through sign language. "Ron was the one who was crucial to allow the project to start, and the rest is history," said Lorraine Slater, executive director of the "Gorilla Foundation of Woodside" and http://www.koko.org. "I think he understood apes in a way few people did at the time. He was very dedicated in caring for them."
Reuther remained at the San Francisco Zoo until 1973 when he became President and Executive Director of the Philadelphia Zoo. Reuther then retired in 1978.
During his years as a zoo manager, Ronald Reuther was a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Reuther served on the Board of Directors from 1965 to 1971, served on many committees, and was editor of the AZA newsletter. From 1968 to 1970 Reuther was President of the AZA. Two publications were created during his tenure: "Zoological Park Fundamentals", and Z"ookeeper Training: A suggested Guide for Instructors".
Aviation.
After retirement, Ronald Reuther returned to his love of airplanes. He lectured on aviation operations and management for Golden Gate University, and on aeronautics at Sierra Academy of Aeronautics, a school for professional pilots. Reuther co-authored two books with William Larkins: "San Francisco Bay Area Aviation", and "Oakland Aviation". "He had a great interest in aviation history, as well as flying, and a special interest in the aviation history of the Bay Area and Northern California," said Larkins.
In 1981, Reuther founded the Western Aerospace Museum, now known as the Oakland Aviation Museum. As founder, president, and executive director, Reuther was instrumental in the creation of the museum, which includes exhibits on the history of Oakland International Airport, women in aviation, and notable flyers like the Tuskegee Airmen. In the museum's collection are the sister ship of Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Model 10 Electra, and the "flying boat" used in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Reuther was particularly knowledgeable about flight pioneer Amelia Earhart. He was fascinated by the circumstances of Earhart's disappearance and was an active member of the worldwide Amelia Earhart Society. Reuther organized four of the society's conferences in the Bay Area, and lectured about the subject at educational institutions. In 2002, Reuther organized a gathering in Oakland, California, and led a tour of places Earhart had visited before her final flight in 1937.
Reuther was also a member of the Northern California Chapter of the Explorers Club, and served as its president from 1989 to 1995.
Ronald Theodore Reuther died on October 4, 2007 of colon cancer.

The village has a population of 360.
History.
Wola Gułowska is located on the "rzeką Czarną" (Black River), a small tributary of the "Tyśmienica". It is located on the edge of the Plateau "Żelechowskiej" near the Łukowski plains. The terrain points to the "rzeźbie terenu" (Black Valley) and towering above the village the church of the Carmelite monastery dominates.
The oldest references to Wola Gułowska is from the years 1508 and 1545. In 1633, Ludwik Krasiński, heir to the local property, decided to found the Carmelite Monastery and build a new church in place of the old wooden chapel. The construction of the church was completed and consecrated in 1782. The church is famous for its miraculous image of the Virgin Mary, recognised in 1982 by the Archbishop Józef Glemp, and a copy of the image of Madonna.
Over 3 to 5 October 1939 Polish soldiers fought against German in the Wola Gułowska by the cemetery (the cemetery was taken by Poles). During the fighting near Wola Gulowska, the Poles and the German paratroopers also fought near local airfield. The fighting near Wola Gulowska was one of the smaller battles fought during the Battle of Kock. The Poles were defeated due to depletion of ammunition. A shrine and Museum was erected in the village after the war to remember the fighting.
Between the years 1975 and 1998 the area administratively belonged to the province of Siedlce.

Stephen Rebello

Stephen Rebello is an American writer, screenwriter, and former clinical therapist.
Early life.
Born to parents of third-generation Portuguese American and French-Portuguese American extraction in Fall River, Massachusetts, Rebello was raised in Somerset, Massachusetts. He graduated from Somerset High School where he co-edited the school newspaper and was a soloist in the mixed chorus. As a child singer, he had performed on a weekly radio show and done extensive live performances.
He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where he double majored in literature and psychology. He received a Master's from Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston.
Writing career.
After several years as a clinical social worker and supervisor at a Harvard University-affiliated hospital and also as a private therapist in Boston, he relocated in 1980 to Los Angeles. Continuing his work as a therapist, he eventually branched into journalism, publishing feature articles and interviews in "The Real Paper", "Cinefantastique", "American Film Magazine", the "Los Angeles Times", "Saturday Review", "Cosmopolitan", "Movieline", "GQ" and "More", among others.
His interview subjects have included Lee Iacocca, Chuck Yeager, Sharon Stone, Nicole Kidman, Anthony Minghella, Steven Soderbergh, Matt Damon, Jerry Bruckheimer, Eva Mendes, Clive Owen, Demi Moore, Drew Barrymore, Tom Cruise, Denis Leary, Robert Downey, Jr., Rosario Dawson and Scarlett Johansson. He is a "Playboy" magazine Contributing Editor.
"Reel Art" (1988).
On May 30, 1988, his award-winning non-fiction book "Reel Art: Great Posters From the Golden Age of the Silver Screen" (with Richard C. Allen) was published by Abbeville Press. The book generated film poster exhibitions in 1988 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, New York and in 1990 in the Paine Webber Building in New York City. The book was honored at an event at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of the best ever written about Hollywood.
"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho" (1990).
Rebello's 1990 non-fiction book "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho", distributed by W. W. Norton, received considerable praise on publication. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the May 7, 1990 edition of the "New York Times" declared it a "meticulous history of a single film production." Critic, author and filmmaker Richard Schickel called the book "indispensable and marvelously readable" and "one of the best accounts of the making of an individual movie we've ever had." Reviewer Gary Johnson called the book "one of the best books ever written about the making of a movie" and "unquestionably the best source available." Critic Leonard Maltin on his blog called the book a "landmark."
Paperback editions have been published by St. Martin's Griffin and by W. W. Norton. Hardcover editions have been published in the U.K., Australia, Italy, and Japan. The book has become a standard and continues to be used in film studies classes on director Alfred Hitchcock.
Work at Disney (1990s).
During the latter half of the 90s, Rebello worked alongside many Disney artists as a writer on several animated film concepts and projects that remain unproduced. He also wrote three books for Disney Hyperion based on the art of "Pocahontas" (1995), "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1996), and "Hercules". In addition, Rebello developed a teleplay for a live-action Disney musical for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which is yet to be produced.
"Hitchcock" (2012).
In 2005, several entertainment magazines announced the optioning of the screen rights to "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho" for a television movie or miniseries. That option was superseded when two other major production companies optioned the rights for a theatrical motion picture version. In January 2010, Paramount Pictures purchased the screen rights to the book. The film began development in 2011 by The Montecito Picture Company with director Sacha Gervasi at the helm of the feature, subsequently entitled "Hitchcock". Early screenplay drafts were written by "Black Swan" co-writer John J. McLaughlin. By late 2011, Fox Searchlight Pictures bought the project and the film was cast with Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, James D'Arcy, Jessica Biel, Toni Collette, Danny Huston, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ralph Macchio, Michael Wincott, Richard Portnow and Richard Chassler. Principal photography began on location on April 13, 2012 and the film was released in selected U.S. cities on November 23, 2012, with a nationwide and worldwide theatrical expansion thereafter. "Hitchcock' was chosen as the opening night film of the 2012 American Film Institute's annual film festival, with Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln' as the closing night attraction.

Professional wrestling career.
World Wrestling Federation.
Peggy Lee competed in the World Wrestling Federation in the mid-1980s. In 1984, she formed a tag team with Wendi Richter and frequently challenged WWF Women's Tag Team Champions Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. By 1985, Leather and Richter split up. Richter became a face and won the WWF Women's Championship. Leather challenged Richter for the title, but was unsuccessful.
American Wrestling Association.
After leaving the WWF, she competed in Florida Championship Wrestling as Peggy Lee Pringle, the sister of Percy Pringle. She engaged in a feud with Mad Maxine, who had been battling Percy. She then began working for the American Wrestling Association as Peggy Lee Leather and challenged Madusa Miceli for the AWA World Women's Championship. She also competed in a lingerie battle royal at the "AWA SuperClash III" pay-per-view event on December 13, 1988.
Independent circuit and World Championship Wrestling.
Leather also worked for David McLane. She competed in his nationally televised professional women's wrestling league, Powerful Women of Wrestling (POWW). During her time in POWW, she had a notable feud with her former WWF tag team partner Wendi Richter. She also feuded with long-time adversary Bambi.
In 1990, she briefly competed in World Championship Wrestling and was defeated by Bambi on "WCW Worldwide". She then joined the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association and competed as Lady X. She defeated Susan Sexton on January 31, 1991 in Laughlin, Nevada to win the LPWA Championship. At the "LPWA Super Ladies Showdown" pay-per-view event, she lost the LPWA Championship when she was defeated by Terri Power. After the LPWA closed, she returned to the independent circuit. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In 1997, she briefly returned to WCW and became a contender for the WCW Women's Championship. While in WCW, she wrestled against her former AWA rival, Madusa, who was the number one contender at the time..
From 2000-2001, she wrestled as Thug in David McLane's televised Women of Wrestling promotion, where she frequently feuded with long-time rival Selina Majors (previously billed as Bambi). Thug defeated Majors in a steel cage match at the "WOW Unleashed" pay-per-view event. Off-camera, Majors and Thug served as trainers for the inexperienced talent.

Ernest Beutler

Ernest Beutler (September 30, 1928 – October 5, 2008) was a German-born American hematologist and biomedical scientist. He made important discoveries about the causes of a number of diseases, including anemias, Gaucher disease, disorders of iron metabolism and Tay-Sachs disease. He was also among the first scientists to identify X-inactivation as the genetic basis of tissue mosaicism in female mammals, and pioneered a number of medical treatments, including bone marrow transplantation techniques. Beutler served as a Professor, then Chairman, of the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California from 1979 until 2008.
Early life and education.
Born in Berlin, to a Jewish family, his family home was located on Reichskanzlerplatz, renamed “Adolf Hitler Platz” after Hitler’s ascent to power, and then Theodor Heuss Platz after the Second World War. Both of his parents (Alfred and Kaethe, née Italiener) were physicians. His mother, a pediatrician, was in pre-war times the physician to the children of Magda Quandt née Rietschel, later Magda Goebbels, wife of the German propaganda minister. The second of three children, Beutler was preceded by an older brother, Frederick (b. October 3, 1926, later a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan), and followed by a younger sister, Ruth (b. November 23, 1932, later a clinical psychologist; d. July 14, 1993). In 1935, when Beutler was seven years of age, the family emigrated to the United States to escape Nazi persecution. Beutler was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
At 15, Beutler enrolled in a special program at the University of Chicago, founded by Robert Hutchins, then President of the University. He completed his undergraduate, medical school and residency training at the University of Chicago, receiving his doctorate in medicine in 1950 at the age of 21. He was the valedictorian of his graduating class.
Academic Career and Principal Scientific Contributions.
Beutler pursued a remarkably eclectic research career, and made fundamental contributions in many different areas of science over 56 years of active publication. His first scientific paper was published in 1952, and concerned the effect of X-irradiation on susceptibility to influenza virus in mice. This was an attempt to determine whether irradiated mice might offer a better experimental model in which to detect human viral infections. Not long afterward, he published a paper on the lag phase of "E. coli", which is also influenced by X-irradiation. This work, carried out during his residency in the laboratory of Leon O. Jacobson, was aimed at the development of an assay for a humoral radioprotective factor, and reflected a chance observation. Beutler also developed an early interest in iron metabolism, prompted by his clinical observation of the rapid symptomatic improvement of iron deficient patients treated with iron: an improvement that preceded any major hematologic change, and showed that numerous enzymes were sensitive to iron deficiency.
After completing his residency (1953), Beutler applied for a commission as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to the Army Malaria Research Program. During this period, he worked at Joliet Prison in Illinois (1953–1954), investigating anemia produced by antimalarial drugs. In the course of his work, he identified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency as a genetic defect that leads to the lysis of red blood cells under conditions of oxidative stress. This work hinged on his demonstration that red blood cell glutathione was unstable to oxidative stress. Later, he was to develop an assay for glutathione that was widely used in studies of red cell oxidative metabolism.
He was later transferred to Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland (1954–1955), where he studied Q fever. He was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of Captain.
Beutler then joined the faculty of the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago, where he studied iron metabolism and red blood cell metabolism. In 1959, he became chairman of the Department of Medicine of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, and in 1979 assumed the chairmanship of the Department of Clinical Research at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. Three years later, he was asked to become Chairman of a merged department (the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine) at Scripps, which later became The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA. He maintained his position as Chairman until his 80th birthday, only a few days before his death.
Not long after moving to California, Beutler made one of his most important contributions. A new colleague at the City of Hope and ultimately a lifelong friend, Susumu Ohno had recently demonstrated that the histologically observable Barr body present in the nuclei of mammalian female cells was a hyperchromatic X chromosome. Beutler immediately recognized that this might account for the variable expression of X-linked genes in females heterozygous for X-linked mutations. He soon determined that random X chromosome inactivation causes tissue mosaicism in female mammals, in that each somatic cell expresses one (but not both) of the alleles of X-linked genes with which it is endowed. This he accomplished by showing that two populations of erythrocytes exist in the blood of African American women who are heterozygous for G6PD deficiency. Mary F. Lyon independently hypothesized that variegated coat colors in mice might arise from random X chromosome inactivation. This, too, flowed from Ohno’s observations.
Beutler’s seminal work on G6PD deficiency led him to further explore hemolytic anemias caused by various enzyme deficiencies. The systematic methodology that he developed became the standard approach to study of patients with these disorders.
Beutler made major contributions to the understanding of Tay-Sachs disease. He purified the enzyme that is aberrant in this disease and demonstrated its multimeric structure. His group cloned the gene responsible for Gaucher disease and developed treatments for this disease, as well as diagnostic tests. Beutler also developed a screening test for galactosemia, which is used to this day to detect the disease in neonates, and prevent its severe consequences.
Beutler was the first to attempt pharmacologic intervention in sickle cell disease by increasing methemoglobin levels, carboxyhemoglobin levels, and fetal hemoglobin levels. The latter approach depended on administration of estrogen, progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin. These attempts were unsuccessful, but set the stage for presaged the use of hydroxyurea as a treatment modality.
In addition, Beutler designed the first artificial storage media for red blood cells, introduced the use of mannitol (still a mainstay in red cell preservation), and devised a variety of approaches to maintaining red cell ATP and 2,3-DPG levels and determined the viability of the cells in human volunteers.
He also played a major role in pioneering new therapies for leukemia: bone marrow transplantation in acute leukemia, and 2-chorodeoxyadenosine in chonic leukemias and lymphomas.
Beginning in the mid-1990s, Beutler attempted to positionally clone the mutation responsible for the common adult-onset form of hereditary hemochromatosis. He failed to identify the mutation before it was found by others to affect HFE, a member of the major histocompatibility complex family of proteins. However, in contrast to the reports of others, he found that only about 2% of males and no females homozygous for the mutation showed severe clinical manifestations of the disease. This study depended upon genotypic and phenotypic analysis of more than 43,000 subjects.
Beutler served as an editor of Williams Hematology, a widely used text in this medical specialty, for more than 20 years: from its inception until the last year of his life. In keeping with his editorial interests and his requirements as a publishing scientist, Beutler also wrote the software for the first comprehensive bibliographic retrieval system used by publishing scientists. Later commercialized as Reference Manager, it is still in wide use today.
He authored more than 800 publications, 19 books, and over 300 book chapters over a 55 year scientific career.
Awards and honors.
Beutler was a president of both the American Society of Hematology and the Western Association of Physicians. He also received a Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa, Tel Aviv University.He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and was presented with the inaugural Award for Lifetime Achievement from The American Society of Hematology.
Family.
Married to Brondelle May Fleisher in 1950, Beutler had four children (Steven Merrill Beutler, Earl Bryan Beutler, Bruce Alan Beutler, and Deborah Ann Beutler). Bruce A. Beutler, also a biomedical scientist, occasionally collaborated with Ernest Beutler scientifically, over a period spanning more than 30 years.

On Thorns I Lay

On Thorns I Lay (previously known as Paralysis, then Phlebotomy) is a gothic metal band founded in 1992 in Athens, Greece.
Biography.
They started as a death metal, under the name of "Paralysis", then changed their name for "Phlebotomy" in 1993. They were originally a trio with Stefanos Kintzoglou handling drums and the lead vocals. They released the demo 'Beyond The Chaos' in 1992 and the EP 'Dawn Of Grief'. In early 1994, the group recorded the 'Voluptuous' demo which secured attention from the Holy Records label.
In 1995, they again changed their name for ""On Thorns I Lay"" in reference to Shakespeare(The name was suggested by their friend, Nightfall's vocalist/bassist Efthimis Karadimas) and their style got closer to Death/doom style, under the influence of bands like Paradise Lost and Anathema. Little by little, it evolved towards gothic metal, emphasizing melancolic themes, in the way of the band Theatre of Tragedy, having cavernous masculine voices and soprano feminine voices.
In 1994, the founders of the band, Chris and Stefanos, moved for graduate studies to Romania, where they also had some local musicians in their band. The current line-up of the band was formed in 2001, when the band founders returned to Greece.

Yoshihisa Yamamoto (wrestler)

Yoshihisa Yamamoto (born July 4, 1970 in present-day Kudamatsu) is a Japanese mixed martial artist and professional wrestler. In mixed martial arts, he has competed for RINGS, WEF, PRIDE, and Hero's.
Mixed martial arts career.
RINGS.
Yamamoto made his professional debut for RINGS in Japan on January 25, 1995, facing off against Dutch fighter Hans Nijman, who was also making his debut. Yamamoto lost the bout when he was knocked out only 43 seconds into the fight. After winning his next bout for via unanimous decision at an event in Amsterdam for the organization, Yamamoto faced off against legendary Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist, Rickson Gracie at Vale Tudo Japan 1995. Yamamoto gave the undefeated fighter arguably the most difficult fight of his career, but the former professional wrestler ultimately lost via rear-naked choke at 3:49 of the third round, the referee having stepped in when Yamamoto refused to tap out. This would be the only fight that Gracie ever had that didn't end with him winning in the first round.
The fight with Gracie elevated Yamamoto's status. In his next bout, he won via neck crank submission before losing via keylock submission to his teacher Akira Maeda and then to Ricardo Morais, who knocked out Yamamoto 46 seconds into the fight. In his next bout, Yamamoto faced David Khakhaleishvili, an Olympic Gold Medalist in judo. Yamamoto defeated the Georgia fighter via TKO 40 seconds into the fight before competing in the Rings - Battle Dimensions Tournament 1996 Final. Yamamoto won his fight in the quarter-finals of the tournament and then lost in his semi-finals match against Kiyoshi Tamura.
Yamamoto then went 7-7-1 in his next 15 fights with wins over Valentijn Overeem, Joop Kasteel, and Tsuyoshi Kosaka before being invited to compete in PRIDE.
PRIDE.
Yamamoto made his PRIDE debut at Pride 16 on September 24, 2001 against Brazilian Assuerio Silva and was dominated, losing via only 11 seconds into the fight via TKO. However, the former professional wrestler would bounce back, defeating South African kickboxer Jan Nortje via armbar submission less than two minutes into the fight. In his next bouts he was knocked out by former NFL lineman Bob Sapp and then lost via unanimous decision to Guy Mezger before picking up his next win against Alexander Otsuka after Otsuka injured his leg in the second round. In his next bout at Pride Final Conflict 2003 Yamamoto fought Heath Herring and performed well against the Sambo and Muay Thai specialist but ultimately lost via rear-naked choke submission in the third round.
In his next bout the 13-16-1 Yamamoto faced two-time UFC Heavyweight Tournament Champion, Mark Kerr. Yamamoto pulled off a huge upset win, defeating the former All-American via TKO only 40 seconds into the fight. Yamamoto's next appearance for the organization was at Pride Bushido 2 against future 2006 Pride World Grand Prix Champion Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipovic. Yamamoto lost the bout via knockout 2:12 into the first round. Yamamoto fought once more the organization at Pride Bushido 3 against Choi Mu-Bae and lost via unanimous decision.
Post-PRIDE.
After PRIDE, Yamamoto fought for K-1 Hero's, and DEEP, but has not won since his TKO win over Mark Kerr, losing his last nine fights.

Indiano Bridge

Indiano Bridge (Ponte all'Indiano in Italian) is the first earth-anchored cable-stayed bridge in the world. It is a bridge across the Arno River in Florence (Italy) (near the Indian Monument). 
The bridge was built between 1972 and 1978 by Società C.M.F. S.p.A with architectural and urban architects Montemagni and Adriano Paolo Sica, and structural design engineer Fabrizio de Miranda.
The project won the national competition organized by the Municipality of Florence in 1968, and immediately attracted attention because it involved a pedestrian bridge hanging below. For the structural characteristics Fabrizio de Miranda in 1978 received the European award-CECM ECCS (European Convention for Construction Metallica). In fact it is the first cable-stayed bridge of large span anchored to the ground made the world and is one of the largest cable-stayed bridges in Italy of the twentieth century.

Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (politician)

Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (18 February 1813 – 23 April 1891) was a Norwegian priest and politician.
He was born at Jarlsberg Manor in Vestfold. His brother Johan Sverdrup would found the Liberal Party and become Prime Minister of Norway in 1884.
He graduated as cand.theol. in 1837, and worked as a senior technical officer ("amanuensis") at the University Library of Oslo from 1837 to 1845. In 1845 he was appointed to a clerical position, that of chaplain in Leikanger. In 1849 the district of Balestrand was separated from Leikanger as an own parish, and Sverdrup became vicar ("sogneprest") of the new parish. He published several works, mostly based on Erik Pontoppidan's explanation of the Luther's Small Catechism.
As his brother, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup became involved in politics. When Balestrand became a municipality of its own in 1849, Sverdrup became its first mayor. He sat as mayor until 1879. He was among the establishers of the local savings bank in 1847, and of the transport company Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe (later: Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane) with Jan Henrik Nitter Hansen and Michael Aubert in 1858.
He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1851, representing the constituency of "Nordre Bergenhus Amt". He was re-elected in 1854, 1857, 1859, 1862, 1865 and 1868. In 1870 he lost the election due to disagreements with Søren Jaabæk and his supporters, but Sverdrup later returned for a final term from 1874. Harald Ulrik Sverdrup stepped down as a priest in 1883.
When he stepped down, his son Jakob Sverdrup stood for election, and won. He also became a government minister.
A daughter of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup married the priest and Nynorsk proponent Eirik Olson Bruhjell. They had met while Sverdrup was the private tutor of Bruhjell. Another of his sons, Edvard Sverdrup, became a professor of theology. One of Edvard's sons, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup, Jr., went on to become a well-known oceanographer and metheorologist.

Iraq–Ukraine relations

Iraq–Ukraine relations are the interstate ties between Iraq and Ukraine. Iraq has an embassy in Kyiv and Ukraine has an embassy in Baghdad.
A small contingent of Ukraine operated in Iraq in the wake of the invasion of Iraq mainly concerning police work and reconstruction.
History.
The formation and the development of the bilateral cooperation between the two states are determined by traditional historical ties and significant potential for cooperation in trade, economic, military, and scientific areas. The valuable experience of participation of Ukrainian enterprises in development of the infrastructure of Iraq and development of the whole industries of Iraq's economy during the 1980s became a historical foundation for development of mutual relations.
At the same time, the application of international sanctions towards Iraq and a complex international situation around Baghdad substantially constrained active development of mutual relations during the 1990s. However, Iraq still remained one of the important directions of Ukrainian policy, particularly in economic sphere.
Formal relations.
Diplomatic relations between Ukraine and the Republic of Iraq were established on December 16, 1992. In May 2001 in Baghdad the Embassy of Ukraine in Iraq re-opened. Iraq also has an embassy in Kiev. Since 2004 there is the trade and economic mission operating under the auspices of the Embassy of Ukraine in Iraq. At the same time the permanent exhibition of Ukrainian goods and services is organized in Baghdad.
Economic relations.
During the pre-war period, economic cooperation between Ukraine and Iraq was developing exclusively within the framework of the United Nations "oil-for-food" program. The commodity structure of trade in the second period was determined by the presence of the international sanctions, which reduced possible assortment of Ukrainian production. In various years the metal products (ferrous metals), products of agriculture (barley, wheat), products of equipment and machinery (agricultural machines, power transformers, engines and generators) were delivered. Exports from Ukraine to Iraq increased from 2,5 million dollars in 1998 to 122.7 million dollars in 2002. In 2001 they reached the highest value in the history of bilateral relations – 293.1 million dollars. During this period Ukraine and Iraq, signed the treaty on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation, the association agreement between Commercial and industrial chamber of Ukraine and Federation of chambers of commerce of Iraq, the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Donetsk regional state administration and the administration of the Iraqi province Basra.
In 2003 there were conditions for development of relations between Ukraine and Iraq on qualitatively new, wider basis. The visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Kostiantyn Grishchenko to Iraq, became one of the first high level officials to visit at this stage of mutual relations.
Bases and parameters of development of relations between Ukraine and new Iraq for the nearest future were outlined on September 2004 during working visit of the Prime minister of Ukraine Victor Yanukovych to Iraq. During this visit the heads of the governments of Ukraine and Iraq determined such priorities and specific targets for development of bilateral cooperation for the nearest future.
Dynamics of trade turnover in the first half of 2004 indicates a gradual renewal of the volumes of Ukrainian exports to Iraq, as well as its diversification. The export volumes were 18.8 million US dollars and consisted of supplies of locomotives for the amount of 15.5 million US dollars (82%), iron and steel (8.3%), food (4%), medicines (4%), means of hygiene, paper.
In December 2009 Ukraine agreed to supplying arms worth of $550 million to Iraq.

USS "Lee" (1776) was a galley built for the Continental Navy. She participated in the Battle of Valcour Island during which she was grounded and lost. However, her participation in the battle helped delay the British advance on New York City by a year.
Construction.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Lee" was a galley cutter built under direction of General Benedict Arnold at Skenesboro, New York, in 1776 for service on Lake Champlain. It was constructed of timber captured in October 1775 at St. Jean’s, the British shipyard on the lake. 
Continental service and grounding.
"Lee", commanded by a Captain Davis, joined Arnold’s squadron 6 September 1776; the galley cutter operated on Lake Champlain for shortly over a month, ready to defend the inland water path which connected Canada and New York.
When the British moved south, the American flotilla met them in the Battle of Valcour Island 11 October 1776. "Lee" ran aground and bilged, during the action in which the small American squadron was all but wiped out. 
Delaying the British advance.
However, while suffering a serious tactical defeat, General Arnold’s ships won a great strategic victory by delaying for a year the British advance on New York City, a year in which the patriots prepared for the new British offensive which ended with the capture of the British Army at the Battle of Saratoga.

House of Laanui

The House of Laanui ("Hale O Laanui" in the Hawaiian language) is a family of heirs to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii collateral to the House of Kamehameha. Both houses are branches of the House of Keōua Nui. 
History.
The European-style use of patrilineal family names for royal houses was only introduced into Hawaii in the 19th century. The male line of Kalokuokamaile stopped after the marriage of Chiefess Kaohelelani to Nuhi. After this the line continues as the House of Laanui, using the name of the son of Nuhi and Kaohelelani, rather than being called House of Nuhi. Theresa Owana Laanui was the last to use the Laanui surname. The surviving descendants use the Wilcox family name, and include English and Italian descent after Theresa's marriage to Robert William Wilcox. 
Hawaiian royal houses, unlike European royal houses, continued after the extinction of the male line through the female line.
Kalokuokamaile.
The eldest branch of the House of Keōua Nui is from descendants of chiefs of the Kona district of the island of Hawaii, and from the island of Maui. The dynastic line was established by Kalokuokamaile who was the eldest half-brother of King Kamehameha I, who established the reigning House of Kamehameha. Kalokuokamaile was the son of High Chief Keōua Kalanikupuapaikalaninui and High Chiefess Kahikikala-o-kalani of Western Maui.
Kalokuokamaile's paternal ancestry makes his descendants the closest surviving collateral relatives of the Kamehameha reigning house. From his paternal grandmother, Kamakaimoku, daughter of Chief Kua Nuuanu, an Oahu chief descended from King Umi's youngest son Kumalae of Hilo. This maternal grandmother was also the half-sister of Heulu, the father of Keawe-a-Heulu, ancestor of House of Kalakaua.
The ancestry of Kalokuokamaile’s mother High Chiefess Kahikikala-o-kalani was of a cadet branch of the Royal House of Maui. His mother was daughter of High Chief Kalahumoku, of Hāna, Kaupo and Kipahulu, by his wife, High Chiefess Kalani Kaumehameha. On her father side, she descended from Lono-Honua-Kini, King of Maui, through his youngest daughter the Princess Kuhala of Maui. Through his mother and father, Kalokuokamaile descended from the island rulers of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and (more distantly) Kauai.
Laanui-Kalokuokamaile.
The male line of Kalokuokamaile went extinct when Kalokuokamaile did not produce a male heir. He was survived by his daughter Princess Kaohelelani, by his wife Kaloiokalani of Kahikinui and Honuaula descent. Kaohelelani married Nuhi, who was noble but not a ruling chief. Rather than being called the House of Nuhi, the House continued under the name of their son, Gideon Peleioholani Laanui. Gideon's male line came to end in 1944 after the death of Theresa Owana Laanui, the last female descendants. 
Her descendants:
Claims to Throne.
Being the only descendants of any of the brothers of Kamehameha, these descendants claim to be the closest surviving relatives of the Kamehameha dynasty. The Laanui claims are similar to the Miguelist pretenders of Portugal, since they are not descendants of the last monarch. The claims of succession are from Lunalilo, the last descendant of Keōua Nui to sit on the Hawaiian throne, while the Kawananakoas are successor of Queen Liliuokalani. The Kalakaua and Kawananakoa descend from Kalaninuiamamao while the Keōua Nui descend from Keeaumoku Nui, who were both brothers and sons of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku the last unquestioned Alii Aimoku of the Island of Hawaii. These two brothers were the main forces in the war of succession that followed Keawe's death, and the battle between their descendants, for the position of sovereign of Hawaii continues. The Kawananakoa pretender, Prince Quentin Kawananakoa, is the ninth-cousin-twice removed of Noa Kalokuokamaile.
Other claims.
The Laanui are the closest descendants of Princess Elizabeth Kekaaniau, who attended the Chiefs' Children's School. Each of the 15 royal children were declared eligible to succeed to the Hawaiian throne by King Kamehameha III with approval of the House of Nobles.
Although Princess Elizabeth was childless she adopted her only niece Theresa Owana Laanui as her heir. The Kawananakoa are cousins to royal family members who attended the school; they are not as close as the niece and aunt relation. 
With Theresa's second marriage to military and political leader Robert William Wilcox (Hawaii's first Delegate to Congress), the Laanui also claimed a closer lineage to the Kings of Maui through the line of Wilcox's ancestor Lonomakaihonua, the brother of Kaulahea II, King of Maui. However, the Kawananakoas are closer in descent to the House of Maui, descended from King Kekaulike, son of Kaulahea II.
Members of the Laanui family sometimes claimed the titles of prince and princess, as a matter of tradition and respect of their ancient native Hawaiians ancestry.

Marc Kasky (born 1944) is a consumer activist best known for bringing a lawsuit against Nike Inc. in 1998 under a California law against false advertising and unfair competition for their advertising claims about treatment of Chinese, Indonesian and Vietnamese workers at company subcontractors.
Career.
Kasky was born in Stamford, Connecticut and graduated from Wesleyan University and Yale University. He moved to San Francisco in the 1970s and headed the San Francisco Ecology Center, and later the Fort Mason Center.
Kasky is a former amateur and semi-profesional baseball player, who retired from baseball in 1997. He is also an active wilderness backpacker, with extensive experience in the back country of the High Sierra.
Kasky v. Nike, Inc..
Kasky filed a lawsuit in California regarding newspaper advertisements and several letters Nike distributed in response to criticisms of labor conditions in its factories. Kasky claimed that the company made representations that constituted false advertising. Nike responded that the false advertising laws did not cover the company's expression of its views on a public issue, and that these were entitled to First Amendment protection. The local court agreed with Nike's lawyers, but the California Supreme Court overturned this ruling, claiming that the corporation's communications were commercial speech and therefore subject to false advertising laws.
The United States Supreme Court agreed to review the case (Nike v. Kasky) but sent the case back to trial court without issuing a substantive ruling on the constitutional issues. The parties subsequently settled out of court before any finding on the accuracy of Nike's statements, leaving the California Supreme Court's denial of Nike's immunity claim as precedent. The case drew a great deal of attention from groups concerned with civil liberties, as well as anti-sweatshop activists.

National Conservation Exposition

The National Conservation Exposition was an exposition held in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States, between September 1, 1913 and November 1, 1913. The exposition celebrated the cause of bringing national attention to conservation activities, especially in the Southeastern United States. The fair was held in what is now Knoxville's Chilhowee Park in East Knoxville. 
History.
Inspired by the successes of Knoxville's Appalachian Expositions of 1910 and 1911, civic leaders sought to bring greater national exposure to the community with a third exhibition in 1913. At its 1912 convention, the National Conservation Congress endorsed Knoxville as the conservation fair site, and the National Conservation Exposition Company was established. The Tennessee state legislature appropriated $25,000 for the Exposition with the passage of the Senate Bill #1, Chapter 19 of the general appropriation bill during the 58th General Assembly, but the state comptroller opposed the funding on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, and state courts agreed. Various East Tennessee counties and private donors then stepped in to provide the necessary funding. Additional federal funding was secured for the fair by May 1913. Knoxville attorney T. Asbury Wright (1866–1923) served as President of the Exposition. 
The Exposition opened on Labor Day; September 1, 1913. President Woodrow Wilson addressed visitors via wireless transmission, and Governor Ben W. Hooper and Mayor Samuel G. Heiskell delivered speeches.
Although a national exhibition, it primarily focused on the natural resources of the South. The two-month exhibition drew over one million visitors. Nine major and six smaller buildings were constructed on-site to house its exhibits and demonstrations, including the Southern States Building, designed by local architect Charles I. Barber, and the Negro Building, designed and built by Knoxville College faculty and students. Among the visitors were Booker T. Washington, Helen Keller, William Jennings Bryan, Gifford Pinchot, and the Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, Cardinal Gibbons. The content of the fair was mostly entertainment such as a mock coal mine explosion, moving pictures and John Robinson's "Herd of Trained Elephants". The conservation exhibits talked of progressive topics such as peak coal, the loss of topsoil due to poor farming techniques, and the value of wildlife. Several Knoxville citizens involved in the Exposition would later play a part in the creation of the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
Local painters Lloyd Branson and Charles Krutch were among the artists who exhibited at the fair. Catherine Wiley, another local painter, served as Chairman of the Art Committee. Noted local photographer Jim Thompson provided much of the Exposition's promotional photography.
On September 11, 1913, a debate on women's suffrage took place at the Exposition, with Lizzie Crozier French delivering the pro-suffrage argument, and Annie Riley Hale delivering the anti-suffrage argument.
In April 2013, Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero announced that a Centennial Conservation Expo would be held in Chilhowee Park in October 2013.

James Curtis (journalist)

James Curtis (fl. 1828–1835) was a British journalist and eccentric. He is best known for his association with William Corder, hanged for the Red Barn Murder.
Curtis was a habitué of the Old Bailey, taking notes of court cases apparently for his own interest rather than as a regularly commissioned journalist. He invented his own shorthand for the purpose. He was known for his eccentric behaviour, fondness for long walks and insomnia.
He befriended William Corder after taking an interest in the Red Barn case, and sat by him during his trial: indeed, he became so connected with the case that a newspaper artist, asked to produce a picture of the accused man, drew him instead. Curtis carried out a thorough survey of the case and published what is regarded as the best contemporary account of the trial.

Subdural empyema

Subdural empyaema is a form of empyema in the subdural space. 
Bacterial or occasionally fungal infection of the skull bones or air sinuses can spread to the subdural space, producing a subdural empyema. The underlying arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces are usually unaffected, but a large subdural empyema may produce a mass effect. Further, a thrombophlebitis may develop in the bridging veins that cross the subdural space, resulting in venous occlusion and infarction of the brain. With treatment, including surgical drainage, resolution of the empyema occurs from the dural side, and, if it is complete, a thickened dura may be the only residual finding. Symptoms include those referable to the source of the infection. In addition, most patients are febrile, with headache and neck stiffness, and, if untreated, may develop focal neurologic signs, lethargy, and coma. The CSF profile is similar to that seen in brain abscesses, because both are parameningeal infectious processes. If diagnosis and treatment are prompt, complete recovery is usual.
It usually occurs in infancy.
It can be associated with sinusitis.

Prince of the Sa'id

Prince of the Sa'id (), was the title used by the heir apparent to the Egyptian throne prior to the abolition of the monarchy following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The title translates as "Prince of Upper Egypt".
Background.
The title was first used by the son and heir of Fuad I, Farouk Agha, who was officially named "Prince of the Sa'id" on 12 December 1933. The title that was given to Farouk Agha with the purchase in his name of 3,000 feddans of the best agricultural land. Farouk Agha held the title until he ascended the throne as Farouk I following the death of his father on 28 April 1936.
Since the title was only granted to heirs apparent, Farouk I's successor as heir, Mohammed Ali Tewfik, did not receive it as he was heir presumptive. The next person to hold the title was Farouk I's first (and only) son Ahmad Fuad. He held the title immediately following his birth on 16 January 1952 as he was the heir apparent of his father Farouk I. However, he only held it very briefly, since he ascended the throne as Fuad II following his father's forced abdication on 26 July 1952.
The title has never been used since then, as the Egyptian monarchy was abolished on 18 June 1953. Fuad II's eldest son Muhammad Ali (born on 5 February 1979) is styled "Prince of the Sa'id". However, since the monarchy no longer exists in Egypt, the title has no legal standing whatsoever, but is merely used as a form of courtesy.

Pool play.
The top two teams in each pool move on to their respective semifinals. The winners of each will meet on August 30 to play for the Little League World Championship. Teams marked in "green" qualified to the knockout stage, while teams marked in "red" were eliminated.
Ties are broken based on records in head-to-head competition among tied teams. In the event of a three-way tie for first place, the tie is broken by calculating the ratio of runs allowed to defensive innings played for all teams involved in the tie. The team with the lowest runs-per-defensive-inning ratio is ranked first and advances. Second place is determined by the head-to-head result of the other two teams. If the three-way tie is for second place, the runs-per-defensive-inning ratio rule is used. The team with the lowest run ratio advances, the other two teams are eliminated.

Fletcher Benton

Fletcher Benton (born February 25, 1931 Columbus, Ohio) is an American sculptor and painter from San Francisco, California. Benton is widely known for his kinetic art as well as his large-scale steel abstract geometric sculptures.
Life.
Born in the coal- and iron-producing district of southern Ohio, Benton was a successful sign painter as a youth. After serving time in the Navy, he graduated from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1956. Thereafter he moved to San Francisco, and began as an instructor at the California College of Arts and Crafts and then went to Europe, traveling by his motorcycle through Scandinavia, Holland, and France; he spent some time in Paris and then in New York and later moved back to San Francisco.
Benton was a part of the Beatnik movement in San Francisco during the ‘50s and ‘60s working as a sign painter by day and an expressionist artist (painting) by night. In 1961, he had a solo exhibition at the California Palace Legion of Honor, showing his portraits of fellow artists like David Simpson and William Morehouse. Frustrated with the limitations of paint on canvas, Benton began to work with movement in geometric pattern pieces and boxes which he was familiar with from his work in commercial signs. This was at the beginning of the kinetic movement; Benton worked largely in isolation, unaware of other efforts of kinetic artists. His early works of this series were exhibited at Gump’s Gallery in San Francisco.
In the late 1970s, he abandoned kinetic art, switching to a more traditional media for sculpture: bronze and steel. These works are designed to be viewed from all angles and have often been characterized as new constructivism; he continues to work in this style today. Some of his most popular series in this style are the Folded Square Alphabets and Numericals, Folded Circle, Donuts, and Steel Watercolors.
Benton has large-scale steel sculptures permanently installed world-wide including San Francisco’s Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, the city of Cologne, Germany, the city of Berlin, among others.
Public Collections.
His work is included in the collections of the:
Awards.
In 2008, Fletcher Benton was a recipient of the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.
In 1995, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters by the University of Rio Grande, located in Gallia County, Ohio.

Wojcieszków

Wojcieszków is a village in Łuków County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wojcieszków. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south of Łuków and north of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,100, and used to be a town from 1540 to 1819.
The village of Wojcieszkow was founded in 1437 by a local nobleman Klemens Bielinski. In the same year, Bishop of Kraków Zbigniew Olesnicki established here a Roman Catholic parish church. On January 21, 1540, upon request of Mikolaj Dzik, the owner of Wojcieszkow, King Sigismund I Old granted Magdeburg rights to it. In 1767, a wooden church of Holy Trinity was built, and in 1771, a Suchodolski family library was opened. Until the Partitions of Poland, Wojcieszkow belonged to the County of Stezyca, Sandomierz Voivodeship.
In the late 18th century, the Plater family built here a large manor house, which was burned during World War II. According to documents, in 1802 Wojcieszkow had a market place, a church and a castle. The town however, was located on poor soil, among forests and sands, which had a negative impact on its development. As a result, Wojcieszkow gradually declined, and in 1819 was stripped of town charter. Currently, the location of Wojcieszkow turned out to be an advantage. Due to clean environment, hilly landscape and forests, the village is emerging as a local tourist center. It has a historic church and a cemetery, where Maria Babska, the wife of Henryk Sienkiewicz, is buried.

Iclaprim

Iclaprim (INN), codenamed AR-100 and RO-48-2622, is a diaminopyrimidine dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is structurally related to trimethoprim. In Phase III clinical trials, intravenously-administered iclaprim was found to be as effective as and better tolerated than linezolid in people with skin and soft tissue infections, many caused by methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA). "In vitro", iclaprim is highly active against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (VRSA), strains of "Streptococcus pneumoniae" resistant to several common antibiotics, and some Gram-negative bacteria.
A new drug application for iclaprim was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2008, and a marketing authorisation application (MAA) was accepted by the European Medicines Agency on August 21, 2008. Phase II clinical trials are being conducted to assess whether iclaprim can be taken by mouth as well as intravenously and whether it is effective for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Iclaprim has been granted fast track status by the FDA.

Honda Vigor

The Honda Vigor was a premium sedan sold in Japan through the "Honda Verno" dealer network from 1981 to 1995 derived from the Honda Accord, and briefly sold in North America from 1992 to 1994 as the Acura Vigor. Early Vigors were more upmarket versions of the Accord and served as Honda's flagship until the arrival of the Honda Legend. In 1989, the Vigor would differentiate itself further from the Accord with unique styling and an available longitudinal five-cylinder engine, and a twin to the Vigor was introduced with the Honda Inspire, available at "Honda Clio" dealerships.
It was replaced in North America with the Acura TL and in Japan with the Honda Saber/Inspire, which were the same vehicle sold through different networks.
The Vigor was developed during what was known in Japan as the Japanese asset price bubble or "bubble economy".
First generation (SZ (hatchback)/AD (sedan)).
Beginning September 25, 1981, Honda produced a variant of the Honda Accord badged as the Honda Vigor for Japan only. The first generation Vigor was a higher grade 4-door sedan and 3-door hatchback, with the 1.8 L engine as the only engine available, using Honda's CVCC-II system. The Vigor was a sportier, faster, "vigorous" Accord with a higher level of equipment over the more sedate Accord. Due to the higher level of luxury oriented equipment, the Vigor help "set the stage" for the market to accept a luxury equipped car from Honda, which appeared in 1985 with the Honda Legend. The Vigor competed with the Toyota Chaser and the Nissan Laurel in Japan. The rear lighting implementation consisted of the license plate installed in the bumper, with a black trim piece between the rear tail lights and the word "Vigor" inscribed. The Accord installed the rear license plate between the rear tail lights. 
This engine used the SOHC 3-valve-per-cylinder CVCC-II setup, mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission with a lockup torque converter. Vehicles with a manual transmission and the CVCC carburetor earned based on Japanese Government emissions tests using 10 different modes of scenario standards, and , and at consistently maintained speeds at . Vehicles with PGM-FI earned based on Japanese Government emissions tests using 10 different modes of scenario standards, with , and consistently maintained speeds at . 
Items that were optional on the Accord, such as cruise control, air conditioning with automatic fan speed control and thermostatically monitored temperature, power windows with driver's one touch express down, and power steering were standard on the Vigor. A trip computer that displayed mileage, driving time, and fuel economy that Honda called in sales brochure literature as "Electronic Navigator" was also standard on the Vigor. All Vigors were also equipped with ELR (Emergency Locking Retractor) seatbelts. One of the optional items on the Vigor was an Electro Gyrocator, the world's first automatic in-car navigation system. Other items included digital instrumentation, four-wheel Anti-lock brakes, a choice of stereo systems from Alpine Electronics, Clarion, and Pioneer, alloy wheels (13-inch), and adjustable thigh support on the front passenger seat.
As of 1985, trim levels that were offered were the MG, ME, and ME-R for the sedan. Earlier trim packages were the VXR, VX, and VL, all using the CVCC-II induction setup. Honda's fuel injection system was offered on the VTL-i, and VT-i. As the hatchback continued to be manufactured as an Accord only, the Vigor hatchback was available with the trim packages MX-T, and the ME-T until it was replaced by the Honda Integra 2-door hatchback in 1984. Earlier trim packages for the Vigor hatchback were the TXL, TX, and TU using the carburetor, and the TT-i with fuel injection. Vehicles that were installed with fuel injection no longer used the CVCC system. Some of the standard equipment on the MX-T hatchback and the MG and ME sedans included cruise control, 2 position 4 Wheel auto leveling suspension, fuel usage computer, AM/FM cassette stereo and two Coaxial loudspeakers, flow through ventilation, velour interior with split folding rear seats, and a rear cargo cover for the hatchbacks. The higher trim level ME-T hatchback and the ME-R also included delayed interior illumination (called "theater lighting"), four coaxial speakers with the stereo system, power windows and locks, disc brakes front and rear, and speed sensitive power steering.
With some differences in the equipment available between the Accord and the Vigor, the vehicle was essentially the same. Producing a vehicle with two different names allowed Honda to sell the car at different sales channels in Japan; the Vigor was sold at "Honda Verno" dealerships, and the Accord was sold at "Honda Clio" dealerships. The fully equipped Vigor 2-door hatchback offered cargo carrying flexibility over the first generation Nissan Leopard coupe, which was not a hatchback, an approach shared with the first and second generation Toyota Supra. Here is a Japanese television commercial for the Vigor
In 1997, Honda reused this approach to add an enhanced version of the mainstay Accord, by duplicating their efforts achieved on this generation Honda Vigor, and naming the new car the Honda Torneo.
Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3).
June 4, 1985 saw the introduction of the redesigned Vigor as a four-door sedan only. As before, the Vigor was a luxury Accord. The 1.8 L B18A four-cylinder engine was now offered with dual carburetors and a larger 2.0 L B20A engine was offered Honda's PGM-FI, with the 1.8 L A18A engine as the basic offering. The Vigor had minor cosmetic differences from the Accord, using a different front grille and rear tail lights, as well as a higher specification. The adoption of concealed headlights reflected the popularity of the Honda Prelude, and the new Honda Integra as the Vigor continued to be a companion at "Honda Verno" dealerships. The Vigor installed the rear license plate in the rear bumper, whereas the Accord installed the license plate indented on the trunklid. The trim level designations were 2.0 Si, MXL-S, MX, MXL, and MF. May 1987 saw the introduction of the 2.0 Si Exclusive, adding electric retractable side view mirrors as standard. An automatic shift-lock system was added in September 1988 on the "MXL Super Stage" trim level.
The second generation Vigor also benefited from Honda deciding to employ double-wishbones at both the front and rear ends—a layout that spread to other Honda products in subsequent years. While more expensive than competitors' MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small 4-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the JDM 2.0-Si model ), larger 4-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models. Base model Vigors rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels. As established with the first generation car, the luxury content was also extensive in comparison to luxury equipment available from competitors at the time. Some of the items on the top level 2.0Si included a power tinted glass moonroof, optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, optional coloured LCD digital instruments (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and engine temperature), tilt steering with speed sensitive power steering, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, electronic AM/FM stereo radio with cassette and 4 speakers (high power) with subwoofer and amplifier, intermittent front wipers (variable), 4-Wheel disc brakes (front: 2 piston calipers with ventilated front discs), and optional leather interior.
Third generation (CB5/CC2 & CC3).
At the launch of the fourth generation Accord, the Vigor was no longer based on the Accord chassis. The third generation Vigor, fulfilling as the top level sedan at "Honda Verno" dealerships in Japan, was shared with the all new Honda Inspire and the new second generation Honda Legend, sold at "Honda Clio" dealerships. The Vigor was sold in the United States and was badged as the first generation Acura Vigor in 1992. In Japan, the Vigor competed against the Toyota Chaser and the Nissan Laurel. The Vigor in Japan was available in four trim packages, starting with the Type N, Type E, Type W, and Type X. In May 1991, the Type N package was no longer offered, and the top trim package was the Type S-Limited. Starting January 1992, the trim packages were 2.5XS, 2.5S, 2.5X, 2.5W, 2.0G, and the Type W. In North America, the Vigor came in two trim packages; the LS and the higher content GS, and the 2.5 L engine was the only engine available. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel. One of the optionally available items was Digital signal processing integrated into the stereo system that allowed sound modification for various types of music. 
Production began in 1991 and the vehicle went on sale as a 1992 model in June of that year, slotting between the Integra and the Acura Legend in North America, with the platform shared as the Honda Inspire between the Honda Concerto and the CB series Honda Accord in Japan at "Honda Clio". In order to keep the Vigor classified as a "compact" according to Japanese vehicle size requirements, the Vigor sold in Japan was available in two versions; the shorter and narrower vehicle with the G20A engine, and a longer and wider version with the G25A engine that was also only sold in North America as an Acura. 
Honda's longitudinally mounted 5-cylinder petrol was the only engine available. The transmission is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends power to the front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. 
Comparisons to the Lexus ES 300, which was roomier and softer in ride, generally favored the Lexus as the more appealing buy for the average luxury car buyer, whereas the Vigor was stiff and small.
In response to the reviews, Acura made several changes to the Vigor for the 1994 model year, increasing rear seat room, softening the suspension and re-engineering the steering rack to help isolate the driver from road imperfections in an attempt to make the model more like the ES. The tactics were unsuccessful; buyers favored the more powerful Legend as a sports sedan and still seemed to prefer the ES as an entry-level luxury model.
Poor sales and no improvement in market response led Honda to drop the model, and production ended on May 13, 1994. The Vigor was replaced by the 1996 Acura TL/Honda Saber.

David S. Cunningham, Jr.

David Surmier Cunningham, Jr., or Dave Cunningham, (born June 24, 1935) is a business executive who was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1973 to succeed Council Member Tom Bradley, who had been elected mayor that year. He represented the 10th district until 1987, when he resigned.
Biography.
Cunningham was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Eulah Mae Lawson Cunningham and David S. Cunningham, Sr. He received an associate's degree from Stowe Teachers College in St. Louis, Missouri, and was in the U.S. Air Force as a cartographer until 1960. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science and economics from the University of California, Riverside, in 1962; the following year he did an internship as administrative aide to Assemblyman Charles Warren, and then moved to Lagos, Nigeria, to become West Africa regional manager for the DuKane Corporation. He was manager of community relations for Hughes in 1967. He earned a master's degree in urban studies from Occidental College in 1970.
He and his wife, Mary, had three children — David III, Leslie June and Robyn Elaine. He lived in Baldwin Hills, which was outside the 10th District, until June before his 1973 campaign for City Council, when he moved into an apartment in the district.
He was vice president of Cunningham, Short, Berryman and Associates, a consulting firm specializing in governmental and economic problems before his election to the City Council. He now owns Dave Cunningham and Associates, a political-consultant firm.
A government center on west Washington Boulevard is named David S. Cunningham Jr. Multi-service Senior Center in his honor. He was president of the board of directors of the UCRiverside Alumni Association in 2010–11.
City Council.
Geography and population.
In the early 1970s, the 10th District included "parts of the Leimert Park, Crenshaw, Wilshire, West Adams, and Fairfax areas." It ran from "Olympic Blvd. on the north, to La Cienega Blvd. and Cattaraugus Ave. on the west, to Rodeo Road and Jefferson and Adams Blvds. on the south, to the Harbor Freeway on the east." The district was 50 percent black, 12 percent Asian-American, 12 percent Mexican-American, 20 percent Jewish, 5 percent Caucasian, and less than 1 percent American Indian.
Elections.
In 1973, Cunningham, 38, was endorsed by Mayor Bradley for the latter's old seat on the City Council in a special election held on September 18, 1973, his chief opponents being Herbert Carter, 40, former executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations and actor George Takei, 36, "familiar to many voters through his role of Sulu on television's "" series. Other candidates included Juanita Dudley, 43, former assistant regional director of the Urban League; Jordan Daniels Jr., 48, former administrative assistant to Assemblyman Henry Waxman, and Joseph Evanns, 35, a patent attorney.
The results of the election, in which only a plurality was needed to win, were Cunningham, 8,199 votes; Takei, 6,552; Daniels, 2,412, and the others trailing. Cunningham reported spending $62,766 in the campaign, compared with Takei's reported $31,228, and Porter's $26,365. His major reported contributor was Lloyd Rigler, whose food company, Adolphs, gave $3,000.
When he ran for re-election in 1975, he was described as "on his way to becoming the City Council's most prominent liberal." He got "consistently high marks from clean-air groups, and he has publicly battled for fluoridated water and a ban on oil drilling in Santa Monica Bay. He has also suggested the city cut off funding to the Los Angeles Unified School District unless it desegregates its schools." He was opposed by Warren Bradley, 49, a businessman, and Douglas MacMillan, a civil engineer. The results were Cunningham, 3,571 votes; Bradley, 1,621, and MacMillan, 648.
Warren Bradley filed petitions with 5,936 signatures seeking Cunningham's recall in December 1975, based, among other things, on Cunningham's backing of fluoridation in city water and "support of neighborhood half-way houses in the district for convicts and drug addicts." Only 2,472 signatures were proved valid, and the recall effort failed.
In 1978, Cunningham ran for the "hotly contested" 28th Congressional District seat against Assemblyman Julian C. Dixon and State Senator Nate Holden. He lost the Democratic primary to Dixon, who had 42,350 votes; Holden, 29,588; Mayor Merle Hergell of Inglewood, 6,457; and Cunningham, 5,255.
Holden and Cunningham again opposed each other in 1979, when Holden challenged the incumbent councilman for his 10th District seat. Cunningham won by 9,116 votes (51.6 percent) to 7,505 (42.5 percent).
Activities.
In March 1976, Cunningham and City Councilman Arthur K. Snyder narrowly averted fisticuffs "in an explosive climax to a debate over assistance to small and minority businesses in the city." The two council members swore at each other but were separated by the council's sergeant-at-arms.
In September 1976, Cunningham withdrew a proposal he had submitted that his press relations and public affairs be handled by a new firm whose members included a former aide of his and two other ex-city employees. City Clerk Rex E. Layton said he had "never seen that type of contract before at City Hall."
Cunningham became involved in a "nose-to-nose confrontation" with Councilman Louis Nowell in the City Council chamber in March 1977 after the council, by a vote of 8-4, passed a resolution against "forced busing" in Los Angeles, the practice of transporting schoolchildren far from their homes for the purpose of racial desegregation. He assailed the majority as "stupid" and called them "white bastards." He called Nowell "the greatest racist in the world" and told the San Fernando Valley councilman, who was campaigning to become city controller, that "I'll give you all the trouble you can take if you do get elected. . . . you hate me simply because I'm black." A resolution of censure against Cunningham was proposed by Nowell at a later meeting; it was referred to a committee.
Cunningham agreed to pay $1,178 to the city in December 1977 when it was discovered that Beverly Hills publicist Leonard Herring had been placing telephone calls from his home telephone on behalf of a fund-raising dinner and charging them to Cunningham's City Hall number. Cunningham denied he had given permission.
The councilman was said to have gained new "clout," or influence, when the City Council adopted a "trail-blazing" policy calling for its Grants, Housing and Community Development Committee, chaired by Cunningham, to oversee the distribution of millions of dollars in federal and state housing grants. Cunningham was able to sponsor a $500-a-plate fund-raising dinner, which "gained him entry into an exclusive council club consisting only of Arthur K. Snyder and Zev Yaroslavsky, the only other council members who have charged that much for an event." He later gave $60,000 of his campaign funds to the war chest of his ally, Mayor Bradley.
In August 1986, an investigative report by the "Los Angeles Times" listed Cunningham as third on a list of City Council members who had received campaign contributions from investment bankers and bond lawyers, a total of $29,200 after $36,600 to Gilbert Lindsay and $31,450 to John Ferraro. The "Times" cited a "growing link between city politics and the bond business." Cunningham resigned from the City Council on September 30, 1986, and went to work for Cranston Securities Company as a vice president on October 15.

Route 97 (MTA Maryland)

Route 97, also known as the Mondawmin Shuttle Bug or Mondawmin Shuttle, is one of two neighborhood shuttle routes operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore. It was the second and is so far the final in the series of shuttle bus routes to be introduced by MTA in the 2000s. The route serves Baltimore City Community College, Coppin State College, and various nearby streets, some served by regular bus routes, and some not. But the full route is within a close walk of one or more other MTA bus routes. The route operates at 25-minute intervals.
Unlike most MTA bus routes, the Mondawmin shuttle, having the "shuttle" status, operates via a circuitous route, and allows boarding for $1.00 as opposed to the regular $1.60 fare.
History.
Route 97 started operating in 2002.
In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, it was initially proposed that the shuttle's frequency would be reduced to one bus an hour, and riders were encouraged to use other regular bus routes that shared common routing. However, after community meetings, it was ultimately decided that the schedule would remain the same.
In 2006, MTA proposed that the route would be modified to serve Reservoir Hill in order to replace a portion of Route 5 that was at the time proposed for modification away from this area. But it was later decided that Route 5 would continue to serve Reservoir Hill.
June 2011.
Revise route to operate via Elgin Avenue on the southern loop with existing frequency.
