Biography.
Tallan Noble Latz was born to parents Carl and Doris Latz of Elkhorn, Wisconsin in the United States. He received his first musical instrument, a drum kit, at the age of three and began playing acoustic guitar at age four. By the time he was five, a video of Joe Satriani had a major impact on the boy and he declared "That's what I want to do." At the age of eight, he has played on-stage with performers the likes of Jackson Browne and Les Paul. He appeared on the Rachel Ray show on January 21, 2009.
Latz's musical influences include Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, BB King, Buddy Guy, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Steve Miller, Eric Johnson, Led Zeppelin, Derek Trucks, Rush, Slash, Keith Urban, Craig Young, Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven.
"The entire planet needs to see this kid play."
- John Schuld, co-organizer of the Kenosha Bloomin' Days Festival
"Life has it's special moments and one of mine was the first time I saw Tallan perform at the Stevie Ray Vaughan Ride and Concert in Dallas, Texas. Watching him perform that day was one of those moments in my life, a special day I'll never forget! It was pure magic and the crowd couldn't get enough of Tallan. He IS the whole package!"

Latz (aka: T-Man) is a 14-year-old award winning rock/blues/pop guitarist/singer, who has been playing music since the age of 3, picking up the guitar for the first time at 4 and finally getting serious about the guitar at age 5.
At age 5, Latz was taking lessons 3 days a week, soaking up all the information he could about the guitar. The dedication of a 5 year old practicing 3 hours straight was unheard of to his guitar teachers. As his first guitar teacher said, “This is unbelievable that he can learn the lesson sitting here. His speed of learning never existed in any student I have ever had in my 25 years of teaching!”
Latz began performing regularly with local bands when he was 6 years old. He quickly became a crowd favorite everywhere he performed.
The decision was made for Latz (age 7) to start fronting his own band. The name of the band became T-Man’s Blues Project and then when Latz was 8 years old the band name changed to The Tallan Noble Latz Band and it is still called that today.
Aged 8, Latz was asked to do a cameo in the movie, “Wildfire, the Arabian Horse”! This experience gave Latz the bug to want to explore movie roles more in the future.
In 2009, Latz (age 9) collaborated with the Louie Zagoras. Louie recognized immediately that Latz had something and took him under his wing. With Louie’s guidance they quickly went into the studio to record 5 original songs: Journey Man, Slippin Away, Other World, Kid in the Region and a song for Latz’s mom called 4U.
Latz then started working harder to carve his place in the Wisconsin music scene and that caught the attention of the fans and the music industry. Together they voted Latz (age 10) the WAMI's 2010 Rising Star of the Year Award Winner.
In 2011, Latz (age 11) went back into the studio and collaborated with blues artist, Anthony Gomes. Latz and Gomes worked at Sawhorse Studios in St. Louis, MO. The collaboration produced 2 songs, one was called Blues Child and the other rightfully named at the time, Blues @ 11. The songs relate to Latz’s experiences of being so young and being on the road playing music in the adult world. With the addition of top studio musicians Joe Meyer, Preston Hubbard and David Grelle to lay down the groove, allowing Latz to focus on his guitar and vocal tracks. The tracks were then sent to mixer Jim Gaines who mastered the songs.
At age 12 Latz became a sought after guitar clinician and guitar instructor. Latz partnered with Dangerous Guitars and together they will be releasing instructional videos and books designed to help the young guitar enthusiast to advance quickly.
Latz has been featured on many TV Shows, such as:
NBC's America's Got Talent, CBS' Rachael Ray TV Show, WGN’s Morning Show, Fox’s Morning Show, NBC's Today Show with Kathy Lee and Hoda, CBS’ Early Show, FOX News: Studio B with Shepard Smith, The Bonnie Hunt TV Show, CNN, Milwaukee’s Morning Blend, NBC's Today Show with Meredith Vieira, Chicago's WLS TV Morning Show, Madison’s Urban Theater and Almost Live with Johnny B TV Show.
Latz has been talked about on news broadcasts and radio programs all over the country; Latz was even featured on the BBC segment. His story has appeared in every major newspaper in the country and even some worldwide papers. He was the feature story on Yahoo’s Homepage multiple times. Latz has received over 25 million YouTube hits on his videos. Latz also has appeared on TV shows around the world. While in Denmark on tour, Latz appeared on all 3 national TV networks within a 1-week span, which is an unheard of accomplishment for any musician.
Latz has had the privilege to share the stage with some of the greatest musicians around:
Joe Bonamassa, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, Hubert Sumlin, Jackson Browne, Ian Moore, Derek St. Holmes, Van Wilks, Devon Allman, Bryan Lee, Anthony Gomes, Guitar Shorty, Michael Burks, Chris Duarte, Walter Trout, Greg Koch, Albert Cummings, Eric Gales, Wes Jeans, Lance Lopez, Eric Mantel, Louie Zagoras, Tommy Katona, Rob Hunt, Eric McFadden, Bugs Henderson, Pat MacDonald, Chris Aaron, Lonnie Brooks, Wayne Baker Brooks, Ronnie Baker Brooks, Jim Peterik & the Ides of March and JJ Grey & the Mofro. Latz also had the honor of sharing the stage with Les Paul, aged 8, he was the youngest person to have ever shared the stage with Paul.
Latz has had the opportunity to play at some of the best venues in the country, such as Antoine’s (Austin, TX), Bourbon Street Blues and Boogie Bar (Memphis, TN), Wild Horse Saloon (Nashville, TN), Maggie Mae’s (Austin, TX), House of Blues (Chicago, IL), BB King's Blues Club (Memphis, TN), House of Blues (Dallas, TX), BB King's in Times Square (NYC, NY), Milwaukee Art Museum (Milwaukee, WI), The Harley Davidson Museum (Milwaukee, WI), BB King’s Blues Club (Nashville, TN), BB King's Lucille’s in Times Square (NYC, NY), and Amager Bio (Copenhagen, Denmark).
Latz has performed at many major festivals around the country including:
Ain’t Nuttin But the Blues Fest, Summerfest, Lil Bear Ribfest, Northwest Ohio Rib-Off, Urbana Blues Brews and BBQ Festival, Ozark Blues Fest, Blues Bandits and BBQ Festival, TX State Fair, Bloomin Days, Blues Café, Oak Creek Lion’s Fest, Great American Biker Rally, Round Lake Beach Fest, St. Fabien’s Festival, The PRS Experience, Dallas Guitar Show, Bamfest, Prairie Dog Blues Fest, Lakefront Art Fest, Steel Bridge Songfest, IL Blues Fest, Harley’s 105th Birthday Celebration, Paramount Blues Festival, WI State Fair, NAMM, Children of Fallen Riders Fest, Ruben’s Run, Westmont Blues Fest (Muddy Water's Blues Fest), Northbrook Days, WI Harley Rally, WI/IL Border Rally, Sun Prairie Blues Fest, Jimi Hendrix's 67th Birthday Bash in Times Square and Co-Headlined The Stevie Ray Vaughan Ride and Concert in Dallas, TX.
Latz has also traveled to Denmark, where he appeared on multiple TV shows and played at a number of different venues including performances at the Odense Internationale Bluesdage and the Frederikshavn Blues Festival.
Latz has endorsement deals with:
Ultimate Ears, PRS Guitars, Shure Microphones, Mojo Hand FX, Amalfitano Pickups, Ultrasone Headphones, Munder Pedals, Mogami Cables, In-Tune Guitar Picks, Curt Mangan Strings, Morley Pedals, Effects Pedal Boutique, Soulful Impressions, LR Baggs, Diamond Finish, Seymour Duncan Pickups, N-Tune, Graph Tech and Peterson Tuners. Latz is the youngest musician that any of these companies have ever endorsed.
Latz is working on multiple projects during 2013. He will be heading into the studio and then touring in support of the CD release with a nation-wide and possible worldwide tour.
Controversy.
In 2008, Latz's father Carl received a letter from the state of Wisconsin informing him that Latz may not play club venues anymore, as a result of an anonymous e-mail sent to state officials complaining that he was too young to be performing in taverns and nightclubs. His booking agent also received an anonymous letter threatening her with death should she continue booking the 8-year old guitarist.
As of 2013, there has been no changes to the WI Law preventing young musicians from performing in certain venues. Together with Senator Kedzie, the Latz's have been in front of a committee of Senator trying to bring the vagueness of the law into light. They have been unsuccessful up to this point because of the severe bi-partisanship in the state. The problem with this law is that it prohibits young musicians from performing in certain venues that serve liquor, the problem is in the state of WI young people can legally drink if they are with a parent. So underage drinking is legal in the state as long as a parent is present and buys the liquor for the minor. But hand a child a guitar or musical instrument in a place they can legally drink at, the state now looks at the parent as unfit and will take the child away for child endangerment. But yet the state has refused to recognize the problem and Latz can't perform within the state at many venues because the state would take him from his parents. The issue remains unresolved.
Appearance on "America's Got Talent".
On July 14, 2009, Latz appeared as a contestant on America's Got Talent. He received a standing ovation from the audience, and all three judges approved of sending him to the next round. On the July 29, 2009 episode, he was eliminated at the Las Vegas round at the start of the episode.

First Battle of Passchendaele

The First Battle of Passchendaele took place on 12 October 1917 in the Ypres Salient area of the Western Front, west of Passchendaele village, during the Third Battle of Ypres in World War I. The Allied plan to capture Passchendaele village was based on inaccurate information about the result of the previous attack of 9 October, as the period of rainy weather continued. The attack took ground in the north but early gains around Passchendaele were mostly lost to German counter-attacks. The battle was a German defensive success, although costly to both sides. British attacks were postponed until the weather improved and communications behind the front had been restored. Two German divisions intended for Italy were diverted to Flanders, to replace "extraordinarily high" losses.
Background.
Tactical developments.
In July 1917, British Field Marshal Douglas Haig began the Third Battle of Ypres campaign, in an attempt to break out of the Ypres Salient. At the Battle of Messines Ridge the far side of the ridge had been captured down to the Oosttaverne Line and a substantial success gained in the subsequent Battle of Pilckem Ridge. At the Battle of Langemarck there was an advance of around Langemarck village by XIV Corps. In view of the failure of the British Fifth Army to advance on the Gheluvelt Plateau in August, Haig ordered that artillery reinforcements be added to the south-east along the higher ground of the Gheluvelt plateau, Broodseinde ridge and the southern half of Passchendaele ridge.
The main offensive was switched to the British Second Army under command of General Herbert Plumer. Plumer refined the tactics of bite-and-hold that had been used in July and August. By a succession of attacks with objectives of diminishing distance, with increasing numbers of infantry, behind a bigger multi-layered creeping barrage and with standing barrages on the objective lines during consolidation, German counter-attacks would be confronted by a defence in depth, with infantry in communication with its artillery and with much more local support from the Royal Flying Corps, rather than the former practice of looking to exploit success by occupying vacant ground beyond the final objective. Strictly limited advances at the battles of the Menin Road Ridge, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde produced a advance in two weeks, heavy German casualties and a search by the German high command for a remedy to the refined British attacking methods. The British attacks from 4 October put severe strain on the German defence and Generalleutnant Hermann von Kuhl, Chief of Staff of Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht, later claimed that conditions in the field were much worse for the Germans and that sickness had put further strain on manpower.
In the lower ground west of the Passchendaele Ridge, three months of constant shelling had blocked the watercourses that normally provided drainage. On the night of 4 October it began to rain and continued intermittently for the next three days. Much of the battlefield again became a quagmire, making movement extremely difficult. Had the German defence collapsed during the attack on the first objective at the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October, the reserve brigades of II Anzac Corps were to have passed through later in the day to continue the attack. On 7 October the afternoon attack, which was to have reached the far side of Passchendaele village and the Goudberg spur to the north, was cancelled by Haig because of the heavy rain. The final plan for the attack of 12 October was decided on the evening of 9 October. Plumer had received misleading information about the progress of the attack that day and believed that "a sufficiently good jumping-off line" had been achieved, passing the erroneous information back to Haig. The decision was made to continue the offensive in order to gain more favourable winter positions on higher ground, to assist the French with their attack due at Malmaison on 23 October and to hold German troops in Flanders during the preparations of the offensive at Cambrai.
Prelude.
British offensive preparations.
Encouraged by the unusually high German losses during the Battle of Broodseinde and reports of lowered German morale, Haig sought quickly to renew the Allied offensive and secure Passchendaele Ridge, as British Intelligence indicated that the German forces opposite Ypres were close to collapse. The Battle of Poelcappelle began on 9 October, causing many casualties to both sides. Most of the ground that the British captured opposite Passchendaele was lost later in the day to German counter-attacks. News of this German defensive success was delayed in reaching the higher British commanders, because the usual collapse of communications during an attack was exacerbated by the rain and mud. German artillery fire had become much heavier, as British counter-battery artillery fire had declined after 4 October. Guns had sunk in the mud, bogged down moving forward and run short of ammunition. Late on 9 October, Plumer erroneously informed Haig that II Anzac Corps had reached the first objective, a good position for the attack due on 12 October.
The 3rd Australian and the New Zealand Divisions relieved the 66th and 49th divisions on the night of 10–11 October. Patrols discovered that the 49th Division had reached the Wallemolen spur east of the Ravebeek creek, the advance having then been stopped by new barbed wire entanglements around the line. The 66th Division was found to be back near its start line of 9 October. The New Zealand Division had to make hurried preparations behind the front line, to restore communications and reconnoitre the ground, because the information available from the 49th Division was vague. Attempts were made to evacuate wounded but some were still stranded in no-man's-land when the attack began on 12 October. Many field guns needed for the attack were still bogged down in the mud. Other field guns had been placed on improvised platforms, when their new sites had proved impossible to reach and fired slowly and inaccurately or sank into the mud. A German bombardment took place on the morning of 11 October and later in the day, the British shelled the German defences on Wallemolen spur to little effect. Some progress had been made in the building of plank roads since the attack on 9 October and a few more guns had reached their new positions by 12 October. The Commander Royal Artillery of the New Zealand Division reported that adequate artillery support for his division could not be guaranteed.
Plumer discovered that the line near Passchendaele had hardly changed and that the main reason for the failure on 9 October was uncut barbed wire deep, in front of the pillboxes, at the hamlet of Bellevue on Wallemolen spur. The New Zealand Division commander, Major-General Sir Andrew Russell, later wrote that accurate information arrived too late to ask for a postponement or radically to alter the barrage plan and unit orders. The true front line meant that the planned advance of was actually closer to . The opening barrage line planned for the 3rd Australian Division was moved back but this still required the infantry to advance for to reach it. Duckboard tracks had been extended to the line held on 9 October, which allowed infantry to move up on the night of 11 October in time for the attack, despite rain and a German gas bombardment on Gravenstafel spur. High winds and heavy rain began about zero hour () and lasted all day.
Plan of attack.
II Anzac Corps was to conduct the main attack by the Second Army on a front of . The Fifth Army being short of fresh troops, limited its participation to the protection of the northern flank of II Anzac Corps, with brigades from XVIII and XIV Corps divisions. Ground south of the Ypres–Roulers railway was to be captured by I Anzac Corps and the attack was extended to the south by X Corps and IX Corps. The eastern edge of Passchendaele village was to be captured by the 3rd Australian Division. To the north the Bellevue defences and Goudberg on Wallemolen spur, were to be captured by the New Zealand Division, an advance of , rather than a advance from the line believed to have been reached on 9 October. Halts of two hours on the first objective and one hour on the second were to be made, in view of the wet ground.
In the New Zealand Division sector, each brigade frontage was approximately wide. The two attacking brigades were each given a machine-gun company and the other three machine-gun companies were to fire a machine-gun barrage. The artillery was to be ready to move forward after the final objective was gained, with a view to bombarding German-held ground from positions beyond Passchendaele village. The division had the nominal support of field guns and The first objective (red line) was beyond the Bellevue pillboxes; The second objective (blue line) was at the junction of the Wallemolen spur with the main ridge, from the Ravebeek creek north to the Paddebeek stream. The final objective (green line) was on the Goudberg spur.
German defensive preparations.
After their defensive success on 9 October, the Germans had brought fresh divisions into the line but the tempo of British operations caused considerable anxiety among German commanders. The 18th Division took over in the Poelcappelle area; on a front, the division had machine-guns, with large numbers of MG 08/15 machine-guns distributed among its infantry companies. Ludendorff's defensive changes had been implemented in some parts of the front, despite a certain reluctance among some of the local commanders. Outposts beyond the German advanced defensive zone () were to hold the front line in enough strength to stop the British from sapping forward but were to withdraw when attacked, to the main line at the rear of the , signalling to the artillery with rockets and Verey lights. The German artillery would be able to place a barrage in front of the main line of resistance before the British infantry reached it. "Eingreif" divisions were if possible, to be held back.
Rupprecht was doubtful about the changes, especially instructions for more counter-battery fire, since he had used all his artillery to engage British infantry. An anticipated French attack on the Chemin des Dames meant that fewer reinforcements could be expected by the German Fourth Army, making a fighting withdrawal the only possible response to the British attacks. A decline had set in among the German troops and attempts to counter British artillery had all failed, requiring a retreat to be far enough back to force the British into a laborious artillery redeployment. After being postponed from 2 October due to delays in the transport of ammunition, Operation took place at midnight on A strip of ground from Messines to Dixmude was bombarded with gas, which high winds dispersed with little ill-effect on Allied troops.
Battle.
Second Army.
Rain fell all night on 11/12 October, with only one dry interval during the day as the attack began at On the right flank, the 12th Brigade of the 4th Australian Division advanced on time but saw no infantry beyond the railway from the 3rd Australian Division. The Keiberg cutting was captured and consolidated, along with the rest of the first objective, although with heavy casualties. Troops of the 3rd Australian Division arrived at the first objective on the left and dug in, as the advance of the right flank units of the 12th Brigade towards the second objective began at Outpost groups got across the Keiberg spur with heavy losses, then destroyed two German counter-attacks between and , withdrawing as the right brigade of the 3rd Australian Division, north of the Ypres–Roulers railway fell back from the first objective, eventually returning to their starting point.
The 9th Brigade on the right of the 3rd Australian Division managed to reach the first objective and the battalion due to advance to the second objective went straight on. As soon as the infantry began to descend from a slight rise, they were engaged by German field and heavy artillery. The Australians kept going to the second objective, although on the right flank the advance was bogged down short of the first objective (red line). The battalion intended for the third objective had already advanced, veered to the left and dug in near the second objective, roughly where the 66th Division had reached on 9 October. The left (10th) brigade had heavy casualties from machine-guns in pillboxes to the right, centre and left of its front, despite silencing them relatively quickly. The survivors dribbled forward to a fold in the ground near the first objective, which gave some cover despite increasing machine-gun fire from the Bellevue pillboxes in the New Zealand Division area. The troops had suffered too many casualties to resume the advance towards the second objective at , so dug in to wait for reinforcements as the sun briefly came out. One party had kept going and arrived at the pillbox near Crest Farm, whose occupants promptly surrendered. The party went into Passchendaele village and German troops rallied and re-occupied the pillbox, as the Australian party joined with the 9th Brigade troops on their right.
An attempt was made to push the reserve battalion of the 9th Brigade around the right flank, past the west end of Passchendaele, to outflank the Bellevue pillboxes, together with a new attack by the New Zealand Division around as the rain came back. Before the attack began the 10th Brigade was forced to retire by the fire from Bellevue and by had filtered back to its start-line. The 9th Brigade was exposed by this retirement and fell back from the second objective in the face of artillery, machine-gun and sniper fire, with heavy losses. Dead and wounded of the 3rd Division lay with those of the 66th Division still there from 9 October. A second attack was cancelled by Lieutenant-General Alexander Godley, the II Anzac Corps commander.
The Germans opposite the New Zealanders had been alert on the night of 11/12 October, sending up many flares and conducting an artillery bombardment on the New Zealand front line at , hitting the New Zealand trench mortar personnel and destroying their ammunition. At the New Zealand advance began and immediately it was seen that the wire on the Wallemolen spur was undamaged. The creeping barrage was very thin, as some guns were bogged and others had been knocked out by German artillery. The creeping barrage diminished as it moved forward and howitzer shells plunged into the wet ground around the Bellevue pillboxes and exploded harmlessly. The German artillery fired all the way back to the rear or the New Zealand divisional area and machine-gun barrages from the German pillboxes at Crest Farm swept the forward slope down to the Ravebeek. Fire from Source Trench, north of Bellevue also raked the advance. At the wind rose, the rain turned into a deluge and mist formed, obscuring observation of the infantry from the rear. On the far left the cemetery at Wallemolen was captured and in the centre, Wolf Copse was reached. On the right the advance stopped on the rise from Marsh Bottom astride the Ravebeek. North of the Gravenstafel–Metcheele road, the left brigade gained some ground and was then also stopped by the wire and swept by machine-gun fire.
German troops were seen to retreat but machine-gun fire from the pillboxes and shell-hole positions increased and stopped the New Zealand infantry at the wire, "annihilating" attempts to get through it. At the surviving New Zealand infantry were ordered to dig in; by German infantry began to trickle back, engaging the New Zealanders from vantage points and directing artillery onto their positions. On the right, down to the swamp astride the Ravebeek, the 2nd Brigade met a similar fate, as their weapons clogged with mud and they found belts of barbed wire deep. The infantry of the right brigade tried to cut their way through the wire on the Wallemolen spur, against the Bellevue pillboxes and massed machine-guns hidden in shell-holes. Many New Zealand troops were killed and the wounded either lay out in the open or crawled to shell-holes, some occupied by 49th Division soldiers from the attack of 9 October. Small numbers of troops got through both belts but were then stopped by more wire close around the German pillboxes and killed. Further south two pillboxes were captured, with help from 3rd Australian Division troops in the area. An advance began up the northern slope of the Ravebeek but broke down quickly around Laamkeek.
The attack was suspended until while a flanking move by the 3rd Australian Division was organised and the artillery fire brought back to the red line. The renewal of the attack was eventually cancelled as the 9th Division to the north and the 3rd Australian Division to the south were forced back by the fire of the Bellevue machine-guns. The artillery bombardment went ahead, dropping on some New Zealand positions but also dispersing two German parties massing for a counter-attack. In the evening most of the division was withdrawn to a line on the lower slopes of the Wallemolen spur, from the cemetery–Wolf Farm–Peter Pan.
Fifth Army.
Flank protection for the main attack was provided by single brigades of the 9th and 18th divisions of XVIII Corps, attacking from north of Goudberg to north of the Lekkerboterbeek. The 26th Brigade of the 9th Division was to advance on a front, with its left flank on the Lekkerboterbeek, into an area dotted with fortified farm buildings. The division was hampered by the effect of rain and mud on supply routes, which stranded guns and caused shortages of ammunition, particularly in smoke shells. Midnight on 11 October brought torrential rain and a German gas and high explosive barrage on the division's forming-up areas. The wide front left numerous gaps in the line, as the 26th Brigade advanced behind a barrage moving at in eight minutes, assisted by a machine-gun barrage from Vickers guns The creeping barrage began at and was described as "thin and ragged". The advancing troops lost direction and communication broke down, as carrier pigeons were retarded by the high wind and messenger-dog handlers became casualties. The infantry continued their advance and on the right captured Adler Farm and reached the green line at Source Trench. In the centre, the attackers had to dig in a hundred yards forward. Small parties reached Source Trench and possibly Vat Cottages. On the left of the brigade the ground was even worse, the infantry lost the barrage and direction but captured a pillbox and moved further on. Some of the troops on the left flank inadvertently crossed the Lekkerboterbeek, advanced and then formed a flank with troops from the 18th Division. Except on the right flank, the attack was stopped by the Germans only from the start line, despite the 27th Brigade being sent to reinforce the attack; some British infantry were drowned in shell-holes. The new front line ran from the junction with the New Zealand Division at the cemetery near Wallemolen, to Oxford Houses then back to the old front line.
One brigade of the 18th Division attacked north of the Lekkerboterbeek, over ground soaked after rain all day on 11 October. A low-flying German aircraft had reconnoitred the area so the position of the jumping-off line was altered, to avoid a possible German counter-barrage as the brigade formed up for the advance. The divisional field artillery suffered the same fate as those of the divisions to the south, many sinking into the soft ground. The barrage began at and the infantry advanced in "snake formation". A German counter-barrage began within a minute and as British troops took cover, German machine-gunners fired at the crater lips of shell-holes, bullets passing through to hit the soldiers sheltering inside. The effect of the German barrage was worst on the right and added to machine-gun fire from the Brewery and Helles House strong-points. The situation at Requette Farm was not known as all runners sent from there were killed. Mud clogged weapons of all types and at a trench-mortar battery and some supporting machine-guns had to cease fire, because of wet and dirty ammunition. At noon German counter-attacks towards the west end of Poelcappelle began and lasted all afternoon, the Germans trying to exploit a gap with the 4th Division on the left; shell-hole posts were improvised and held by the survivors of the British attack. Rain fell in a deluge as it grew dark; the divisional history called the attack a "dismal fizzle".
The XIV Corps divisions had much better artillery and machine-gun barrages. The attacking brigade of the 4th Division met little resistance on the left, advancing next to the 17th Division and digging in at Memling Farm. On the right it was held back by the check to the 18th Division, the new front line curving back through Besace Farm to west of Helles House, south-west of Requette Farm, north of Poelcappelle.
The 51st Brigade of the 17th Division was to advance astride the Ypres–Staden railway, to meet the left of the 4th Division near Poelcappelle and the right flank of the Guards Division north of the railway, which would be facing north. After dark on 11 October, tapes were laid beyond the front line for the troops to form up on, so as to be beyond a possible German counter-barrage; to avoid detection, scouts patrolled further forward, ambushing German patrols. The British artillery barrage began at and the German counter-barrage was slow to begin, falling mostly behind the attacking waves. The creeping barrage moved at a very slow rate of in ten minutes through the waste of mud and shell-holes. The attack was made in two bounds towards Schaap Baillie. North of the railway the advance veered slightly towards the railway embankment, to avoid a German strong-point which caused many casualties, losing touch with the Guards Division as it did.
South of the railway, astride the Broombeek and Watervlietbeek, several farm strong-points, pillboxes and shell-hole positions were overrun, as the infantry were able to keep up close to the slow barrage; German occupants of a strong-point surrendered to three men and a box of pigeons. The first objective was reached by despite a number of German reinforcements arriving through the British artillery barrages, to join the front garrisons. The final objective was reached at and a defensive flank was thrown back from Memling Farm at the final objective on the right flank, to meet troops on the left of the 4th Division who occupied the new line, bent back from Memling Farm towards Requette farm, north of Poelcappelle at the junction with the 18th Division, which had been held back by fire from Poelcappelle. By noon the advance was complete, had been taken and no German counter-attack followed, resistance being limited to a small amount of rifle fire. That night the division co-operated with the Guards on the left to close a gap north of the railway line.
Troops of the Guards Division moved up on the night of 11 October through heavy rain and a German gas barrage (Operation ) which caused many casualties in this part of the front. The British creeping barrage began at in rain that lasted all day and although "ragged", the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance, took the higher ground on the edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running north-east from Veldhoek. Touch with the 17th Division was lost on the right, as the contact aircraft observing the advance failed to see the left flank formation of the 17th Division veer to the right. After dark the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap by capturing German pillboxes at Angle Point and Aden House. On 13 October the Guards Division patrolled vigorously against German opposition, which was limited to extensive sniping.
Air operations.
Low-altitude machine-gun and bomb attacks were made by ; and counter-attack patrols were flown and were made to engage German machine-gun nests, troops, artillery and transport. At German troops were seen by air observers east and south-east of Passchendaele village and bombarded by British artillery. No big German counter-attacks ensued, although this was felt to be because of the success of the German front-holding divisions. batteries were engaged for destruction and neutralisation. Four bombing raids on encampments and railway stations were flown, eight reconnaissance flights were made beyond the battlefront and in twelve dogfights British squadrons lost fourteen aircraft; five crew members returned wounded.
German Fourth Army counter-attacks.
The 18th Division held the line opposite Poelcappelle and retained most of its area but needed all of its reserves and incurred considerable casualties. The German command considered that the Allied advance in the north was less dangerous than that towards , between Passchendaele and Drogenbroodhoek. One division was moved to Morslede and another to the area between Westrozebeke and Stadenberg, either side of Passchendaele.
Aftermath.
Analysis.
The German defence on 12 October was more effective than expected, although the 195th Division at Passchendaele had so many casualties () from that it had to be relieved by the 238th Division. Ludendorff changed his mind about the prospect of retaining Passchendaele Ridge, believing that the British had only fourteen days before the weather made attacks impossible and ordered Rupprecht to stand fast. At a conference on 18 October, Hermann von Kuhl advocated a retreat as far to the east as possible; Sixt von Armin the Fourth Army commander and his chief of staff, Colonel Fritz von Lossberg preferred to fight to hold their remaining defences in and , because the ground beyond the Passchendaele watershed was untenable, even in winter.
The British attack was costly for both sides and captured more ground than the attack of 9 October, the British taking more than . British artillery support was inadequate, due the amount of field artillery out of action and the vast increase in mud, which smothered high-explosive shell-detonations. The weather from also prevented counter-battery fire and little was achieved by the heavier guns. On 13 October it was decided to stop the offensive until better weather returned and roads and tracks had been repaired, to ensure that deliberate attacks with a greater quantity of artillery support could be resumed. Operations were to continue to reach a suitable line for the winter and to keep German attention on Flanders, to help the French attack due on 23 October and the Third Army operation south of Arras due in mid-November (the Battle of Cambrai). The Canadian Corps relieved the II Anzac Corps on 18 October, in the depression between Gravenstafel Ridge and the heights at Passchendaele. The captured ground made a slightly better starting line for the Second Battle of Passchendaele, which began on 26 October.
Casualties.
Ludendorff divided the Third Battle of Ypres into five periods. In the ""Fourth Battle of Flanders"", from he described German "wastage" as "extraordinarily high". Hindenburg claimed later that he waited with great anxiety for the wet season. In "Der Weltkrieg" (1942) the German Official Historians recorded including for the period The 4th Australian Division lost and the 3rd Australian Division . From the German 195th Division lost casualties. There were , being killed or mortally wounded and stranded in no-man's-land. Calculations of German losses by J. E. Edmonds, the British Official Historian have been severely criticised ever since for adding 30% to German casualty figures, to account for different methods of calculation. The New Zealand Memorial to the Missing at Tyne Cot commemorates New Zealanders killed during the Battle of Broodseinde and the First Battle of Passchendaele, who have no known grave. The death toll made this the blackest day in New Zealand history.
Subsequent operations.
On 14 October a German attack captured a post on the IX Corps front in the 37th Division area. Next day patrols from the 9th Division (XVIII Corps) found Varlet Farm occupied. After a bombardment, an attack at on 20 October by two battalions of the 18th Division reached a German headquarters west of Poelcappelle church. On 21 October, wire-cutting began on the Fifth and Second Army fronts; under cover of the bombardment, 18th Division platoons moved forward on the night of 21 October and dug shallow trenches, which saved many casualties from a German counter-bombardment, after a ruined farm behind the jumping-off places caught fire and silhouetted the troops during a gas bombardment. On 22 October, in the British 9th Division sector to the south, the XVIII Corps Cyclist Battalion conducted a feint, using dummy figures to assist an attack by the 9th Division, which captured the Brewery strong-point quickly. The attack was resumed at through the village, taking Noble's Farm, Meunier House and then Tracas Farm, a total advance of . At A German counter-attack was stopped short of Noble's Farm with many casualties. In the XIV Corps area, two brigades of the 34th Division attacked at , the right brigade taking their objectives and Requette Farm in the 18th Division area. The left brigade advanced until close to a row of pillboxes, which were thought to have been captured and was cut down. Reinforcements were stopped at the Broombeek due to flooding and a heavy German barrage.
Next to the 35th Division the attack reached Six Roads, where covering fire was used as the troops to the right tried to outflank the pillboxes but uncut wire stopped the attack; a counter-attack then forced them back to the east of Egypt House. A two-brigade attack by the 35th Division was made at the same time. The right brigade reached the first objective easily, then the advance on the right was stopped by machine-gun fire. Further to the left Colombo House was captured and the final objective on Conter Drive was reached at Ground beyond Angle Point and Aden House was then taken. The left brigade captured Marechal Farm on its right flank but the attack in the centre was stopped by machine-gun fire, north west of Colombo House. On the left Panama House was captured and the final objective reached by A German counter-attack forced a retreat to the start line by one battalion but was then caught by British artillery fire and forced under cover.
On 21 October German positions from the Corverbeek to the Wallemolen Spur had been subjected to an intense bombardment of high-explosive, shrapnel and gas shell. A regiment of the French 1st Division prepared to attack on a front, as the Fifth Army on the right prepared for the main part of the operation. The evening was dry until after midnight, when it began to rain and a thick mist rose and it became impossible to see more than a few yards by the time the advance began just before on 22 October. Despite a drying wind for several days, the ground in most places was a morass.
The German 40th Division and elements of the 58th Division were opposite the French north of Mangelaere, where the French 1st Division had to capture a number of redoubts and the ruins of Jean Bart Farm. The preliminary French artillery bombardment was so effective, that the French objectives were quickly taken and the French joined in the attack east of Veldhoek, where they helped the British to reduce a number of pillboxes. Some resistance was encountered at Panama Farm, north-east of Veldhoek, which was soon overcome and with few casualties the French, often up to their waists in water, reached the fringes of Houthulst Forest, from the jumping-off point; the French captured two field guns and several prisoners. On the evening of 23 October the seventh German counter-attack since the operation began, was made at the junction of the French and British armies and was a costly failure, as was another counter-attack in the southern outskirts of Houthulst Forest on the evening of 24 October. In the operations at Poelcappelle by the 18th and 34th divisions and at Houthoulst Forest by the British 35th and French 1st Division, were taken; the Fifth Army had .

Thomas of Otterbourne

Thomas of Otterbourne is the name of two English medieval chroniclers, very often confused. The later Thomas wrote in the early 15th century and covers in detail the reign of Richard II of England, extending to 1420. The text was printed in 1732 by Thomas Hearne, with that of John Whethamstede. 
The earlier Thomas of Otterbourne was a Franciscan, active in the middle of the fourteenth century. The two were regarded as probably the same man by the "Dictionary of National Biography", but this view is rejected by Antonia Gransden, who tentatively identifies him as the rector in 1393 of Chingford. They are also regarded as different by the Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle.

Alf Ellaby

Alf Ellaby (born 24 November 1902, died in 1993) was an English rugby league footballer of the 1920s and '30s. A , he remains the English national team's all-time top try-scorer and became the highest try scorer in the game's history with 446 tries until overtaken by Brian Bevan in 1954. Also a Great Britain and Lancashire representative player, he was dubbed the "Hat-trick King", with 31 for his home-town club, St. Helens.
Ellaby was born in Liverpool. He was Liverpool's first rugby league superstar, who saw a promising Association football career with Rotherham United ended by a knee injury before going on to become a St. Helens legend. 
Ellaby set the club's record for most tries in a match with six on 5 March 1932. A record that has since been matched, but never broken. Ellaby scored 50 tries in the 1926–27 season and 280 in 289 matches.
Ellaby won caps for England while at St. Helens in 1927 against Wales, in 1928 against Wales (2 matches), in 1930 Other Nationalities, in 1931 against Wales, in 1932 against Wales (2 matches), and in 1934 against France. He also won caps for Great Britain in 1928 against Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (2 matches), in 1929 against Australia, 1930 against Australia, in 1932 Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (2 matches), in 1933 Australia.
Ellaby played in St. Helens' 1931–32 Lancashire League victory.
Due to being on the 1932 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, Ellaby and Albert Fildes did not play in St. Helens' 9–5 victory over Huddersfield in the 1931–32 Rugby Football League Championship final at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 7 May 1932.
Ellaby was transferred to Wigan in 1933 to help ease the club’s financial burden but returned to Knowsley Road to complete his fantastic career. In his debut for Wigan he scored a hat-trick of tries. While at Wigan in he played for England in 1935 against France.
Alf was, at various times, the landlord of the Veevers Arms and Ardwick Hotel in Blackpool, together with the George Hotel at Garforth, becoming a Director of Castleford for a spell. A member of the Saints’ Past Players’ Hall of Fame, he lived in Garforth until his death at the age of 90 in 1993. There was to be a final twist, however, quite befitting to one of the great sporting heroes of St.Helens. His ashes were taken home on the Saints ‘A’ Team coach after a match at Castleford and were later scattered on the pitch at his beloved Knowsley Road. 
It was no surprise when Alf was inducted into the Saints Greatest 17 in the autumn of 2010 and he was joined by Les Fairclough, his stand-off who had done so much to keep the threequarter line moving to provide Alf with so many of his scoring opportunities.

John Kewish, Jr. (died 1 August 1872) was the last person executed by the Isle of Man. He was convicted and executed for the crime of patricide.
Background.
Prior to his arrest John Kewish, Jr. lived on a farm with his elderly parents. He was the oldest of seven siblings and was unmarried. Kewish's father, John Kewish, Sr., was found dead in his home on 28 March 1872. Kewish, Jr., who had a history of crime including sheep stealing, was arrested and charged with patricide. He was described as being mentally disabled.
Depositions.
According to depositions the body was found the evening of 28 March by the victim's wife, Mary Kewish, and a neighbour. The following day the family moved the body, washed it, and prepared it for burial. It wasn't until 30 March that someone decided to contact the police. On 31 March a police doctor examined the body and noted six wounds (four on the back and two on the chest) which he felt were caused by three thrusts from a small pitchfork. Additionally Thomas Kewish, John Jr.'s brother, admitted there was an ongoing argument between John and his father. The police felt this was strong enough evidence to arrest John, Jr.
Trials.
Kewish was tried twice before a jury. At his first trial his only defence was that he had not committed the crime. After 14 hours of deliberation the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A new trial was ordered when the jury foreman became ill and deliberations were unable to continue. There is evidence that a majority of this first jury believed Kewish to be either innocent of the crime, or so simple minded as to not be responsible for the act. (According to one of the jurors, seven of the twelve believed he was not guilty.) At Kewish's second trial his advocates added the additional plea of not guilty by reason of insanity submitting that either he had not committed the crime or if he had, his mental disability freed him of responsibility. Insanity was later supported by an examining physician’s statement that Kewish's mind was unable to comprehend the moral “turpitude” of such a criminal act. After an hour's deliberation the jury convicted him of patricide. The presiding deemster, William Drinkwater, sentenced Kewish to the mandatory punishment of death by hanging.
Post-trial.
Although convicted, Kewish had the hope of receiving leniency from the British Government. The Lieutenant-Governor received several sworn statements intended to encourage leniency including from the jurors of the first trial, his examining physician, and others. Kewish's post-trial statements were inconsistent. At one point Kewish's gaoler stated that Kewish admitted he had accidentally shot his father and hid the weapon in the thatch of an outhouse (where a bird gun was later found). At other times Kewish repeated his claims of innocence and requested a free pardon. The pitchfork had not clearly been identified however the Home Secretary advised the Queen that he could not recommend mercy. He felt the crime was premeditated, committed from greed, and added that neither the deemster nor the jury had recommended mercy at the trial.
Manx law at the time required the British Crown to order the execution by positive act. Queen Victoria was displeased with this which she indicated in a letter to the Home Secretary. He apologised and promised to bring Manx law into compliance with that of England which did not require such an order. Although expressing personal doubts about the case, she took his advice and indicated that the execution was to proceed.
Execution.
Locally there was reluctance in becoming involved in the execution. Craftsmen initially refused to build the gallows and an executioner, Calcraft, had to be brought over from England to carry out the sentence. Kewish was hanged in Castle Rushen at Castletown on 1 August 1872 and he is buried there. It was the only non-public execution that took place under Manx law.
Aftermath.
After the execution, Queen Victoria was petitioned to put an end to the death penalty. She declined, and it wasn't until 1993 that Tynwald abolished capital punishment in the Isle of Man. Five people were sentenced to death (for murder) on the island between 1973 and 1992 but all death sentences after Kewish's were commuted to life imprisonment by the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom using the Crown's Prerogative of Mercy.

Samuel Rayan

Samuel Rayan (born 23 July 1920) is an Indian Jesuit theologian. He was born on 23 July 1920 at Kumbalam in Kollam District, Kerala into a family of eight children (2 girls and 6 boys). In 1939 Rayan entered Jesuit order. He was ordained priest on March 24, 1955. 
Being a radical humanist, Rayan is convinced that the human person in community is the object of God's special love. Rayan speaks for care of the earth, concern for life and commitment to people.
Rayan's theologizing is deeply rooted in his life, his land and his commitment to Jesus. Born in and brought up in a village in Kerala, he devoted many years to the study of Malayalam literature. He mastered Sanskrit and is well read in Indian religions and philosophy.
According to Rayan theology is a reminder of the great demands of the Kingdom. For Rayan the central mission of the Christian faith is its insertion into the concrete and daily life of the people, especially of the most marginalized and oppressed members of the social body. As Rayan says, "Rice is for sharing, bread must be broken and given. Every bowl, every belly shall have its fill, to leave a single bowl unfilled is to rob history of its meaning; to grab many a bowl for myself is to empty history of God."
Rayan's God is a God of life and hope. He draws on the richness of India's great religious traditions and finds therein a deep respect for the human person and humanity, which is the core of his theology. His humanism can thus be called an Indian humanism. This humanism has at its heart a concern for social justice and the uplift of the poor and marginalized, without which religion in India would be mere empty rhetoric.
Two of his major works are: "Breath of Fire : The Holy Spirit: Heart of the Christian Gospel" (ISBN 0225662434 / 9780225662436 / 0-225-66243-4),"The Holy Spirit:Heart of the Gospel and Christian Hope", (ISBN 0883441888 / 9780883441886 / 0-88344-188-8).
Prof Kurien Kunnumpuram has been editing his collected works, which is being published.

Jaffray, British Columbia

Jaffray, British Columbia () is an unincorporated village in southeast British Columbia. As of the RDEK 2010 census, the population was 810 [http://www.rdek.bc.ca/index.htm], spread over a rural area of roughly 44 square kilometres.
History.
Jaffray was formerly a siding, depot and steam train water stop. In the early 1900s Robert Jaffray and several of his brothers worked at the local sawmills, eventually leaving and homesteading in Lacombe, Alberta, and even though some local people believed that Jaffray may have been named after the brothers, according to folklore, Jaffray had already been named by the time they came to the area. Frank Desrosier may have been the first resident to purchase land in the Jaffray town-site, purchasing District Lot 3055. In September 1900, Robert Elmsby received a crown grant on D.L. 3543, obtaining for two hundred dollars, which consists of what is now most of Jaffray proper.
Since the first residents settled in, Jaffray has had four hotels, including the Jaffray Hotel, the Henderson's Hotel, Desrosier's Hotel and the Pearson Hotel. Historical general stores included Anthony Modigh's General Store, Economy Corner Store, and the present Jaffray General Store.
Fire Protection.
In September 1995, the Regional District of East Kootenay, with the direction of founding Fire Chief John Betenia and community approval of RDEK bylaw opened the Jaffray Volunteer Fire Department with 31 volunteer firefighter trainees. The department has expanded considerably since inception and now includes a rescue team with First Responder Level III status. [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jaffray-Volunteer-Fire-Department/190452217655044]
Notable residents.
The following notable people come from or were born near Jaffray:
Geography.
Jaffray is located near the beautiful Steeples and Lizard Mountains, not far from Lake Koocanusa, found on Highway 3 and 93, northwest of the Elko's Highway 93 junction, just north of the Canadian/United States border at Rooseville, BC. This portion of the Rocky Mountain Trench is relatively flat, with open woodland and grasslands. The area is very popular for its great recreational opportunities.
Education.
This East Kootenay village is home to the Jaffray Elementary Junior Secondary School, which has over 200 students from Jaffray and surrounding communities [http://jess.sd5.bc.ca]. This public school is run by School District 5 Southeast Kootenay.

Chabařovice Lake

Chabařovice Lake (), also known as "Milada", is a reservoir in the Czech Republic. It originated from excavation by an old coal mine and flooded former villages, Hrbovice, Tuchomyšl and Vyklice. The lakes surface area stretchs 250 ha, which makes it slightly smaller than the nearby Machas Lake. Its average depth is 15.5 meters and its maximum depth is 22 m. The capacity is approximately 35 mil. m3.
Water mode.
In 1998, the mining of brown coal in Chabařovice ceased and the quarry was closed. Recultivation work started subsequently. Formerly, the Chabařovice quarry was the first of large surface mines within the Czech Republic in which redevelopment and reclamation works, after termination of mining, came to the stage when remnant den was filled with the water. It became a model for other localities.
The watering has been in progress since 15 June 2001. The reservoir is the second largest reclaimed lake within northern Czech Republic. The recultivation is based on the hydric system, concretely the watering. The maximum watering speed is 700 l/s and is processed by a water relief from Kateřina reservoir. At the present time some land is being prepared for investment and the area is being opened to the public. Mild local climate change is expected in the direct surroundings following the creation of the lake, such as an increase in fogs, less dustiness and temperature stabilization.
The water quality is one of the key criteria, which is monitored and will be helpful for projection of the hydric recultivation in another region.
Utilization.
The lake will be partly used for recreational purposes. 
In 2006 originated the Association of five communes called Jezero Milada (Lake Milada). These five communes are Ústí nad Labem, Chabařovice, Trmice, Řehlovice and Modlany. The financial resources of the Association and the municipality Ústí nad Labem were used on setting out the Cycling path 3009. Cycling path with marking 3009 was opened in 2006 and it goes through the territory of outside dump of the mine with line up to Habří and Řehlovice. In Chabařovice it connects the already built cycling path KČT (Club of Czech Tourists) with the same marking, then it goes around lake, diverges across paths in the area and finally it leads to Stadice. Here it lines-up cycling path of Přemysl Oráč (no. 3071), which leads to Trmice or the other direction to Úpořiny.
Future utilization as recreational and sporting area – bathing, swimming, fishing, sailing, bike route, roller skating, jogging, horse riding etc..

<doc id="18841364" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18841364" title="IP in IP">
IP in IP

IP in IP is an IP tunneling protocol that encapsulates one IP packet in another IP packet. To encapsulate an IP packet in another IP packet, an outer header is added with codice_1, the entry point of the tunnel and the codice_2 point, the exit point of the tunnel. While doing this, the inner packet is unmodified (except the codice_3 field, which is decremented). The codice_4 and the codice_5 fields should be copied to the outer packet. If the packet size is greater than the codice_6, the packet is fragmented in the encapsulator, as the outer header should be included. The decapsulator will reassemble the packet.
IP Packet encapsulated in IP Packet.
Outer IP header have the following fields:
Version: 4 bitsThis field is the Protocol version number. It is always 4 as IP in IP is supported for IPv4
Header Length: 4 bits
This field is the length of outer IP header
Type of Service (TOS): 8 bits
This field is copied from the inner IP header
Total Length: 16 bits
This field is the length of the encapsulated IP header (including Outer IP header, Inner IP header, IP Payload)
Identification: 16 bits
This field is used to identify the fragments of a datagram which will be helpful while reassembling the datagrams as encapsulator might fragment the datagram. For the outer IP header a new number is generated.
Flags: 3 bits
R: 1 bit
This bit is reserved and should be 0.
DF: 1 bit
This field specifies whether the datagram can be fragmented or not. If this bit is set to 1 in the inner header, then the outer header also have this bit set to 1 saying that this datagram cannot be fragmented. If this bit is set to 0 in the inner header, then the outer header may set to 0/1.
MF: 1 bit
This field is required when the datagram is fragmented saying whether the datagram contains some more fragments. This field is not copied from inner header. 
Fragment Offset: 13 bits
This field is used while reassembling the fragments.
Time To Live (TTL): 8 bits
This field is used to track the lifetime of the datagram. The inner header TTL is decremented before encapsulation and is not changed in decapsulator. The outer header TTL is set to value such that the datagram is delivered to tunnel end point.
Protocol: 8 bits
This field indicates the next protocol following this datagram. The value is set to 4. Most cases the protocol will be IPv4 unless there is some additional headers for encapsulated packet.
Header Checksum: 16 bits
This field is the IP checksum of outer header.
Source IP Address: 32 bits
This field is the IP address of the encapsulator
Destination IP Address: 32 bits
This field is the IP address of the decapsulator
Options: Variable length
This field in general is NOT copied from the inner IP header. New options can be added.
Padding. Variable length.
This field is used to fill the datagram so that IP Payload starts on a 32 bit boundary.
Handling ICMP Messages.
After sending a datagram, there may be chances of encapsulator getting ICMP messages from intermediate nodes. The encapsulator takes action for ICMP message depending on the Type and Code of the ICMP messages. The following are the ICMP messages with Type and Code as well as the action taken by the encapsulator: 
Handling Tunnel Loops.
Loops may occurs within a tunnel due to the following reasons:
In both the cases, the router MUST NOT tunnel datagram. Instead it should discard the datagram.
Tunnel Management.
For ICMP messages intermediate routers return 64 bits of the datagram beyond the IP header which is not enough to copy Inner header. So the encapsulator will not be able to relay the appropriate message to the original sender. But this can be handled by maintaining the soft state of the tunnel. The soft state information maintained by the tunnel includes the following:

Louis Freeland Post

Louis Freeland Post (November 15, 1849 - January 11, 1928) was the Assistant United States Secretary of Labor during the closing year of the Wilson administration, the period of the Palmer Raids and the Red Scare, where he had responsibility for the Bureau of Immigration.
Biography.
Post opposed immigration restrictions and forcefully supported free speech and Henry George's single-tax movement. He once called George's political philosophy "my kind of radicalism...which regards the social values of natural resources as in their nature public property." He became an Assistant Secretary of Labor in 1913, a position he held until the end of the Wilson administration in March, 1921. 
Early in March 1920, the temporary absence of Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson and the recent resignation of the Department's Solicitor General made Post the Department's Acting Secretary and the key person responsible for the Bureau of Immigration for two critical months. He directed the review of all deportation cases and often opposed the activities of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the Justice Department's "Radical Division," soon renamed the General Intelligence Division. In 1919, in response to anarchist terror bombings, Hoover's agents penetrated many violent revolutionary groups and identified their members. In January 1920, Palmer and Hoover oversaw the Palmer Raids designed to arrest those members who were not U.S. citizens and deport them. 
The Anarchist Exclusion Act of 1918 set the standard for such deportations. It specified that "aliens who are members of or affiliated with any organization that entertains a belief in, teaches, or advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States or of all forms of law" were subject to deportation. Post, often with the support of Secretary Wilson, distinguished carefully among those arrested, for example, determining that membership in the Communist Labor Party was not grounds for deportation because it did not meet the legal standard that other organizations with similar names did meet, like the Communist Party of America. By April 10, Post had reviewed a backlog of 1600 cases and dismissed 71% of them. Some had been held for as long as two months for having attended a meeting of a radical group. Post also determined that aliens were entitled to a fair hearing, which was contrary to the position of the Bureau of Immigration, which held that immigrants were not subject to constitutional safeguards. Overall, Post is credited with preventing many deportations and freeing many innocent people. He also declined to take action against those he called "harmless but technically culpable." Some had in good faith resigned from a proscribed organization. Others only became "members" of such an organization when organizations merged, as often happened. On the other hand, he authorized the deportation of anarchists even "of the extreme pacifist type," because he thought the law required that.
As early as January 1920, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began compiling a file on Post and his political leanings, but failed to find substantive evidence of radical connections on his part. Nevertheless, the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization compiled a sensational report of Post's deportation decisions, When it leaked, the press made much of the affair, what Post later called "a newspaper cyclone of misrepresentation," though some coverage supported him. Some Congressmen traded speeches on his culpability, Committee Chairman Albert Johnson of Washington state attacking Post, and Congressman George Huddleston of Alabama defending him. On April 15, 1920, Kansas Congressman Homer Hoch accused Post of having abused his power and called for his impeachment. The House Committee on Rules planned to ask the President to remove Post instead of impeaching him, so Post requested and was granted a chance to testify. He successfully defended his actions on May 7–8, attacking Attorney General Palmer and others. In a dramatic exchange, Congressman Edward W. Pou, a Democratic supporter of the anti-radical campaign, praised Post's actions–"I believe you have followed your sense of duty absolutely"–and left the room in stunned silence. The Rules Committee took no further action.
After the Attorney General had spent 2 days reading a statement in his defense, the "New York Evening Post" gave Post the victory:
The American Legion later sought Post's dismissal in a letter to President Wilson on December 31, 1920. The White House responded with a letter quoting Labor Secretary Wilson who endorsed Post's actions, detailed the Constitutional principles that guided him, and praised his adherence to Department policies: "We will not deport anyone simply because he has been accused or because he is suspected of being a Red. We have no authority to do so under the law...Mr. Post...I am satisfied ranks among the ablest and best administrative officers in the Government service." 
In retirement in 1923, he published "The Deportations Delirium of Nineteen-Twenty: A Personal Narrative of an Historic Official Experience", a detailed account of the raids, arrests, and deportations of 1919-20. He called the entire effort "a stupendous and cruel fake". He asserted that his actions had been vindicated with the passage of time, that "no substantially erroneous decision of mine has yet been specified. Most certainly and without qualification may this be said of my cancellation decisions, and it was for these alone that my official fidelity was clamorously questioned... Every attempt to show even one erroneous cancellation decision has utterly failed." 
Post died on January 11, 1928 at Homeopathic Hospital in Washington, DC after a brief illness. The "New York Times" reported that he had been a lawyer and editor, noted his early advocacy of a single tax.

<doc id="18841429" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18841429" title="Gu (poison)">
Gu (poison)

Gu () or jincan (; lit. "gold silkworm") was a venom-based poison associated with cultures of south China, particularly Nanyue. The traditional preparation of "gu" poison involved sealing several venomous creatures (e.g., centipede, snake, scorpion) into a closed utensil, where they devoured one another and allegedly concentrated their toxins into a single survivor. "Gu" was used in black magic practices such as manipulating sexual partners, creating malignant diseases, and causing death. According to Chinese folklore, a "gu" spirit could transform into various animals, typically a worm, caterpillar, snake, frog, dog, or pig.
Names.
Circa 14th-century BCE Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions recorded the name "gu", while 7th-century CE Tang Dynasty texts first used "jincan" "gold silkworm".
Gu.
The term "gu" 蠱, says Loewe (1990:191), "can be traced from the oracle bones until modern times, and has acquired a large number of meanings or connotations". Before discussing "gu", it is necessary to introduce the related word "chong" 蟲 "wug".
"Chong" or (originally a "snake; worm" pictogram) "insect; bug; pest; worm; spider; amphibian; reptile; dragon; etc." denotes a Chinese folk taxonomy lacking an adequate English translation equivalent. Carr (1983:7) proposes translating "chong" as ""wug"" – Brown's (1979) portmanteau word (from "worm" + "bug") bridging the lexical gap for the linguistically widespread "class of miscellaneous animals including insects, spiders, and small reptiles and amphibians". Contrast the Wug test for investigating language acquisition of plurals in English morphology. Note that "wug" will translate "chong" below.
The Traditional Chinese character and the Simplified for "gu" "demonic poison" are "wugs inside in a container" ideograms that combine "chong" or "wug" and "min" "jar; cup; dish; utensil". Early written forms of "gu" 蠱 range from (ca. 14th-11th centuries BCE) Oracle bone script to (ca. 3rd century BCE) Seal script characters. The Oracle characters had two or one 虫 "wug" elements inside a container, while the Seal characters had three. Shima's (1958:386) concordance of oracle bone inscriptions lists 23 occurrences of "gu" written with two wugs and 4 with one; many contexts are divinations about sickness. Marshall (2001:129) concludes, "The oracle-bone character of "gu" is used to refer to the evil power of the ancestors to cause illness in the living."
Jincan.
"Jincan" 金蠶 "gold silkworm/caterpillar" is a "gu" synonym first recorded in the Tang Dynasty. Li Xian's (7th century) commentary to the "Hou Han Shu" uses "jincan" as the name of a funerary decoration cast from gold, and the (9th century) author Su E 蘇鶚 describes it as a legendary golden-color caterpillar from Kashmir.
Eberhard (1968:149-150, cf. 153) connects "gu", "jincan", and other love charms with the Duanwu Festival that occurs on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Chinese calendar, which is "the theoretical apogee of summer heat" (Groot 1910 5:851).
Among the Miao on the fifth of the fifth month poisonous animals were put into a pot and allowed to devour each other, and they were called 'gold-silkworms'. The more people were killed by the "ku", the richer the "ku"s owner became. In our time the normal term for "ku" has been 'gold-silkworm'. These animals can make gold. It was typical for the gold-silkworm that people continued to feed this animal in the pot, that humans had to be sacrificed to it, that the animal kept the house clean and worked for its master like a brownie, but that it caused harm to its master if he did not provide proper sacrifices. 
"For centuries, the Miao, particularly Miao women", writes Schein (2000:50-51), "have been feared for their mastery of the so-called "gu" poison, which is said to inflict death from a distance with excruciating slowness."
Groot (1910 5:854) quotes a Song Dynasty description.
a gold caterpillar is a caterpillar with a gold colour, which is fed with silk from Shuh (Szĕ-ch‘wen). Its ordure, put in food or drink, poisons those who take it, causing certain death. It can draw towards a man the possessions of such victims, and thus make him enormously rich. It is extremely difficult to get rid of it, for even water, fire, weapons or swords can do it no harm. Usually the owner for this purpose puts some gold or silver into a basket, places the caterpillar also therein, and throws the basket away in a corner of the street, where someone may pick it up and take it with him. He is then said to have given his gold caterpillar in marriage. 
The "Bencao Gangmu" (tr. Groot 1910 5:850-851) quotes Cai Dao 蔡絛's (12th century) "Tieweishan congtan" 鐵圍山叢談 that "gold caterpillars first existed" in the Shu region (present-day Sichuan), and "only in recent times did they find their way into" Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guanxi. It also quotes (tr. Groot 1910 5:853-854) the Tang Dynasty pharmacologist Chen Cangqi (713-741 CE) that:
ashes of old flowered silk are a cure for poison of "ku" of insects or reptiles which eat such silk. His commentator adds, that those insects are coiled up like a finger-ring, and eat old red silk and flowered silk, just as caterpillars eat leaves; hence, considered in the light of the present day, those insects are gold caterpillars. 
Gu Meanings.
The "Hanyu Da Zidian" dictionary defines 9 "gu" 蠱 meanings, plus the rare reading "ye" 蠱 "bewitchingly pretty; seductive; coquettish" [妖艷].
The (early 4th century BCE) "Zuozhuan" commentary to the (ca. 6th-5th centuries BCE) "Chunqiu" history provides an ancient example of 蠱's polysemy. It records four "gu" meanings – 2.5 "grain which (molders and) flies away", 2.6 "insanity", 2.7 "delusion and disorder", and 2.9 "same name" – in a 541 BCE story (昭公1, tr. Legge 1872:580-581) about a physician named He 和"Harmony" from Qin explaining "gu" to the ruler of Jin.
The marquis of asked the help of a physician from [Qin, and the earl sent one to see him, who said, "The disease cannot be cured, according to the saying that when women are approached, the chamber disease becomes like insanity. It is not caused by Spirits nor by food; it is that delusion which has destroyed the mind. Your good minister will [also die; it is not the will of Heaven to preserve him." The marquis said, "May women (then) not be approached?" The physician replied, "Intercourse with them must be regulated." … Meng (further) asked what he meant by ‘insanity’; and (the physician) replied, “I mean that which is produced by the delusion and disorder of excessive sensual indulgence. Look at the character; – it is formed by the characters for a vessel and for insects (蠱 = 皿 and 蟲). It is also used of grain which (molders and) flies away. In the ["Yijing"], (the symbols of) a woman deluding a young man, (of) wind throwing down (the trees of) a mountain, go by the same name (蠱; ☶ under ☴): all these point to the same signification." Meng pronounced him a good physician, gave him large gifts, and sent him back to . 
Abdominal wug poisoning.
The "poisoning from abdominal wugs" or "abdominal parasites" meaning 2.1 first appears in the (121 CE) "Shuowen Jiezi" dictionary, cf. 2.3 below. It defines "gu" 蠱 as 腹中蟲也, literally "stomach middle wug", (tr. Loewe 1970:192) "insects within the stomach". However, Duan Yucai's (1815 CE) commentary construes this definition as "afflicted by abdominal wugs"; and explains that instead of the usual readings "zhōng" 中 "middle; center; interior" and "chóng" 蟲 "wug", both terms should be read in entering tone, namely "zhòng" 中 "hit (a target); be hit by" and "zhòng" 蟲 "wug bites". 
Cultivated poisonous wug.
The second "gu" meaning "anciently recorded type of artificially cultured poisonous wug" names the survivor of several venomous creatures enclosed in a container, and transformed into a type of demon or spirit.
The "Zhouli" ritual text (秋官司寇, tr. Groot 1910 5:826) describes a Shushi 庶氏 official who, "was charged with the duty of exterminating poisonous "ku", attacking this with spells and thus exorcising it, as also with the duty of attacking it with efficacious herbs; all persons able to fight "ku" he was to employ according to their capacities." Zheng Xuan's commentary explains "dugu" 毒蠱 "poisonous "gu"" as "wugs that cause sickness in people".
Dismembered sorcerer's ghost.
"Gu" meaning 2.3 "ghost of a person whose decapitated head was impaled on a stake" refers to the severe Han Dynasty "dismemberment (as tortuous capital punishment)" for criminals convicted of practicing "gu"-sorcery (see 2.6). Groot (1910 5:840) "Plate VI, Punishment of Cutting Asunder" provides a gruesome illustration. The "Zhouli" commentary of Zheng Xuan (cf. 2.2, tr. Loewe 1970:195) notes, "Those who dare to poison people with "ku" or teach others to do it will be publicly executed".
Eberhard (1968:152) says "gu", "was also the soul of a dead person whose head had been pitted on a pole. This, too, fits later reports, in so far as the souls of "ku" victims often are mentioned as servants of the master of "ku", if not "ku" itself served the master."
The "Shuowen Jiezi" (cf. 2.1 above, tr. Loewe 1970:195) also defines "gu" as "the spirits of convicted criminals whose heads had been exposed on stakes." This specialized torture term "niejie" 臬磔 combines "nie" "target" (which pictures a person's 自 "nose" on a 木 "tree; wooden stand") and "jie" 磔 "dismemberment". Compare the character for "xian" 縣 "county; district" that originated as a "place where dismembered criminals were publicly displayed" pictograph of an upside-down 首 "head" hanging on a 系 "rope" tied to a 木 "tree". 
Groot (1910 5:828) suggests this meaning of "gu", "seems to reveal to us a belief that such a soul, roaming restlessly about because of its corpse being mutilated, must be avenging itself on the living by settling in their intestines in the shape of the same maggots and grubs which gnaw away its decaying head."
Unschuld (1985:49-50) provides historical perspective.
As the legal measures of individual dynasties demonstrate, administrative officials viewed ku as a reality, as late as the nineteenth century. The primary host was considered a criminal; a person guilty of the despicable act of preparing and administering ku poison was executed, occasionally with his entire family, in a gruesome manner. In addition to the obvious desire to punish severely criminal practices that could result in the death of the victim, it is possible that Confucian distaste for the accumulation of material goods, and above all for the resulting social mobility, contributed to this attitude. Indeed, the penalties of the use of ku poison appear to have been more severe than those for other forms of murder. 
Heat miasma.
The fourth meaning of "evil heat and noxious "qi" that harms humans" refers to allegedly sickness-causing emanations of tropical miasma. "There was also an ancient belief that "ku" diseases were induced by some sort of noxious mist or exhalation", writes Schafer (1967:102), "just as it was also believed that certain airs and winds could generate worms".
The "Shiji" (秦本紀, tr. Groot 1910 5:827) records that in 675 BCE, Duke De 德公 of Qin "suppressed "ku" at the commencement of the hottest summer-period by means of dogs. According to commentators, these animals were for the purpose butchered and affixed to the four gates of the capital." The Tang Dynasty commentary of Zhang Shoujie 張守節 explains "gu" as "hot, poisonous, evil, noxious "qi" that harms people". Displaying "gu" dogs at city gates reflects meaning 2.3 above.
Besides shapeshifting "gu" spirits usually appearing as wugs, classical texts record other animal forms. The (ca. 350 CE) "Soushenji" "In Search of the Supernatural" (tr. Groot 1910 5:846-847) says,
In P‘o-yang (in the north of the present Kiangsi pr.) one Chao Shen kept canine "ku". Once, when he was called on by Ch‘en Ch‘en, six or seven big yellow dogs rushed out at this man, all at once barking at him. And when my paternal uncle, on coming home, had a meal with Chao Sheu’s wife, he spit blood, and was saved from death in the nick of time by a drink prepared from minced stalks of an orange-tree. "Ku" contains spectral beings or spectres, which change their spectral shapes into those of beings of various kinds, such as dogs or swine, insects or snakes, their victims thus never being able to know what are their real forms. When they are put into operation against people, those whom they hit or touch all perish. Tsiang Shi, the husband of my wife’s sister, had a hired work-man in employ, who fell sick and passed blood. The physician opined that he was stricken by "ku", and secretly, without informing him of it, strewed some "jang-ho" root under his sleeping-mat. The patient then madly exclaimed: "The ku which devours me is ceasing to spread"; and then he cried: "It vanishes little by little." The present generations often make use of "jang-ho" root to conquer "ku", and now and then it has a good effect. Some think it is ‘the efficacious herb’, mentioned in the "Cheu li" 
This "ranghe" 蘘荷 "myoga ginger" is a renowned antidote to "gu" poisoning, see below.
The "Shanhaijing" (南山經, tr. Birrell 2000:4) says the meat of a mythical creature on Mount Greenmound prevents miasmic "gu" poisoning, "There is an animal on this mountain that looks like a fox, but has nine tails. It makes a noise like a baby. It can devour humans. Whoever eats it will not be affected by malign forces." The commentary of Guo Pu notes this creature's meat will make a person immune to the effects of supernatural "qi".
A Tang Dynasty account of Nanyue people (tr. Schafer 1967:102) describes "gu" miasma:
The majority are diseased, and "ku" forms in their bloated bellies. There is a vulgar tradition of making "ku" from a concentration of the hundred kinds of crawling creatures, for the purpose of poisoning men. But probably it is the poisonous crawlers of that hot and humid land which produce it – not just the cruel and baleful nature of the householders beyond the mountain passes. 
Wug pest.
The "wug pest that eats grain" or "grain that transforms into wugs" meaning 2.5 is seen above in the "Zuozhuan" explanation of "gu" as "grain which (molders and) flies away". The (ca. 3rd century BCE) "Erya" dictionary (6/21) defines "gu" 蠱 as pests in "kang" 糠 "chaff", written with the phonetic loan character "kang" 康 "healthy". The (ca. 543 CE) "Yupian" dictionary defines "gu" as "longstanding grain that transforms into flying insects".
Groot (1910 5:827) connects this "gu" "grain pest" meaning with 2.1 "internal parasites" and 2.7 "debauchery".
Thus the term "ku" also included the use of philtre-maggots by women desirous of exciting the lusts of men and attracting them into debauchery. And, evidently, "ku" was also used to destroy crops or food-stores, or, as the learned physician expressed it, to make the corn fly away, perhaps in the form of winged insects born therein; indeed, the character for "ku" is regularly used in literature to denote devastating grubs and insects, including internal parasites of the human body, which exercise a destructive influence like poison. 
Sorcery.
"Gu" meaning 2.6 "sorcery that harms humans" or "cast damaging spells" is exemplified in the Modern Standard Chinese words "wugu" 巫蠱 (with "shaman") "sorcery; art of casting spells" and "gudu" 蠱毒 (with "poison") "a venomous poison (used in Traditional Chinese medicine); enchant and injure; cast a harmful spell over". 
"Gu"-sorcery allegedly resulted in a debilitating psychological condition, often involving hallucinations. The "Zuozhuan" (宣公8, tr. Legge 1872:302) records that in 601 BCE, Xu Ke 胥克 of Jin was discharged from office because he had "gu", "an illness which unsettled his mind". The Qing Dynasty philologist Yu Yue 俞樾 etymologically connects this meaning of "gu" 蠱 with "gu" 痼 "chronic, protracted (illness)". "Guji" 蠱疾 "insanity; derangement; condition caused by excessive sexual activities" is a comparable word.
The "Hanshu" provides details of "wugu"-sorcery scandals and dynastic rivalries in the court of Emperor Wu (r. 141-87 BCE), which Schafer (1967:103) calls "notorious dramas of love and death".
This early Chinese history (tr. Loewe 1970:169) records that in 130 BCE, a daughter of Empress Chen Jiao (who was unable to bear a son) was accused of practicing "wugu" and "maigu" 埋蠱 "bury a witchcraft charm a victim's path or dwelling" (cf. voodoo doll). The "empress was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed"; specifically (tr. Groot 1910 5:828) "their heads were all exposed on stakes" (cf. 2.3). This history claims "wu" 巫 "shamans" from Yue conducted the "gu" magic, which Eberhard (1968:152) notes, "seems to have consisted, at least in part, of magic human figures buried under the road which the emperor, the intended victim, was supposed to take".
Accusations of practicing "wugu"-magic were central to the 91 BCE ("Wugu zhi huo" 巫蠱之禍) attempted coup against crown prince Liu Ju by Jiang Chong 江充 and Su Wen 蘇文. The "Hanshu" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836) claims that, "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!"
Traditional Chinese law strictly prohibited practicing "gu"-sorcery. For instance, during the reign of Tang Empress Wu Zetian, Schafer (1967:103) says,
the possession of "ku" poison, like the casting of horoscopes, was cause for official suspicion and action: At that time many tyrannical office holders would orders robbers to bury "ku" or to leave prophecies in a man's household by night. Then, after the passage of a month, they would secretly confiscate it. 
Seduce.
This "gu" meaning 2.7 of "seduce; bewitch; attract; confuse; mislead; bewilder" is evident in the Standard Chinese words "yaogu" 妖蠱 "bewitch by seductive charms", "gumei" 蠱媚 "bewitch/charm by sensual appeal", and "guhuo" 蠱惑 "confuse by magic; enchant; seduce into wrongdoing". ""Ku"-poisoning was also associated with demoniac sexual appetite – an idea traceable back to Chou times", says Schafer (1967:103), "This notion evidently had its origins in stories of ambiguous love potions prepared by the aboriginal women of the south.
The "Zuozhuan" (莊公28, tr. Legge 1872:115) uses "gu" in a story that in the 7th century BCE, Ziyuan 子元, the chief minister of Chu, "wished to seduce the widow" of his brother King Wen of Zhou. The "Mozi" (非儒下, tr. Mei 1929:208) uses "gu" to criticize Confucius, who "dresses elaborately and puts on adornments to mislead the people." The "Erya" (1B/49, cf. 2.5 above) defines "gu" 蠱, "chan" 諂 "doubt; flatter", and "er" 貳 "double-hearted; doubtful" as "yi" 疑 "doubt; suspect; fear; hesitate". Guo Pu's commentary suggests this refers to "gu" meaning "deceive; seduce".
Many later accounts specify women as "gu"-magic practitioners. Eberhard (1968:149) explains,
We know that among many aborigines of the south women know how to prepare love charms which were effective even at a distance. In these reports it was almost invariably stated that the love charm had a fatal effect if the man, to whom the charm was directed, did not return to the woman at a specified time. 
Affair.
The least-attested "gu" 蠱 meaning 2.8 of "affair; event" first appears in the (3rd century CE) "Guangya" dictionary, which defines "gu" as "shi" 事 "assignment; affair; event; thing; matter; trouble". 
The "Yijing" Gu hexagram (see 2.9) "Line Variations" repeatedly refer to parental "gu" with the enigmatic phrases 幹父之蠱 ""gan"-father's "gu"" and 幹母之蠱 ""gan"-mother's "gu"". Wang Niansun quotes an "Yijing" commentary that "gu" means "shi", and proposes "gu" 蠱 is a phonetic loan character for "gu" 故 "reason; cause; event; incident". Commentarial tradition takes "gan" 幹 "trunk; framework; do; work" to mean "chi" 飭 "put in order", and Richard Wilhelm (1967:75) translates "Setting right what has been spoiled by the father" and "Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother". Arthur Waley (1933:132) follows an ancient interpretation that "gan" 幹 is a variant Chinese character for "gan" 干 "stem; Celestial stem; day of the (10-day) week; involve", translating "stem-father's maggots" and "stem-mother's maggots", explaining
it is surely obvious that the maggots referred to are those which appeared in the flesh of animals sacrificed to the spirits of dead parents, who after their death were, for reasons of taboo, only known by the name of the day upon which they were born, being merely a fuller way of writing 'stem', 'day of the week'. 
Hexagram 18.
"Gu" 蠱 names the "Yì-Jīng" Hexagram 18, which is translated as "Destruction" (Z.D. Sung 1935), "Work on What Has Been Spoiled " (Richard Wilhelm 1967), "Decay" (John Blofeld 1965), "Degeneration" (Thomas Cleary 1986), "Poison, Destruction" (Wu Jing-Nuan 1991), and "Ills to Be Cured" (Richard John Lynn 1994). Wilhelm (1967:75) explains translating "decay" for 蠱.
The Chinese character "ku" represents a bowl in whose contents worms are breeding. This means decay. It has come about because the gentle indifference in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the upper, and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions embody a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram is not simply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled." 
"The Judgment" (tr. Wilhelm 1967:75): "WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED Has supreme success. It furthers one to cross the great water. Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days." "The Image" (tr. Wilhelm 1967:76) reads: "The wind blows low on the mountain: The image of DECAY. Thus the superior man stirs up the people, And strengthens their spirit." 
In the "Zuozhuan" (僖公15, tr. Legge 1872:167), divination of this Gu hexagram foretells Qin conquering Jin, "A lucky response; cross the Ho; the prince's chariots are defeated."
"Gu" techniques.
According to ancient "gu" traditions, explain Joseph Needham and Wang Ling (1956:136), "the poison was prepared by placing many toxic insects in a closed vessel and allowing them to remain there until one had eaten all the rest – the toxin was then extracted from the survivor." They note, "It is strange to think that this same method has been successfully employed in our own times for the isolation of strains of soil bacteria capable of attacking the tuberculosis bacillus".
Feng and Shryock (1935:1) describe contemporary practices of "gu". 
At present, "ku" is used primarily as a means of acquiring wealth; secondarily as a means of revenge. The method is to place poisonous snakes and insects together in a vessel until there is but one survivor, which is called the "ku". The poison secured from this "ku" is administered to the victim, who becomes sick and dies. The ideas associated with "ku" vary, but the "ku" is generally regarded as a spirit, which secures the wealth of the victim for the sorcerer. 
Eberhard (1968:152) summarizes "gu" practices.
The essence of "ku", then, was the magic charm that could be prepared out of the surviving animal in the pot. It could be used as a love charm with the object of forcing the loved male to come back to the woman. The "ku" could be used also as an evil magic with the object of obtaining subservient spirits. This was done by feeding it to unrelated persons who would either spit blood or whose stomachs would swell because of the food they had taken would become alive in their insides, and who would die as a result; similar to the gold-silkworms, their souls had to be servants of the owner of the "ku". 
The 4th-century "Soushenji" (cf. 2.4, tr. Feng and Shryock 1935:7) records that "gu" breeding was a profitable but dangerous profession in the Honan region.
In the province of Yung-yang, there was a family by the name of Liao. For several generations they manufactured "ku", becoming rich from it. Later one of the family married, but they kept the secret from the bride. On one occasion, everyone went out except the bride, who was left in charge of the house. Suddenly she noticed a large cauldron in the house, and on opening it, perceived a big snake inside. She poured boiling water into the cauldron and killed the snake. When the rest of the family returned she told them what she had done, to their great alarm. Not long after, the entire family died of the plague. 
Feng and Shryock (1935:11-12) describe how 20th-century Zhuang women in Guangxi elaborately produced "gu" during the Duanwu Festival (see "jincan" above).
"Ku" poison is not found generally among the people (i.e., the Chinese), but is used by the T'ung women. It is said that on the fifth day of the fifth month, they go to a mountain stream and spread new clothes and headgear on the ground, with a bowl of water beside them. The women dance and sing naked, inviting a visit from the King of Medicine (a tutelary spirit). They wait until snakes, lizards, and poisonous insects come to bathe in the bowl. They pour the water out in a shadowy, dark place. Then they gather the fungus which grows there, which they make into a paste. They put this into goose-feather tubes and hide them in their hair. The heat of their bodies causes worms to generate, which resemble newly-hatched silk-worms. Thus "ku" is produced. It is often concealed in a warm, dark place in the kitchen. The newly made "ku" is not yet poisonous. It is used as a love potion, administered in food and drink and called "love-medicine." Gradually the "ku" becomes poisonous. As the poison develops, the woman's body itches until she has poisoned someone. If there is no other opportunity, she will poison even her husband or her sons. But she possesses antidotes. It is believed that those who produce "ku" themselves become "ku" after death. The ghosts of those who have died from the poison become their servants. 
"Gu" remedies.
Groot (1910 5:861-869) and Eberhard (1968:152-3) detail numerous Chinese antidotes and cures for "gu" poison-magic. For instance (see 2.4), the "Shanhaijing" claimed eating a legendary creature's meat would prevent "gu" and the "Soushenji" prescribed "ranghe" 蘘荷 "myoga ginger". Unschuld (1985:47) says
Prescription literature was filled with antidotes. All known Chinese conceptual systems of healing dealt with the ku phenomenon and developed therapeutic strategies that were in accord with their basic principles. The Buddhists recommended prayers and conjurations, thus utilizing the same methods as practitioners of demonic medicine. In pharmaceutical literature, drugs of a plant, animal, or mineral origin were described as effective against ku poisoning. Adherents of homeopathic magic recommended the taking of centipedes, since it was known that centipedes consume worms. 
The "Zhou houbei jifang" 肘後備急方 (tr. Groot 1910 5:862), which is attributed to Ge Hong, describes "gu" diagnosis and cure with "ranghe":
A patient hurt by "ku" gets cutting pains at his heart and belly as if some living thing is gnawing there; sometimes he has a discharge of blood through the mouth or the anus. If he is not forthwith medically treated, it devours his five viscera, which entails his death. To discover whether it is "ku" or not, let the patient spit into water; if the spittle sinks, it is "ku"; if it floats, it is not. The recipe for discovering the name of the owner of the "ku" poison is as follows: take the skin of a drum, burn it, a small piece at a time, pulverize the ashes, and let the patient drink them with water; he will then forthwith mention the name; then bid this owner forthwith to remove the "ku", and the patient will recover immediately. Again place some "jang-ho" leaves secretly under the mattress of the patient; he will then of his own accord immediately mention the name of the owner of the "ku"
Many "gu"-poison antidotes are homeopathic, in Western terms. The 8th-century pharmacologist Chen Cangqi (tr. Groot 1910 5:866) explains using venomous creatures both to produce and cure "gu"-poison.
In general reptiles and insects, which are used to make "ku", are cures for "ku"; therefore, if we know what "ku" is at work, we may remedy its effects. Against "ku" of snakes that of centipedes should be used, against "ku" of centipedes that of frogs, against "ku" of frogs that of snakes, and so on. Those varieties of "ku", having the power of subduing each other, may also have a curative effect . 
Needham and Wang (1956:136) say prescribing "gu" poison as a cure or preventive suggests "that someone had stumbled on an immunisation process", and suggest scorpion-venom and centipede-venom as possible toxins.
Chen (tr. Schafer 1967:102, cf. Groot 1910 5:847) further describes catching and preparing medicine from the shapeshifting "gu" creature that,
… can conceal its form, and seem to be a ghost or spirit, and make misfortune for men. But after all it is only a reptile ghost. If one of them has bitten a person to death, it will sometimes emerge from one of that man's apertures. Watch and wait to catch it and dry it in the warmth of the sun; then, when someone is afflicted by the "ku", burn it to ashes and give him a dose of it. Being akin, to it, the one quite naturally subdues the other. 
Besides such homeopathic remedies, Schafer (1967:103) says one could, 
give "ku" derived from particularly venomous creatures to overcome that taken from less lethal creatures. Thus centipede "ku" could be overcome by frog "ku"; serpent "ku" would prevail over frog "ku", and so on. There were also soberer, though almost as powerful remedies: asafetida, python bile, civet, and a white substance taken from cock's dung were all used. It is not certain what real maladies these repellent drugs, cured, or seemed to cure. Probably they ranged from the psychosomatic to the virus-born. Many oedematous conditions were called "ku", and it has been plausibly suggested that some cases were caused by intestinal parasites (hence the constant worm motif). Others are attributable to fish poisons and arrow poisons concocted by the forest dwellers. 
Chinese folklore claims the definitive cure for "gu"-magic is passing it on to a greedy person. Eberhard (1968:153) says,
The most common way to get rid of the "ku" (just as of brownies and the golden-silkworm) was to give it away as a present. The actions of a man in Chang-chou (Fukien) are rather uncommon. He found on the ground a package containing three large silver bars wrapped in silk and in addition a "ku" which looked like a frog ("ha-ma"); in spite of the danger he took it; at night two large frogs appeared which he cooked and ate; on the next night more than ten smaller frogs appeared which he also ate up; and he continued consuming all frogs that kept appearing until the magic was cast off; in this fashion the man suffered no ill effects from the "ku" poison. 
From descriptions of "gu" poisoning such involving "swollen abdomen, emaciation, and the presence of worms in the body orifices of the dead or living", Unschuld (1985:48) reasons, "Such symptoms allow a great number of possible explanations and interpretations". He suggests attitudes toward "gu" were based upon fear of others, envy, and greed. "But the concept of ku is unknown outside of China. Instead, one finds what may be its conceptual equivalent, the "evil eye", present in all "envy societies"."

Business suite

A business suite is a set of business software functions enabling the core business and business support processes inside and beyond the boundaries of an organization.
Overview.
The key characteristic of a business suite is the delivery of end-to-end business processes which span organizational boundaries such as business departments and locations. In the last years the focus of the business processes supported by business suites has expanded to integrate business partners such as customers, suppliers and service providers .
Business Suites are generally rooted in the traditional ERP systems that are based on a common data model used to storing the data to be shared between departments and their business processes. Most corporate ERP systems have been enhanced and complemented by additional applications over the years. As a result, the total cost of ownership (TCO) grows, process integrity across applications is at stake, and the flexibility to consistently change and optimize business processes suffers. The vendors of business suites claim to address these issues.
Topics.
The issues with business process visibility, flexibility, efficiency, and integrity in heterogeneous business application environments have recently created 2 basic types of business suites:
Business Process Scope.
A business suite usually encompasses all core business and business support processes of an organization, unlike business applications such as treasury management or CRM that have been designed to serve a single line of business.
Since no vendor today offers applications covering all business process requirements of larger organizations, vendors complement their application portfolio through acquisitions or through cooperation with specialized partners.
Two strategies.
A "coverage through acquisition" strategy is confined to the processes that are entirely under the control of a single organization, while the "coverage through cooperation" approach can also enable and support processes that span the boundaries of multiple organizations like suppliers, customers, banks.
Foundational processes.
The foundational set of business processes supported by a business suite includes business support processes to manage financials, build, develop and administer the workforce, run facilities, support the procurement of generic goods and services. Those foundational processes are required to sustain a functional enterprise that complies with all regulatory requirements.
Value drivers.
The next layer of business processes is sometimes grouped by the main value drivers or differentiators of a company:
Processes in support of value drivers.
Key processes supporting those value drivers invariably span organizational boundaries and are relevant for multiple lines of business. A typical business process that connects organizational entities is "order to cash" which can span sales, production, finance, logistics, billing and dispute management and influences important key performance indicators of the involved areas like "free cash-flow", "customer satisfaction", "customer profitability", "fulfillment cost".
Some business suites offer a layer of deep industry processes - either through industry extensions of the core business suite or through a network of frequently certified 3rd party software providers which adopt compatible or identical process and data models.
Current status.
Today, no commercial business suite can cover all business process requirements of a large organization. Modern business suites offer an environment in which an organization can develop or modify business processes reusing the supplied standard processes. Some advanced business suites allow the fast composition of new business processes from process fragments or process steps.

Joseph Bernard Clark (1868-1940) was a British ornamental plasterer and co-founder of the specialist plasterwork company of Clark & Fenn. 
Born in Dundee on 25 March 1868, the son of a plasterer, Clarks family moved to London when he was still young. In 1913 Clark joined with Harry Fenn, a surveyor, founding a company at Loughborough Junction to specialise in ornamental fibrous plasterwork and Plaster of Paris work. 
The business was a rapid success with commissions from the new cinemas and major theatres who competed against each other through the splendour of their interior decoration. For designs, Clark & Fenn worked closely with G. Jackson & Sons, founded in 1780 with Robert Adam as a designer. The company soon moved to larger premises at Clapham Old Town where they were able to prefabricate much of their work off-site. This allowed them to take the mouldings ready-prepared for installation to a theatre or cinema, minimising the disruption to performances and rehearsals.

The selection of the Miss Bhutan finalists and eventually the winner of the pageant is based on the decision of a panel of judges on the performance and physical attributes of the candidates and not by public voting system. The winner of Miss Bhutan receives a cash prize of Nu 100,000. The Miss Bhutan crown, designed in India, is worth another Nu 100,000.
The reigning Miss Bhutan represents the country in the international Miss Earth beauty pageant. Although there was no swimsuit round in the actual Miss Bhutan contest, the winner is trained in an enclosed area for the swimsuit competition in preparation for the international Miss Earth competition.
In the first edition of the pageant, 77 contestants from across Bhutan registered for the Miss Bhutan 2008, but only 20 contestants were short listed in the main event after the preliminary round.
On November 9, 2008, Miss Bhutan 2008 Tsoki Tsomo Karchung participated in the 8th edition of Miss Earth beauty pageant, which was held at the Clark Expo Amphitheater in Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines. Eighty-five delegates arrived from October 19, 2008 in the Philippines. The pageant was won by Karla Henry from the Philippines.

<doc id="18841577" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18841577" title="Biblical archaeology school">
Biblical archaeology school

Biblical archaeology, occasionally known as Palestinology is the school of archaeology which concerns itself with the biblical world.
18th/early 20th centuries.
Adriaan Reland, professor of philosophy at the University of Harderwijk, was one of the early Orientalists, teaching Hebrew antiquities from 1713. Although he never ventured beyond the borders of the Netherlands, he was also acclaimed as a cartographer and published the first modern work of Biblical archaeology, Palaestina ex monumentis veteribus illustrata, a detailed geographical survey of Palestine in 1696 written in Latin and published by Willem Broedelet, Utrecht, in 1714.
The foundations of biblical archaeology were laid in the 19th century with the work of antiquarians such as Johann Jahn, whose manual of biblical antiquities, "Biblische Archäologie", (1802, translated into English 1839) was immensely influential in the middle years of the 19th century. Shortly thereafter, Edward Robinson, known as "the founder of modern Palestinology" published the bestselling "Biblical Researches in Palestine, the Sinai, Petrae and Adjacent Regions" (1841), which prompted a group of English clergymen and scholars to found the Palestine Exploration Fund "to promote research into the archaeology and history, manners and customs and culture, topography, geology and natural sciences of biblical Palestine and the Levant" in 1865. This was followed by the Deutscher Palästina-Verein (1877) and the École Biblique (1890). The American School of Oriental Research was founded in (1900), and the British School of Archaeology in (1919). The research these institutions sponsored, at least in these early days, was primarily geographic, and it was not until the 1890s that Sir Flinders Petrie introduced the basic principles of scientific excavation, including stratigraphy and ceramic typology to Palestinian archaeology.
William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school.
The dominant figure in 20th-century biblical archaeology, defining its scope and creating the mid-century consensus on the relationship between archaeology, the Bible, and the history of ancient Israel, was William F. Albright. An American with roots in the American Evangelical tradition (his parents were Methodist missionaries in Chile), Director of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), (now the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research) through the `1920s and 1930s, editor of ASOR's "Bulletin" until 1968, and author of over a thousand books and articles, Albright drew biblical archaeology into the contemporary debates over the origins and reliability of the Bible. In the early decades of the 20th century this debate was dominated by the documentary hypothesis. This explained the Bible as the composite product of authors working between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, and raised the question of whether the books of the bible could be regarded as a reliable source of information for Solomon’s period or earlier." European scholars such as Hermann Gunkel, Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth were suggesting that the books of the Old Testament rested on a body of oral tradition that reflected genuine history, but could not themselves be regarded as historically accurate. Albright saw archaeology as the a practical means to test these ideas. Biblical archaeology, for him, therefore embraced all lands and any finds that could "throw some light, directly or indirectly, on the Bible."
Albright and his followers believed that archaeology could and should be used to shed light on the Biblical narrative, particularly the Old Testament. The influential academic positions held by Albright and his followers, and their immense output — Albright alone was the author of over a thousand books and articles — made their work highly influential, especially in America, and especially among ordinary Christians who wished to believe that archaeology had proved the Bible true. In fact the members of the school were not biblical literalists, and their main concern was to discriminate between those parts of the biblical story that were true and those that were embellishments.
By the middle of the 20th century the work of Albright and his students, notably Nelson Glueck, E. A. Speiser, G. Ernest Wright and Cyrus Gordon, had produced a consensus that biblical archaeology had provided physical evidence for the originating historical events behind the Old Testament narratives: in the words of Albright, "Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details of the Bible as a source of history." The consensus allowed the creation of authoritative textbooks such as John Bright's "History of Israel" (1959). Bright did not believe that the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph could be regarded as reliable history, or that it was possible to reconstruct the origins of Israel from the biblical text alone, but he did believe that the stories in Genesis reflected the physical reality of the 20th–17th centuries BC, and that it was therefore possible to write a history of the origins of Israel by comparing the biblical accounts with what was known of the time from other sources.
Biblical archaeology today.
Albrightian theories were largely overturned in the second half of the 20th century, especially in regards to suppositions that Albrightians made regarding the pre-monarchic era. Improved archaeological methods, notably Kathleen Kenyon's excavations at Jericho, did not support the conclusions the biblical archaeologists had drawn, with the result that central theories squaring the biblical narrative with archaeological finds, such as Albright's reconstruction of Abraham as an Amorite donkey caravaneer, were rejected by the archaeological community. The challenge reached its climax with the publication of two important studies: In 1974 Thomas L. Thompson's "The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives" re-examined the record of biblical archaeology in relation to the Patriarchal narratives in Genesis and concluded that "not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the Patriarchal narratives to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely." and in 1975 John Van Seters' 'Abraham in History and Tradition' reached a similar conclusion about the usefulness of tradition history: "A vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times."
At the same time a new generation of archaeologists, notably William G. Dever, criticized Biblical archaeology for failing to take note of the revolution in archaeology known as processualism, which saw the discipline as a scientific one allied to anthropology, rather than as a part of the corpus of the humanities linked to history and theology. Biblical archaeology, Dever said, remained "altogether too narrowly within a theological angle of vision," and should be abandoned and replaced with a regional Syro-Palestinian archaeology operating within a processual framework.
Dever was broadly successful: most archaeologists working in the world of the Bible today do so within a processual or post-processual framework: yet few describe themselves in these terms. The reasons for this attachment to the old nomenclature are complex, but are connected with the link between excavators (especially American ones) and the denominational institutions and benefactors who employ and support them, and with the unwillingness of biblical scholars, both conservative and liberal, to reject the link between the Bible and archaeology. The result has been a blurring of the distinction between the theologically-based archaeology that interprets the archaeological record as "substantiating in general the theological message of a God who acts in history," and Dever's vision of Syro-Palestinian archaeology as an "independent, secular discipline ... pursued by cultural historians for its own sake."

Joel Edward Philip Ward (born 29 October 1989 in Emsworth, England) is an English footballer who plays for Premier League club Crystal Palace. He is naturally a centre back, but has made his breakthrough into the first team as both right back and defensive midfielder.
Club career.
Portsmouth.
Ward started his footballing career with East Lodge F.C. and signed a professional contract with Portsmouth in July 2008 after spending two years in the Academy and Reserves.He was in the first team and could play in a variety of positions.
Bournemouth (loan).
The following month, he signed a one-year loan deal with Bournemouth to gain first team experience. Ward soon made his debut in a League Cup match against Cardiff City on 12 August, playing the full 90 minutes as Cardiff ran out 2–1 winners. His League Two debut came later that week on 16 August in an away draw with Aldershot Town. As the season progressed, Ward continued to appear in defence for "the Cherries" and he gained the first yellow and red cards of his career on 18 October in a 4–1 away defeat to Shrewsbury Town, eventually being sent off for two bookable offences. However, his form meant that he returned to the side soon afterwards, making his Football League Trophy and FA Cup débuts: a home defeat by Colchester United and a home win against Bristol Rovers on 4 and 8 November respectively.

He made his league debut four days later in a home game against Watford. He won promotion with Crystal Palace after clearing a shot off the line during the last minute of injury time against the same opponents n the Play-Off Final. On 18 August 2013, Ward started against Tottenham Hotspur at Selhurst Park, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1-0 defeat in Palace's opening Barclays Premier League fixture.
Personal life.

John Fenn (priest)

John Fenn (born at Montacute near Yeovil, Somerset; d. 27 December 1615) was an English Roman Catholic priest and writer, in exile under Elizabeth I of England. He was the elder brother of James Fenn, the Catholic martyr, and Robert Fenn.
Life.
After being a chorister at Wells Cathedral, he went to Winchester School in 1547, and in 1550 to New College, Oxford, of which he was elected Fellow in 1552. Next year he became head master of the Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, but was deprived of this office and also of his fellowship for refusing to take the oath of supremacy under Elizabeth. 
He went to Rome where after four years' study he was ordained priest about 1566. Having for a time been chaplain to Sir William Stanley's regiment in Flanders, he settled at Leuven, where he lived for forty years.
In 1609, when the English Augustinian Canonnesses founded St. Monica's Priory in Leuven, he became their first chaplain, until in 1611 when his sight failed. He continued to live in the priory, until his death.
Works.
He contributed to the publication, in 1583, by John Gibbons, S.J., of various accounts of persecution of English Catholics, under the title "Concertatio Ecclesiae Catholicae in Angliâ". This was the groundwork of the larger collection published by Bridgewater under the same name in 1588. 
Besides his "Vitae quorundam Martyrum in Angliâ", included in the "Concertatio", he translated into Latin John Fisher's "Treatise on the penitential Psalms" (1597) and two of his sermons; he also published English versions of the Catechism of the Council of Trent, Jerome Osorio de Fonseca's reply to Walter Haddon's attack on his letter to Queen Elizabeth (1568), Guerra's "Treatise of Tribulation", an Italian life of Catherine of Sienna (1609; 1867), and Gaspar Loarte's "Instructions How to Meditate the Misteries of the Rosarie".

Detachable Penis

"Detachable Penis" is a song by avant-garde band King Missile. It was the first single from the band's 1992 album" Happy Hour," and became a modest hit, reaching No.25 on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Lyrical content.
In "Detachable Penis," frontman John S. Hall recites a deadpan monologue in which he portrays the owner of the eponymous penis. Apparently a resident of Manhattan's East Village, the narrator awakens one morning with a bad hangover to discover that his penis is missing again. He searches his apartment, calls the location of the party he attended the night before, and queries numerous acquaintances, but is unable to recover his penis.
Depressed, he goes to the Kiev Restaurant for breakfast, and afterwards, while walking "down Second Avenue, toward St. Mark's Place," discovers his penis for sale "on a blanket next to a broken toaster oven." The man selling the penis wants $22 for it, but the narrator is able to "talk him down to seventeen." He takes his penis home, washes it off, and reattaches it. With his penis back in place, he is "happy again: complete."
In 2013, researchers discovered that the idea of a detachable penis is not novel in the animal world. They discovered that the sea slug "Chromodoris reticulata" sloughs off its penis after sex, then grows a new one within approximately 24 hours.
Musical content.
The music of "Detachable Penis" consists largely of a distorted, delay-treated electric guitar riff backed by organ and drum grooves with brief lead guitar improvisation. For most of the track, the titular phrase is sung with an interval of approximately four seconds, or more accurately two 4/4 bars, the length of the guitar riff. The riff provides a harmonic ground of C#min - G Maj - Amaj, which remains unchanged throughout the song.
Music video.
The video for "Detachable Penis" was directed by Richard Kern at the suggestion of drummer Roger Murdock. Hall called Kern "the perfect choice." The video consists of a literal visual depiction of the song's narrative, interspersed with shots of the band performing and an anonymous woman simulating attaching and detaching the titular organ (represented by a dildo complete with artificial scrotum and testicles).
Commercial performance and effect on band.
In a 2003 interview, Hall stated that the commercial success of "Detachable Penis" led to a commercial backlash: "that CD ["Happy Hour", we didn't really get a lot of airplay". A few stations continued to be supportive, but I think that the success of 'Detachable' resulted in a lot of people getting pretty tired of what we were doing. That is one of the bad things about having a 'hit.'"
Moreover, said Hall, the band realized that the song had drawn in many casual fans who did not care about the rest of the group's material; thus, the band began to play the song "early in the set, so that the people who didn't like us could leave, and we could play for the people who cared. That worked out well. People did leave."
Interpretations.
"Detachable Penis" has been subject to a wide array of misinterpretations. Some people take the lyrics at face value, while others see the story as an elaborate metaphor. In his review of "Happy Hour," Michael C. Harris of "Rolling Stone" wrote of the song: "A parable of self-emasculation? Who knows? And Hall's not telling."
In a 1998 interview, Hall remarked, "Obviously, there are elements to 'Detachable' about male identity that are there, but not really overtly there. For the person who wants to find it, it's there. I don't know. I don't think... I like to think I'm not obvious about the humor, and I'm not obvious about the feelings, either."

A Trap to Catch a Cracksman

A Trap to Catch a Cracksman was a short story written by Ernest William Hornung featuring his most famous creation A. J. Raffles, a cricketer and Gentleman thief. It was first published in 1905 in the collection A Thief in the Night.
Raffles attempts to rob the boxer Barney Maguire, the heavyweight champion of the United States who is in England to fight a leading British contender. After meeting him at the Imperial Sporting Club, Raffles decides to steal the collection of valuable trophies he carries around everywhere with him. He does this the night after Maguire has fought (and beaten) the British champion, correctly assuming that he will be out drinking to celebrate.
That same night, his friend Bunny Manders receives a call from a desperate Raffles. Maguire had spoken of a "A trap to catch a cracksman", and while attempting to steal his trophies Raffles has discovered it. Rather than the mantrap that he and Bunny had suspected it is in fact, a heavily drugged decanter of whiskey which Raffles has drunk and collapsed on the floor. Bunny rushes round to aid his companion. They manage to escape by similarly drugging Maguire.
Adaptations.
It was adapted as an episode in the 1977 Raffles (TV series).

List of infantry mortars

The list of infantry mortars catalogues weapons which are issued to infantry units to provide close range, rapid response, indirect fire capability of an infantry unit in tactical combat. In this sense the mortar has been called "infantryman's artillery", and represents a flexible logistic solution to satisfying unexpected need for delivery of firepower, particularly for the light infantry. In general infantry mortars are defined by what a team of infantrymen, sometimes known as mortarmen, can transport unaided by significant vehicle support. Because of this intrinsic restriction mandated by weight, mortars are only considered "infantry" to a calibre of 120mm. These larger weapons usually require wheeled assemblies to allow their towing either by hand or by light tactical vehicles.

Rubeus Hagrid

Rubeus Hagrid is a fictional character in the "Harry Potter" book series written by J. K. Rowling. Hagrid is introduced in "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" as a half-giant and half-man who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and later becomes a member of the Order of the Phoenix.
Character development.
Hagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created "the very first day". She has explained the source of his name as "another old English word, meaning – if you were hagrid – it’s a dialect word – you’d had a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker – he has a lot of bad nights." In her article "Harry’s Fame", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowling’s work, and Hagrid is the only character that is "directly drawn from the Forest of Dean". According to Goring, Hagrid’s "dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality." She also notes that Hagrid is physically "modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who’d swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair".
The character of Hagrid and conversations between him, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in his hut are expository through the series, due to the fact that the trio frequently discover things about Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts by talking with Hagrid, as he has a habit of letting slip bits of information. He was also one of the first characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as "pure-bloods" and "half-bloods" is a dated concept.
Rowling has stated in an interview that Hagrid was in Gryffindor house during his time as a student. When he comes into possession of an acromantula, he is expelled from Hogwarts as his pet is supposed to be the "monster of Slytherin". However, persuaded by Dumbledore (who at the time was Transfiguration teacher), Headmaster Armando Dippet agrees to train Hagrid as gamekeeper, allowing the boy to remain at Hogwarts. By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means "that he will let you in and out of Hogwarts." Part of his job includes leading the first years across the lake in boats, upon their initial arrival at Hogwarts.
When discussing the killing off of characters in her books, Rowling said that she always knew she was "working towards the point where Hagrid carried Harry out alive - but supposedly dead - out of the forest". She said had planned from very early on that Harry would walk to his death accompanied by the 'ghosts', and that "he would emerge in Hagrid's arms". In her own words, "that's what always kept Hagrid safe". She said "Hagrid would have been a natural to kill in some ways", but that the mental image of this moment - a big fatherly Hagrid carrying the limp Harry in his arms - was so strong it decided his fate. She also liked the circular notion of Hagrid both bringing Harry into the world, and then bringing him back from the dead.
Appearances.
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".
Rubeus Hagrid is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house after they have been murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. 10 years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher’s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron’s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets".
Readers first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was "The Monster of Slytherin," and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and, either intentionally or unintentionally, allowed it to attack and petrify (and in one case, kill) other students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage. During the events of the second book, the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban, as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks. However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to "follow the spiders", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk, it is revealed that Ginny Weasley is acting under the influence of Tom Riddle's diary, and Hagrid is freed from prison.
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
Following the resignation of Silvanus Kettleburn, who, according to Dumbledore, wanted to spend time with his remaining limbs, Hagrid is assigned to teach the subject of Care of Magical Creatures in the third novel. He is also allowed to perform magic again since his name has been cleared after the events of the previous book. During his first class, in which he introduces the hippogriffs to third-years, one of the beasts, Buckbeak, attacks Draco Malfoy after the boy insults it. Although Dumbledore manages to prove that Hagrid is innocent, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. Thus, Hagrid's classes become extremely boring, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend some time looking for information that would help Hagrid in Buckbeak’s defence. Near the end of the book Hermione and Harry use a time-turner to save Buckbeak from death and Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss.
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire".
In the fourth novel it is revealed that Hagrid is of mixed wizard and giant parentage, his mother having been the giantess Fridwulfa, who left his wizard father when Hagrid was a baby. Since giants have a reputation for being brutal, and were once allies of Voldemort, Hagrid keeps his parentage a secret and allows people to imagine other reasons for his great size (drinking a bottle of Skele-Gro when he did not need it). Hagrid’s parentage is exposed in the "Daily Prophet" by Rita Skeeter, who portrays him as dangerous (because of his fascination for aggressive creatures) and incompetent. Hagrid is gravely affected by this and attempts to resign from his post as teacher, though Dumbledore does not accept his resignation. During the novel, Hagrid develops a romantic interest with Olympe Maxime – another half-giant witch and Headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. Hagrid is also one of the very few people who, since the beginning, believes Harry’s word that he did not apply to enter the Triwizard Tournament. Later in the book, Alastor Moody (impersonated by Barty Crouch Jr) suggests Hagrid should show Harry that the first task of the Tournament would involve dragons. Hagrid also provides Blast-Ended Skrewts for the third task.
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix".
Hagrid is absent during the first part of the fifth novel. The character later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince".
In the sixth novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer students of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during the first part of the book, but he soon realises that it is not because they do not like him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as "liquid luck") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them. During Dumbledore’s funeral, Hagrid is seen carrying the Headmaster’s body.
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".
In the seventh novel, Hagrid is part of the Order of the Phoenix delegation assigned to remove Harry from the Dursleys' home to the magic-protected Burrow. Hagrid takes Harry on the flying motorcycle he inherited from Sirius but the plan goes awry when the Order delegation is ambushed by Death Eaters. The pair narrowly make it to the Burrow after being attacked by Voldemort himself. After attending Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s wedding reception, Hagrid does not appear again until near the end of the book when it is revealed he has been driven into hiding in the mountains by the new death-eater regime at Hogwarts.
During the climactic battle, Hagrid attempts to come to the defence of Aragog's carnivorous children, who have been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by the Death Eaters and are now attacking both Hogwarts defenders and Death Eaters indiscriminately, but he is carried off by a swarm of them. He later turns up, captive in the Death Eaters' camp, when Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort. Hagrid is forced to carry Harry back to the school, not realising that Harry has survived again, and en route accuses the watching Centaurs of not doing enough to help. The Centaurs soon afterward join the fray and Hagrid takes part in the second half of the battle, felling his main nemesis among the Death Eaters, the magical-creature executioner Walden Macnair.
According to Rowling, the scene in the final book in which Hagrid is seen carrying Harry’s apparently dead body is very significant as "Hagrid brings Harry from the Dursleys. He takes him into the wizarding world … He was sort of his guardian and his guide ... And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest." Rowling also commented that Hagrid was never in danger of dying, as she "always had that picture in my head of the huge gigantic Hagrid walking through the forest crying with Harry in his arms".
Epilogue.
Nineteen years after Voldemort’s defeat, Hagrid is still at Hogwarts, though it is not clear in what capacity (he would be 87 years old by this time), and invites Harry’s young son Albus to his hut for tea, just as he had once done for Harry himself signifying that Harry and Hagrid are still close. During an interview in 2007, when asked if Hagrid did marry, Rowling answered that Hagrid developed a relationship with a giantess but it did not work out.
Film portrayal.
Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid in all of the film adaptations of the "Harry Potter" novels. Rowling had Coltrane first in mind for the role and when asked who was the top of her list responded "RobbieColtraneforHagrid" all in one quick breath. Coltrane has commented that to be part of the "Harry Potter" films is "a fantastic thing to be involved in." Rowling gave Coltrane some background on Hagrid She also stated that, "Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have – you really do have to sense – a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly."
Former English rugby union footballer Martin Bayfield has portrayed Hagrid as a stunt performer in longer shots due to his large size to emphasise Hagrid’s height. Bayfield also appeared as a young Hagrid in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets".
Characterisation.
Outward appearance.
In "Philosopher’s Stone", Hagrid is mentioned as being twice as tall as the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being and in later books he is said to be three times as wide. Hagrid is known for his thick West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In "Order of the Phoenix", when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of "Half-Blood Prince", during the chapter "Flight of the Prince", withstanding a Death Eater’s powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.
Personality.
He has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in "Philosopher’s Stone". He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in "Philosopher’s Stone", he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool"). He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of Hagrid, "Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. He’s like the king of the forest, or the Green Man. He’s this semi-wild person who lives on the edge of the forest".
Magical abilities and skills.
Following his expulsion from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrid’s oak wand and forbade him to perform magic. Hagrid keeps the pieces of his wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since he is not a fully qualified wizard, he "will always be a bit inept" as compared to other adult wizards, but "occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, by bringing off more impressive bits of magic". He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant blood. For example, in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him.
Family.
Grawp.
Grawp is the giant half-brother of Hagrid. Grawp and Hagrid were born of the same mother, the giantess Fridwulfa. Grawp is about tall, which Hagrid claims is small for a giant. His knuckles are the size of cricket balls (~225 mm in circumference). The other giants were bullying Grawp, and this is a factor in Hagrid’s decision to bring him to the Forbidden Forest. Big and dim, he only knows a few words in English and his manners are wild and unpredictable.
At first, Grawp seems indifferent to his brother’s attempts to civilise him, preferring to spend his time tearing down trees. After Hagrid leaves Hogwarts to avoid being imprisoned, he leaves Grawp in the care of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Much to their surprise, when they find themselves trapped in the forest during a confrontation with the local centaur population, Grawp inadvertently manages to divert the centaurs' attention from Harry and Hermione while looking for Hagrid, whom he calls 'Hagger'.
In "the Half-Blood Prince", Grawp is moved to the mountains, where he is apparently progressing much better. He also attends Dumbledore’s funeral with Hagrid, much more civil and calm than before, and dressed formally. He also appears to understand emotions, at least to some extent, as he pats Hagrid’s head to comfort him. In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", Grawp, Hagrid, and Fang go into hiding after Hagrid throws a "Support Harry Potter" party and it is implied that Grawp helped them all escape. He is the only giant fighting against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, probably in an attempt to protect Hagrid, as he frequently calls his name while fighting the Death Eaters. Grawp participates in the victory celebration over Voldemort’s defeat (albeit from a window, since he is too big to fit into the hall), and the Hogwarts students show their appreciation by tossing food into his laughing mouth.
In the film adaptation of the fifth book Grawp is computer-generated using a new "soul capturing" process from Image Metrics. Andrew Whitehead spent 18 months working on the giant Grawp for the film. The voice of Grawp is performed by Tony Maudsley.
Parents.
In "the Goblet of Fire", the truth about Hagrid’s parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his father’s care after his birth; according to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later she gave birth to Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in "the Order of the Phoenix". Hagrid describes his father as "a tiny little man" whom he could pick up with one hand and place on the dresser at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", he says that his father’s death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories.
Hagrid's pets.
Hagrid keeps and has kept a variety of pets, including some which the Wizarding community considers impossible to domesticate. They are not always wrong. Rowling has said that Hagrid has little interest in tamer magical creatures because of the lack of a challenge, although he has a large but cowardly dog, a boarhound named Fang. Hagrid’s love of dangerous magical creatures is central to the plot of several books of the series.
Aragog.
Aragog was an Acromantula—an enormous, sentient spider capable of speech—who made a unique clicking noise as he moved in search of prey. Hagrid raised him from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the "Monster of Slytherin," and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was actually a basilisk.
After Hagrid was expelled, Aragog lived in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid found him a mate, Mosag, with whom Aragog bore an entire colony of giant spiders. He remained grateful to Hagrid for his entire life, and kept his carnivorous children from attacking him when he came to visit. However, he did not extend this courtesy to other creatures and people; he allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang when they encountered him in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". Hagrid led them to Aragog by giving them the cryptic advice, "follow the spiders." It was Aragog who told Harry and Ron that he was not the Monster of Slytherin, but another creature, that unlike Aragog, was born in the castle, and which spiders so fear above all others that they never speak of it or give its name, despite Hagrid's numerous inquiries. Though Aragog allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang, they were saved at the last minute by Mr. Weasley’s flying car, which had been lost in the forest months before. Aragog remained in the Forbidden Forest for the rest of his life, but eventually died of old age in "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince". Hagrid retrieved Aragog’s body from the forest so that he could give him a proper burial, fearing that his children would devour his body. From that point on, the spider colony was the only part of the Forbidden Forest that Hagrid could not enter safely.
Aragog’s children returned in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" during the Battle at Hogwarts; having been driven from the forest, they began attacking Death Eaters and Hogwarts' inhabitants indiscriminately. Hagrid’s love of the spiders endangered him and others because he tried to protect them; the spiders thanked Hagrid by capturing him and taking him to Voldemort.
Aragog was voiced by Julian Glover in the film adaptation of "the Chamber of Secrets".
Buckbeak.
Buckbeak, along with eleven other hippogriffs, is introduced during one of Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures classes. Hagrid explains that hippogriffs are very calm, powerful, proud creatures, but are sensitive and demand respect. Harry successfully approaches Buckbeak, who allows him to ride him around the paddock.
Draco Malfoy, in an arrogant attempt to show up his school nemesis, endeavours to approach Buckbeak as well. It becomes obvious that Draco neither listens to nor cares about Hagrid's warnings about the hippogriffs' sensitivity, as he makes contemptuous remarks about Buckbeak. Quickly angered, Buckbeak slashes Draco’s arm with his claws. Pretending to be injured much more severely than he truly is, Draco persuades his father, Lucius Malfoy, to use his political power to sentence Buckbeak to death. Hagrid’s numerous appeals fail, and members of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures come to Hogwarts to execute Buckbeak. With the use of a Time-Turner, Hermione and Harry free Buckbeak (they believed him earlier to have been executed, but it was revealed the executioner only swung his axe into the fence in anger, in the film he does this to a pumpkin) and rescue Sirius Black from the tower in which he is being held before being handed over to the Dementors. Sirius escapes with Buckbeak and flies to safety. During most of Harry’s fourth year, Sirius and Buckbeak hide in a cave in the mountains above Hogsmeade. After this, they move to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, whereupon Buckbeak stays in Sirius' mother’s former room. When Kreacher wants to lure Sirius away briefly, he wounds Buckbeak.
In "Half-Blood Prince", Harry inherits Buckbeak, and allows Hagrid to look after him again. To avoid suspicion from the Ministry of Magic, he is given the alias "Witherwings". A fiercely loyal creature, Buckbeak chases Severus Snape away from Harry by slashing his claws at the end of the book. Buckbeak also features in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of "the Deathly Hallows" leading the Hogwarts' Thestrals against Voldemort’s giants.
Fang.
Fang is a large boarhound (portrayed in the films by a Neapolitan Mastiff) that, aside from his enormous size, appears to be an entirely ordinary dog. While Fang's appearance is intimidating, he is, in Hagrid's words, "a bloody coward." Boisterous and loving with people he knows, he seems to enjoy licking Harry, Ron, or Hermione around the face or ears.
In "the Philosopher’s Stone" he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest to look for an injured unicorn. In the following book, "the Chamber of Secrets", Harry and Ron take Fang into the forest where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasley’s flying car. In "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrid’s hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang over his shoulder, and carries him to safety. In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts.
Fluffy.
Fluffy is a giant three-headed dog provided by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher’s Stone was hidden until the end of "Philosopher’s Stone". The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull him to sleep by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek Mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus.
In "Philosopher’s Stone", Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville accidentally run into Fluffy whilst hiding from Peeves, who was attempting to give them away to caretaker Argus Filch, who was searching for them. On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffy’s chamber, and for the next few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying "How are you meant to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?" to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher’s Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffy’s defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that had been given to him by Hagrid.
J. K. Rowling was asked in an interview what happened to Fluffy after he was no longer needed to protect the Stone. Her reply was that Fluffy was released into the Forbidden Forest.
Norberta.
Norberta, previously named Norbert, is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid had acquired as an egg from a mysterious, hooded stranger in the Hog's Head, who turned out to be Professor Quirrell. Hagrid helps the dragon hatch from the egg. Norberta becomes very dangerous and much bigger in the weeks following. Norberta bit Ron’s hand, causing him to require medical treatment due to the venom in her fangs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally persuade Hagrid to send the dragon to Ron’s older brother Charlie, who is studying dragons in Romania. In "the Deathly Hallows", Charlie reveals to Hagrid that "Norbert" is actually female and had been renamed "Norberta". Charlie adds that female Norwegian Ridgeback dragons "are more vicious..." which explained Norberta's biting and dangerous behavior as a baby.
Reception.
IGN listed Hagrid as their thirteenth top "Harry Potter" character, saying that Hagrid had become a surrogate for the audience and that the short scene in the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" film where he recollects memorable moments with Harry, Hermione and Ron gave them a "cherished memory". IGN’s Joe Utichi also listed Hagrid as his 7th favourite "Harry Potter" character.
In popular culture.
Hagrid has appeared in various animated and non-animated parodies of Harry Potter. He was featured in US skit comedy "Saturday Night Live", portrayed by Horatio Sanz, in the same episode in which Lindsay Lohan played Hermione. In Alistair McGowan's "Big Impression" show, Hagrid appeared in a sketch called "Louis Potter and the Philosopher’s Scone", in which he was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane himself. Hagrid is also parodied in "Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan", a story released by Comic Relief in 2003, and he was played by Ronnie Corbett. In the "Potter Puppet Pals" parodies by Neil Cicierega, Hagrid appeared in the episode "Ron's Disease", in which Harry uses Hagrid’s strength to cure Ron from an illness, as well as to beat Hermione and Snape, and to discover Dumbledore’s identity as a "gay android". Hagrid also appears in the parody stage production "Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice", interacting with Draco Malfoy and a dementor. In one episode of the second series of "Tracey Ullman's State of the Union", Tracey Ullman parodies Rowling as bossy and very keen on keeping her creations copyrighted, believing a hobo is impersonating Hagrid.

Girls (Sugababes song)

"Girls" is a 2008 single by British girl group Sugababes. It was written by Anna McDonald and Nicole Jenkinson, and produced by Si Hulbert and Melvin Kuiters for the band's sixth studio album "Catfights and Spotlights" (2008), featuring an interpolation of Ernie K-Doe's record "Here Come the Girls," as written by Allen Toussaint.
"Girls" was released as the album's lead single on 6 October 2008 in the United Kingdom, and features remixes by Fred Falke, Dennis Christopher and Funkerman. A moderate chart success around Europe in comparison with previous single, the song peaked in the top-three in Estonia, and the United Kingdom, and reached the top-twenty in Ireland and Turkey as well as the top-fifty in several countries including Slovakia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic. "Girls" is used as the one of two theme songs of "Dagens Mand", the Danish version of "Taken Out".
Music video.
The music video for "Girls" was filmed on 28 August 2008 and directed by Daniel Wolfe, The video premiered on 4Music and Channel 4 on 6 September 2008. In the clip, bandmembers Amelle Berrabah, Keisha Buchanan and Heidi Range enjoy a girls' night out at a pole-dancing club, embraced by a "1980s disco style." It features the girls dancing and performing, focusing more on the other dancers during the chorus and on the girls while singing their verses. During their verses, Berrabah engages sensual dance moves with one of the fellow female dancers and Buchanan teases a male dancer.
While "" contestant Latoya Satnarine is featured in a cameo appearance, Buchanan invited her boyfriend Dean Thomas to star in a supporting role in the video. As reported, Berrabah decided to have pole-dancing lessons before filming the video yesterday so she "wouldn't make a fool out of herself on the pole." After recruiting female fans to star in the video, producers denied accusations they were being unfair by failing to pay those who starred in the video.
A spokesman for the band later stated: "No professional dancers are being asked to do anything for free. This is an opportunity for people who don’t dance for a living but who fancy their chances."
Chart performance.
In the UK, the song entered two weeks prior to its physical release, on downloads, at number 8. The following week it climbed four more spots to number 4. The week of 13 October 2008, it climbed one spot to number 3. "Girls" marked their first lead single not to reach number 1 since their debut "Overload" in 2000. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 12.
US promotions.
Though the song was not officially released in the USA, it was used in commercials to promote American shoe store Payless in 2009. It was also reported that the song would be re-recorded with Jade Ewen's vocals to help promote US department store J. C. Penney in 2010. The original version featuring the third line up (Buchanan, Range and Berrabah) was already used in several commercials for J. C. Penney.

Glenrothes by-election, 2008

The 2008 Glenrothes by-election was a by-election held in Scotland on 6 November 2008 to elect a new Member of Parliament (MP) for the House of Commons constituency of Glenrothes in Fife, Scotland.
The seat fell vacant when the previous MP, John MacDougall (Labour), died of pleural mesothelioma on 13 August 2008, aged 60. Pleural Mesothelioma is a rare form of lung cancer caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos.
The by-election was won by Lindsay Roy of the Labour Party.
Background.
Fife is traditionally a stronghold for the Labour Party. McDougall had held Glenrothes and its forerunner, Central Fife, since 2001, when he succeeded Henry McLeish. Willie Hamilton had previously represented the area, which has elected Labour MPs since Hamilton won West Fife from the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950.
The poll followed a run of poor by-election results for the Labour Party, which included a loss to the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Glasgow East, formerly the party's twenty-fifth safest seat in Britain. Glenrothes has a considerably smaller Labour majority than Glasgow East had.
According to the "Financial Times", Labour privately admitted that they expected to lose Glenrothes to the SNP. "The Guardian" described the constituency's main town, Glenrothes, as a "core area" for the SNP. The SNP were in second place in the seat in the 2005 General Election and won the nearest equivalent seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election.
The SNP also ran Fife Council, which covers the constituency, in coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Liberal Democrats won the last by-election to be held in Fife from Labour on a swing of 16%.
Polling date.
By tradition, the polling date was decided by Labour, as MacDougall's party, and set for Thursday, 6 November 2008.
Had the writ been moved immediately the by-election could have been held as early as mid-September, although this coincided with the Trades Union Congress annual conference and the following weeks were filled with various party conferences. A Labour loss during this period could have provided a particular boost for their opponents, or for dissident elements within the party. The SNP may have favoured a quick by-election, noting that Labour called the Glasgow East by-election rapidly, when commentators believed it was to Labour's advantage.
Candidates.
The Labour party candidate was Kirkcaldy High School rector Lindsay Roy. The SNP selected the leader of Fife Council, Peter Grant. The Conservative Party selected Maurice Golden while the Liberal Democrats chose Harry Wills. The Scottish Socialist Party stood Morag Balfour, their national co-chair, who lived in Glenrothes and had been a candidate in the constituency before. Solidarity stood Louise McLeary, a community activist who lived in the part of Kirkcaldy which lies inside the constituency. The UKIP candidate was Dr. Kris Seunarine a specialist in the science of biophotonics at Dundee university, and chairman of the Fife branch of UKIP.
Two of the minor party candidates had disabilities: Balfour was a wheelchair user and McLeary was visually impaired.
Marked register.
Some months after the election, the marked register (on which the electors who had cast their vote were marked) was discovered to be missing. In law the register ought to have been preserved for a year and a day; the Returning Officer from Fife Council had transmitted the marked register to the Sheriff Court as required by law and obtained a receipt. The SNP Constituency Organiser, Cllr John Beare, had asked for a copy of the marked register on 19 November 2008; after ten weeks, the Scottish Court Service admitted the marked register was lost. An inquiry by the Scottish Court Service identified significant failings in its handling of election documents, which had been placed in a room at the court office in Kirkcaldy to which outside contractors had access.
In October 2009, the Scotland Office agreed a protocol to create a substitute marked register for the election.

P. J. Lynch

Patrick James Lynch (born 2 March 1962), known professionally as P. J. Lynch, is an Irish artist and illustrator of children's books. He won both the 1995 and 1997 Kate Greenaway Medals from the British Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject.
Biography.
Early Years.
Born in Belfast, Lynch was the youngest of five children. He was interested in art from an early age, often choosing to spend his free periods during school in the art department. He recalls that Belfast in the 1970s was a "scary" place for a teenager, and he used drawing and reading as a "way of escaping for a while from the horrors that were happening around me in the real world." He attended the Brighton College of Art and departed in 1984 to begin working on children's books.
Book Illustrations.
Lynch's first illustrated book was "A Bag of Moonshine" by Alan Garner (1986), a collection of folklore tales from England and Wales. For that work he won the Mother Goose Award, given to the "most exciting newcomer to British children's book illustration". Since then folklore—traditional stories, legends, and fairy tales—has been a recurring subject of his work.
"The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey" by Susan Wojciechowski, published by Walker Books in 1995, tells the story of a gloomy woodcutter who gradually recovers his ability to find joy in life. It proved to be very popular, with sales in the United States exceeding one million copies. Lynch's illustrations were lauded for their "exceptional range of texture and colour", and earned him both the Kate Greenaway Medal and the Christopher Medal. James Earl Jones recorded a Grammy-nominated reading and a movie based on the book was released in 2007.
"Jonathan Toomey" is Lynch's work most widely held by WorldCat participating libraries.
He won his second Greenaway Medal two years later for illustrating "When Jessie Came Across the Sea" by Amy Hest (1997). No one has won three.
Other media.
Lynch has created posters for both Opera Ireland and the Abbey Theatre. He has illustrated four sets of Christmas stamps for An Post, as well as other individual stamps. The stamps he has designed have been acclaimed for their "level of detail, mood and emotion", which give them "a vivid life
of their own."
In 2006 Lynch completed work on two large scale murals in oils on the theme of "Gulliver's Travels" for the new Cavan County Library.
Personal life.
Lynch and his wife Barbara were married in 2002 on his fortieth birthday. As of 2007 they live in Dublin with their two sons.
Published works.
Lynch has illustrated more than 20 books: 
Lynch was one of many illustrators who contributed to "An ABC Picture Gallery", a collaborative alphabet book written by the Dyslexia Institute staff (Oxford: Butterworth–Heinemann, 1999; ISBN 9780434804726) — "a full page illustration for each letter of the alphabet from some of the illustrators of today" with text insights about their work.

Nudity

Nudity or nakedness is the state of wearing no clothing. Wearing of clothing is a predominantly human characteristic which evolved from functional needs such as protection against cold after the loss of body hair and migration to colder areas and correlated with lice infestation. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations, such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements, and social considerations. 
In some circumstances, a minimum amount of clothing or none at all may be considered socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing may be expected.
Terminology.
Full nudity refers to complete nudity, while partial nudity refers to less than full nudity, with parts of the body covered in some manner. The term partial nudity is sometimes used to refer to exposure of skin beyond what the person using the expression considers to be within the limits of modesty. If the exposure is within the standards of modesty of a given culture and setting (e.g. wearing a bikini at a non-nude beach), terms such as nudity, partial or otherwise, are not normally used. If however, the degree of exposure exceeds the cultural norms of the setting, or if the activity or setting includes nudity as an understood part of its function, such as a nude beach, terminology relating to nudity and degrees thereof are typically used. Toplessness is regarded by most people as partial nudity.
Full frontal nudity describes a state of full nudity with the subject facing forward with the whole front of the body exposed, including intimate parts such as a man's penis or woman's vulva. Partial frontal nudity typically only refers to the exposure of the breasts. Non-frontal nudity describes nudity where the whole back side of the body, including the buttocks, is exposed, or a side-view from any other direction.
Public nudity.
A society's attitude to public nudity varies depending on the culture, time, location and context of an activity. There are many exceptions and particular circumstances in which nudity is tolerated, accepted or even encouraged in public spaces. Such examples would include a nude beach, within some intentional communities (such as naturist resorts or clubs) and at special events.
In general and across cultures, evidence of sexual arousal are commonly covered and those parts of the human body that can display arousal are also normally covered. Sex organs and often women's breasts are covered, even when other parts of the body may be freely uncovered. Yet the nudity taboo may have meanings deeper than the immediate possibility of sexual arousal, for example, in the cumulative weight of tradition and habit. Clothing also expresses and symbolizes authority, and more general norms and values besides those of a sexual nature.
While some European countries such as Germany are rather tolerant about public nudity, in many countries public nudity may meet social disapproval or even constitute a misdemeanor of indecent exposure. In 2012, the city council of San Francisco proposed a ban on public nudity in the inner city area. This was met by harsh resistance since the city is usually known for its liberal culture. Similarly, park rangers began filing tickets against nudists at San Onofre State Beach in 2010, also a place with long tradition of public nudity.
Social nudity.
Some people take part in non-sexual public nude events. These may be in a naturist resort or club or at a nude beach. Outdoor nude recreation can take place in private or rural areas, though generally limited to warm weather.
Others practice casual public nudity. Topfree sunbathing is considered acceptable by many on the beaches of Finland, France, Spain, Italy and most of the rest of Europe (and even in some outdoor swimming pools); however, exposure of the genitals is restricted to nudist areas in most regions. In the United States, topfree sunbathing and wearing thongs are not common in many areas, but are limited to nude beaches in various locations. It is normally acceptable for men in the U.S. to be barechested or shirtless when engaged in outdoor recreational activities.
Where the social acceptability of nudity in certain places may be well understood, the legal position is often less clear cut. In England, for example, the law does not actually prohibit simple public nudity, but does forbid indecent exposure. In practice, this means that successful prosecution hangs on whether there is a demonstrable intention to shock others, rather than simply a desire to be nude in a public place. Specifically, using nudity to "harass, alarm or distress" others is an offence against the Public Order Act of 1986. Occasional attempts to prove this point by walking naked around the country therefore often result in periods of arrest, followed by release without charge, and inconsistencies in the approach between different police jurisdictions. Differences in the law between England and Scotland appear to make the position harder for naked ramblers once they reach Scotland.
Photography of installations of massed nude people in public places, as made repeatedly around the world by Spencer Tunick, claim artistic merit.
Means of attracting attention.
Nudity is at times used to draw attention to a cause, with the participants desiring to remain anonymous. Public nude events are at times staged as a forum for usually unrelated messages, such as clothing-optional bike rides. At times, the cause is merely a personal justification for taking part in a nude event, which are popular in their own right. Many nude calendars are produced each year featuring naked men or women. Some of these are produced to raise money for charities or other causes. Nudity, like sexuality, is also used to draw attention for a commercial purpose, such as for promotion or advertising.
Private nudity.
Personal nudity.
In the privacy of their own homes, people are more casual in relation to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in the privacy of their own homes. A person's cultural background as well as their religious teachings will have an impact on the way they view their own nudity, alone or in the presence of others, as well as viewing the nudity of others. Some cultures deprecate nudity even in a private context. Another factor is the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a possibility of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. 
In the case of nudity in front of those who do not normally occupy the same private space, that will usually depend on whether the outsider is comfortable with the nudity and whether the nudity is reciprocated, as in the case of social nudism. Social nudism may take place in any private social context, such as at one's home with friends or with acquaintances at a nudist facility or event, such as a naturist club, community center, resort or other facility. Some social gatherings may organise party games, which may involve some level of nudity, such as strip games. Strip games can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups and may be intended to generate an atmosphere of fun and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere. 
A 1999 survey by the Federation of Canadian Naturists found, besides other things, that 39% of Canadians go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists. According to a 2004 United States survey, 31% of men and 14% of women report sleeping in the nude, while a 1996 BBC survey revealed that in the U.K. 47% of men and 17% of women do. Some individuals and couples adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Sexual nudity.
Nudity in front of a sexual partner is widely accepted, but not in all cases. For example, some partners insist on nudity only at the time and place of sex, or with subdued lighting; during bathing with the partner or afterward; covered by a sheet or blanket, or while sleeping.
Personal privacy issues.
The invention of photography and more recently the video camera has opened the art of capturing images of people and of scenes at a relatively low cost to the true amateur. A person can now capture images in both public and private situations. A feature of most of private photographs and videos is that they are not intended for viewing outside of a very limited range of people, and seldom if ever by the general public. Amateur photography, which included nude photography, which previously has been produced for personal enjoyment, is increasingly being more widely disseminated by the medium of the Internet, at times without the knowledge and consent of the subject of the photograph, and to their subsequent embarrassment. Also, the use of secret photography to capture images of an unsuspecting person (undressed or not, and whether for personal use, or intended for posting on the Internet) creates additional personal privacy issues.
Children.
There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children. Gordon and Schroeder report that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards. Bonner recommends against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.
A U.S. study by Alfred Kinsey found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.
In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect. Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.
Children seeing nudity.
Attitudes toward children seeing nude people vary substantially, depending on the child's culture, age and the context of the nudity (see also the section "Home" above).
Television and radio regulations in many countries require broadcasters to avoid transmitting images or language considered inappropriate for children from 5:30 am to 9 pm (the so-called "watershed"). In the United Kingdom, the Broadcasting Code states, "Nudity before the watershed must be justified by the context." In the U.S., the safe harbor rule forbids depictions of nudity between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm. Violators may be subject to civil legal action and sanctions if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determines the broadcaster did not meet its standards of "decency". "Material is indecent if, in context, it depicts or describes sexual or excretory organs or activities in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium."
Attitudes to nudity vary substantially throughout Europe. Male and female nudity in Scandinavia is not uncommon. The region has a very open attitude about nudity, although it strictly prohibits children's access to pornography.
Communal showering.
Another issue has been the nudity of children in front of other children.
In continental Europe, students tend to shower communally after physical education classes, separated by gender. Fathers taking their young daughters or mothers taking their young sons into the gender-separated changing rooms is mostly viewed as non-controversial, although some public baths have introduced family changing rooms. Some private gymnasiums have instituted rules specifically banning family members of opposite genders taking their children into single-sex locker rooms.
In the U.S. and some of the English-speaking majority of Canada, students at public schools have historically been required to shower communally with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes. In the U.S., public objections and the threat of lawsuits have resulted in a number of school districts in recent years changing policy to make showers optional. Private boarding schools and military academies in the U.S. often have communal showers, since the focus there is on 24-hours-a-day education and rooming, rather than just acting as day schools. Students in these establishments need places to clean themselves daily. A court case in Colorado noted that students have a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to "communal undress" while showering after physical education classes. According to an interview with a middle school principal, most objections to showering at school that he had heard were actually from the students' parents rather than from the students.
Children and naturism.
Children who are within a naturist home will usually also be naked, together with their family, and may see non-family members in the nude.
Depictions of nudity.
Nudity in film.
Nudity in film has since the development of the medium been controversial, and most nude scenes in films have had to be justified as being part of the story, in the concept of "artistically justifiable nudity". In some cases nudity is itself the object of a film or is used in the development of the character of the subject. In some cases, nudity has been criticized as "superfluous" or "gratuitous" to the plot, and some film producers have been accused of including nudity in a film to appeal to certain audiences. Many actors and actresses have appeared nude, or exposing parts of their bodies or dressed in ways considered provocative by contemporary standards at some point in their careers. 
Erotic films usually contain nudity, and nudity in a sexual context is common in pornographic films. A film on naturism or about people for whom nudity is common may contain non-sexual nudity, and some other non-pornographic films may contain very brief nude scenes. The vast majority of nudity in film is found in pornographic films.
Visual media.
Mainstream art generally reflects – with some exceptions – social standards of aesthetics and morality of a society at various periods of time. Beyond mainstream standards, artistic expression may be merely tolerated, or be considered as fringe. Since prehistoric time, humans, both male and female, have been depicted in all states of dress, including all states of undress. Nudity in all styles has been and continues to be found in art. Nudity is also a subject of many literary works and in film. All professionally-produced works of art use stylised compositions to depict the nude body. This also applies to cinema, where even nude scenes are staged and rehearsed.
The erotic aspect of nudity in the arts has been an important factor in its attraction, and has come to be associated with certain states and emotions, such as innocence, playfulness, vulnerability, etc. Pornography does not necessarily involve a naked person, but it involves sexualized scenes, and usually it does not claim to have any artistic merit.
The visual arts were at times the only means available to the general public to view a nude body. Today, the opportunities available for the viewing of the nude body are very wide, and these include magazines, television, films, and the Internet.
Child nudity.
Depictions of child nudity or children with nude adults appear in works of art in various cultures and historical periods. These attitudes have changed over time and have become increasingly frowned upon particularly in recent years, especially in the case of photography. In recent years, there have been a few incidents in which snapshots taken by parents of their infant or toddler children bathing or otherwise naked were challenged as child pornography.
In May 2008, police in Sydney, Australia, raided an exhibition by the photographer Bill Henson featuring images of naked children on allegations of child pornography. Comparable artworks by Henson had been exhibited without incident since 1975, perhaps indicating that this sensitivity has heightened in recent years.
In June 2008, it was reported in "The Age" that police would have no basis to prosecute Henson over his photographs of naked teenagers, after they were declared "mild and justified" and given a PG rating by the Australian Classification Board, suggesting viewing by children under the age of 16 is suitable with parental guidance.
Out of protest, the "Art Monthly Australia" magazine published an image of the 6-year-old Olympia Nelson taken by her mother, Polixeni Papapetrou. According to the then-11-year-old Olympia, she did not believe the photograph amounted to abuse and was upset with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's remark that he hated it. Olympia's father, art critic Professor Robert Nelson, defended it, saying: "It has nothing to do with pedophilia. The connection between artistic pictures and pedophilia cannot be made and there is no evidence for it."
Uses of nudity.
Full body scanner.
A full-body scanner is a device that creates an image of a person's nude body through their clothing to look for hidden objects without physically removing their clothes or making physical contact. They are increasingly being deployed at airports and train stations in many countries.
One technology used under the name "full-body scanner" is the millimeter wave scanner, the active form of which reflects extremely high frequency radio waves off the body to make an image on which one can see some types of objects hidden under the clothes. Passive millimeter wave screening devices rely on only the raw energy that is naturally emitted from the human body or objects concealed on the body; passive devices do not transmit millimeter waves. Another technology in use is the backscatter X-ray.
Imposed nudity.
In some situations nudity is imposed on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a corporal punishment or as humiliation, especially when administered in public. In fact, torture manuals have distinguished between the male and female psychological aversion to self-exposure versus being disrobed.
Nazis used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in concentration camps. This was depicted in the film "Schindler's List".
In 2003, Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad gained international notoriety for accounts of torture and abuses by members of the United States Army Reserve during the post-invasion period. Photographic images were circulated that exposed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse.
Western culture.
Functional nudity.
Functional nudity for a short time, such as when changing clothes on a beach, is sometimes acceptable, while staying nude on the beach generally is not nor is it legal in some jurisdictions. On designated nude beaches it is acceptable and legal to be nude.
Breastfeeding in public is forbidden in some jurisdictions, not legislated for in others, and a legal right in public and the workplace in yet others. Where it is a legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to breastfeed, and some people may object to the practice.
Toplessness and "topfreedom".
In some cultures, toplessness is regarded as partial nudity, and the exposure of breasts or nipples may be regarded as indecent exposure. However, in many western societies and in appropriate settings, such as while suntanning, toplessness is not, of itself, normally regarded as indecent. In the United States, however, exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and not usually allowed in public (see Public indecency), while in the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to "harass, alarm or distress" according to the Public Order Act of 1986. Different standards apply to art, with one example being the dome of the US Capitol featuring a fresco depicting goddesses with their breasts exposed.
Prosecutions of cases has given raise to a movement advocating "topfreedom", promoting equal rights for women to have no clothing above the waist, on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances. The term "topfree" rather than "topless" is advocated to avoid the latter term's perceived sexual connotations.
Naturism.
Naturism (or nudism) is a cultural and political movement practising, advocating and defending private and public nudity. It is also a lifestyle based on personal, family and/or social preference.
Naturists reject contemporary standards of modesty which discourage personal, family and social nudity, and seek to create a social environment where people feel comfortable in the company of nude people, and being seen nude, either just by other naturists, or also by the general public.
Nude bathing.
The trend in some European countries (for instance Germany, Finland and the Netherlands) is to allow both genders to bathe together naked. Many German spas allow mixed nude bathing. For example the Friedrichsbad in Baden-Baden has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. There may be some older German bathhouses, such as Bad Burg, which remain segregated by gender, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer FKK (clothing-optional) areas. In general, continental Europeans have a more relaxed attitude about nudity than is seen in the British-influenced world. Some have attributed this difference to the influence of Queen Victoria's husband Albert, who was raised in a very restricting religious sect (see Victorian morality).
The sauna, originating from Finland, is attended nude in its source country as well as in most Scandinavian and in the German-speaking countries of Europe. This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex. Saunas are very common in modern Finland, where there is one sauna for every three people and became very popular in the remainder of Europe in recent decades. Gender segregation is more the exception than the rule in modern European sauna facilities.
In Russia, public banyas are also attended nude, however, they are always segregated by gender, either by having separate sections, or by days of the week. Shared areas (such as swimming pools), if present, can only be attended in bathing suits.
Non-Western attitudes.
Attitudes in Western cultures are not all the same as explained above, and likewise attitudes in non-Western cultures are many and variant. In almost all cultures, acceptability of nudity depends on the situation.
Cultural and/or religious traditions usually dictate what is proper and what is not socially acceptable. Many non-Western cultures allow women to breastfeed in public, while some have very strict laws about showing any bare skin.
Africa.
The curse of nakedness.
In Africa, woman have used stripping naked on purpose as a curse, both historically, and in modern times. The idea is that women give life and they can take it away. The curse initiates an extreme form of ostracism, which anthropologist Terisa Turner has likened to "social execution". The curse extends to foreign men as well, and is believed to cause impotence, madness or other similar harm. The threat has been used successfully in mass protests against the petroleum industry in Nigeria, by Leymah Gbowee during the Second Liberian Civil War, and against President Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivory Coast.
Clothing and nudity.
Different traditions exist among, for example, sub-Saharan Africans, partly persisting in the post-colonial era. Whereas it is the norm among some ethnic and family groups including some Burkinabese and Nilo-Saharan (e.g. Nuba and Surma people) in daily life or on particular occasions not to wear any clothes or without any covering below the waist – for example, at highly-attended stick-fighting tournaments well-exposed young men use the occasion to catch the eye of a prospective bride.
Liberia.
In modern Liberia, soldiers under General "Butt Naked" Joshua Blahyi fought naked in order to terrorize their opponents. Nude except for lace-up leather shoes and a gun, the general led his fierce "Butt Naked" Battalion into battle on behalf of the warlord Roosevelt Johnson, who hired the unclothed warriors for their fearlessness and fighting skills.
Brazil.
In Brazil, the Yawalapiti, an indigenous Xingu tribe in the Amazon Basin, practice a funeral ritual known as Quarup, to celebrate life, death and rebirth, and also involves the presentation of all young girls who have begun menstruating since the last Quarup and whose time has come to choose a partner.
Asia.
In Japan, public baths are very common. Bathing nude with family members or friends in public bath houses, saunas, or natural hot springs (Onsen) is popular.
In Korea, public baths (Jjimjilbang) are widespread and communal nude bathing is normal, although nudity is not permitted in unisex areas.
In the south Asian region, public nudity is totally restricted.
Nudity is considered shamelessness in the conservative society of India, although nude beaches can be found in Goa and nude saints like those of the Digambara sect of Jainism and Hindu Sadhus are respected and worshipped.
In many Muslim countries, public nudity is illegal.
Some conservative people with extreme religious views consider bathing in nudity an insult to the water goddess. Hence, nudity in the view of orthodox society is considered a sin.

Lac de Vassivière

The lac de Vassivière or Vassivière Lake (Vacivièra in Occitan), one of France's largest lakes, is a large man-made reservoir of about . It is situated on the Plateau de Millevaches in the départements of Creuse and Haute-Vienne. It is the largest area of water in the Limousin region of France and provides water supplies, hydroelectricity, and leisure facilities.
Construction.
The lake was constructed after World War II and opened at Christmas 1950. It is the product of two dams in the valley of the Maulde River, an important tributary of the Vienne River.
The lac de Vassivière feeds water to a hydro-electric station at Mazet, to the west.
Geography and environment.
The lac de Vassivière is surrounded by more than of land of ecological or natural interest (ZNIEFF: Zone naturelle d'intérêt écologique, faunistique et floristique), level 1, grouped in 15 distinct areas. These present the full range of landscapes characteristic of the Plateau de Millevaches: peat bog, wetland, heath and forest. The bogs, in particular, are unique and fragile small ecosystems, composed of many strata of plant material, and forming a carbon sink. They are the sources of many of the streams and rivers that flow from the region.
The climate is heavily influenced by the elevated, inland location. Milevaches winters are cold with snowfalls heavy enough for some winter sports. Spring is generally cool and wet, and summer is warm and pleasant, albeit with occasional fierce thunderstorms. Autumn often brings a period of considerable sun and warmth.
The lac de Vassivière is the 16th largest lake in France by area, but sixth among the artificial lakes, and tenth among fresh water lakes. It is surrounded by many different communes, including:
Amenities.
As the lac de Vassivière is entirely inside the Millevaches Regional Natural Park, large parts of its shoreline are protected from excessive development, and form an important haven for wildlife, and wild flowers in particular.
However, with 45 kilometres of shoreline there has still been room for a good deal of tourist development, mostly at well-separated, small sites. This provides camping and picnic facilities, small-scale catering, hotels, artificial beaches, and small ports. There are demarcated zones for motor boating and water skiing, but most of the surface is dominated by small sailing boats. Much of the surrounding housing caters for tourists. There are numerous organised cycling and walking events. The lake has, in fact, become the most important area for sport, and especially water sports, in the region.
Isle of Vassivière.
The Isle of Vassivière is an island at the centre of the lake with an area of 0.75 km². It is dominated by a château and features a number of exhibition and performance spaces, a landscape sculpture park and small menagerie. It is also the site of the lake's main lighthouse, designed in 1988 by Aldo Rossi.
The island is connected to the shore by a causeway. Only authorised vehicles are allowed, so it is normally accessed on foot or by road train.
Transport.
The Lake is entirely encircled by roads and footpaths. The nearest railway station is Eymoutiers/Lac de Vassivière. As well as guided tours by boat, there is a free water taxi on the lake.

<doc id="18841931" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18841931" title="Scrotum">
Scrotum

In some male mammals, the scrotum is a dual-chambered protuberance of skin and muscle, containing the testicles and divided by a septum. It is an extension of the perineum, and is located between the penis and anus. In humans and some other mammals, the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hairs at puberty. The scrotum is homologous to the labia majora in females.
Function.
The function of the scrotum is to keep the temperature of the testes slightly lower than that of the rest of the body. For human beings, the scrotum temperature should be about 35-36 degrees Celsius (95-96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. one to two degrees Celsius below the accepted normal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures may be damaging to sperm count. The temperature is controlled by the scrotum moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when the ambient temperature is cold, and farther away when it is hot. Moving the testes away from the abdomen and increasing the exposed surface area allow a faster dispersion of excess heat. This is done by means of contraction and relaxation of the cremaster muscle in the abdomen and the dartos fascia (muscular tissue under the skin) in the scrotum.
However, this may not be the main function of the scrotum. The volume of sperm produced by the testes is small (0.1-0.2 ml). It has been suggested that if testes were situated within the abdominal cavity that they would be subjected to the regular changes in abdominal pressure that are exerted by the abdominal muscles. This squeezing and relaxing would result in the more rapid emptying of the testes and epididymis of sperm before the spermatozoa were matured sufficiently for fertilization. Some mammals — elephants and marine mammals, for example – do keep their testes within the abdomen and there may be mechanisms to prevent this inadvertent emptying.
Contraction of the abdominal muscles, and changes in intra-abdominal pressure, can often lift and lower the testicles within the scrotum. Contraction of the muscle fibers of the dartos tunic (or fascia) is completely involuntary and results in the appearance of increased wrinkling and thickening of the scrotal skin. The testicles are not directly attached to the skin of the scrotum, so this dartos contraction results in their sliding toward the abdomen. They also, in some men, can be lifted the same way by tightening the anus and pelvic muscles, doing Kegel exercises.
Although the ideal temperature for sperm growth varies between species, it usually appears, in warm-blooded species, to be a bit cooler than internal body temperature, making the scrotum necessary. Since this leaves the testicles vulnerable in many species, there is some debate on the evolutionary advantage of such a system. One theory is that the impregnation of females who are ill is less likely when sperm is highly sensitive to elevated body temperatures. An alternative explanation is to protect the testes from jolts and compressions associated with an active lifestyle. Animals that have stately movements – such as elephants, whales, and marsupial moles – have internal testes and no scrotum.
Clinical significance.
A study has indicated that use of a laptop computer positioned on the lap can negatively affect sperm production. 
A common problem of the scrotum is the development of masses. Common scrotal masses may have any of a variety of causes, including a sebaceous cyst, also called an epidermal cyst; a hydrocele, a hematocele, a spermatocele or a varicocele.
Another condition is blisters caused by chafing or scratching of the scrotum while it is damp. This condition is often seen in males undergoing puberty, as emerging pubic hairs cause an itch and an urge to scratch. Powdering the scrotum to absorb moisture can help to prevent this discomfort. Contact dermatitis may cause redness, burning, swelling, and itching of the entire scrotum. It can result from soaps, solvents, detergents, and natural irritants such as poison ivy. Inguinal hernia and yeast infection may occur, and there may be swelling resulting from conditions external to the scrotum, including heart failure, kidney or liver disease, cherry angioma and testicular torsion.
Skin conditions which have not been successfully identified may be referred to as non-specific scrotal dermatitis.

Douglas Macmillan

Douglas Macmillan MBE (10 August 1884, in Castle Cary, Somerset, England – 1969) was a civil servant and charity founder. He was the seventh of eight children of William Macmillan (1844-1911) and his wife Emily (1843-1937). He was educated at Sexey's School, Bruton (1894-7), the Quaker Sidcot School, Winscombe (1897-1901), and then at the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institute, London (1901). Macmillan entered the civil service in London in 1902 and worked in the Board of Agriculture and, later, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, retiring as a staff officer in 1945.
The death of his father from cancer, in 1911, left a deep impression on Macmillan, and the following year he founded the Society for the Prevention and Relief of Cancer against a background of resistance. The National Health Service had yet to be established, and registration of nurses was not introduced until 1919. At the time no Health and Safety acts had been passed by Parliament and public health had yet to become a priority by the state. In setting up the society Macmillan "wanted to see homes for cancer patients throughout the land, where attention will be provided freely or at low cost, as circumstances dictate... ... panels of voluntary nurses who can be detailed off to attend to necessitous patients in their own homes." This organisation has since flourished and is today known as Macmillan Cancer Support. 
A blue plaque was erected to honour him at his former residence of 15 Ranelagh Road, Pimlico in 1997. In October 2010, The Bexley Civic Society invited the Mayor of Bexley, Cllr Val Clark, to unveil another plaque on his house in Knoll Road, Sidcup where he lived for 30 years.
Douglas Macmillan was a vegetarian. In 1909, he wrote an open letter to all Christians entitled 'SHALL WE SLAY' which encouraged orthodox Christians to consider vegetarianism.

Frederick Ransome

Frederick Ransome (1818-1893) was a British inventor and industrialist, creator of Ransome's artificial stone. 
Frederick was the son of James Ransome, 1782-1849, a member of the Ransomes steel and agricultural equipment-making family of Ipswich. 
In 1844 Frederick invented an artificial sandstone, using sand and powdered flint in an alkaline solution. By heating it in an enclosed high temperature steam boiler the siliceous particles were bound together and could be moulded or worked. With properties equivalent to natural stone, it found applications as filtering slabs, vases, tombstones, decorative architectural work, emery wheels and grindstones. Ransome founded the Patent Siliceous Stone Company in 1852 in order to produce and sell the stone, with an illustrious group of backers that included Charles Darwin, and the Patent Concrete Stone Company in 1865. However, the stone fell out of use, in favour of Portland cement-based concrete, which could be more simply cast on-site.
Ransome moved the manufacture of the artificial stone from Ipswich to Blackwall Lane, Greenwich, in 1866. The Blackwall Lane works covered about four acres, connected to a jetty on the Thames by a tramway.
The company’s decorative "stonework" was used at the Brighton Aquarium, London Docks, the Indian Court, Whitehall, St. Thomas's Hospital, and at the University of Calcutta and other buildings in India. They also made paving tiles, which were used on the Albert Bridge and inscribed memorial headstones. 
By far his most economically important invention (Patents 5442/1885, 10530/1887 and 15065/1887) was the rotary cement kiln. Although his experiments with this were not a commercial success, his designs provided the basis for successful kilns in the USA from 1891, subsequently emulated world-wide.
Ransome became an associate of the Institute of Civil Engineers in 1848. He died at East Dulwich on 19 April 1893 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His son, Ernest L. Ransome, born in 1844, moved to the United States and became a significant innovator of reinforced concrete in his own right.

Elimane Coulibaly

Elimane Coulibaly (born 15 March 1980 in Dakar) is a Senegal football striker who currently plays for Kortrijk in Belgian Pro League.
At the start of the season 2005/2006, Coulibaly left KVK Ninove and went to KMSK Deinze. He played two seasons in the team and scored 15 goals in 35 games. At the end of the 2005-06 season, he left Deinze and signed a two-year-contract with KV Kortrijk. As from the season 2009-2010, Elimane plays in the team of AA Gent in the first team. This season, he also became the top scorer of the team, which ended on the second spot after champion Anderlecht and won the cup. In the cup final, Coulibaly scored the first goal against Cercle Brugge. He scored the first Champions League qualification goal ever of AA Gent in the game against Dinamo Kiev. After the 2011-12 season, he moved to Beerschot but was released in October 2012 and returned as an unattached player to Gent in December 2012.
Club career.
First years.
Coulibaly emigrated to Belgium and never had the intention of becoming a professional football player. he started playing football in the local team of KFC Oostakker to integrate with the people in the area. This hobby soon became serious, as Coulibaly became better. In the summer of 2005, he started playing in the team of KMSK Deinze, which played in Second Division, and in which he scored 15 times in 36 games.
KV Kortrijk.
After two seasons in Deinze, Coulibaly made a transfer to the West-Flemish team KV Kortrijk. His first season was quite difficult, as he only scored five goals in 27 games. Nevertheless, KVK managed to promote to First Division. Consequently, the season 2008-2009 became the break-trough of Coulibaly. Thanks to his 11 goals, Kortrijk managed to stay in First Division.
AA Gent.
Coulibaly got the interest of AA Gent and in the summer of 2009, he signed a contract of 3 years in the team of Ghent. He was transferred as back-up of the often injured Zlatan Ljubijankič. At the start of the season, he only got some rare turn raids. It took until the road game in Mechelen until Coulibaly could score his first goal. After this, he went on scoring very easily and made 11 goals during the season, which helped AA Gent to become vice-champion. He also won the cup and became by this a little hero in Ghent. His second season in Ghent was a little less spectacular than his first. He started self-assured and helped Aa Gent to the group phase in the Europa League, but lost after a while his basic place to Shlomi Arbeitman, who had been traded during summer. Elimane also got many critics from the supporters by his lazy way of playing football, but just as a year before he started to play better during winter break.
Beerschot AC.
In July 2012, Coulibaly joined Beerschot AC. However, on 24 October 2012, he was released by the club for aggressive behavior towards his team mate Hernán Losada. Coulibaly clashed Losada after team's 3-0 defeat against KRC Genk on 20 October 2012.
Return to AA Gent.
After coming to an agreement with Beerschot regarding the end of their cooperation, Coulibaly was signed as a free player by Gent, who were in need of an experienced forward to help them move back into the top half of the standings.

Thomas Copley

Thomas Copley, alias Philip Fisher (born 1596, Madrid, Spain – 1652, British colony of Maryland) was an English Jesuit missionary in North America.
Life.
He was the eldest son of William Copley of Gatton, England, and grandson of Sir Thomas Copley, of a recusant family. He arrived in Maryland in 1637, and, being a man of great executive ability, took over the care of the mission, "a charge which at that time required rather business men than missionaries". 
In 1645, Fisher was arrested and carried in chains to England, with Father Andrew White, the founder of the English mission in America. After enduring hardships he was released, and returned to Maryland (February, 1648). He made an effort to enter Virginia; this appears from a letter written 1 March 1648, to the Jesuit General Vincenzo Carafa in Rome, in which he says: There is no further record bearing on the projected visit. Neill, in his "Terra Mariae" (p. 70), and Smith in his "Religion under the Barons of Baltimore" (p. VII), confuse this Father Thomas Copley of Maryland with an apostate Catholic, John Copley, who was never a Jesuit. Father Fisher is mentioned in the missionary annals of Maryland, and, according to Hughes, was "the most distinguished man among the fourteen Jesuits who had worked in Maryland".

The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American horror film written and directed by Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick. The film was produced by the Haxan Films production company. The film relates the story of three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later by the police department and that this "recovered footage" is the film the viewer is watching.
The film received enormously positive reception from critics and went on to gross over US$248 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The DVD was released in December 1999 and presented only in full-screen.
A studio production film based on the theme of "The Blair Witch Project" was released on October 27, 2000 titled "". Another sequel was planned for the following year, but did not materialize. On September 2, 2009, it was announced that Sánchez and Myrick were pitching the third film. A trilogy of video games based on the film was released in 2000.
Plot.
The film opens with the opening text stating that in October 1994 three filmmaking students disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later, their footage was found by police.
In October 1994 film students Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly Blair, and interview locals about the legend of the Blair Witch. The locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods where he tortured and murdered them. Parr brought the children into his house's basement in pairs, forcing the first child to face the corner and listen to their companion's screams as he murdered the second child. Parr would then murder the first child. Eventually turning himself in to the police, Parr later pleaded insanity, saying that the spirit of Elly Kedward, a witch hanged in the 18th century, had been terrorizing him for some time and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the children. He was hanged after being questioned by police and reporters.
The second day, the students begin to explore the woods in north Burkittsville to look for evidence to prove that the Blair Witch exists. Along the way, two fishermen warn them that the woods are haunted and recall that in 1888, a young girl named Robin Weaver went missing, and when she returned three days later, she talked about "an old woman whose feet never touched the ground." The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, and then camp for the night. The next day they move deeper into the woods despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map. They eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns. They set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark. Josh accidentally disturbs a cairn and Heather hastily repairs it. Later they hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions, but they assume the noises are from animals or locals.
The following day they attempt to return to their vehicle but cannot find their way. They try until nightfall, when they are forced to set camp. That night, they again hear crackling noises but cannot see anything. The next morning they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night. As they continue trying to find their way out of the woods Heather realizes that her map is missing and Mike later reveals that he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day. Josh and Heather attack Mike in a fit of intense rage. They realize they are now hopelessly lost and decide to simply "head south". They discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night they hear more strange noises, including the sounds of children and bizarre "morphing" sounds. When an unknown force shakes the tent they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until dawn. Upon returning to their tent they find that their possessions have been rifled through and Josh's equipment is covered with slime, causing them to question why only his belongings were affected. As the day wears on they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier despite having traveled directly south all day and again set camp, completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles.
The next morning Josh has disappeared. After trying in vain to find him Mike and Heather eventually break camp and slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh screaming in the darkness but are not able to find him. The next morning Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent. Later inspection reveals it contains blood-soaked scraps of Josh's shirt, as well as teeth and hair, but she does not mention this to Mike.
That day Heather films herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as her family and breaks down crying and hyperventilating, understanding that something terrible is hunting her and Mike. Later, they again hear Josh's agonized cries for help, but this time they follow them and discover a derelict abandoned house in the woods. Mike races upstairs, following what sounds like Josh's voice, while Heather tries to follow. Mike then claims he hears Josh in the basement. He runs downstairs and after what seems to be a quick struggle goes silent and drops the camera. Heather shouts for Mike but gets no answer. She enters the basement screaming in fear while her camera catches a glimpse of Mike facing the corner, just as Parr's victims had been made to do. Heather then utters a final scream as she and her camera violently drop to the floor. There is only silence as the footage ends.
Production.
"The Blair Witch Project" was developed during 1994 by the filmmakers. The script began with a 68-page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. Accordingly, the directors advertised in "Back Stage" magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the pool of 2,000 actors. In developing the mythology behind the movie, the filmmakers used many inspirations. Several character names are near-anagrams; Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic. Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, began as an anagram for Rasputin. In talks with investors, they presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. This documentary, originally called "The Blair Witch Project: The Story of Black Hills Disappearances" was produced by Haxan Films.
Filming began in October 1997 and lasted eight days. Most of the movie was filmed in tiny Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland, although a few scenes were filmed in the real town of Burkittsville. Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast. The final scenes were filmed at the historic Griggs House in Granite, Maryland. Donahue had never operated a camera before, and spent two days in a "crash course". Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she once worked with, citing the character's self assuredness when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis.
During filming, the actors were given clues as to their next location through messages given in milk crates found with Global Positioning Satellite systems. They were given individual instructions that they would use to help improvise the action of the day. Teeth were obtained from a Maryland dentist for use as human remains in the movie. Influenced by producer Gregg Hale's memories of his military training, in which "enemy soldiers" would hunt a trainee through wild terrain for three days, the directors moved the characters far during the day, harassing them by night and depriving them of food.
Almost 19 hours of usable footage was recorded which had to be edited down to 90 minutes. The editing in post production took more than eight months. Originally it was hoped that the movie would make it on to cable television, and the filmmakers did not anticipate wide release. The initial investment by the three University of Central Florida filmmakers was about US$35,000. Artisan acquired the film for US$1.1 million but spent US$25 million to market it. The actors signed a "small" agreement to receive some of the profits from the film's release.
A list of production budget figures have circulated over the years, appearing as low as $20,000. In an interview with "Entertainment Weekly", Sánchez revealed that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000.
Reception.
Box office.
"The Blair Witch Project" was shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, and released by Artisan on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity, including a ground-breaking campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the movie was a record of real events. The distribution strategy for "The Blair Witch Project" was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg.
"The Blair Witch Project" grossed $248,639,099 worldwide. After reshoots, a new sound mix, experiments with different endings, and other changes made by the studio, the film's final budget ended up between $500,000 and $750,000.
Critical.
The movie has been widely acclaimed by critics. Rotten Tomatoes provides links to 133 reviews for the movie, with 87% of these reviews being favorable. Also, the film holds a score of 81/100 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim". The film's "found footage" format received near-universal praise by critics and, though not the first in the found footage genre, the film has been declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success. Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun Times" gave the film a total of 4 stars, calling it "an extraordinarily effective horror film". It was listed on Filmcritic.com as the 50th best movie ending of all time.
"The Blair Witch Project" is thought to be the first widely released movie marketed primarily by internet. The movie's official website featured fake police reports and 'newsreel-style' interviews. Due to this, some people initially thought it was an actual documentary about the 'missing' teenagers. These augmented the movie's found footage style to spark debates across the internet over whether the movie was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction.
During 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" named "The Blair Witch Project" one of "the 100 best films from 1983 to 2008", ranking it at #99. In 2006, Chicago Film Critics Association listed it as one of the "Top 100 Scariest Movies", ranking it #12.
Because the filming was done by an inexperienced operator using a hand held camera, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which the camera operator is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomiting as a result.
Awards and nominations.
"The Blair Witch Project" was nominated for, and won, the following awards. Despite Donahue's award, her performance was praised nonetheless.
Cinematic and literary allusions.
In the movie, the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the Salem Witch Trials and "The Crucible", to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches. They were influenced by "The Shining", "Alien" and "The Omen." "Jaws" was an influence as well, presumably because the witch was hidden from the viewer for the entirety of the film, forcing suspense from the unknown.
Soundtrack.
None of the songs featured on "Josh's Blair Witch Mix" actually appear in the movie. However "The Cellar" is played during the credits and the DVD menu. This collection of mostly goth rock and industrial tracks is supposedly from a mix tape made by ill-fated film student Joshua Leonard. In the story, the tape was found in his car after his disappearance. Some of the songs featured on the soundtrack were released after 1994, after the events of the movie supposedly have taken place. Several of them feature dialogue from the movie as well.
Media tie-ins.
Books.
In September 1999, D.A. Stern compiled "The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier". Perpetuating the film's "true story" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews and newspaper articles presenting the movie's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends (an additional "dossier" was created for ""). Stern wrote the 2000 novel "Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr" and in 2004, revisited the franchise with the novel "Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift", featuring all original characters and plot.
In May 1999, a Photonovel adaptation of "The Blair Witch Project" was written by Claire Forbes and was released by Fotonovel Publications.
"The Blair Witch Files".
A series of eight young adult books entitled "The Blair Witch Files" were released by Random subsidiary Bantam from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena related to the Blair Witch in attempt to discover what really happened to Heather, Mike and Josh.
Comic books.
In August 1999, Oni Press released a one-shot comic promoting the film, simply titled "The Blair Witch Project". Written by Jen Van Meter and drawn by Bernie Mireault, Guy Davis, and Tommy Lee Edwards, the comic featured three short stories elaborating on the mythology of the Blair Witch. In mid-2000, the same group worked on a four-issue series called "The Blair Witch Chronicles".
In October 2000, coinciding with the release of "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2", Image Comics released a one-shot called "Blair Witch: Dark Testaments", drawn by Charlie Adlard and written by Ian Edginton.
Video games.
In 2000, Gathering of Developers released a trilogy of computer games based on the film, which greatly expanded on the myths first suggested in the film. The graphics engine and characters were all derived from the producer's earlier game, "Nocturne". Each game, developed by a different team, focused on different aspects of the Blair Witch mythology: Rustin Parr, Coffin Rock and Elly Kedward, respectively.
The trilogy received mixed reviews from critics, with most criticism being directed towards the very linear gameplay, clumsy controls and camera angles, and short length. The first volume, "Rustin Parr", received the most praise, ranging from moderate to positive, with critics commending its storyline, graphics and atmosphere; some reviewers even claimed the game was scarier than the movie. The following volumes were less well-received, with "PC Gamer" saying Volume 2's only saving grace was its cheap price and calling Volume 3 "amazingly mediocre".
Home media.
"The Blair Witch Project" was released on DVD on October 26, 1999, with VHS and laserdisc versions released around the same time. The DVD included a number of special features, including ""The Curse of the Blair Witch"" and ""The Blair Witch Legacy"" featurettes, newly discovered footage, director and producer commentary, production notes, cast & crew bios, and trailers.
A Blu-ray release from Lionsgate was released on October 5, 2010. Best Buy and Lionsgate had an exclusive release of the Blu-ray available on August 29, 2010.
Sequel.
A sequel, "", was released in the autumn of 2000, but was poorly received by most critics. A third installment announced that same year did not materialize.

Hsieh attended Badminton Proton Malaysia Open which is held in the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, in January. He played both events in the tournament, men singles and mix doubles. He knocked out in the first round in the mix doubles while in the men singles, he had clashed into men singles semi finals successfully. But he was knocked out 13-21 14-21 by South Korean Park Sung-hwan. This tournament can be said that Hsieh is a not bad player because he had done his all the best. In March, Hsieh attended Badminton All England Open. In this tournament, Hsieh lost to Indonesian most strongest players in the first round in both events he took. Later that, he continued his competition in Wilson Swiss Open. Hsieh is actioning much better in this tournament. He took both events also, he played until second round in mix doubles and in the men singles he was successfully played until the quarters final match. He beat India's Chetan Anand in the second round by winning rubber games 9-21 22-20 21-17. He was then stopped by China's Lin Dan 16-21 14-21 in the quarters final and ended his tournament. In early April, he went to Osaka and took part in both events to get some points to improve his world ranking. In June, Hsieh took part men singles match only in the Singapore Open. He lost to Indonesia's Sony Dwi Kuncoro 15-21 15-21 in the second round. Then, he attended Indonesian Open also in men singles only. Later, he was blew away again in the second round by China's Lin Dan with 12-21 12-21. In August, Hsieh grabbed his golden opportunity to took part in the Macau Open Grand Prix Gold competition. Hsieh clashed into the last eight in Macau. But unfornately again, he was stopped by Indonesian Taufik Hidayat 16-21 14-21 in the last eight. Later in the Chinese Taipei Open and Li Ning China Open, Hsieh again lost 17-21 21-17 20-22 to Thailand's Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk and lost 15-21 19-21 to China's Lin Dan in the second round. Then in Japan Open, he lost to Indonesian Simon Santoso 18-21 6-21 in the first round. In November, Hsieh again took both events in the Hong Kong Open Super Series. He lost to Malaysian mix doubles pairs in the qualification match and later is the surprising that he lost 13-21 9-21 to Indonesian youngster Dionysius Hayom Rumbaka in the second round. Hsieh may be did many mistakes again the Indonesian. After that, Hsieh went to the second times of China Open to play in only men singles. He was beaten by Chen Jin of China in the second round by 14-21 5-21. In December, he attended BWF World Super Series Masters Competition in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. All of the players come to this Masters Competition should win at least 2 points in the opening three rounds before clashing into the semi-finals. Hsieh had won 1 point only in his match so that he was again have nobond to play in the last four. He was only beaten former Olympic Champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia with a 21-17 21-15 win in the last round. The first round he went down 11-21 12-21 to the world number one Lee Chong Wei and in the second round he lost to Chinese ace Bao Chunlai 21-17 8-21 16-21.
2008.
He was a surprise in the Beijing 2008 men's singles tournament. He beat Kaveh Mehrabi from Iran 21-16 21-12 in the first round, Nguyen Tien Minh form Vietnam 21-16 15-21 21-15 in the second round and defeating Wong Choong Hann from Malaysia 14-21 21-17 21-18 in the third round, who has beaten Indonesian legend Taufik Hidayat with a 21-19 21-16 win in the opening round. Hsieh was stopped by Chen Jin of China 8-21 14-21 in the quarter-finals. After playing the Olympic games, he took part in the Chinese Taipei Open. In Chinese Taipei Open, he was again played back both events. He knocked out in the third round in both events that he took and he had ended the tournament. After a few days, he continued his match in the Japan Open Super Series. He took part in three events in Japan Open, men singles, men doubles and mix doubles.

Shampoo

Shampoo is a hair care product that is used for the removal of oils, dirt, skin particles, dandruff, environmental pollutants and other contaminant particles that gradually build up in hair. The goal of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up without stripping out so much sebum as to make hair unmanageable. Using shampoo also allows the hair to be nourished and healthy.
History.
The word "shampoo" in English dates to 1762, and is derived from Hindi "chāmpo" (चाँपो ), itself derived from the Sanskrit root "capayati" (चपयति, which means to press, knead, soothe). Shampoo was first introduced in Britain by a Bengali entrepreneur from Bihar named Sake 19th century. Later, Sake Dean Mahomed together with his Irish wife, opened "Mahomed's Steam and Vapour Sea Water Medicated Baths" in Brighton, England. His baths were like Turkish baths where clients received a treatment of "champi" (shampooing). Very soon due to Sake Dean Mahomed fame as a bathing expert he was appointed ‘Shampooing Surgeon’ to both George IV and William IV.
In the 1860s, the meaning of the word shifted from the sense of massage to that of applying soap to the hair. Earlier, ordinary soap had been used for 
the hair made it uncomfortable, irritating, and unhealthy looking.
During the early stages of shampoo, English hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance. Kasey Hebert was the first known maker of shampoo, and the origin is currently attributed to him. Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century. A 1914 ad for Canthrox Shampoo in "American Magazine" showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine ads in 1914 by Rexall featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo.
In 1927, liquid shampoo was invented by German inventor Hans Schwarzkopf in Berlin.
Originally, soap and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived surfactants, a type of detergent. Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with "Drene", the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap.
Composition.
Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate and/or sodium laureth sulfate with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water to form a thick, viscous liquid. Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrance. Other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities.
Many shampoos are pearlescent. This effect is achieved by addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. glycol distearate, chemically derived from stearic acid, which may have either animal or vegetable origins. Glycol distearate is a wax. Many shampoos also include silicone to provide conditioning benefits.
Ingredient and functional claims.
In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container. The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit. Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations. While the claims may be substantiated however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward. For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation. While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective. The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third party testing. Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff are regulated as OTC drugs in the US marketplace. In other parts of the world such as the EU, there is a requirement for the anti-dandruff claim to be substantiated, but it is not considered to be a medical problem.
Health risks.
Methylisothiazolinone, or MIT is an ingredient used in many commercial shampoos. MIT and its closely related analog, chloromethylisothiazolinone or CMIT, affect the ability of young or developing neurons to grow processes (axons and dendrites) in tissue culture.
Some studies have shown MIT to be allergenic and cytotoxic, and this has led to some concern over its use.
The CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association) and the European Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products Intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) both released reports stating that methylisothiazolinone poses no health risks to humans at the low concentrations (0.01%) used in finished cosmetic products.
Specialized shampoos.
Dandruff.
Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff. These contain fungicides such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide which reduce loose dander by killing "Malassezia furfur". Coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well
Colored Hair.
Many companies have also developed color-protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; many of these are shampoos will contain gentle cleansers.
Gluten or wheat free.
Many people suffer from eczema on their palms and their head. Some find that wheat and/or gluten (the protein found in many grains including wheat) is the cause, particularly if they are sensitive to this in food e.g. celiac disease wheat allergy. Shampoo can often go into the mouth, particularly for children, so all individuals who are on gluten-free diets may prefer to find a gluten-free shampoo. Shampoo manufacturers are starting to recognize this and there are now gluten/wheat free products available.
Wheat derivatives and ingredients from the other gluten grains are commonly used as binders to help the shampoo stick together and are also used as emollients in the form of oils. Following is a list of grain-derived shampoo ingredients. Most of these ingredients do not theoretically contain any intact wheat proteins, but may do so due to incomplete processing or contamination.
All-natural.
Some companies use "all-natural", "organic", "botanical" or "plant-derived" ingredients (such as plant extracts or oils), combining these additions with one or more typical surfactants.
Baby.
Shampoo for infants and young children is formulated so that it is less irritating and usually less prone to produce a stinging or burning sensation if it were to get into the eyes. For example, Johnson & Johnson's Baby Shampoo advertises under the premise of "No More Tears". This is accomplished by one or more of the following formulation strategies.
The distinction in 4 above does not completely surmount the controversy over the use of shampoo ingredients to mitigate eye sting produced by other ingredients, or the use of the products so formulated.
The considerations in 3 and 4 frequently result in a much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos, and the detergency and/or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby. The monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosity-increasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other shampoos are much less common in the better baby shampoos.
Animal.
Shampoo intended for animals may contain insecticides or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients/drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special care must be taken not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.
Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended to do more than just clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition, an allergy or to fight against fleas.
The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.
Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.
Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).
Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.
Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe Vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.
Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.
Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.
Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that are found in pet shampoos.
Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.
Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.
Solid.
Solid shampoos or shampoo bars use as their surfactants soaps or other surfactants formulated as solids. They have the advantage of being spill-proof. They are easy to apply; one may simply rub the bar over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather.
Jelly/gel.
Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's viscosity. This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair.
Paste/cream.
Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes. The contents were wet but not completely dissolved. They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly.
Antibacterial.
s are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions, as well as in humans before some surgical procedures.
No Poo Movement.
Closely associated with environmentalism, the 'No poo' movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use. Some adherents of the no-poo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey. Other people use nothing, rinsing their hair only with warm water.
Theory.
In the 1970s ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week. This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing. Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp. This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing. According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp.
Traditional and prehistoric use.
Indonesia.
Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the husk and straw ("merang") of rice. The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have alkaline properties) are mixed with water to form lather. The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry. Afterwards, coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it.
India.
In India, a variety of herbs and their extracts are used as shampoos. A very effective shampoo is made by boiling soapnuts with dried Indian gooseberry (aamla) and a few other herbs, using the strained extract. This leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing are shikakai (Acacia concinna), soapnuts (Sapindus), hibiscus flowers and arappu (Albizzia amara).
North America.
Certain Native American tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the Costanoans of present day coastal California used extracts from the coastal woodfern, "Dryopteris expansa", for a shampoo.

Rūdolfs Kundrāts

Rūdolfs Kundrāts (born 1904, date of death unknown) was a Latvian football defender, one of the most reliable in his position in Latvia in 1920s and 1930s.
Kundrāts first gained attention as a good defender when still playing with LNJS Riga in 1926, the following year he moved higher - to LSB Riga, one of the four clubs playing in the newly founded Latvian Higher League. The first two years which Kundrāts spent with LSB were relatively successful for the club as it finished third in the league on both occasions, however in 1929 LSB came out last in Virsliga and after the disappointing season Kundrāts left it for the new Virsliga side - Riga Vanderer.
While playing with Vanderer, Kundrāts became a regular player in the Latvia national football team. Over his seasons with LSB he had been called to the national team several times, yet he had not made an appearance in an international match. Kundrāts made his international début on 27 June 1930 as Latvia drew 1-1 with Estonia in Tallinn. The next year he played 6 matches for Latvia, six more followed in 1932 and six again in 1933. For the last time Kundrāts represented Latvia on 4 September 1933 as it drew 2-2 against Lithuania, securing a victory in the Baltic Cup.
With Riga Vanderer Kundrāts played until 1935 always remaining one of the club's best defenders. In 1932 and 1934 Kundrāts was a member of the team that won silver in the Latvian league, in the same years the side also won the Riga Football Cup. After retiring from active playing Kundrāts was known as one of the best football referees in Latvia.

Thoroughbred

The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. Although the word "thoroughbred" is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered "hot-blooded" horses, known for their agility, speed and spirit.
The Thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century, and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and more than 118,000 foals are registered each year worldwide.
Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting. They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones, and have been influential in the creation of the Quarter Horse, Standardbred, Anglo-Arabian, and various warmblood breeds.
Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing.
Breed characteristics.
The typical Thoroughbred ranges from high, averaging . They are most often bay, dark bay or brown, chestnut, black, or gray. Less common colors recognized in the United States include roan and palomino. White is very rare, but is a recognized color separate from gray. The face and lower legs may be marked with white, but white will generally not appear on the body. Coat patterns that have more than one color on the body, such as Pinto or Appaloosa, are not recognized by mainstream breed registries. Good-quality Thoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head on a long neck, high withers, a deep chest, a short back, good depth of hindquarters, a lean body, and long legs. Thoroughbreds are classified among the "hot-blooded" breeds, which are animals bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold.
Thoroughbreds born in the Northern Hemisphere are officially considered a year older on the first of January each year; those born in the Southern Hemisphere officially are one year older on the first of August. These artificial dates have been set to enable the standardization of races and other competitions for horses in certain age groups.
Terminology.
The Thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse, although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a "thoroughbred". The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is "purebred". While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's General Stud Book was one of the first breed registries created, in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a "thoroughbred" except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed. Nonetheless, breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably, though "thoroughbred" is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species. The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed, though often not capitalized, especially in non-specialist publications, and outside the US. For example, the Australian Stud Book, "The New York Times", and the BBC do not capitalize the word.
History.
Beginnings in England.
Early racing.
Flat racing existed in England by at least 1174, when four-mile races took place at Smithfield, in London. Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the Middle Ages and into the reign of King James I of England. It was then that handicapping, a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures, began to be used. During the reigns of Charles II, William III, Anne, and George I, the foundation of the Thoroughbred was laid. Under James' grandson, Charles II, a keen racegoer and owner, and James' great-granddaughter Queen Anne, royal support was given to racing and the breeding of race horses. With royal support, horse racing became popular with the public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted to racing, the "Racing Calendar", was founded. Devoted exclusively to the sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.
Foundation stallions.
All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the Byerley Turk (1680s), the Darley Arabian (1704), and the Godolphin Arabian (1729). Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential, but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed. These included the Alcock's Arabian, D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb. Another was the Brownlow Turk, who, among other attributes, is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds. In all, about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred. The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines, whether Arabian, Barb, or Turk, to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses. According to Peter Willett, about 50% of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines, with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding.
Each of the three major foundation sires was, coincidentally, the ancestor of a grandson or great-great-grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse's male line: Matchem was the only descendant of his grandsire, the Godolphin Arabian, to maintain a male line to the present; the Byerley Turk's male line was preserved by Herod (or King Herod), a great-great-grandson; and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great-great-grandson Eclipse, who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated. One genetic study indicates that 95% of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line (via the Y chromosome) to the Darley Arabian. However, in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees, most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian (13.8%) than to the Darley Arabian (6.5%) when all lines of descent (maternal and paternal) are considered. Further, as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines, Curwen's Bay Barb (4.2%) appears more often than the Byerley Turk (3.3%). The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only 27 or 28 stallions from the 18th and 19th centuries.
Foundation mares.
The mares used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds, some of which, such as the Irish Hobby, had developed in northern Europe prior to the 13th century. Other mares were of oriental breeding, including Barb, Turk and other bloodlines, although most researchers conclude that the number of Eastern mares imported into England during the 100 years after 1660 was small. The 19th century researcher Bruce Lowe identified 50 mare "families" in the Thoroughbred breed, later augmented by other researchers to 74. However, it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than Lowe identified. Recent studies of the mtDNA of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor; in 19 mare lines studied, the haplotypes revealed that they traced to only 15 unique foundation mares, suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB.
Later development in Britain.
By the end of the 18th century, the English Classic races had been established. These are the St. Leger Stakes, founded in 1776, the Epsom Oaks, founded in 1779, and the Epsom Derby in 1780. Later, the 2,000 Guineas Stakes and the 1,000 Guineas Stakes were founded in 1809 and 1814. The 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to fillies, but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years. The distances of these races, ranging from to , led to a change in breeding practices, as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed. In the early 18th century, the emphasis had been on longer races, up to , that were run in multiple heats. The older style of race favored older horses, but with the change in distances, younger horses became preferred.
Selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in the size of horses and winning times by the middle of the 19th century. Bay Middleton, a winner of the Epsom Derby, stood over 16 hands high, a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian. Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible. This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a mid-grade runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil. The race was over , and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying more than Asil, he still managed to beat Asil by 20 lengths. An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing, but also for steeplechasing. Up until the end of the 19th century, Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses.
Soon after the start of the 20th century, fears that the English races would be overrun with American-bred Thoroughbreds because of the closing of US racetracks in the early 1910s, led to the Jersey Act of 1913. It prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book (GSB) if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB. This excluded most American-bred horses, because the 100-year gap between the founding of the GSB and the American Stud Book meant that most American-bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in the GSB. The act was not repealed until 1949, after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book. Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside the British Isles.
In America.
The first Thoroughbred horse in the American Colonies was Bulle Rock, imported in 1730 by Samuel Gist of Hanover County, Virginia. Maryland and Virginia were the centers of Colonial Thoroughbred breeding, along with South Carolina and New York. During the American Revolution importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty. Two important stallions were imported around the time of the Revolution; Messenger in 1788 and Diomed before that. Messenger left little impact on the American Thoroughbred, but is considered a foundation sire of the Standardbred breed. Diomed, who won the Derby Stakes in 1780, had a significant impact on American Thoroughbred breeding, mainly through his son Sir Archy. John F. Wall, a racing historian, said that Sir Archy was the "first outstanding stallion we can claim as native American." He was retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents.
After the American Revolution, the center of Thoroughbred breeding and racing in the United States moved west. Kentucky and Tennessee became notable centers. Andrew Jackson, later President of the United States, was a breeder and racer of Thoroughbreds in Tennessee. Famous match races held in the early 19th century helped popularize horse racing in the United States. One took place in 1823, in Long Island, New York, between Sir Henry and American Eclipse. Another was a match race between Boston and Fashion in 1838 that featured bets of $20,000 from each side. The last major match races before the American Civil War were both between Lexington and Lecompte. The first was held in 1854 in New Orleans and was won by Lecompte. Lexington's owner then challenged Lecompte's owner to a rematch, held in 1855 in New Orleans and won by Lexington. Both of these horses were sons of Boston, a descendant of Sir Archy. Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion, and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years, fourteen of them in a row.
After the American Civil War, the emphasis in American racing changed from the older style of four-mile (6 km) races in which the horses ran in at least two heats. The new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats, over distances from five furlongs up to . This development meant a change in breeding practices, as well as the age that horses were raced, with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore. It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race. Iroquois became the first American-bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881. The success of American-bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in 1913, which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England. After World War I, the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England, and this trend continued past World War II. After World War II, Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky, but California, New York, and Florida also emerged as important racing and breeding centers.
Thoroughbreds in the United States have historically been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was the foundation of the Standardbred, and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental in the development of the American Quarter Horse. The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred. Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service, which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts.
In Europe.
Thoroughbreds began to be imported to France in 1817 and 1818 with the importation of a number of stallions from England, but initially the sport of horse racing did not prosper in France. The first Jockey Club in France was not formed until 1833, and in 1834 the racing and regulation functions were split off to a new society, the "Societe d'Encouragement pour l'Amelioration des Races de Chevaux en France", better known as the Jockey-Club de Paris. The "French Stud Book" was founded at the same time by the government. By 1876, French-bred Thoroughbreds were regularly winning races in England, and in that year a French breeder-owner earned the most money in England on the track. World War I almost destroyed French breeding because of war damage and lack of races. After the war, the premier French race, the Grand Prix, resumed and continues to this day. During World War II, French Thoroughbred breeding did not suffer as it had during the first World War, and thus was able to compete on an equal footing with other countries after the war.
Organized racing in Italy started in 1837, when race meets were established in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in 1842. Modern flat racing came to Rome in 1868. Later importations, including the Derby Stakes winners Ellington (1856) and Melton (1885), came to Italy before the end of the 19th century. Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of Federico Tesio, who started his breeding program in 1898. Tesio was the breeder of Nearco, one of the dominant sires of Thoroughbreds in the later part of the 20th century.
Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs, including Germany, Russia, Poland, and Hungary. However, none of these countries have made a large mark on the breeding of Thoroughbreds.
In Australia and New Zealand.
Horses arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 along with the earliest colonists. Although horses of part-Thoroughbred blood were imported into Australia during the late 18th century, it is thought that the first pureblood Thoroughbred was a stallion named Northumberland who was imported from England in 1802 as a coach horse sire. By 1810, the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney, and by 1825 the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there. In 1825, the Sydney Turf Club, the first true racing club in Australia, was formed. Throughout the 1830s, the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds, almost exclusively for racing purposes, and to improve the local stock. Each colony formed its own racing clubs and held its own races. Gradually, the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization, now known as the Australian Racing Board. Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the 1840s and 1850s, with the first direct importation from England occurring in 1862.
In other areas.
Thoroughbreds have been exported to many other areas of the world since the breed was created. Oriental horses were imported into South Africa from the late 17th century in order to improve the local stock through crossbreeding. Horse racing was established there in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and Thoroughbreds were imported in increasing numbers. The first Thoroughbred stallions arrived in Argentina in 1853, but the first mares did not arrive until 1865. The Argentine Stud Book was first published in 1893. Thoroughbreds were imported into Japan from 1895, although it was not until after World War II that Japan began a serious breeding and racing business involving Thoroughbreds.
Registration, breeding, and population.
About 37,000 Thoroughbred foals are registered each year in North America, with the largest numbers being registered in the states of Kentucky, Florida and California. Australia is the second largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the world with almost 30,000 broodmares producing about 18,250 foals annually. Britain produces about 5,000 foals a year, and worldwide, there are more than 195,000 active broodmares, or females being used for breeding, and 118,000 newly registered foals in 2006 alone. The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness, generating around $34 billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about 470,000 jobs through a network of farms, training centers and race tracks.
Unlike a significant number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by "live cover", the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.
Concern exists that the closed stud book and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of the level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30 foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages. Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line, called the "distaff" line. The line that a horse comes from will often determine the price paid regardless of the actual talent or potential of the horse.
Value.
Prices of Thoroughbreds vary greatly, depending on age, pedigree, conformation, and other market factors. In 2007, Keeneland Sales, a United States based sales company, sold 9,124 horses at auction, with a total value of $814,401,000, which gives an average price of $89,259. As a whole for the United States in 2007, The Jockey Club auction statistics indicated that the average weanling sold for $44,407, the average yearling sold for $55,300, average sale price for two-year-olds was $61,843, broodmares averaged $70,150, and horses over two and broodmare prospects sold for an average of $53,243. For Europe, the July 2007 Tattersall's Sale sold 593 horses at auction, with a total for the sale of 10,951,300 guineas, for an average of 18,468 guineas. Also in 2007, Doncaster Bloodstock Sales, another British sales firm, sold 2,248 horses for a total value of 43,033,881 guineas, making an average of 15,110 guineas per horse. Australian prices at auction during the 2007-2008 racing and breeding season were as follows: 1,223 Australian weanlings sold for a total of $31,352,000, an average of $25,635 each. 4,903 yearlings sold for a total value of A$372,003,961, an average of A$75,853. Five hundred two-year-olds sold for A$13,030,150, an average of A$26,060, and 2,118 broodmares totalled A$107,720,775, an average of A$50,860.
Averages, however, can be deceiving. For example, at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland, 3,799 young horses sold for a total of $385,018,600, for an average of $101,347 per horse. However, that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece.
The highest price paid at auction for a Thoroughbred was set in 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The Green Monkey. Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not necessarily reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The Green Monkey, injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race. Conversely, even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat. The best-known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, exported to Japan to stand at stud, but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002, presumably for pet food.
However, the value of a Thoroughbred may also be influenced by the purse money it wins. In 2007, Thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of $1,217,854,602 in all placings, an average earnings per starter of $16,924. In addition, the track record of a race horse may influence its future value as a breeding animal.
Stud fees for stallions that enter breeding can range from $2,500 to $500,000 per mare in the United States, and from ₤2000 pounds to £75,000 pounds or more in Britain. The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s, when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $1 million. During the 2008 Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A$110,000 or more, with the highest fee in the nation at A$302,500.
Uses.
Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for racing, the breed is also used for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses. The larger horses are sought after for hunter/jumper and dressage competitions, whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies.
Horse racing.
Thoroughbred horses are primarily bred for racing under saddle at the gallop. Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects what they have been bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while "stayers", or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer. The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse. Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16.2 hands, down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1, the best racehorses are generally of average size. Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness. Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate. Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size: the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3 hands high. By 1876 this had increased to 15.3.
In 2007, there were 71,959 horses who started in races in the United States, and the average Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States and Canada ran 6.33 times in that year. In Australia, there were 31,416 horses in training during 2007, and those horses started 194,066 times for A$375,512,579 of prize money. During 2007, in Japan, there were 23,859 horses in training and those horses started 182,614 times for A$857,446,268 of prize money. In Britain, the British Racing Authority states there were 8,556 horses in training for flat racing for 2007, and those horses started 60,081 times in 5,659 races.
Statistically, fewer than 50% of all race horses ever win a race, and less than 1% ever win a stakes race such as the Kentucky Derby or the Epsom Derby. Any horse who has yet to win a race is known as a maiden.
Horses finished with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist to help make the transition from the racetrack to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses.
Other disciplines.
In addition to racing, Thoroughbreds compete in eventing, show jumping and dressage at the highest levels of international competition, including the Olympics. They are also used as show hunters, steeplechasers, and in western riding speed events such as barrel racing. Mounted police divisions employ them in non-competitive work, and recreational riders also use them. Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in polo in the United States. They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well.
Crossbreeding.
Thoroughbreds are often crossed with horses of other breeds to create new breeds or to enhance or introduce specific qualities into existing ones. They have been influential on many modern breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, the Standardbred, and possibly the Morgan, a breed that went on to influence many of the gaited breeds in North America. Other common crosses with the Thoroughbred include crossbreeding with Arabian bloodlines to produce the Anglo-Arabian as well as with the Irish Draught to produce the Irish Sport Horse. Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various Warmblood breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities.
Health issues.
Although Thoroughbreds are seen in the hunter-jumper world and in other disciplines, modern Thoroughbreds are primarily bred for speed, and racehorses have a very high rate of accidents as well as other health problems.
One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems, including fractures. Current estimates indicate that there are 1.5 career-ending breakdowns for every 1,000 horses starting a race in the United States, an average of two horses per day. The State of California reported a particularly high rate of injury, 3.5 per 1000 starts. Other countries report lower rates of injury, with the United Kingdom having 0.9 injuries/1,000 starts (1990–1999) and the courses in Victoria, Australia, producing a rate of 0.44 injuries/1,000 starts (1989–2004). Thoroughbreds also have other health concerns, including a majority of animals who are prone to bleeding from the lungs (exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage), 10% with low fertility, and 5% with abnormally small hearts. Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds, with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass, which contributes to foot soreness, the most common source of lameness in racehorses.
Selective breeding.
One argument for the health issues involving Thoroughbreds suggests that inbreeding is the culprit. It has also been suggested that capability for speed is enhanced in an already swift animal by raising muscle mass, a form of selective breeding that has created animals designed to win horse races. Thus, according to one postulation, the modern Thoroughbred travels faster than its skeletal structure can support. Veterinarian Robert Miller states that "We have selectively bred for speeds that the anatomy of the horse cannot always cope with."
Poor breeding may be encouraged by the fact that many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.
Excess stress.
A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, particularly in the United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.
Studies have shown that track surfaces, horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal medications, and high-intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate. One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks, and one of the first tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004–05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation. The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing.
Medical challenges.
The level of treatment given to injured Thoroughbreds is often more intensive than for horses of lesser financial value but also controversial, due in part to the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries. Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, laminitis, and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's "bed rest" because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion.
Whenever a racing accident severely injures a well-known horse, such as the major leg fractures that led to the euthanization of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro, or 2008 Kentucky Derby runner-up Eight Belles, animal rights groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry. On the other hand, advocates of racing argue that without horse racing, far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses. Although horse racing is hazardous, veterinary science has advanced. Previously hopeless cases can now be treated, and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like scintigraphy can keep at-risk horses off the track.

<doc id="18842058" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18842058" title="Norman Osborn">
Norman Osborn

Norman Osborn is a fictional character, a supervillain who appears in the comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #14 (July 1964). Although many have taken up this identity, he is the original and most well-known Green Goblin. Originally an amoral industrialist head of Oscorp and Harry Osborn's father, he took a serum which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect but also drove him to insanity. He adopted a Halloween-themed appearance, dressing in a goblin costume, riding on a bat-shaped "Goblin Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably grenade-like "Pumpkin Bombs", to terrorize New York City. He is one of Spider-Man's most persistent foes and archenemies, being responsible for numerous tragedies in Spider-Man's life, such as Gwen Stacy's death and the Clone Saga. However, he has also come into conflict with other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and was the focus of the company-wide "Dark Reign" storyline as the original Iron Patriot.
Norman Osborn was played by Willem Dafoe in the 2002 film "Spider-Man" as the main antagonist, and will be portrayed by Chris Cooper in the upcoming 2014 film "The Amazing Spider-Man 2". 
In 2009, Norman Osborn was also ranked as IGN's 13th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. 
Publication history.
According to Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin, as we know him, was entirely his creation. He claims: 
The Green Goblin debuted in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #14. At this time, his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his secret identity. Apparently, Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be. According to one theory, Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger, feeling this was closer to real life. Ditko has refuted this rumor, however, claiming: 
Ditko left the series with issue #38, before he could reveal Green Goblin's identity, and Lee subsequently unmasked him in the next issue as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced two issues earlier as Harry Osborn's father. John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalls: 
After the Green Goblin killed Gwen Stacy, writer Gerry Conway decided that Green Goblin had to pay a heavy price. Osborn accidentally caused his own death in the course of a fight against Spider-Man. Others, such as Harry, later adopted the Green Goblin identity, and writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy.
However, Osborn would loom over the history of the Spider-Man franchise. In particular, the character (originally portrayed as a loving but distant workaholic father who gave his son money and material possessions to make up for how he was never there for his son physically) would be recast as a physically and emotionally abusive father to Harry. One whose disdain for his son would lead to Harry suffering crippling mental problems, leading to him taking up the Green Goblin mantle himself and ultimately his own demise.
Return.
During the Clone Saga storyline, the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone Ben Reilly as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use Mephisto, but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed. It was then suggested that the semi-zombified cyborg known as "Gaunt" be revealed as Harry Osborn who was killed in "Spectacular Spider-Man" #200. Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone and resuming his father's Green Goblin identity full-time. However, the plotline was changed by newly promoted editor in chief Bob Harras, who disliked Harry's character, and instead chose Norman be the mastermind, revealing Gaunt as Mendel Stromm.
Osborn would return in "Peter Parker: Spider-Man" #75, revealing himself as the mastermind behind the Clone Saga as revenge for his son's death. Though Osborn was blown up at the end of the issue, he recovered and returned to his life but without his Green Goblin identity. The character instead would attack Spider-Man through minions and smear campaigns designed to make him seem to be a monster. However, he would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.
Norman Osborn appears in the first arc of the comic series "The Pulse". In "The Pulse" #1-5, Luke Cage confronts Osborn after he murders a reporter investigating a series of murders committed by the villain. In the ensuing struggle, Norman kills more than a dozen police officers and nearly kills Jessica Jones (Cage's pregnant fiancé) before being brought down by Cage. In the process, Osborn is once again exposed to be the Green Goblin, having sued writer Phil Urich after his return over a book he wrote during the period he was presumed dead.
New roles.
Following the "Civil War" story arc, Warren Ellis began writing "Thunderbolts", and Osborn was brought into the title as the director of the team. He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to "Thunderbolts" editor Molly Lazer, "was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he's in the book!" Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying, "all I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... [Joe Quesada] talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing." Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the Commission on Superhuman Activities, giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted: "He's a free man with a lot of power ... And his agenda, well, it's not that secret. He wants to get Spider-Man."
Writer Christos Gage took over for the Secret Invasion tie-in stories, which ended with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the Skrulls, after he killed the Skrull queen Veranke. This allowed the character to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath Dark Reign. Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, Brian Michael Bendis, "Secret Invasion"'s writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis: "While I was putting it together, Warren "Thunderbolts" run made it very clear that if one would choose to do so, Norman was on track to head toward this kind of storyline, very organically, very in-character, and very much within the realm of what was going on." Bendis stated, "Norman's team is made up of people who are outstanding at what they do. These are bad-ass, hardcore get-it-done types. They'll close the door and take care of business, and he's dressing them up to make them something that the people want."
Meanwhile, Andy Diggle took over the writing of "Thunderbolts". He introduced new characters to serve as Osborn's black ops team, explaining, "Norman selected agents with stealth, infiltration and assassination skills rather than overt flying-and-fighting type powers" and "now that he's reached a higher level, he's reconfiguring the Thunderbolts into something much more covert and much more lethal: his own personal hit squad." Diggle's Osborn is still mad: "To quote the movie "Speed", he's 'crazy, not stupid.' He's clearly fiercely intelligent and a natural born leader, with the ego and competitive drive to succeed against all odds. He also just happens to be crazy as a shithouse rat." He describes his take on Osborn: "I think the secret to understanding Norman is that he doesn't realize he's the villain. He thinks he's the hero. He truly believes that he deserves public adulation, and it bugs the hell out of him that so-called 'superheroes' are getting it instead of him."
He appeared as a regular character in the "Dark Avengers" series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010), as well as the mini-series "Siege", which saw Norman being arrested for the crimes committed by him following the events of Civil War storyline. At this point, the character was officially reclassified as an Avengers villain and only made three minor appearances in "Amazing Spider-Man". The first was "Brand New Ways To Die", which ran from "Amazing Spider-Man" #570-573 and featured Norman and the Thunderbolts versus Spider-Man and the original Venom. His second appearance was "Amazing Spider-Man" #580, which explained that, following Mephisto's alteration of Spider-Man's past, Norman's return was significantly altered. He had returned earlier than he had originally returned and that he had arranged for his son Harry's death to be faked with help from Mysterio, due to his concern for his son's mental well being after once again became the Green Goblin. His final appearance was in "Amazing Spider-Man" #595-599: in this storyline, Norman attempts to convince his son to become a super-hero so that he can kill him off and exploit his demise. It also revealed that he was sleeping with the super-villain Menace (Harry's ex-girlfriend), with Norman believing that the villan's child she was carrying was his.
A five issue mini-series followed, written by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Rios. The mini-series would lead into a duel storyline running in the pages of "New Avengers" #17-24 and "Avengers" #18-24, in which the character formed a new version of the Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a Super-Adaptoid.
Fictional character biography.
Pre-Goblin years.
Norman Osborn was born in New Haven, Connecticut as the son of industrialist Ambrose Osborn. Although Ambrose was a brilliant student in the fields of science, he was also an alcoholic who lost control of his company and was abusive toward his family. In one incident, Ambrose locked Norman in one of the Osborn family's empty estates in an attempt to toughen his son. It was in that darkened mansion that Norman felt haunted by a "green, goblin-like" creature that was "waiting to pounce on him." All of these events had a severe impact on Norman, planting the seeds of the megalomaniac he would eventually become. Norman would stop at nothing to regain the wealth that his father had lost.
In college, where he studies chemistry and electrical engineering, Norman meets his sweetheart Emily, gets married, and eventually has a son whom he names Harry. In his adulthood, he co-founds a major firm with his former professor Mendel Stromm called Oscorp Industries, of which he is owner and president. However, Emily becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old. This tragedy pushes Norman to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect Harry. Hoping to gain more control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accuses Stromm of embezzlement and has him arrested. Norman then searches Stromm's possessions, discovering an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula. When Osborn attempts to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities, but also drives him to destructive insanity.
Enter the Green Goblin.
Norman Osborn adopts the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin with the goal of becoming boss of the city's organized crime. He intends to cement his position by defeating Spider-Man. As the Green Goblin, he would bedevil Spider-Man many times but fail to achieve his goal. Stromm soon returns and attempts revenge with an army of robots, but apparently dies of a heart attack after Osborn tries to shoot him through the window. Osborn discovers that college student Peter Parker, a classmate of Harry's, is Spider-Man after exposing Spider-Man to a gas that weakens his spider-sense with the aid of a gang of ordinary crooks, and allows him to be observed. Osborn captures Parker after knocking him out with an asphyxiation grenade, catching him off-guard at home and concerned for Aunt May. The Green Goblin bound Peter with a steel rope and took him to his waterfront base. He then ties him to a steel chair with the intention of torturing Peter with suspense, revealing his identity to the world, and killing Peter while he is completely helpless and at his mercy. He reveals his true identity and origin to Peter, who stalls Osborn long enough to free one hand. Seeing this, The Green Goblin releases Spider-Man for what he intends to be their climactic battle. Spider-Man defeats Osborn, who loses his memory after being knocked into a mass of electrical wires, and destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire.
Osborn is troubled by repressed memories of the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. A presentation on supervillains by NYPD Captain George Stacy restores Osborn's memory, but after a brief return to his Green Goblin persona, in which he abducts Parker's friends and threatens Parker's elderly Aunt May, he is exposed to one of his own "psychedelic bombs", inducing another amnesia spell. In "The Amazing Spider-Man" #96, Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which again restores his memory. The Goblin battles Spider-Man in this and the following two issues, until Spider-Man leads Osborn to see his son Harry Osborn hospitalized, overdosed on drugs. The shock causes Osborn's amnesia to return yet again.
In issue #121 (June 1973), his memory having been regained, the Green Goblin throws Parker's love, Gwen Stacy, from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text). She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: "It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her." The following issue, the Goblin appears to accidentally kill himself in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man when he is impaled by his Glider.
Years after Gwen's death, it is revealed that Osborn had a one-night stand with Gwen after she's overwhelmed by his charisma which in turn leads to her pregnancy with his twin children, Gabriel and Sarah. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent her talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself thus becoming his ideal heirs. The only person who knew of their liaison and the existence of their children was Mary Jane Watson, who despises Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he is the villainous Green Goblin.
Return.
The Green Goblin formula endowed Osborn with a healing factor that allowed him to circumvent his otherwise certain death. Osborn, no longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, escapes from a morgue and goes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed. He becomes the leader of the Scrier cabal, which he utilizes to carry out revenge on Parker using Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller, the Jackal, and Mendel Stromm, who is now the cyborg-like Gaunt, as his pawns. It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker during the controversial 1990s storyline the "Clone Saga", in which a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by the Jackal and dubbed Ben Reilly, returns to New York City. Osborn reemerges in Parker's life, and initially convinces Parker that Parker is the clone and Reilly the original. When Parker learns the truth, Osborn kills Reilly, the real clone. It is later revealed that he also raises his illegitimate children, Gabriel and Sarah, while in Europe and tells them that Peter Parker is their father and murdered their mother as Spider-Man.
The returned Osborn regains control of his business. He uses a Goblin stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin. He also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley, the original Hobgoblin, and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter's corporate empire in retaliation for raiding the Goblin arsenal and identity. Osborn joins a cult hoping to receive great power but instead goes further into madness. Osborn comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of this roundelay, and declares a truce.
Osborn's identity as the Green Goblin is revealed to the public through an investigation by the "Daily Bugle" after Osborn murders one of its reporters. After a battle with Spider-Man and Luke Cage, Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time. Regardless, Osborn masterminds a plot that forces Spider-Man himself to help him escape. Osborn escapes to Paris but is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Rise and fall.
Osborn attempts to distance himself from his Green Goblin persona after being prescribed medication. During the "Civil War" over the Superhuman Registration Act, Osborn is appointed director of the superhero team the Thunderbolts, now tasked to apprehend anyone who resists registering. During the "Secret Invasion" by the shape-shifting alien race the Skrulls, Osborn kills the Skrull queen Veranke, leader of the invasion, by shooting her. He leverages this widely publicized success in defeating the Skrulls to replace Iron Man as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., which he in turn replaces with a paramilitary force he uses to advance his agenda, while using his public image to start a new team of Avengers using some of the former members of the Thunderbolts: Moonstone (Ms. Marvel), Bullseye (Hawkeye) and Venom (Spider-Man), as well as Daken (Wolverine), Noh-Varr (Captain Marvel), Ares and Sentry whom Osborn manipulated into helping further his cause. Osborn himself leads the team as the "Iron Patriot", a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man's armor with Captain America's American flag colors. Osborn simultaneously formed an alliance called the Cabal with Doctor Doom, Emma Frost, Namor, Loki and the Hood, but this 'alliance' quickly falls apart when Namor and Frost betrayed the Cabal to aid the X-Men.
His attempts to exert his authority were increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes. This includes Tony Stark tricking Osborn into attacking him while Stark was suffering from brain damage in his original suit of armor- thus showing Osborn brutally assaulting a man physically and mentally incapable of even attempting to strike back-, and the New Avengers using a tracking device Osborn had planted in Luke Cage to trick Osborn into blowing up his own house. Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, the Sentry causes Asgard to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Steve Rogers, Stark removes the Iron Patriot's armor remotely, revealing Osborn's green facepaint with yellow paint to create a goblin-like look. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg, and is incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, where he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world.
Prison break.
When transferred to a secret underwater government base, Osborn takes steps to ensure his release from prison, where he meets June Covington and Ai Apaec. He uses a group of followers as the 'Green Goblin Cult' to break out with the aid of corrupt senators, planning to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a 'champion' of the judicial system.
After the breakout he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised' Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates new Dark Avengers: June Covington (Scarlet Witch), Ai Apaec (Spider-Man), Barney Barton (Hawkeye), Skaar (Hulk), Superia (Ms. Marvel), Gorgon (Wolverine), and an A.I.M. rebuilt Ragnarok (Thor).
In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals he has the Super-Adaptoid's powers and declares himself the head of world security and orders the Avengers arrested for war crimes. Revealing himself as Captain America's double agent, Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body. This overloads him with superpowers, placing him in a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up his leftover resources and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded.
Later after Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) returned to New York, a nurse and doctor are called to Norman's hospital room only to find him gone.
The Goblin King.
When the children that work for Vulture are discussing what to do after Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) had brutally defeated Vulture, Green Goblin approaches them and tells them that he will be the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs, the henchmen having escaped as Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals. As he builds this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, Green Goblin takes up his new alias of the "Goblin King". The Hand ninjas that evaded capture made it to the sewers and joined up with Goblin King's Goblin Underground. They are rejoiced by the news that thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, Goblin King now owns over the half of New York's organized crime claiming that he now owns New York City as the "Goblin Kingpin of Crime."
With the help of Menace, the Goblin King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport and upgrades his armor and weapons. Goblin King asks only that Urich dedicate his only identity from here on as the "Goblin Knight". Goblin King trains Goblin Knight anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as Hobgoblin and is sighted by some of the Spiderlings.
Upon Carlie Cooper being brought to the Goblin King's lair by Menace, he receives Carlie's journal from Menace which reveals to him that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body. Goblin King later douses Carlie with the Goblin formula, causing her to mutate into a new superhuman villain whom he dubs Monster. He demands to know Spider-Man's identity, but Monster first asks Goblin King to reveal his own identity. Goblin King assures her he is Norman Osborn, but refuses to remove his mask until she has proven herself a loyal follower, and dispatches her and Menace on a mission. The Goblin King battles and kills the original Hobgoblin, although it is revealed to be Claude, Roderick Kingsley's butler, who was acting under his master's orders, as Kingsley is still in hiding abroad.
Powers, abilities, and weaknesses.
Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor Mendel Stromm. The process granted Osborn superhuman agility, strength, speed, stamina, and dexterity.
In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.
Weapons as the Iron Patriot.
During the events of the "Dark Reign" storyline, Osborn created the identity of the Iron Patriot (an amalgam of Iron Man and Captain America) to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized an outdated version of Iron Man's armor painted in Captain America's colors. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While the original Iron Man armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn's design does not; Stark destroyed all but one repulsor, and stated that "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. The star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest, because of its shape, also has a less powerful output than that of the original Iron Man model.
Powers and weaknesses as the Super-Adaptoid.
Following his time in prison, A.I.M scientists converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, and he was able to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.
He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.
However, Osborn had no control over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would automatically absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him becoming comatose.
Mental illness and other weaknesses.
Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression. He has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, multiple-personality disorder (for some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities, his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses while his other side was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry, although his anger over his son's failing health as 'Norman' helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, his other side never reappearing after he was believed dead). He is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.
In "Thunderbolts", Norman Osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness.
Superhuman psychologist Leonard Samson says of Osborn: "In clinical terms, the words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet."
There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes, transferring blame for his shortcomings to others or claiming that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father. Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself. He also missed the opportunity to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual – which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively – only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians "wouldn't" threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.
It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be just as (if not more) evil and cruel. Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism. While he was in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. As director of the Avengers, he allowed Bullseye to continue to function as an Avenger, even after Bullseye allowed over thirty innocent bystanders to be killed during a skirmish with a supervillain. As director of H.A.M.M.E.R., he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy Pepper Potts was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue armor. Because these actions threatened the hero persona he had carefully crafted some in the media began to see him for what he really was, and many of his highly-credible former enemies spoke out against him. His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of "Dark Avengers", where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, "Why won't this face come off...?", and finally took over when Osborn's Iron Patriot armor was defeated by Captain America and Iron Man at the end of the "Siege" arc.
Other Goblins.
While Norman Osborn was presumed dead, several other villains and one hero took up the Green Goblin mantles. Other villains have also created separate, but similar, Goblin identities.
In other media.
Norman Osborn has appeared in many Spider-Man related media albeit usually appears as Green Goblin but occasionally appears within other Marvel media separately.

Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869

The Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869 (32 & 33 Vict. c. 17) was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It was the first Act to protect wild birds in that country.
History.
In 1868, Professor Alfred Newton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science on the "On the Zoological Aspect of the Game Laws". In particular, he urged for protection of birds of prey and seabirds during the breeding season. The British Association appointed a committee to propose a close season. The committee consisted of Frank Buckland, Henry Eeles Dresser, William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and Henry Baker Tristram. James Edmund Harting was later co-opted onto the committee.
Newton's speech cited the destruction of seabirds on the Isle of Wight and Flamborough Head. Wide publicity of his speech led to public condemnation of the residents of Bridlington. Rev. Henry Frederick Barnes-Lawrence of Bridlington Priory held a meeting of local clergy and naturalists and formed the Association for the Protection of Sea-Birds. Barnes-Lawrence's Association had the support of Francis Orpen Morris, William Thomson, Archbishop of York, and local MP Christopher Sykes.
As with many animal welfare laws before 1900, the animals' safety was not the main reason for the act. Seabirds were useful to sailors to warn of land in bad weather. If a boat was in fog and the sailors could hear seabirds nearby then they would know that they were near land. If the population of seabirds declined then they would not have this early warning system.
The Act.
The act was introduced by Christopher Sykes (MP), Mr Clay and Mr Ward Jackson on behalf of the Association for the Protection of Sea-Birds. It was designed to reduce the effects of shooting and egg collecting during the breeding season. It gave limited protection to "the different species of auk, bonxie, Cornish chough, coulterneb, diver, eider duck, fulmar, gannet, grebe, guillemot, gull, kittiwake, loon, marrot, merganser, murre, oyster catcher, petrel, puffin, razor bill, scout, seamew, sea parrot, sea swallow, shearwater, shelldrake, skua, smew, solan goose, tarrock, tern, tystey, willock".

<doc id="18842088" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18842088" title="Hypocrisy">
Hypocrisy

Hypocrisy is the state of falsely claiming to possess virtuous characteristics that one lacks. Hypocrisy involves the deception of others and is thus a kind of lie.
Hypocrisy is not simply failing to practice those virtues that one preaches. Samuel Johnson made this point when he wrote about the misuse of the charge of "hypocrisy" in "Rambler No. 14":
Thus, an alcoholic's advocating temperance, for example, would not be considered an act of hypocrisy as long as the alcoholic made no pretense of sobriety.
Etymology.
The word "hypocrisy" comes from the Greek ὑπόκρισις ("hypokrisis"), which means "jealous", "play-acting", "acting out", "coward" or "dissembling". The word "hypocrite" is from the Greek word ὑποκρίτης ("hypokritēs"), the agentive noun associated with υποκρίνομαι (hypokrinomai κρίση, "judgment" »κριτική (kritiki), "critics") presumably because the performance of a dramatic text by an actor was to involve a degree of interpretation, or assessment.
Alternatively, the word is an amalgam of the Greek prefix "hypo-", meaning "under", and the verb "krinein", meaning "to sift or decide". Thus the original meaning implied a deficiency in the ability to sift or decide. This deficiency, as it pertains to one's own beliefs and feelings, informs the word's contemporary meaning.
Whereas "hypokrisis" applied to any sort of public performance (including the art of rhetoric), "hypokrites" was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens in the 4th century BC, for example, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed his rival Aeschines, who had been a successful actor before taking up politics, as a "hypocrites" whose skill at impersonating characters on stage made him an untrustworthy politician. This negative view of the "hypokrites," perhaps combined with the Roman disdain for actors, later shaded into the originally neutral "hypokrisis." It is this later sense of "hypokrisis" as "play-acting", i.e., the assumption of a counterfeit persona, that gives the modern word "hypocrisy" its negative connotation.

Jung on the General Hypocrisy of Man.
C. G. Jung a few times referred to the hypocrisy of people who are not aware of the dark or shadow-side of their nature.
Every individual needs revolution, inner division, overthrow of the existing order, and renewal, but not by forcing them upon his neighbors under the hypocritical cloak of Christian love or the sense of social responsibility or any of the other beautiful euphemisms for unconscious urges to personal power (Jung, 1966:5).
It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one's personality, otherwise the repressed elements will only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive. If people can be educated to see the shadow-side of their nature clearly, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more self-knowledge can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures (Jung, 1966:par. 28).
In "New Paths in Psychology" (1916) Jung pointedly referred to the "hypocritical pretenses of man".
Dream-analysis above all else mercilessly uncovers the lying morality and hypocritical pretences of man, showing him, for once, the other side of his character in the most vivid light (Jung, 1966:par. 437).
Jung omitted this characterization from his later essay "On the Psychology of the Unconscious" (1943), which developed out of the former.

Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846

The Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846 (formally" "An Act for regulating the Gauge of Railways"; 18 August 1846) introduced mandated standard gauges of for Great Britain, and for Ireland. The gauge, designed by I.K. Brunel when engineering the Great Western Railway, was limited to the south west of England. The law stated that these railways "shall be constructed on the Gauge of Seven Feet". This isolation ultimately marked the end for Brunel's broad gauge system.

Electoral district of Bellarine

The Electoral district of Bellarine is an electoral district of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. The electorate contains some of the eastern suburbs of Geelong and much of the Bellarine Peninsula after which the electorate is named.
The seat was first created in a redistribution prior to the 1967 election but was abolished and replaced by Geelong East and South Barwon in 1976. It was revived prior to the 1985 election after Geelong East was itself abolished and population increases in South Barwon moved that electorate westwards.
It has traditionally been a marginal seat. Graham Ernst of the Labor Party won the seat in the 1985 and 1988 elections but was defeated at the 1992 election by the Liberal Party's Garry Spry who held the seat until his retirement in 2002. At the election in November of that year it was one of many seats to fall to the Labor Party.
Lisa Neville is the current member. She holds the seat with a margin of 1.37%.

Frigolet Abbey

Frigolet Abbey ("Abbaye Saint-Michel de Frigolet") is a Premonstratensian monastery, originally Benedictine, in southern France. It is located in the territory of the commune of Tarascon, in the region of the Montagnette, the parishes of which are served by the canons of the monastery.
Monks, canons and friars.
The monastery, dedicated to Saint Michael, was founded about 960 at Frigolet by Conrad the Pacific, King of Arles, on one of the numerous hills which lie between Tarascon and Avignon. It was initially occupied by Benedictine monks from Montmajour Abbey.
By the 12th century, the abbey was home to a community of canons regular. A document from 1133 lists the prior of the canons as Guillaume of Loubières. The chapel of Our Lady of Good Remedy dates from this period. The canonical Augustinian community lasted until 1480, when the canons petitioned the Holy See to suppress the monastery. This request was granted by Pope Sixtus IV, at which time the monastery was abandoned. The chapel, however, remained a popular pilgrimage site.
In 1647 the monks of the Hieronymite Order were given possession of the derelict monastery. They worked to restore it, at the same time expanding the complex, enlarging the choir and sacristy, and erecting a chapter room. The community did not stay long, however, and were replaced in 1661 by the Discalced Augustinians. The friars of this order continued the work of the Hieronymites, but also did pastoral care in the surrounding region, providing support to the local clergy.
At the time of the French Revolution, it was suppressed and sold by the French Republic. 
Premonstratensians: 19th century to the present.
From that time it changed hands frequently, eventually acquired by a priest, the Abbé Edmund Boulbon who purchased it from another priest, T. Delestrac. Boulbon, born 14 January 1817, entered the Abbey of Our Lady of La Trappe at Bricquebec in 1850, wishing to lead a more dedicated religious life. Acting on the advice of the Trappist superiors, he left the abbey and undertook the restoration of the Premonstratensian Order, or Order of St. Norbert.
On 6 June, the feast day of St. Norbert, Boulbon received the white habit of the Premonstratensians from the hands of Paul-Armand de Cardon de Garsignies, Bishop of Soissons, at Prémontré Abbey. Pope Pius IX approved the project in an audience which he granted him on 4 December 1856. 
With the consent of Georges-Claude-Louis-Pie Chalandon, Archbishop of Aix, Boulbon took possession of Frigolet and, having admitted several novices, commenced community life there. In honour of Our Lady Conceived without Sin he erected a magnificent church, which was solemnly consecrated on 6 October 1866. The monastery was canonically erected as a priory on 28 August 1868, and as an abbey in September 1869, with Boulbon as its first abbot. 
On 8 November 1880, under the French anti-clerical laws, the Abbey of Frigolet was seized and the religious expelled. Eventually, however, they were permitted to return.
Boulbon died on 2 March 1883. His successor, Paulinus Boniface, named abbot on 10 June 1883, undid by poor administration the work begun by Boulbon; but, after a canonical visitation by François Xavier Gouthe-Soulard, Archbishop of Aix, he was deposed, and the direction of the abbey entrusted to Denis Bonnefoy. Up to this time, Frigolet Abbey with the priories it had founded had formed, as it were, a separate congregation with an organization of its own, having no connection with the other abbeys or the General Chapter of the Premonstratensian Order. This state of affairs was changed by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, dated 17 September 1898, when the congregation of Frigolet was incorporated into the Order. 
Denis Bonnefoy, who was made abbot on 21 March 1899, died on 20 September of the same year. The canons of Frigolet then chose for their abbot Godfrey Madelaine, then prior of Mondaye Abbey, Calvados, the author of "L'histoire de S. Norbert" and other books. Under his administration, Frigolet Abbey sent missionaries to Madagascar, and founded priories at Conques and Etoile in France, and at Storrington and Bedworth in England. Meanwhile, the French Republic had framed new laws against all religious institutes, and on 5 April 1903, the canons, again expelled from their abbey, took refuge either in Belgium, in Norbertine abbey in Leffe, or in the priory at Storrington in England.
The community at Leffe suffered severely from the German occupation during World War I: some were killed, and the rest were driven into further exile. Frigolet was reoccupied by the Premonstratensians in 1923, and remains in operation, although the communities at Leffe and Storrington also continued.
The Abbot of Frigolet from 1946 was P. Norbert Calmels, later distinguished as the Abbot-General of the Premonstratensian Order from 1961 to 1981, during which time he participated in Vatican II.
Under Pope John Paul II the abbey church of Frigolet was raised to the status of a minor basilica.

Saranya Mohan

Saranya Mohan born 9 February 1989) is an Indian film actress, who has acted in Malayalam and Tamil films. She is probably best known for her performances in "Yaaradi Nee Mohini" and "Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu".
Early life.
Saranya was born on 9 February 1989 in Alappuzha, Kerala as the eldest daughter to Palakkad Iyer Mohan and has a younger sister named Sukanya. Her mother Kalamandalam Devi is a trained classical dancer, who runs a dance school in Alappuzha, where Saranya herself also learnt dancing bharatanatyam. She studied at St. Joseph's College in Alappuzha, completing her B. A. degree in English literature.
Career.
She was brought to light by Malayalam director Fazil, who had seen Saranya dancing at her dancing school. After approaching and persuading her parents, he cast her for a child character in the 1997 Malayalam film "Aniyathi Pravu" and its Tamil remake, "Kadhalukku Mariyadhai". Following two more roles as a child artiste, she took a break, concentrating on her studies, before enacting a supporting role in another Fazil directorial, "Oru Naal Oru Kanavu" (2005), in which she acted as a sister to the male lead character.
Her subsequent release, the Dhanush-Nayantara starrer "Yaaradi Nee Mohini" (2008), brought her into limelight. Her comedic performance as the younger sister to the lead female, who has a crush on her sister's love interest, won her fame and many accolades. She subsequently appeared in a number of Tamil films, which, however, were less successful. 2009, she had six releases, four of which being Tamil projects. Out of her Tamil releases, the tragedy sports film, "Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu", directed by debutante Suseenthiran, and the supernatural thriller "Eeram" proved to be commercially as well as critically successful. Later that year, she made her Telugu debut with "Village Lo Vinayakudu" and made her comeback to Malayalam films, starring in "Chemistry". In 2011 she acted in M.Raja's Velayudham which turned out to be a huge hit. Her role as Vijay's sister won her a lot of good reviews. She also acted in another film named Dharani's Osthi in 2011. She plays the role of the lover of simbhu's (osthi velan) younger brother. Her debut Bollywood film is Badlapur boys.

D1 road (Croatia)

The state road D1 () is a national highway in Croatia. It is a one-lane highway that spans from Macelj border crossing in the north via Krapina, Zagreb, Karlovac, Slunj, Gračac, Knin, Sinj, ending in Split. It is long overall.
Before the A1 and A2 dual carriage motorways have been completed (in 2005 and 2007 respectively), the D1 was probably the busiest road during the summer in Croatia as it connected the northern border as well as the city of Zagreb with the tourist resorts at the Adriatic Sea. Since then, the traffic has waned significantly, but the D1 remains relevant as an alternative to the tolled highways.
Route description.
North of Zagreb the D1 is mostly parallel to the A2 motorway up to the Krapina interchange, connecting to a number of the A2 interchanges directly or via connector roads. It also runs parallel with railway tracks in some sections running through hilly terrain.
A part of the D1 state road is concurrent with other routes: the A2 motorway between Zaprešić and Jankomir interchanges, the A3 motorway between Jankomir and Lučko interchanges, the D3 state road between the A3 motorway Lučko interchange and Karlovac, the D6 state road in Karlovac, the D33 state road in Knin and the D219 state road in Sinj.
Parts of the D1 have been upgraded to expressway ("brza cesta") status. Currently two sections of the D1 are considered as such, since they comprise dual carriageways or are currently expanded to four traffic lanes:
The northern part of the D1 in Karlovac is actually a slightly lower road category because there are several intersections with traffic lights which slow the traffic down.
Parts of the road in Lika have climbing lanes.
The road, as well as all other state roads in Croatia, is managed and maintained by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company.
Traffic volume.
Traffic is regularly counted and reported by Hrvatske ceste, operator of the road. The D1 AADT and ASDT (average summer daily traffic) figure variations observed south of Karlovac are attributed to tourist traffic to various regions of Adriatic Sea coast in Dalmatia region of Croatia.

<doc id="18842168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18842168" title="Semen">
Semen

Semen, also known as "seminal fluid", is an organic fluid that may contain spermatozoa. It is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova. In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa, and provide a medium through which they can move or "swim".
Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle, which is located in the pelvis. The process that results in the discharge of semen is called "ejaculation".
Physiological aspects.
Internal and external fertilization.
Depending on the species, spermatozoa can fertilize ova externally or internally. In external fertilization, the spermatozoa fertilize the ova directly, outside of the female's sexual organs. Female fish, for example, spawn ova into their aquatic environment, where they are fertilized by the semen of the male fish.
During internal fertilization, however, fertilization occurs inside the female's sexual organs. Internal fertilization takes place after insemination of a female by a male through copulation. In low vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds and monotreme mammals), copulation is achieved through the physical mating of the cloaca of the male and female. In marsupial and placental mammals, copulation occurs through the vagina.
Composition of human semen.
During the process of ejaculation, sperm passes through the ejaculatory ducts and mixes with fluids from the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral glands to form the semen. The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70% of human semen. The prostatic secretion, influenced by dihydrotestosterone, is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes, citric acid, acid phosphatase and lipids. The bulbourethral glands secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the urethra to lubricate it.
Sertoli cells, which nurture and support developing spermatocytes, secrete a fluid into seminiferous tubules that helps transport sperm to the genital ducts. The ductuli efferentes possess cuboidal cells with microvilli and lysosomal granules that modify the ductal fluid by reabsorbing some fluid. Once the semen enters the ductus epididymis the principle cells, which contain pinocytotic vessels indicating fluid reabsorption, secrete glycerophosphocholine which most likely inhibits premature capacitation. The accessory genital ducts, the seminal vesicle, prostate glands, and the bulbourethral glands, produce most of the seminal fluid.
Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents.
The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract. The normal environment of the vagina is a hostile one for sperm cells, as it is very acidic (from the native microflora producing lactic acid), viscous, and patrolled by immune cells. The components in the seminal plasma attempt to compensate for this hostile environment. Basic amines such as putrescine, spermine, spermidine and cadaverine are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen. These alkaline bases counteract and buffer the acidic environment of the vaginal canal, and protect DNA inside the sperm from acidic denaturation.
The components and contributions of semen are as follows:
A 1992 World Health Organization report described normal human semen as having a volume of 2 ml or greater, pH of 7.2 to 8.0, sperm concentration of 20×106 spermatozoa/ml or more, sperm count of 40×106 spermatozoa per ejaculate or more, and motility of 50% or more with forward progression (categories a and b) of 25% or more with rapid progression (category a) within 60 minutes of ejaculation.
A 2005 review of the literature found that the average reported physical and chemical properties of human semen were as follows:
Appearance and consistency of human semen.
Semen is typically translucent with white, grey or even yellowish tint. Blood in the semen can cause a pink or reddish colour, known as "hematospermia", and may indicate a medical problem which should be evaluated by a doctor if the symptom persists.
After ejaculation, the latter part of the ejaculated semen coagulates immediately, forming globules, while the earlier part of the ejaculate typically does not. After a period typically ranging from 15 – 30 minutes, prostate-specific antigen present in the semen causes the decoagulation of the seminal coagulum. It is postulated that the initial clotting helps keep the semen in the vagina, while liquefaction frees the sperm to make their journey to the ova.
A 2005 review found that the average reported viscosity of human semen in the literature was 3–7 cP.
Semen quality.
Semen quality is a measure of the ability of semen to accomplish fertilization. Thus, it is a measure of fertility in a man. It is the sperm in the semen that is the fertile component, and therefore semen quality involves both sperm quantity and sperm quality.
Quantity.
The volume of semen ejaculate varies. A review of 30 studies concluded that the average was around 3.4 milliliters (ml), with some studies finding amounts as high as 4.99 ml or as low as 2.3 ml. In a study with Swedish and Danish men, a prolonged interval between ejaculations caused an increase of the sperm count in the semen but not an increase of its amount.
Increasing semen volume.
Some dietary supplements have been marketed with claims to increase seminal volume. Like other supplements, including so-called herbal viagra, these are not approved or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (as licensed medications would be), and none of the claims have been scientifically verified. Similar claims are made about traditional aphrodisiac foods, with an equal lack of verification.
Semen storage.
Semen can be stored in diluents such as the "Illini Variable Temperature" (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of semen for over seven days. The IVT diluent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with CO2.
Semen cryopreservation can be used for far longer storage durations. For human sperm, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.
Health effects.
In addition to its central role in reproduction, some studies have made claims that semen may have certain beneficial effects on human health:
Other studies claim adversarial effects:
Semen and transmission of disease.
Semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Further research, such as that by Mathur and Goust, demonstrated that non-preexisting antibodies were produced in humans in response to the sperm. These antibodies mistakenly recognized native T lymphocytes as "foreign" antigens, and consequently T lymphocytes would fall under attack by the body's B lymphocytes.
Semen contains many proteins with potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and virus. But none of these proteins are active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a common cause of sexually transmitted disease.
Blood in the semen (hematospermia).
The presence of blood in semen or hematospermia may be undetectable (it only can be seen microscopically) or visible in the fluid. Its cause could be the result of inflammation, infection, blockage, or injury of the male reproductive tract or a problem within the urethra, testicles, epididymis or prostate.
It usually clears up without treatment, or with antibiotics, but if persistent further semen analysis and other urogenital system tests might be needed to find out the cause.
Semen allergy.
In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include vaginal itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include generalized itching, hives, and even difficulty breathing.
One way to test for human seminal plasma sensitivity is to use a condom during intercourse. If symptoms dissipate with the use of a condom, it is possible that a sensitivity to semen is present. Mild cases of semen allergy can often be overcome by repeated exposure to seminal fluid. In more severe cases, it is important to seek the advice of a physician, particularly in the event that a couple is trying to conceive, in which case, artificial insemination may be indicated.
Scientists at Utrecht University studied the condition whereby some men "get flu-like symptoms such as feverishness, runny nose, extreme fatigue and burning eyes immediately after they ejaculate. Symptoms can last for up to week." This condition is termed post orgasmic illness syndrome (POIS), and it was discovered that this stemmed from an allergy to their own semen. Its effects could be cured using hyposensitization therapy or allergen immunotherapy.
Psychological aspects.
A recent study has suggested that semen acts as an antidepressant in women, so that women physically exposed to semen are less likely to suffer from depression. It is thought that the psychological effects of semen are a result of its complex chemical make-up including several mood-altering hormones (testosterone, oestrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and several different prostaglandins). In a scientific survey of 293 college women it was also found that those who did not use condoms were most likely to initiate sex and to seek out new partners as soon as a relationship ended, suggesting that the chemical dependency to semen creates a "rebound effect". The effect of semen on a male sexual partner (as the receiver of semen) is not known.
Cultural aspects.
Qigong.
Qigong and Chinese medicine place huge emphasis on a form of energy called 精 (pinyin: jīng, also a morpheme denoting "essence" or "spirit") – which one attempts to develop and accumulate. "Jing" is sexual energy and is considered to dissipate with ejaculation so masturbation is considered "energy suicide" amongst those who practice this art. According to Qigong theory, energy from many pathways/meridians becomes diverted and transfers itself to the sexual organs during sexual excitement. The ensuing orgasm and ejaculation will then finally expel the energy from the system completely. The Chinese proverb 一滴精，十滴血 (pinyin: yì dī jīng, shí dī xuè, literally: a drop of semen is equal to ten drops of blood) illustrates this point.
The scientific term for semen in Chinese is 精液 (pinyin: jīng yè, literally: fluid of essence/jing) and the term for sperm is 精子 (pinyin: jīng zǐ, literally: basic element of essence/jing), two modern terms with classical referents.
Greek philosophy.
In Ancient Greece, Aristotle remarked on the importance of semen: "For Aristotle, semen is the residue derived from nourishment, that is of blood, that has been highly concocted to the optimum temperature and substance. This can only be emitted by the male as only the male, by nature of his very being, has the requisite heat to concoct blood into semen." According to Aristotle, there is a direct connection between food and semen: "Sperms are the excretion of our food, or to put it more clearly, as the most perfect component of our food."
The connection between food and physical growth, on the one hand, and semen, on the other, allows Aristotle to warn against "engagin sexual activity at too early an age ... [since this will affect the growth of their bodies. Nourishment that would otherwise make the body grow is diverted to the production of semen... Aristotle is saying that at this stage the "body" is still growing; it is best for sexual activity to begin when its growth is 'no longer abundant', for when the body is more or less at full height, the transformation of nourishment into semen does not drain the body of needed material."
Additionally, "Aristotle tells us that the region round the eyes was the region of the head most fruitful of seed ("most seedy" σπερματικώτατος), pointing to generally recognised effects upon the eyes of sexual indulgence and to practices which imply that seed comes from liquid in the region of the eyes." This may be explained by the belief of the Pythagoreans that "semen is a drop of the brain [τὸ δε σπέρμα εἶναι σταγόνα ἐγκέφαλου]."
Greek Stoic philosophy conceived of the "Logos spermatikos" ("seminal word") as the principle of active reason that fecundated passive matter. The Jewish philosopher Philo similarly spoke in sexual terms of the Logos as the masculine principle of reason that sowed seeds of virtue in the feminine soul.
The Christian Platonist Clement of Alexandria likened the Logos to physical blood as the "substance of the soul," and noted that some held "that the animal semen is substantially foam of its blood". Clement reflected an early Christian view that "the seed ought not be wasted nor scattered thoughtlessly nor sown in a way it cannot grow."
Women were believed to have their own version, which was stored in the womb and released during climax. Retention was believed to cause female hysteria.
Sacred semen.
In some pre-industrial societies, semen and other body fluids were revered because they were believed to be magical. Blood is an example of such a fluid, but semen was also widely believed to be of supernatural origin and effect and was, as a result, considered holy or sacred.
Dew was once thought to be a sort of rain that fertilized the earth and, in time, became a metaphor for semen. The Bible employs the term "dew" in this sense in such verses as Song of Solomon 5:2 and Psalm 110:3, declaring, in the latter verse, for example, that the people should follow only a king who was virile enough to be full of the "dew" of youth.
It was widely believed, in ancient times, that gemstones were drops of divine semen which had coagulated after having fertilized the earth. There is an ancient Chinese belief that jade, in particular, was the dried semen of the celestial dragon.
Based upon the resemblance of dandelion juice to human semen, it was historically believed that the flower magically promoted the flow of sperm. (This belief probably derives from the doctrine of signatures.)
The orchid’s twin bulbs were thought to resemble the testicles, and there was an ancient Roman belief that the flower sprang from the spilled semen of copulating satyrs.
Barbara G. Walker recounts these examples of sacred semen in "The Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects", the thesis of which is that myth and folklore show a pre-patriarchic rule by women that was later supplanted by masculine culture.
In primitive mythology around the world, semen is very often considered analogous to breast milk in some way. In the traditions of Bali, it is considered to be the returning or refunding of the milk of the mother in an alimentary metaphor. The wife feeds her husband who returns to her his semen, the milk of human kindness, as it were.
In some systems of medical philosophy, such as traditional Russian medicine and the Vital Force theory of Herbert Nowell, semen is regarded as the product of a complex physiological interaction between a man and a woman (rather than merely the product of the male reproductive system).
Semen in espionage.
When the British Secret Intelligence Service discovered that semen made a good invisible ink, Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming noted of his agents that "Every man (is) his own stylo".
Semen ingestion.
Some reasons for human ingestion of human or other semen are erotic gratification and physical and spiritual benefits.
Health risks.
There is no risk in ingesting the semen of a healthy man. Swallowing semen carries no additional risk other than those inherent in fellatio. Fellatio does carry some transmission risk for sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV or herpes, especially for people with bleeding gums, gingivitis or open sores.
Even if semen is cold before the individual ingests it, viruses can stay active for a long period of time once outside the body.
Research has suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) might increase the risk of oral or throat cancer. The study found that 36% of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1% of the healthy control group. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers.
Physical benefits.
An average ejaculation (3.4 mL) contains trace amounts of many nutrients such as zinc, calcium and potassium, as well as vitamin B12.
Some female infertility, preeclampsia and miscarriages are due to the inherent presence of antibodies that destroy the proteins or antigens in her sexual partner's semen. Having oral sex and swallowing the semen of the partner may help make the pregnancy safer and more successful as the woman is ingesting her partner's antigens.
There has been no scientific research conducted into whether oral ingestion of semen has an antidepressive effect, however, semen does contain several mood-elevating compounds such as endorphins, estrone, prolactin, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and serotonin. The noted beneficial effects of these hormones have thus far been studied with vaginal absorption only.
Cultural practices.
In some cultures, semen is considered to have special properties associated with masculinity. Several tribes of Papua New Guinea, including the Sambia and the Etoro, believe that semen promotes sexual maturation among the younger men of their tribe. To them, semen possesses the manly nature of the tribal elders, and in order to pass down their authority and powers, younger men of their next generation must fellate their elders and ingest their semen. Prepubescent and postpubescent males are required to engage in this practice. This act may also be associated with the culturally active homosexuality throughout these and other tribes.
Spiritual views.
The church father Epiphanius records that the Borborites and other libertine Gnostic sects consumed semen as the Body of Christ. The "Pistis Sophia" and "Testimony of Truth" harshly condemn such practices.
In the modern St. Priapus Church, consumption of semen in the presence of others is a form of worship.
Sexual practices.
There are several sexual practices involving the ingestion of semen. They can be done with one or more partners, like snowballing, felching and creampie eating, or with multiple partners, like the practices of bukkake and gokkun, which originate from Japan.
Euphemisms.
A huge variety of euphemisms and dysphemisms have been invented to describe semen. For a complete list of terms, see "sexual slang".

Richard Redman (speaker)

Sir Richard Redman (or Redmayne) (died 1426) was a British soldier, administrator and politician, being elected as a Member of Parliament representing Yorkshire and later acting as the Speaker of the House of Commons for the Parliament of 1415.
He was the son of Sir Matthew Redman, who served in France and Spain under John of Gaunt, and grandson of another Sir Matthew Redman who was the Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1357 and 1358. 
He began his career as a soldier, campaigning on the continent, and was knighted by 1376. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for 1387, 1391, 1394, 1397, 1401 and 1410 and High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1403 and 1415.
In 1393 Richard was granted leave to hold a tournament in Carlisle. In 1397, after campaigning in Ireland with Richard II he was appointed Master of the Horse. Between 1399 and 1400 he travelled to Ireland with John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham before returning to England in May to create a peace with Scotland. In 1405 he was commissioned to fine members of the gentry associated with the rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and was the same year elected to represent Yorkshire as a knight of the shire (MP), a job he returned to for the Parliaments of 1414, 1415, 1420 and 1421. In 1408 he was commissioned again to fine gentry associated with the Percy Rebellion after their defeat at the Battle of Bramham Moor.
In 1409 and 1410 he attempted to gain peace with the Scots; after this failed he was tasked with raising forces against them. In 1415 along with John Strange he raised forces against the French before the Hundred Years' War (1415–1429) and was elected speaker of the 1415 parliament, which met on 4 November and lasted only 8 days due to the loyalist feeling after the Battle of Agincourt before Parliament voted for supplies to maintain the war with France. In 1421 he was again commissioned to raise money for the war with France before his death in 1426.
He died in 1426 and was buried in the Church of the Black Friars, York. An eleborate memorial to him was installed in Harewood church, Yorkshire, where his estates lay. He had married twice, secondly to Elizabeth, the daughter of William, 1st Lord Aldeburgh of Aldeburgh and Harewood, and sister and coheiress of William, 2nd Lord Aldeburgh and widow of Sir Brian Stapleton of Carlton,with whom he had at least two sons and two daughters.
His surviving son, Matthew Redman, died before him in 1419 and he was succeeded by his grandson, Richard. Richard Redman, the Bishop of Exeter, was most likely his great-grandson.

3CT

3CT (3D Catalog Technology) is the process of creating 3D object libraries to be used in computer-aided design software. 3D catalogs facilitate the work of engineers, architects, designers and other users of CAD programs as they shorten considerably the time needed to draw and / or render a project.
Use.
3CT is usually employed by industrialists and manufacturers in order to better serve and appeal to their clients. 3CT is most effective in cases where the client is also a CAD user. For example, a manufacturer of luxury furniture will use 3CT in order to accommodate architects that are almost all users of CAD programs.
3CT superiority over paper catalogs.
As CAD design has become largely widespread amongst designers from all domains, 3CT appears to be indispensable. A 3CT object could be injected into a project in an early phase of CAD design, as it is a virtual digital entity immediately exploitable by the designer. 3D catalogs are easier to browse and the users (The manufacturer’s clients) become well acquainted with the products.
Process.
Raw materials for a 3D Catalog could be obtained either by 2D/3D scanning or by exploiting existing CAD files of the yet to be created catalog objects. Such raw materials are called "Construction data" regardless of the way they are obtained. The construction data is then processed in order to modelize an as accurate as possible 3D object. The resulting object (usually called 3D Master) is then cut into various 2D projections: Top view (or plan) Front, Back, Right and Left views. The minimum 3CT standard is usually 6 files per catalogue object – one 3D file and five 2D projections.
Conversions.
Most 3D catalogs are intended to exist in several CAD formats. The aim is to reach an as large as possible users pool. Since every design domain has several available CAD programs.

Tamil Case (Denmark)

The Tamil Case (Danish: Tamilsagen) is the name of a case about family reunification in Denmark of Tamil refugees from the Sri Lankan Civil War. The case led to the resignation of the government led by Poul Schlüter in 1993.
History.
The case began in 1987 when the government examined the possibilities of decreasing the number of Tamil family reunifications. 
Minister of Justice Erik Ninn-Hansen decided to stall the advance of family reunification of Tamil refugees. Danish law clearly granted the Tamil refugees the right to family reunification, thus rendering the justice minister's order illegal.
When the case appeared in the media, several political parties opposed a re-election of Erik Ninn-Hansen and others demanded an investigation, ultimately leading to the resignation of Erik Ninn-Hansen as minister of justice in 1989.
Four civil servants in the Ministry of Justice were charged and the minister of justice was impeached, which led to the resignation of the government in 1993. In 1995 Erik Ninn-Hansen was found guilty of three cases of abuse of power and received a suspended sentence of 4 months of prison. 
The case is well known in Denmark due to an infamous speech held by Prime Minister Poul Schlüter, wherein he stated that "nothing has been swept under the rug." The phrase is now a common Danish catchphrase.

Drew Carey

Drew Allison Carey (born May 23, 1958) is an American actor, comedian, sports executive, and game show host. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps and making a name for himself in stand-up comedy, Carey eventually gained popularity starring on his own sitcom, "The Drew Carey Show", and serving as host of the U.S. version of the improv comedy show "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", both of which aired on ABC.
Carey has appeared in several films, television series, music videos, a made-for-television film, and a computer game. He has hosted the television game show "The Price Is Right" since 2007. He is interested in a variety of sports, has worked as a photographer at U.S. National Team soccer games, is a minority owner of the Major League Soccer team Seattle Sounders FC and a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. Carey has written an autobiography, "", detailing his early life and television career.
Early life.
Carey was the youngest of Lewis and Beulah Carey's three sons and raised in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. When Drew was eight years old, his father died from a brain tumor. He played the cornet and trumpet in the marching band of James Ford Rhodes High School, from which he graduated in 1975.
He continued on to college at Kent State University (KSU) and was expelled twice for poor academic performance. He left KSU after three years, but not before becoming a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After leaving the university, Carey enlisted into the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1980 and served for six years. He relocated to Las Vegas for a few months in 1982, and for a short time worked as a bank teller and a waiter at Denny's.
Stand-up career.
In 1985, he began his comedy career by following up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) to go to the library and borrow books on how to write jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at multiple comedy clubs over the next few years in both Cleveland and Los Angeles. He was first brought to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 "Star Search". Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the "14th Annual Young Comedians Special" on HBO and made his first appearance on "Late Night with David Letterman". In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special which aired on Showtime, entitled "Drew Carey: Human Cartoon", for which he won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.
Acting career.
Early roles.
Following on the success of his early stand-up career, he subsequently appeared in a number of supporting roles on television shows, during which he developed the character of a hapless middle-class bachelor. In 1993, Carey had a small role in the film "Coneheads" as a taxi passenger. Turning his attention to television, in 1994, Carey co-starred with John Caponera in "The Good Life", a short-lived sitcom that aired on NBC. After the show's cancellation, Carey joined up with writer Bruce Helford (who was also a writer for "The Good Life"), who gave Carey a job as a consultant for the television show "Someone Like Me".
"The Drew Carey Show".
After their stint on "Someone Like Me", Carey and Helford developed and produced the storyline for "The Drew Carey Show". The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, as he took on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with having to deal with censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3/4–9).
Improv television.
While still starring in "The Drew Carey Show", in 1998 Carey began hosting the American version of the improvisational comedy show "Whose Line Is It Anyway?". He would announce the improv guests, direct the games, and then would usually involve himself in the final game of the episode. The show ran for a total of 220 episodes until the show's cancellation in 2006. In 1998, the New York Friars' Club made Carey the newest inductee of the group's Comedy Central Roast. His friend Ryan Stiles (who costarred in "The Drew Carey Show" and "Whose Line Is It Anyway?") served as the roastmaster. Carey's income from "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and "The Drew Carey Show" led to his inclusion on the "Forbes" list of highest-paid entertainers of 1998, at 24th with $45.5 million.
For the WB's 2004-2005 prime time schedule, Carey co-produced and starred in "Drew Carey's Green Screen Show", a spin-off of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?". It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central. The show's premise relied on the use of a green screen for all of the actors' improv interactions. Animation on the screen was inserted during post-production.
On November 18, 2010, GSN announced that Drew Carey would host a new improv show in primetime, called "Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza". The show was filmed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada and first aired on April 11, 2011. The show takes on the premise of "Whose Line?" and "Drew Carey's Green Screen Show" in that it features many of the same performers from both shows and they do improv based on audience-provided suggestions.
Improv All-Stars.
Carey was one of the founders of the Improv All-Stars, a group of eleven actors who perform in unscripted skits. The group joined Carey in all three of his improv shows, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", "Drew Carey's Green Screen Show", and "Drew Carey's Improv-a-ganza" and some members had major roles or guest starred on "The Drew Carey Show". The Improv All-Stars travel on comedy tours, performing at comedy clubs throughout the United States.
Game show host.
"Power of 10".
Beginning in 2007, Carey began hosting game shows, beginning with his April selection as host of the CBS game show pilot "Power of 10". The show ran from August 7, 2007 to April 7, 2008 and aired twice weekly during the late summer and early fall. Each game featured contestants predicting how a cross-section of Americans responded to questions covering a wide variety of topics in polls conducted by CBS.
"The Price Is Right".
After taping the pilot episode for "Power of 10", Carey was contacted by CBS about replacing the retiring Bob Barker at "The Price Is Right". After initially turning down the offer, Carey announced on "Late Show with David Letterman" that he would succeed Barker as host of the program beginning in the fall of 2007. His first episode of "The Price Is Right" was taped on August 15, and his shows began airing on October 15. In response to replacing Barker as host of the game show, Carey stated "You can't replace Bob Barker. I don't compare myself to anybody... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to do, and I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this." When Carey began hosting, the set, theme music, and show logo were updated. However, Carey kept the old closing line about spaying and neutering the pets that originated with Barker, although his version uses slightly different wording. During Carey's second year as host, he began to write some of the sketches used during the Showcase, which sometimes features guest appearances by stars of other CBS programs. In the April Fools' Day 2013 episode, Carey and announcer George Gray switched places with the models, letting the two men be the models for the episode.
Other roles and appearances.
Carey began appearing in commercials for restaurants in the late 1990s in Canada with The Great Root Bear, but his two-year contract with A&W Food Services of Canada was cut short in November 1998 after an episode of "The Drew Carey Show" featured McDonald's. As a result of his dismissal, Carey sued A&W for compensation. 
Disney's Hollywood Studios (then "Disney-MGM Studios"), part of Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, debuted a 12-minute attraction in 1999 titled "Sounds Dangerous!". In the show, a camera follows Carey through a day as an undercover detective. When his video camera fails, the audience is left in complete darkness wearing earphones, following his adventure through sound cues. The attraction is now closed.
In 2000, Carey was given a cameo appearance in the "" expansion pack of the computer game "The Sims". To make him appear, the characters in the game must throw a successful party, which causes Carey to arrive in a limo and join the festivities. Carey is a fan of "The Sims" series and during one April Fool's episode of "The Drew Carey Show", a scene takes place completely within "The Sims". Carey made several other cameo appearances in music videos, including "Weird Al" Yankovic's "It's All About the Pentiums" and Fountains of Wayne's 2004 video for "Mexican Wine", giving an introduction to the video as if it were on a stage.
On January 21, 2001, Drew entered as Vince McMahon's guest entrant in the Royal Rumble match.33 Although primarily known for his television work, Carey has done limited film work, with his first appearance in 1993's "Coneheads". His next film was the 2000 television film, "Geppetto" that debuted on "The Wonderful World of Disney". The film, an adaptation of "Pinocchio", included actor Wayne Brady who had joined Carey on his improv shows. Carey took singing lessons to prepare for the role. In 2005, Carey appeared in three films: the animated film "Robots", where he provided a voice-over for the character Crank; "The Aristocrats" where he retold a dirty joke along with other celebrities; and the documentary, "Fuck", where he was interviewed.
Carey provided the entertainment for the 2002 Annual White House correspondents' dinner. Once Carey completed his standup routine for the 1,800 guests, President George W. Bush, noting Carey's improv work, made a joke of his own: "Drew? Got any interest in the Middle East?" In 2003, he joined Jamie Kennedy to host the WB's live special "Play for a Billion". In September 2003, Carey led a group of comedians, including Blake Clark and "The Drew Carey Show"'s Kathy Kinney, on a comedy tour of Iraq.
On June 8, 2006, "Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures" debuted on the Travel Channel. In this series, Carey traveled throughout Germany to photograph multiple FIFA World Cup soccer games while he immerses himself in the culture of the towns and states he visits. In early 2008, Carey appeared in Matt Groening's "The Simpsons" as part of the episode "All About Lisa" as a guest on the "Krusty the Clown Show". He also surfaced in the second season of ""Community"", playing a well liked former boss to Jeff Winger.
On March 4th, 2014, he was announced to be one of the celebrities competing on the 18th season of "Dancing with the Stars". He is paired with professional dancer Cheryl Burke.
Writing.
Carey has routinely written throughout his career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines in his early stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, "" wherein he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts of depression, and had made two suicide attempts by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills. The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University, and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer. The book was featured on "The New York Times" bestseller list for three months.
Personal life.
He adopted his crew cut hair style while serving in the United States Marine Corps. Carey has had refractive surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006 episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.
Carey is a father figure to Nicole Jaracz's son, Connor, from a previous relationship. They have no children together. Nicole and Connor have appeared alongside Carey on "The Price Is Right" several times. Although he proposed to Jaracz in 2007, the pair never wed as the engagement was called off in January 2012.
After suffering chest pains while filming "The Drew Carey Show" in August 2001, Carey went to the hospital where he underwent a coronary angioplasty. Although his weight was a comedic topic throughout his sitcom and improv shows, in 2010 he began a diet and exercise plan, resulting in an extensive weight loss. He also claimed that he cured his Type 2 diabetes.
Political views.
Carey is an outspoken libertarian. He has expressed his political philosophy in the following terms, "I believe the answers to all the problems we face as a society won't come from Washington, it will come from us. So the way we decide to live our lives and our decisions about what we buy or don't buy are much more important than who we vote for."
Carey expressed his distaste for the Bush administration's management of the Iraq War, specifically on the September 15, 2007, episode of "Real Time with Bill Maher". He made donations to Ron Paul's presidential campaign for the 2008 election. On the September 26, 2008 episode of "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson", Carey defined "libertarian" to host Craig Ferguson as "a conservative who still gets high."
Carey has spoken about his various political beliefs in several interviews, and in 1998 he led a "smoke-in" in defiance of California's newly passed no-smoking ordinance inside bars and restaurants. Carey has hosted a series of mini-documentaries called "The Drew Carey Project" on Reason.tv, an online project of Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. The first episode, "Gridlock", addresses private highway ownership and was released on October 15, 2007. Other episodes discuss topics such as eminent domain, urban traffic congestion, and medical marijuana. Carey also sits on the board of trustees of the Reason Foundation, a libertarian-oriented nonprofit organization.
Sports involvement.
Carey is a devoted fan of the U.S. National Soccer Team, Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Cleveland Indians and the Columbus Blue Jackets. In 1999, Carey was part of the pregame ceremonies at the first game of the return of the Cleveland Browns, televised on ESPN. Carey attended the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Carey is a minority owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, who began play in Major League Soccer on March 19, 2009. Carey is a fan of FC Barcelona and of the Scottish team Rangers. In 2006 he was a season ticket holder for the Los Angeles Galaxy.
Carey has shown his support for the Indians by throwing the first pitch at an August 12, 2006 game against the Kansas City Royals. He was rewarded by the Cleveland Indians for being "the greatest Indians fan alive" with a personal bobblehead doll made in his likeness that was given to fans. Carey responded to his bobblehead likeness by saying "Bobblehead Day, for me, is as big as getting a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
In 2001, Carey was the first television actor to enter World Wrestling Federation's 30-man "Royal Rumble" match, which he did to promote an improv comedy pay-per-view at the time. He appeared in a few backstage segments before his brief participation in the match. Upon entering the ring, Carey stood unopposed for more than half a minute, but after the next entrant Kane refused a monetary bribe, Carey eliminated himself from the match by jumping over the top rope and retreated from ringside. On April 2, 2011 Carey was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Kane.
Carey competed against five other celebrities in the first celebrity edition of the 2003 World Poker Tour. He placed fifth, only beating out actor Jack Black. Carey won $2,000 for his charity.
On May 15, 2011, Carey completed the "Marine Corps Historic Half Marathon" in 1:57:02, then on September 4, 2011, he improved to complete the Disneyland Half Marathon in 1:50:46. And on October 30, 2011, he finished the Marine Corps Marathon with a chip time of 4:37:11, placing 10149th out of 20940.
Philanthropy.
Carey is a supporter of libraries, crediting them for beginning his successful comedy career. On May 2, 2000, in a celebrity edition of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", he selected the Ohio Library Foundation to receive his $500,000 winnings. He later went on to win an additional $32,000 on the second celebrity "Millionaire", making him one of the biggest winning contestants on "Millionaire" who did not win the top prize. Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity. In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund if anybody could beat him at the video game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360. He dared five players from both the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams to compete against him. Carey ended up donating $100,000 plus $60,000 for losing two games out of the six games he played.
In October 2009, Carey made a bid of $25,000 in a charity auction for the @drew Twitter account. He later increased his offer to $100,000 if the number of followers of his account @DrewFromTV reached 100,000 by the end of the auction. In an interview with CBS News, he announced that he would instead donate $1 million to the charity Livestrong Foundation if his follower count reached one million by December 31, 2009.
Photography.
Carey can sometimes be seen on the sidelines of U.S. National Team soccer games as a press photographer. His images are sold via wire services under the pseudonym "Brooks Parkenridge". He was at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in the summer of 2006, for his television show "Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures".
Filmography.
Carey has starred in only a few television shows and films, but also has numerous guest star appearances in a variety of sitcoms and comedy shows.

John Tapner

John Charles Tapner (born about 1823, died 10 February 1854) was an English murderer who was the last person executed by Guernsey.
Tapner was from Woolwich, London, England, and was living in St Martin when 74-year-old Elizabeth Saujon was murdered in her home in St Peter Port on 18 October 1853. Saujon had been knocked unconscious and left to die in her burning house.
Tapner was arrested and tried for the murder of Saujon. At trial, it was revealed that Tapner's mistress — who was his wife's sister — lived with Saujon. There were also reports of some of Saujon's belongings being discovered near Tapner's house in St Martin. While Tapner admitted to being in St Peter Port the evening of the murder, he denied any involvement in the fire or Saujon's death. It was never clear what Tapner's motive would have been for killing Saujon and burning down her house.
Tapner was convicted of murder by the Jurats and sentenced to death by hanging. Victor Hugo, who was living in Guernsey at the time, and 600 residents petitioned the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, Lord Palmerston, to commute Tapner's sentence. Lord Palmerston refused, and Tapner was hanged on 10 February 1854 in St Peter Port. His execution was performed by non-professionals, and Tapner died of strangulation.
No one was executed by Guernsey after Tapner's execution. Guernsey abolished the death penalty in 2003.

Luis Rodríguez Moya, better known as Luis Moya (born 23 September 1960 in La Coruña, Spain) is a now-retired rally co-driver, synonymous with the driver Carlos Sainz. He is the second co-pilot with more victories in the history of the WRC, after Daniel Elena.
Only ever navigating at World Rally Championship level for his compatriot, 1990 and 1992 Drivers' Champion Sainz, he scored 24 world rally victories throughout his career for marques such as Subaru, Toyota and Ford, which lasted until he left the latter team at the end of the 2002 season. He was replaced at Sainz's new team, Citroën, for the full 2003 and 2004 seasons (as well as two rallies in the 2005 season) by another Spaniard, Marc Martí, former co-driver of 2001 Tour de Corse winner, Jesús Puras (and who went on to co-drive the 2005 Junior World Rally Champion and subsequent works driver for Citroën, Sainz protégé Daniel Sordo).
Moya's long-standing record of individual wins has since been surpassed by Sébastien Loeb's co-driver Daniel Elena and Marcus Grönholm's co-driver Timo Rautiainen.
Moya also served as Subaru World Rally Team's Sporting Director from 2003 to 2006.

Cerro Marahuaca

Cerro Marahuaca, also spelled Marahuaka, is a tepui in Amazonas state, Venezuela. It has an elevation of above sea level and is the second-highest mountain of the entire Guayana Shield (after the Cerro de la Neblina complex). Cerro Marahuaca shares a common base with the much larger Cerro Duida and together they form the Duida–Marahuaca Massif. Both tepuis are located entirely within the bounds of Duida–Marahuaca National Park.
Cerro Marahuaca actually consists of two summit plateaus, the slightly larger northern one going by the Yekwana Amerindian name Fufha or Huha (). The southern plateau () is known by two local names; its northwestern edge is called Fuif or Fhuif, whereas its southeastern portion is called Atahua'shiho or Atawa Shisho. A massive ridge known as Cerro Petaca rises to at least just west of these two plateaus.

Computer keyboard

In computing, a keyboard is a , which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers.
A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands.
Despite the development of alternative input devices, such as the mouse, touchscreen, pen devices, character recognition and voice recognition, the keyboard remains the most commonly used and most versatile device used for direct (human) input into computers.
In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or other programs. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows' Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.
A command-line interface is a type of user interface operated entirely through a keyboard, or another device performing the function of one.
History.
While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices, the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices: teleprinters (or teletypes) and keypunches. It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts.
As early as the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape. The teleprinter, in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1903 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard, with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne. Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed.
Earlier, Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices, which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s.
The keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century, while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.
From the 1940s until the late 1960s, typewriters were the main means of data entry and output for computing, becoming integrated into what were known as computer terminals. Because of the limitations of terminals based upon printed text in comparison to the growth in data storage, processing and transmission, a general move toward video-based computer terminals was affected by the 1970s, starting with the Datapoint 3300 in 1967.
The keyboard remained the primary, most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984. By this time, text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen. However, keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present, even as mobile personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual, touchscreen-based means of data entry.
Keyboard types.
One factor determining the size of a keyboard is the presence of duplicate keys, such as a separate numeric keyboard, for convenience.
Further the keyboard size depends on the extent to which a system is used where a single action is produced by a combination of subsequent or simultaneous keystrokes (with modifier keys, see below), or multiple pressing of a single key. A keyboard with few keys is called a keypad. See also text entry interface.
Another factor determining the size of a keyboard is the size and spacing of the keys. Reduction is limited by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. Alternatively a tool is used for pressing small keys.
Standard.
Standard "full-travel" alphanumeric keyboards have keys that are on three-quarter inch centers (0.750 inches, 19.05 mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150 inches (3.81 mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers and a variety of function keys. The internationally common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys.
Laptop-size.
Keyboards on laptops and notebook computers usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They may not have a numerical keypad, and the function keys may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized keyboard. The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard is more likely to be a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.
Handheld.
Handheld ergonomic keyboards are designed to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.
Thumb-sized.
Smaller external keyboards have been introduced for devices without a built-in keyboard, such as PDAs, and smartphones. Small keyboards are also useful where there is a limited workspace.
A chorded keyboard allows users to press several keys simultaneously. For example, the GKOS keyboard has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a game controller, such as the AlphaGrip, are also used to input data and text.
A thumb keyboard (thumbboard) is used in some personal digital assistants such as the Palm Treo and BlackBerry and some Ultra-Mobile PCs such as the OQO.
Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys. They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, Numerical digits, Arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.
Non-standard layout and special-use types.
Chorded.
While other keyboards generally associate one action with each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since there are many combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' stenotype machines use chorded keyboards to enable them to enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.
Software.
Software keyboards or on-screen keyboards often take the form of computer programs that display an image of a keyboard on the screen. Another input device such as a mouse or a touchscreen can be used to operate each virtual key to enter text. Software keyboards have become very popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and space requirements of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse. In software keyboards, the mouse has to be maneuvered onto the on-screen letters given by the software. On the click of a letter, the software writes the respective letter on the respective spot.
Projection (as by laser).
Projection keyboards project an image of keys, usually with a laser, onto a flat surface. The device then uses a camera or infrared sensor to "watch" where the user's fingers move, and will count a key as being pressed when it "sees" the user's finger touch the projected image. Projection keyboards can simulate a full size keyboard from a very small projector. Because the "keys" are simply projected images, they cannot be felt when pressed. Users of projected keyboards often experience increased discomfort in their fingertips because of the lack of "give" when typing. A flat, non-reflective surface is also required for the keys to be projected. Most projection keyboards are made for use with PDAs and smartphones due to their small form factor.
Optical keyboard technology.
Also known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard and optical key actuation detection technology.
An optical keyboard technology utilizes light emitting devices and photo sensors to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located in the perimeter, mounted on a small PCB. The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly horizontal beam).
Layout.
Alphabetic.
There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different keyboard layouts arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, computer programming, or other purposes. The United States keyboard layout is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.
As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor Christopher Sholes developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard are not in widespread use.
The QWERTZ layout is widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters.
Another situation takes place with "national" layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for Ñ ñ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character Ç ç. The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.
Keyboards in many parts of Asia may have special keys to switch between the Latin character set and a completely different typing system. Japanese layout keyboards can be switched between various Japanese input methods and the Latin alphabet by signaling the operating system's input interpreter of the change, and some operating systems (namely the Windows family) interpret the character "\" as "¥" for display purposes without changing the bytecode which has led some keyboard makers to mark "\" as "¥" or both. In the Arab world, keyboards can often be switched between Arabic and Latin characters.
In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Québec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as "é" or "à" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).
Key types.
Alphanumeric.
Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.
The Space bar is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.
Modifier keys.
Modifier keys are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing.
The most widely used modifier keys include the Control key, Shift key and the Alt key. The AltGr key is used to access additional symbols for keys that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the Option key and Command key, respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the Meta key is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a Windows key. Compact keyboard layouts often use a Fn key. "Dead keys" allow placement of a diacritic mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the Compose key).
The Enter/Return key typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an "entry" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.
Cursor keys.
Navigation keys or cursor keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.
The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position "back" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character.
Lock keys lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and Caps lock.
System commands.
The SysRq and Print screen commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a "panic" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard. The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.
In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.
The Escape key (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to "escape" or back out of a mistaken command. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort.
A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the "start" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, and 8.
The Enter key is located: One in the alphanumeric keys and the other one is in the numeric keys. When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do something with their work, pressing the enter key would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.
Shift key, from the word "shift" that means change. When one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter they pressed with the shift key. Another is to type more symbol just like this.
The apostrophe sign was accompanied with a quotation mark on the top. If one wanted to type the quotation mark but they pressed that key, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. So if they pressed shift and the key, the quotation mark would appear.
The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).
Miscellaneous.
Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a numeric keypad to the right of the alphabetic keyboard which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. On Japanese/Korean keyboards, there may be Language input keys. Some keyboards have power management keys (e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or E-mail; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified software or command like launching a game or minimize all windows.
Numeric keys.
When we calculate, we use these numeric keys to type numbers. Symbols concerned with calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division symbols are located in this group of keys. The enter key in this keys indicate the equal sign.
Multiple layouts.
It is possible to install multiple keyboard layouts within an operating system and switch between them, either through features implemented within the OS, or through an external application. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac provide support to add keyboard layouts and choose from them.
Layout changing software.
The character code produced by any key press is determined by the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.
The arrangement of symbols of specific language can be customized. An existing keyboard layout can be edited, and a new layout can be created using this type of software.
For example, Ukelele for Mac, The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator and open-source Avro Keyboard for Windows provide the ability to customize the keyboard layout as desired.
Other programs with similar functions include The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.
Illumination.
Keyboards and keypads may be illuminated from inside, especially on equipment for mobile use. Illumination facilitates the use of the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. Some gaming keyboards have lighted keys, to make it easier for gamers to find command keys while playing in a dark room. Some computers may have small LED lights in a few important function keys, to remind users that the function is activated (see photo).
Technology.
Key switches.
In the first electronic keyboards in the early 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80–120 US dollars and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were reed switches (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger).
In the mid-1970s, lower-cost direct-contact key switches were introduced, but their life in switch cycles was much shorter (rated ten million cycles) because they were open to the environment. This became more acceptable, however, for use in computer terminals at the time, which began to see increasingly shorter model lifespans as they advanced.
In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other "solid-state switch" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.
Meanwhile, IBM made their own keyboards, using their own patented technology: Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a "buckling spring" mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, triggering a hammer that presses two plastic sheets (membranes) with conductive traces together, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed.
The first electronic keyboards had a typewriter key travel distance of 0.187 inches (4.75 mm), keytops were a half-inch (12.7 mm) high, and keyboards were about two inches (5 cm) thick. Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110 inches (2.79 mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard which was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a half-inch thick.
Keytops are an important element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a "dish shape" on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and laser engraving, both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.
Initially, sublimation printing, where a special ink is printed onto the keycap surface and the application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.
Three final mechanical technologies brought keyboards to where they are today, driving the cost well under $10:
Plastic materials played a very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until "monoblocks" came along, GE's "self-lubricating" Delrin was the only plastic material for keyboard switch plungers that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch plungers was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75 mm to 2.79 mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monolocks also made of ABS.
Control processor.
Computer keyboards include control circuitry to convert key presses into key codes (usually scancodes) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the printed circuit board in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided sequentially to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected sequentially by scanning the X lines.
The first computer keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor was introduced in 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional to the extent that the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.
One test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the caps lock key. The keyboard sends the key code to the keyboard driver running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard.
Some lower-quality keyboards have multiple or false key entries due to inadequate electrical designs. These are caused by inadequate keyswitch "debouncing" or inadequate keyswitch matrix layout that don't allow multiple keys to be depressed at the same time, both circumstances which are explained below:
When pressing a keyboard key, the key contacts may "bounce" against each other for several milliseconds before they settle into firm contact. When released, they bounce some more until they revert to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "debounces" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one "confirmed" keystroke.
Some low-quality keyboards also suffer problems with "rollover" (that is, when multiple keys pressed at the same time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early "solid-state" keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early "direct-contact" keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had "n-key" rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) at the same time in a "direct contact" keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth "phantom" key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. "Three-key" rollover, also called "phantom key blocking" or "phantom key lockout", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and games (designed for multiple key presses).
As direct-contact membrane keyboards became popular, the available rollover of keys was optimized by analyzing the most common key sequences and placing these keys so that they do not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.
Connection types.
There are several ways of connecting a keyboard to a system unit (more precisely, to its keyboard controller) using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the PS/2 and the USB connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary Apple Desktop Bus for its keyboard connector.
Wireless keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port. The wireless aspect is achieved either by radio frequency (RF) or by infrared (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called Bluetooth. With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "eavesdropping" by hackers. Wireless solar keyboards charge their batteries from small solar panels using sunlight or standard artificial lighting. An early example of a consumer wireless keyboard is that of the Olivetti Envision.
Alternative text-entering methods.
Optical character recognition (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.
Speech recognition converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). This technology has also reached an advanced state and is implemented in various software products. For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, "close window" or "undo word") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).
Pointing devices can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are Graffiti, Dasher and on-screen virtual keyboards.
Other issues.
Keystroke logging.
Keystroke logging (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legally to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for various illegal or malicious acts. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures.
Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.
Anti-spyware applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by anti-spyware programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a firewall does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from "phoning home" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.
Physical injury.
The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.
Some adaptive technology ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to speech recognition software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.
Bacteria.
Some keyboards were found to contain five times more germs than a toilet seat.
Security vulnerabilities.
Keyboard are known emit electromagnetic signatures that can be detected using special spying equipment to reconstruct the keys pressed on the keyboard. Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council, revealed to InformationWeek that "More than 25 years ago, a couple of former spooks showed me how they could capture a user's ATM PIN, from a van parked across the street, simply by capturing and decoding the electromagnetic signals generated by every keystroke," O'Farrell said. "They could even capture keystrokes from computers in nearby offices, but the technology wasn't sophisticated enough to focus in on any specific computer." See, Van Eck phreaking.
Its also possible to use a hidden microphone to record the sound signature of different keystokes to guess what is being typed on a computer terminal. 
Thermal password scrapping uses thermal emissions to detect which keys were recently pressed on a keyboard in order to guess passwords and catch phrases.

Pond

A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.
Humans also make ponds. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds. Some ponds are created specifically for habitat restoration, including water treatment. Others, like water gardens, water features and koi ponds are designed for aesthetic ornamentation as landscape or architectural features. Fish ponds are designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.
Standing bodies of water such as puddles, ponds, and lakes are often categorized separately from flowing water courses, such as a brook, creek, stream or river. Nutrient levels and water quality in natural or man-made ponds can be controlled through natural process such as algal growth, or man-made filtration such as an algae scrubber.
Technical definitions.
The technical distinction between a pond and a lake has not been universally standardized. Limnologists and freshwater biologists have proposed formal definitions for "pond", in part to include 'bodies of water where light penetrates to the bottom of the waterbody,' 'bodies of water shallow enough for rooted water plants to grow throughout,' and 'bodies of water which lack wave action on the shoreline.' Each of these definitions has met with resistance or disapproval, as the defining characteristics are each difficult to measure or verify. Accordingly, some organizations and researchers have settled on technical definitions of "pond" and "lake" which rely on size alone.
Even among organizations and researchers who distinguish lakes from ponds by size alone, there is no universally recognised standard for the maximum size of a pond. The international Ramsar wetland convention sets the upper limit for pond size as , but biologists have not universally adopted this convention. Researchers for the British charity Pond Conservation have defined a "pond" to be 'a man-made or natural waterbody which is between 1 m2 and 20,000 m2 in area (2 ha or ~5 acres), which holds water for four months of the year or more.' Other European biologists have set the upper size limit at .
In practice, a body of water is called a pond or a lake on an individual basis, as conventions change from place to place and over time. In North America, even larger bodies of water have been called ponds; for example, Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts measures , nearby Spot Pond is , while in between is Crystal Lake at . There are numerous examples in other states of bodies of water less than being called lakes. As the case with Crystal Lake shows, marketing purposes may be the driving factor behind some names.
Formation.
Ponds can result from a wide range of natural processes. Any depression in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of precipitation can be considered a pond, and such depressions can be formed by a variety of geological and ecological events. Rivers often leave behind ponds in natural flood plains after spring flooding, and these can be very important to breeding fish, particularly in large river systems like the Amazon. Retreating glaciers can leave behind landscapes filled with small depressions, each developing its own pond; an example is the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Many areas of landscape contain small depressions which form temporary ponds after spring snow melt, or during rainy seasons; these are called vernal ponds, and may be important sites for amphibian breeding. Some ponds are created by animals. Beaver ponds are the best known example, but alligators also excavate ponds as well. In landscapes with organic soils, fires can also create depressions during periods of drought; these become open water when normal water levels return.
Characteristics.
One of the most important features of ponds is the presence of standing water, which provides habitat for wetland plants and animals. Familiar examples might include water-lilies, frogs, turtles and herons. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by wetland, and these wetlands support the aquatic food web, provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like geese and muskrats consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food. In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and decay. A large number of invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, dragonflies and herons. The open water may allow algae to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and minnows. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have a large number of different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They therefore provide an important source of biological diversity in landscapes.
Vernal ponds are ponds which dry up for part of the year. Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish. They are called vernal ponds because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring ("vernal" means to do with the spring). The absence of fish is a very important characteristic, since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from predation by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have serious detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the Mississippi Gopher Frog.
Conservation and management.
Ponds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity. Some principles threats to ponds include the following. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, overgrazing and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole. Nutrient sources such as pastures, human sewage, and even lawn fertilizer can cause explosive growth of algae, and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species. Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species of fish eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment and eat the young of amphibians. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows. The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.
In some landscapes, ponds are artificially constructed, perhaps to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, or to treat wastewater, or as part of a golf course. The design of a ponds determine how productive it will be for wildlife. In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.
Another important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys.
Nomenclature.
In origin, pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure. As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were man-made and utilitarian; as stew ponds, mill ponds and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds. Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as "stock pond", used for watering livestock.
"Pond" usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.
Some regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than . Minnesota, known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition, but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.
The term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from surface runoff ("ponded" water).
There are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is lochan, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed playas.
Uses.
Globally, the most important service provided by a pond, at many scales, is the production of fish and other wildlife. These are often also a source of food for humans, as well as an important source of recreation. At the same time, these ponds help maintain water quality by recycling nutrients.
In the Indian subcontinent, Hindu temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take baths. These ponds are considered sacred.
In medieval times in Europe, it was typical for many monastery and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have fish ponds. These are still common in Europe and in East Asia (notably Japan), where koi may be kept.
In agriculture, treatment ponds may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide irrigation reservoirs at times of drought.
