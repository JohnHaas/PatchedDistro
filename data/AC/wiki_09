Document conversion

Document conversion is the act of converting one document's format to another, which allows the document to be read in many more applications. Documents can be converted into
How it works.
The conversion of the file is usually done by the application that it was created with, though there are also various third-party tools to perform it. Most file formats can be disassembled with a hex editor.
Alternatively conversions can be automatically provided by Web services that connect to a document storage or delivery system - such as file directory or a document / content management applications. The content transformation services can run on a local server, in the Web or in the cloud.
Conversion tools can also be combined with a delivery component - that publishes converted data into a database, filesystem or other systems.
PHi provides Online Publishing, Digital Publishing Services, Document Conversion, Electronic Publishing print and electronic publishing work.
Paper documents conversion.
The task of converting scanned paper documents to useful electronic formats is one of the most important applications for document conversion.
Documents, scanned to image formats, have lots of limitations such as large file size, impossibility of context search and content reuse. Consideration should be given to conversion to more useful formats, such as:
Content extraction from the document image is the task of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technologies. Modern OCR applications convert image files to different document formats with saving not just content but also the structure of document (ADRT).

Wycherley International School

History.
Wycherley international school, one of the oldest International schools in Sri Lanka was founded in 1985. It is situated in 232 Bauddaloka Mawatte, Colombo 7. As a pioneer educational institution that filled the lack of English language skills in Srilanka when the medium of Sri Lankan schools was changed to Sinhala and Tamil, the school since the inception in 1985 has produced excellent performers in their chosen fields.
The medium of instruction is English with students ranging from nursery to high school. In the senior school, the classes prepare students for the Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary (O), Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level. 
Today the school boasts great academic standards with some of the past alumni attending prominent universities around the world such as Imperial College London, King's College London, University of Cambridge National University of Singapore, Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney and University of Oxford.
The school produces some of the highest “A” grade rates in the country for both Cambridge GCE ordinary level and Advance Level examinations. In some subjects such as Computing the school has produce 100% “A” Grade passes on more than one occasion. This is the only school in Sri Lanka to achieve this feat when presenting a significant number of students. The IT Department of the school is headed by Mr. Ruwan Iddamalgoda, who has been on the academic staff of Wycherly for over twenty years.

History of the internal combustion engine

Although various forms of internal combustion engines were developed before the 19th century, their use was hindered until the commercial drilling and production of petroleum began in the mid-1850s. By the late 19th century, engineering advances led to their widespread adoption in a variety of applications.
Timeline of development.
Various scientists and engineers contributed to the development of internal combustion engines:
Engine starting.
Early internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking. Various types of starter motor were later developed. These included:
Electric starters are now almost universal for small and medium-sized engines, while compressed-air starting is used for large engines.
Modern vs. historical piston engines.
The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between modern internal combustion engines and the early designs is the use of compression and, in particular, in-cylinder compression.

Gelli, Rhondda

Gelli is a village in the Rhondda Fawr valley, in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taff, Wales, situated on the southern bank of the Rhondda Fawr River. Gelli is a former coal mining village which is a district of the community of Ystrad.
Early and industrial history.
The village of Gelli takes its name from a farm that was once found in the area, which translates from the Welsh language roughly as 'small wood or copse'. Before the industrialisation of the area there were few settlements in the area, mainly small agricultural and farm buildings. Archeological finds in the area have provided proof of earlier populations, mainly Bronze Age, though Gelli does house one of only two definite Romano-British finds in the Rhondda Valleys. Roman finds in the uplands of Glamorgan are scarce, but the settlement at Hen Dre'r Gelli, excavated in 1903, is the only undefended settlement of its type in the Rhondda. A lengthy archaeological report was published in 1906, but little remains of the site, with much destroyed during the construction of the Nant y Gwyddon refuse tip.
The farmlands of 19th century Gelli were owned by absentee landlords, like Crawshay Bailey and the Earl of Dunraven, who would gain from selling the areas when coal exploration began. The first pit sunk in Gelli was in the 1870s, undertaken by the firm owned by Edmund Thomas and George Griffiths. The Gelli Colliery was then purchased by brothers, John and Richard Cory who deepened the pit further. The colliery suffered a mining accident when a gas explosion in 1893 took the lives of five miners. Subsequently the pit was sold to the Powell Duffryn Company, who owned the mine until the nationalisation of the mining industry in 1947. A second pit was opened by David Davies in 1877, the Eastern Colliery, though this closed in 1937.
Modern Gelli.
As with all villages in the Rhondda Valley, since the end of the coal mining industry, the area has suffered an economic depression with a history of unemployment higher than the national average. With little employment in the area apart from retail services many people commute to work outside the valley.
Gelli, which is adjoined by the communities of Ton Pentre and Ystrad, experiences fairly heavy levels of road traffic, with the B4223 – linking Llwynypia to Cwmparc – passing through the village. Gelli has also suffered in the past from flooding, owing to its low-lying level in relation to the River Rhondda, and after two serious floods in 1960 and 1970, the council responded by making improvements to the flood defences known as the Rhondda Wall.
Gelli (Nantgwyddon) was also home to a landfill site which has been at the centre of controversial reports connecting it with birth defects in children born in the nearby vicinity. The reports resulted in a full scale environmental report, and the decision by the local authorities to cease the dumping of domestic waste at the site.
Education.
Gelli Primary School, located on Ystrad Road, is the primary school that serves the village.
Pupils from the village also attend Ton Infants School (School Street, Ton Pentre) and Ton Juniors (Bailey Street, Ton Pentre)

Brood of the Witch-Queen

Brood of the Witch Queen is a 1918 supernatural novel by Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward, known better under his pseudonym, Sax Rohmer.
The story deals with Robert Cairn and his suspicions of Antony Ferrara, the adopted son of an old friend and colleague of Robert's father, Dr Bruce Cairn, of infernal magic and supernatural influence.
Plot.
The novel begins with the strange murder of Sir Michael Ferrara. A horrifying series of events follows, leading to a woman being used against her will to prey on her husband and then abducted and killed in inside a secret chamber in an old Egyptian pyramid. Only after a series of adventures and investigation is Antony Ferrara made powerless by Dr Bruce Cairn destroying the source of his control — the famed "Book of Thoth" — upon which Ferrara is no longer able to control the elemental he has summoned and is found as a burned corpse the day after.
Reception.
H.P.Lovecraft compared the novel as being similar to Bram Stoker's "Dracula", alongside Richard Marsh's "The Beetle" or Gerald Biss' "The door of the unreal" in his essay "Supernatural Horror in Literature". Les Daniels identified the book as being probably Rohmer's best novel, noting that it lacked the psuedo-scientific explanations usually employed by the author and concluding that "Rohmer's occult lore was never as well employed as in this tale... and he never equalled the claustrophobic chills of the scenes in the bowels of a pyramid".

Beardmore Precision Motorcycles

Beardmore Precision Motorcycles was a British motorcycle manufacturer. The original Precision company was set up by Frank E.Baker in Birmingham. Frank Baker quickly established a reputation for performance motorcycle engines and supplied Haden, and Sun Motorcycles. He began to build complete motorcycles using frames supplied by Sun, who were based at the nearby the Aston Brook Street factory. At the 1911 Olympia Motorcycle Show in London there were 96 motorcycles with Precision engines and by 1918 the company had over 800 employees. Tom Biggs was appointed as chief designer in 1913. Frank Baker stopped motorcycle & engine production during the First World War.
In 1919 Baker's company was merged with William Beardmore and Company, a Scottish engineering and shipbuilding company based in Glasgow and between 1921 and 1924 Beardmore produced motorcycles under the name "Beardmore Precision". The first motorcycle produced was a 350cc two-stroke featuring leaf-spring suspension front and rear and was followed by a range of motorcycles from 250cc to 600cc. 
After 1924 Baker regained the rights and started his set up his own company to continue production with Villiers engines of between 147 and 342cc in Alvechurch Road, Birmingham The company was eventually sold to the James Cycle Co in 1930. Frank Baker became a James employee and they used his designs well into the 1930s.

Constant current

In electronics, a constant current system is a system that can vary the voltage across an electronic circuit to maintain a constant electric current. When a component is indicated to be driven by a constant current, the driver circuit is, in essence, a current regulator and must appear to the component as a current source of suitable reliability. 
An important usage of constant current power supplies is with LEDs. While a high series resistance is sufficient to light an LED, sometimes the design needs to guard against high current (or risk burning out the LEDs). Another use is in fluorescent lamps which have very dynamic electrical resistance and are optimally operated within a short range of currents. Other uses include shielded metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding.

Thomas Toft

Thomas Toft (died November 1698) was an English potter working in the Staffordshire Potteries during the 17th century.
Pottery Work.
It is thought that Toft operated in the Burslem district during at least 1671-1689. The Staffordshire potters were at that time known for the excellence of their slipware; a kind of coarse earthenware decorated with a coloured clay and water mixture of cream-like consistency called slip. Sometimes a red slip was trailed on to a lighter background, sometimes vice-versa. Black and green slips were also used. According to the common practice of the time, these earthenwares were glazed with a galena lead oxide glaze, giving them their characteristic yellow tinge.
Designs attributed to Thomas Toft include mermaids, unicorns, pelicans, but also King Charles II and his wife Queen Catherine of Braganza, and numerous coats of arms. A cross-hatched rim was fairly typical of the style.
The Toft style, combined with the slip trailing technique, was firmly established in the Staffordshire area by the middle of the seventeenth century.
Over thirty signed dishes have been recorded but a few of them may have been made by his son, also called Thomas Toft.
Three tiny fragments of Toft pottery including a shard inscribed '...OFT' were found three feet below ground at the corner of Stafford Street and Trinity Street, Hanley in 1953.
Surviving Work.
Examples of his work can be found in:
Ireland
United Kingdom
United States
Personal Life and Family.
Very little is known about Toft's life. His father died in 1669. He married to Ellena Bucknall on 21 April 1663. Toft died a pauper in 1689 and was buried at Stoke-upon-Trent- now one of the six towns making up the city of Stoke-on-Trent, on 3 December 1689. His wife Ellena died two years later in 1691. They had five children: Matthias (b.1663), John (b.1664), Thomas (1670–1723), James (b.1673) and Cornelius (1677–1728).
Toft became the grandfather to seven children although he didn't live long enough to witness any of their births. Two, Maria (1701–1703) and Matthew (b.1698) were the children of James. Whilst Carol (b.1706), Cornelius (b.1703), Edward (1698–1701) and Standley (b.1700) were all the children of Matthias and his wife Dorothy Dickinson (d.1713).
Ralph Toft.
Ralph Toft (b.1683) was probably Thomas' elder brother, he shared the name of their father. Ralph's name appears on many typical Toft-style dishes decorated with a double-headed eagle, cavaliers and ladies, or with a mermaid, two being dated 1676 and 1766.
Ralph married Christabell Hatton (d.1693), the couple had no known children.
James Toft.
James Toft (b.1673) was Thomas' fourth son, it is believed that he is the maker of a number of Toft dishes that bear his name.
Cornelius Toft.
Cornelius Toft (1677–1728) was the youngest son of Thomas. A two-handled incised white salt-glazed loving cup is inscribed as follows:

St Mullin's

St. Mullins (, formerly anglicised as "Timoling" or "Tymoling") is a village on the eastern bank of the River Barrow in the south of County Carlow, Ireland. It is less than 2 km off the R729 regional road.
History.
The village is named after Saint Moling, who founded a monastery there in the early 7th century. The monastery was said to have been built with the help of "Gobban Saor", the legendary Irish builder. In the 8th-century manuscript, known as "The Book of Mulling", there is a plan of the monastery - the earliest known plan of an Irish monastery - which shows four crosses inside and eight crosses outside the circular monastic wall. It is said that St Moling dug a mile-long watercourse with his own hands to power his mill, a task that took seven years. He became Bishop of Ferns, died in 697 and is buried at St. Mullins. The St Moling watercourse is still there, but the original monastery was plundered by the Vikings in 951 and was again burnt in 1138. An abbey was later built on the site. A 9th-century high cross, showing the Crucifixion and a Celtic spiral pattern, stands outside the remains of the abbey. There are also the remains of a Norman motte and some domestic medieval buildings, including one that has an unusual diamond-shaped window. St Moling's Mill and Well are not far away.
River Barrow.
As well as being popular with anglers, St. Mullins is one of the stop-off points for pleasure barges and cruisers who ply the River Barrow. The building of the canal on the Barrow began here in 1750 and the Old Grain Store was built to store goods coming up the river from the sailing ships in New Ross. The horses and carts came down the tracks from the Blackstairs Mountains to gather their supplies and sell their goods for export. Horses were kept in the old stables to pull the barges up-river and the blacksmith was on hand to repair the barges and shoe the draught horses. By 1920 the Bolinger engine had arrived and the long serving horses were no longer needed.
St. Mullins is also the beginning and ending point for the Barrow Way long distance walk.

The accident was a result of Mitch dropping his ice cream, taking his eyes off the road to pick it up, and crashing the car into another driver, who had fallen asleep at the wheel and swerved into Mitch's car. His death causes anxiety attacks in Dawson for some time after the accident.

RNAD Broughton Moor

RNAD Broughton Moor is a decommissioned Royal Naval Armaments Depot located between Great Broughton and Broughton Moor in the County of Cumbria, England.
History.
The site was connected to the main line via a branch line to Siddick Junction, north of Workington railway station and utilised a headshunt at Northside to change direction northbound on to the Cumbrian Coast Line. The branch closed on 4 June 1992, being the last part of the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway in operation.
The site was decommissioned in 1992 at the end of the Cold War. The United States Navy used the site for storage of its armaments for its North Atlantic Squadron. The site had a Two foot six inch gauge railways narrow gauge railway. Locomotives from this railway are preserved on the Almond Valley and Whipsnade railways. The weapons were taken by rail out of the site to Workington. 
The large majority of the buildings and bunkers remain along with underground storage and an extensive network of storage sheds and other military buildings. Ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Allerdale Borough Council in 2008 who have yet to decide what to do with the site. The site was purchased by the Borough Council for £1. In October 2008 Cumbria County Council called for interest in the redevelopment of the site rebranded as Derwent Forest. As yet there has been little interest due to the huge cost involved with cleaning up the site. There are unexploded ordnance and large amounts of asbestos as well as unmarked mine shafts when it was a colliery prior to World War II. Furthermore, having previously ruled out allowing the site to be used for coal mining, Allerdale council later agreed to allow mining by any prospective future owners as a way to raise funding for any potential tourism development. 
It was announced on 13 January 2011 that the two shortlisted developers for the site would not mine the site, allaying fears about the environmental impact of the development of the site. A decision is due by the end of February 2011.
Accidents.
An explosion occurred at RNAD Broughton Moor on the 18th January 1944 which resulted in the death of 11 people and left 70 people injured. The coroners hearing was reported in the Cumberland Evening Star in February 1944. The explosion appears to have occurred in one of the traverse laboratories, photos showing the aftermath include a Two foot six inch gauge railways narrow gauge box van No. 267.
Sale of Railway Equipment.
The railway equipment at RNAD Broughton Moor was sold by tender in April and July 1992 and consisted of approximately 3 miles of standard gauge track and 25 miles of narrow gauge (2 ft 6in) track. The sale also included 4 standard gauge locomotives built by Ruston & Hornsby and Hunslet, 27 narrow gauge locomotives by the same builders and 127 wagons, including 6 box vans, 4 brake vans (2 x 4tons & 2 x 6 tons) and 99 flat wagons.
In 1970 the locomotives in use at Broughton Moor consisted of:

Field flattener lens is a type of lens used in modern binocular designs (e.g. Canon 10 x 42 L IS WP, 18 x 50 IS All Weather and Swarovski EL 8.5 x 42, EL 10 x 42) and in astronomic telescopes.
Field flattener lenses in binoculars improve edge sharpness and lower the distortion.
Field flattener lenses counteract the Petzval field curvature of an optical system. In other words, the function of a field flattener lens is to counter the field-angle dependence of the focal length of a system.
The object in designing a field flattening lens is to create a lens that shifts the focal points of the Petzval surface to lie in the same plane. Consider inserting a pane of glass in a focusing beam. Due to refraction, the focal point of the beam is shifted by formula_1 dependent on the thickness of the glass. Thus we have a thickness as a function of focal shift: formula_2. 
formula_3 is given by the radius of curvature of the Petzval surface, formula_4. It can be shown, then, that the radius of curvature for the lens that would flatten out the field is given by formula_5

Header-only

In the context of the C or C++ programming languages, a library is called header-only if the full definitions of all macros, functions and classes comprising the library are visible to the compiler in a header file form. Header-only libraries do not need to be separately compiled, packaged and installed in order to be used. All that is required is to point the compiler at the location of the headers (the -I switch in gcc/g++), and then #include the header files into the application source.
The disadvantages include:
Nonetheless, the header-only form is popular because it avoids the (often much more serious) problem of packaging.
For templates, including the definitions in header is the only way to compile, since the compiler needs to know the full definition of the templates in order to instantiate.

Wadi Tumilat

Wadi Tumilat (Old Egyptian Tjeku/Tscheku/Tju/Tschu) refers to the 50 km long dry river valley (wadi) to the east of the Nile delta. In prehistoric times, it was a distributary of the Nile. It starts from the area of modern Ismaïlia and continues from there to the west.
In ancient times, this was a major communication artery for caravan trade between Egypt and points to the east. The Canal of the Pharaohs was built there. A little water still flows along the wadi.
The Arabic name 'Wadi Tumilat' is believed to reflect the existence in the area, in ancient times, of an important temple of god Atum (Old Egyptian "pr-itm", 'House of Atum', changed over time into 'Tumilat', as well as into 'Pithom').
Archaeology.
Wadi Tumilat has the ruins of several ancient settlements. Late in the New Kingdom period, there was a well fortiﬁed site at Tell el-Retabah. But then, in the Saite Dynasty period, the major settlement and fort were moved east to Tell el-Maskhuta, only 12 km to the east.
Necho II (610–595 BC) initiated—but may have never completed—the ambitious project of cutting a navigable canal from the Pelusiac branch of the Nile to the Red Sea. Necho's Canal was the earliest precursor of the Suez Canal, and it went through Wadi Tumilat. It was in connection with a new activity that Necho founded a new city of "Per-Temu Tjeku" which translates as 'The House of Atum of Tjeku' at Tell el-Maskhuta.
Tell Shaqafiya in the Wadi is also associated with the Canal and its operation.
The site of Tell el Gebel is mostly of the Roman period.
In 1930, a team from the German Institute in Cairo conducted a survey of Wadi Tumilat. Later on, some Hyksos tombs were also discovered in the area at Tell es-Sahaba.
Wadi Tumilat Project.
Modern excavations at Tell el-Maskhuta were carried out by the University of Toronto 'Wadi Tumilat Project' under the direction of John Holladay. They worked over five seasons between 1978 and 1985.
As many as 35 sites of archaeological significance have been identified in the Wadi. The three large tells in the Wadi are Tell el-Maskhuta, Tell er-Retabah, and Tell Shaqafiya.
Tell er-Retabah has been investigated by the archaeologist Hans Goedicke of Johns Hopkins University.
Biblical references.
There are several biblical references to the area of Wadi Tumilat. For example, the ancient Pithom is believed to be here.
The western end of the Wadi Tumilat is identified as part of the Land of Goshen.
Wadi Tumilat—an arable strip of land serving as the ancient transit route between Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai—is also seen by scholars as the biblical 'Way of Shur'.
Biblical scholar Edouard Naville identified the area of Wadi Tumilat as Sukkot (Tjeku), the 8th Lower Egypt nome. This location is also mentioned in the Bible.

Johnny Douglas (conductor)

Johnny Douglas (19 June 1920 - 20 April 2003) was an English composer, musical director and string arranger, perhaps best known for his work in the easy listening genre. He recorded over 500 tracks for DECCA and over 80 albums for RCA, and wrote the soundtrack to the 1971 film "The Railway Children", plus 37 other feature films.
In the 1980s, he also composed and conducted music for many television series, including the children's TV animation series "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends", "Dungeons & Dragons", "The Incredible Hulk", "" and "The Transformers".
Early years.
Douglas was born in Hackney, London, England, on 19 June 1920, the eldest of two sons of John and May Douglas. The family moved to Bermondsey where his mother was a housewife and his father held a secretarial position until he became Alderman of West Bermondsey Council.
One of his earliest recollections was playing gramophone records on a machine that produced sound via a large green horn. By associating the music he heard with the colour and design of the labels on the 10” heavy and sometimes single sided records, he learned how to select the tune he wanted to hear. At 2½, his parents listened, not believing their own ears, when he played on the piano, one finger fashion, one of the popular tunes of the day that he had heard on one of his father’s records. He remembered playing "The Washington Post" that he learned from a record, which he felt sure was a green labelled Regal Zonophone.
Douglas went to school at 3 years where he was soon asked to demonstrate his pianistic ability to the assembled teachers. At 3½ years he played a duet with the head teacher at a school concert - the piece, "Rendezvous". He started piano lessons when he was 4 years old and gradually became interested in how music sounds were made. His music teacher discovered that he could name the notes with his back to the piano. This seemed not in the least extraordinary to him until she brought in all the occupants of the house to witness his “trick”. He then began to realise that he had performed something unusual.
He discovered the mysteries of arranging and orchestration at about 10 years old and gleaned knowledge of instruments and transpositions by studying printed band parts and listening to records. He won a government scholarship to St. Olaves & St. Saviours, a grammar school in Tooley Street, Bermondsey and at 13 formed a band, mainly of school friends, which won several dance band contests. He left school when he was 18 years old, continued with his band and began working as a clerk in an accounts office. 
Early professional career.
He made his first professional appearance in 1939 as pianist with the Neville Hughes Sextet and soon afterwards was called up for war service in the Royal Air Force, serving on various aerodromes in Scotland and England. He formed his own R.A.F. dance band and when, later, an arm injury prevented him from playing the piano for about two years, he concentrated on arranging and composing. He won a "Melody Maker" Jazz Jamboree award for the best dance band composition.
After the war he sent a copy of one arrangement to all the bandleaders of the day. George Elrick replied and engaged him as staff arranger. He began arranging for many famous bands including Bert Ambrose, Ted Heath and Edmundo Ros then became pianist/arranger with the Cyril Stapleton Band and pianist with broadcasting outfits of all kinds and at society balls.
Association with RCA.
In 1948, to gain more experience, he joined a music publisher as staff arranger and there began to write for orchestras rather than dance bands. He started scoring and conducting vocal backings for Decca in 1952 and his first hit was Tex Ritter's "High Noon", released on Capitol. During the next three years he recorded over 500 titles for Decca, backing many famous names including Al Martino, and was Musical Director on many hits. 
It was at this time that he started broadcasting with his own orchestra but it was not until 1958 that he was asked to score "Living Strings Play Music of the Sea" for RCA. It was recorded at the Kingsway Hall, London, with an orchestra of 61 musicians, an experience he was never to forget. This began his long association with RCA, New York, where it was his good fortune to work with A & R producer, Ethel Gabriel. During the next twenty-five years he scored and conducted 80 albums for RCA Living Strings alone and received a gold disc for the RCA album entitled "Feelings".
Broadcasting.
In 1955 he began broadcasting with the BBC, with his own programme entitled "In the Still of the Night", and there have been countless broadcasts since. From 1960 onwards his work increased tremendously. He began composing and scoring for films, had his own programme, again on BBC radio, entitled "Swing Song", which ran for two years, and was arranging for TV shows for such international stars as Shirley Jones, Howard Keel, Vera Lynn and Shirley Bassey. He was also arranging for numerous other recording artists.
Douglas had to his credit over 100 albums and 36 feature films, the most well known of the latter being "The Railway Children", for which he received a British Academy Film & TV Arts BAFTA Nomination, and "Dulcima", for which he conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He composed and arranged the music for the American TV children’s series "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends", "Dungeons & Dragons" and "The Incredible Hulk" and Pandamonium (TV series). He was also composer of the incidental music and arranger of all the music for "The Transformers" and "".

Tracks from his albums with The Johnny Douglas Orchestra and The Johnny Douglas Strings are frequently played on the various easy listening programmes.
Record label.
In 1983 Douglas started his own record label, Dulcima Records, producing top quality digitally recorded easy listening albums with different artists and with his own orchestra. At the end of 1999 he completed his first classical composition - a symphonic poem. It is a light classical work with three movements, entitled "The Conquest". The work was recorded for the label and was highly acclaimed by musicians, colleagues and radio presenters. This encouraged him to write a sequel, another symphonic poem entitled "The Aftermath", as well as a descriptive composition for solo flute entitled "The Blue Damsel-fly". These compositions are available on an album of new classical works entitled "Johnny Douglas in Concert", with the Dulcima Symphony Orchestra.
Death and legacy.
Douglas had suffered from prostate cancer for several years and died on 20 April 2003, at his home in Bognor Regis. He was survived by his wife, Marion, two daughters (his son died in 1988) and three grandchildren. 
Since his death, Dulcima Records has continued to keep his music alive by licensing his past recordings from the records companies that he worked for throughout his career. The ninth Johnny Douglas release on the label, and one of the most successful, is "The Railway Children". In 2008 the Dulcima Label obtained the licience from Sony Music to release the Johnny Douglas albums from the RCA Living Strings Series, and they have continued to re-release these recordings on CD to the present day.

BC Donetsk

BC Donetsk is a Ukrainian professional basketball club, based in Donetsk. The team plays in the Ukrainian SuperLeague. The mascot of the team is a tiger, and this also appears on their team logo; and "The Tigers" is also the team nickname.
History.
In Soviet times there was one professional basketball team in Donetsk, called “Shakhtyor.” It had the reputation of a strong-willed cup fighter. After Ukraine gained its independence, “miners” once took second and once third place in the National Championship, and played 24 games in Euro cups.
In 2006 a new club was found to continue basketball traditions of the Donbass capital, it was named BC "Donetsk". Initiator and the founder of a new club was Valery Plekhanov, who also became its coach, and started playing in the Ukrainian first league, which is the third highest league in Ukraine. At their first season (2006–07) there the team finished first with an amazing record of 34 wins in 34 games, and was promoted to the Ukrainian higher league, which is the second highest league in Ukraine. At that season (2007–08) the team won 53 out of 56 games, one of the leaders of the team Konstantin Galenkin was announced The Best Center Forward of the tournament. So BC "Donetsk" first in its history was promoted to the Ukrainian Basketball Super League. At the same season the team finally found a sponsor: Sergei Dyadechko, who also became the president of the club. Even though just promoted, the team received a wild card to play in the EuroChallenge 2008–09. The person who helped BC "Donetsk" to get its wild card was Sergei Bubka.
Just before the start of new 2008–09 season a new coach was invited to lead a team – Olympic Champion Igors Miglinieks. Also to reinforce the team before new season some famous legionaries and candidates for the national teams of Ukraine, Belarus and Puerto Rico appeared in BC "Donetsk".

Merchise

Merchise was a Computer Software group created circa 1991 at University "Marta Abreu" of Las Villas, in Santa Clara city, Cuba. It was founded by Ing. Medardo Rodriguez who desired to create a Computer Programming Research Team with headquarters in Las Villas U but formed by people with spontaneous and free ideas about what a computer team and software should be. The Merchise name per-se was an idea of the other co-founder Ing. Miguel Cepero and it refers to Mayan wizard deity [http://palabravirtual.com/index.php?ir=ver_poema3.php&pid=11746].
History.
Despite the fact it was feed from students from different departments of the U like Electrical, Computer Sciences, Mechanic, Industrial and Chemistry Departments producing code and graphics during their free time and night shifts the group manage to quickly be noticed not only at its original Campus but nationwide. Fame that probably played a strong roll in the rise and fall of it. As "free thinking" was one of the premises of the team, most of its members had the strong will to create a niche market for Cuban video games. But in a society where games were consider at the time harmful and thus playing was forbidden at all times at all schools a team willing to create games was soon perceived as the black sheep and set to extinction.
After trying and failing with "Axthor" a 2D arcade quite similar in style to Delphine Software's Another World a good opportunity opened for the group at this activity when "La Fortaleza: en las entrañas de la Bestia" (The Fortress:inside the Beast's guts) or just Fortaleza I, a text RPG created by Cepero himself gain positive reviews in Cuba and Mexico. Soon after several games start to develop at Merchise studios, Fortaleza II (La venganza de la bestia|The Beast's revenge) was one of it, but must important was a project named "Escape del Castillo de la Fisica" (Escape from Physic's Castle) a visual point-and-click game in the fashion of Lucas Arts Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or the Monkey Island (series).
By end of 1994 Escape had a multi department team working on it with the full approval of the University authorities that so far considered the dissolution of the group. Since Escape was meant to solve Physics problems a team of two teachers from that Department join the project and it was tested several times with children from different grades and schools and it finally proved that gaming was a reliable tool to teach all along.
Special mention deserves Merchise's own engine creation tool known as "Magister Ludi" what could be at that time compared, again, to Lucas Art's SCUMM. All games and several other types of interactive environments were created using Magister Ludi all over the University's Departments.
Proven themselves as top programmers and designers of their time, in 1995 Merchise Group finally got their dream chance when Canadian software developers Oceanus Communications came along with a very ambitious project for software developing involving Massively multiplayer online games, Internet Media Integration and more.
Ottawa era.
From late 1997 to 2003, year when it finally was dismantled, most of members of former Merchise group had joined Oceanus Communications in Ottawa, Canada in their joint quest to conquer International markets. Important from this period were visionary projects like;
Skipper, online integration (WEB, FTP, Mail, News client and explorer)
Netris Kombat, a Tetris style game but with net multiuser platform and weapons/defenses concept.
Legacy Online former Starpeace, a massive multiplayer world simulation game at the style of SimCity.
Since its release in December 2000 and after several ups and downs Starpece came back in a server in July 2008 due to fan intervention. Currently there are only a couple of worlds being hosted, Zyrane and Planitia. It can be seen hosted at, http://www.starpeaceonline.com .

<doc id="18860008" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18860008" title="Lake Timsah">
Lake Timsah

Lake Timsah, also known as Crocodile Lake, is a lake in Egypt on the Nile delta. It lies in a basin developed along a fault extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Suez through the Bitter Lakes region. In 1800, a flood filled the Wadi Tumilat, which caused Timsah's banks to overflow and moved water south into the Bitter Lakes about nine miles (14 km) away. In 1862, the lake was filled with waters from the Red Sea.
Geography.
Lake Timsah lies within a depression that spans the isthmus between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The lowest points of the depression form shallow natural lakes, of which Timsah is one. The surface area of Lake Timsah covers 5.4 square miles. Most of the lake is marshy and depth rarely exceeds 3 feet (1 meter).
It has been asserted that, in ancient times, Lake Timsah was the northern terminus of the Red Sea.
March 4, 1863, the city of Ismailia, named in honor of the viceroy Ismail Pasha, arose on Lake Timsah's northern bank. Several beaches overlook the lake, including the Moslem Youth, Fayrouz, Melaha, Bahary, Taawen, and a few Suez Canal Authority beaches.
Canals.
Lake Timsah possibly first became a juncture for canal construction approximately 4,000 years ago during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, and was expanded by Darius I.
Suez Canal construction in the vicinity of Lake Timsah began in 1861 on the segment north of the lake. Initial preparations included the construction of sheds to house 10,000 workers, steam sawmills, and importation of large quantities of wheelbarrows and wooden planks. 3,000 laborers dug a channel from the Nile to Lake Timsah in 1861 and 1862, which brought a fresh water supply to the area. It was also proposed to construct a halfway port at this point along the canal.
The Ismailia section of the Suez Canal, which connected Lake Manzala to Lake Timsah, was completed in November 1862. Construction of the segment was completed with forced labor, which expanded the workforce to 18,000 men. The trench measured wide by four to six feet deep and connected Lake Timsah to the Mediterranean Sea. Work began south of Lake Timsah in 1862-1863 as expansion continued on the northern segment. Forced labor was used during canal construction from March 1862 until Ismail Pasha outlawed the practice in 1864. As a result of the canal, waters from Lake Manzaleh flowed into Lake Timsah. Expansion continued on the northern segment until 1867 and on the southern segment until 1876.
Environment.
Lake Timsah is a brackish lake that experiences significant variations in salinity. Human engineering projects have impacted salinity, with resulting changes in the lake's biota. Decreases in salinity were noted as early as 1871 following Suez Canal construction, and subsequent enlargement of the channel from the Nile and other construction projects increased the inflow of fresh water to the lake. The El-Gamil outlet serves as Lake Timsah's principal source of salt water. Timsah's main source of fresh water was annual Nile flooding until the Aswan High Dam interrupted these flows in 1966, although groundwater also accounts for much of the lake's freshwater supply. Lake Timsah experiences both stratification variations in salinity and seasonal surface variations in salinity, and in recent decades freshwater taxa have been overtaking brackish taxa.
In 2002, a study was conducted to check the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish and shellfish species that locals consume from the lake. Samples included tilapia, crabs, bivalves, clams and gastropods. The results showed that crabs contained "significantly higher concentrations of both total and carcinogenic PAHs than other species, while clams contained significantly lower levels of PAHs."
In 2003, a number of groups attempted to relieve the lake of pollution. It was a significant event for the local community, since the lake is of economic importance to the city and its fishermen.

Bezdan (album)

Bezdan (trans. "Abyss") is the fourth studio album released by Serbian and former Yugoslav singer-songwriter Đorđe Balašević. The album was produced by Đorđe Petrović and arrangements were done by Aleksandar Dujin. Those two would be the key associates of Balašević for the next twenty-five years and become the backbone of Balašević supporting band The Unfuckables.
The album's biggest hits were the ballads "Ne volim januar", "Bezdan" and "Ne lomite mi bagrenje". Live versions of "Ne volim januar" usually feature a long concluding monologue. "Ne lomite mi bagrenje" ("Don't Break my Locusts") caused much controversy. Some critics stated that the song was metaphorically speaking against Albanian terror over Serbs in the conflict on Kosovo. Balašević later explained that "it is not a song about ethnicities, but about good and evil, and I don't regret, I called the Evil its full name even when others praised it.". Later in late 1990s he stated that "I didn't know that Serbs would become Shiptars to Shiptars. That turned around. We are the ones who break locusts now, but I can't take the blame for that".
The album was polled in 1998 as the 25th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book "" ("YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music").

Feri Cansel

Feriha "Feri" Cansel (7 July 1944 – 2 September 1983) was a Turkish Cypriot actress.
She was born Lefkoşa (Nicosia), Cyprus and spent her early youth in the United Kingdom, acquiring British citizenship and she became a hairdresser in London. Once settled in Turkey, she also obtained Turkish citizenship, marrying for convenience the janitor of the block of apartments in İstanbul where she lived concluding for that purpose. She started in show business as a stage stripper, and she appeared in her first film in 1964.
Career.
She started her acting career with secondary roles in Turkish cinema's mainstream movies, and who attained fame after she started to appear in "seks filmleri", a particular genre of which had developed in Turkey in the mid-1970s to last until the eve of the 1980s. Her name became synonymous with the then rising wave of films of the genre, with a much reduced story line and a soft- to mid-hardcore pornographical content arranged to match the tastes of local audiences often disguised as comedy films. In this regard, Feri Cansel held the same title as such other cult actresses of the time as Zerrin Egeliler, Arzu Okay, Zerrin Doğan and Figen Han.
According to the Sinematürk database of Turkish films, Feri Cansel's career spanned 18 years during which she acted in 136 films. 120 of these films can be categorized as belonging in the erotic line. Cansel herself, on the other hand, claimed in 1978 that she had by then appeared in 350 erotic movies. Both figures could make Cansel win the career-long title for the highest number of erotic Turkish movies made by any actor/actress.
The difference between the two figures is explained by the extensive practice at the time by the film producers, who viewed films that were shot not as parts of a single work but merely as source material for production of multiple films, to cut and paste. Erotic scenes, especially, were often cut and pasted to assemble new films from various parts of existing ones. This peculiar practice was called "parça" ("literally the "fragment""), and the term was extended into the movie theaters themselves to include the practice by the operators of inserting hardcore material, which was European most of the time, into Turkish "erotic" films.
Cansel's liberal use of foul language in her films earned her the nickname of Emmanuelle of Kasımpaşa, a popular quarter of Istanbul notorious for its peculiar speech rich in slang.
She was killed by her fiancé in İstanbul in 1983. Cansel was survived by her daughter İlter Özcan who is also an actress with the alias "Zümrüt Cansel".

1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France

Between late 1957 and March 1958 the Australia national rugby union team - the Wallabies - conducted a world tour encompassing Britain, Ireland, France and Canada on which they played five Tests and thirty-one minor tour matches. The Wallabies won 17, lost 16 and drew three of their games in total. They lost all five Tests of the tour.
The squad's leadership.
Versatile back Dick Tooth had made 10 Test appearances for Australia before the tour and had captained the Wallabies well in two 1957 Tests against the All Blacks. Howell expresses a view that it was inexplicable that Tooth was not selected for the tour and partially blames this as cause of the disappointing tour result. However Howell writes that Bob Davidson possessed outstanding qualities to make him a natural touring captain. He was a born leader of men, was immensely popular, he met people well, was highly intelligent and spoke well in public. He played in 32 of the 41 tour games and did everything in his power to make the tour a success.
Veteran second-rower Alan Cameron had captained the Wallabies in 18 matches in 1955 and 1956 but was no longer supreme in his position nor guaranteed of Test selection. However he made a superb contribution to the tour playing in 22 matches including one Test and captained the side in seven mid-week matches
As per tradition, Assistant Manager Dave Cowper assumed the coaching duties. Howell writes that in spite of the mounting losses, Cowper "ever the gentleman, never criticised the players, even when he had every right to...he personified the true amateur, playing always to the rules with a strict code of ethics" Squad member Nicholas Shehadie was less complimentary in his published recollections suggesting Cowper had limited imagination as a coach with "our training devoid of variety which made it very tedious."
Tour details.
The squad was on tour for eight months in total and travelled to England by ship. Shehadie reports that the team issue consisted of " "two blazers, a pair of grey slacks, four green ties with a hand-painted wallaby on each, a heavy pullover and a track suit. In addition, each player received one pair of boots - with another pair to be issued in England - sandshoes for training on the ship, a heavy woollen scarf and tablets to counteract sea-sickness, Vitamin C tablets to counteract colds in Britain and a packet of tranquiliser tablets to be used at the player's own discretion" He recalls that the squad's pocket money was 10s a day, up from 5s a decade before.
Test Matches.
Wales.
AUSTRALIA: Terry Curley, Roderick Phelps, Kenneth Donald, Jim Lenehan, Jack Potts, Arthur Summons, Des Connor, Nicholas Shehadie, Norman Hughes, Peter Fenwicke, Tony Miller, David Emanuel, John Thornett, James Brown, Robert Davidson (captain)

Ireland.
Shehadie writes in his memoirs that his response to Noel Murphy continually blocking his vision in the scrum was to deal him a punch in an ensuing scrum. He recalls that the Lansdowne Rd crowd booed the Australian team and that press afterwards singled out Shehadie for his brutal play. He suggests that Dave Cowper then determined to make an example of him and true to his word did not select him in another Test of the tour. It was therefore Shehadie's last Test match, as it would also be for Australia's other forward veteran Alan Cameron.
AUSTRALIA: Terry Curley, Kenneth Donald, Saxon White, Jack Potts, Roderick Phelps, Arthur Summons, Des Connor, Nicholas Shehadie, James Brown, Robert Davidson (captain), Alan Cameron, David Emanuel, John Thornett Norman Hughes, Peter Fenwicke

England.
This was the day Twickenham booed, a rare sound at the august ground. But when big Jim Lenehan tackled Phil Horrocks-Taylor late and so heavily that he was taken off the field, the crowd were annoyed. Every time Lenehan touched the ball, the crowd booed.
The scores were 3-0 at half time, but soon Malcolm Phillips scored a great try and then the elegant Terry Curley gave the Wallabies the lead with a drop goal. When injury time came the score was 6-all. Then came the only try of the match by brilliant Peter Jackson. Jackson out on the wing, got a pass on the Wallaby 25. He was not the fastest of wings - but he was deceptive and knew sidestep, swerve and hand-off, and used them as deadly weapons. He swerved away from Rod Phelps and handed him off. He moved to cut in, plonking Terry Curley onto the wrong foot as he beat him on the outside. Phelps was gaining, the line was approaching, Phelps was faster and Jackson dived with Phelps on his back.
It was England's first post-war Test victory over one of the three Southern powers.

List of dual-code rugby internationals

A dual-code rugby international is a rugby footballer who has played at the senior international level in both rugby league and rugby union.
Rugby league started as a breakaway version of rugby in Northern England (1895) and in New Zealand and Australia in 1908 and consequently a number of the top-class rugby league pioneers had been star players in the rugby union code. Accordingly, a high proportion of Australia and New Zealand's dual-code rugby internationals played in rugby league's formative years in those countries.
From 1910 through to 1995, dual-code internationals were infrequent and with the single exception of Karl Ifwersen, the player had always first appeared as a union international before shifting to league due to the strict "black-banning" approach take by union administrators to those players who crossed to the professional code. In 1995 rugby union itself turned professional and the tide of switches began to reverse. Since then generally all cross-code representatives have debuted internationally in league before being lured to union where there is a larger international competitive arena.
Backs have more often been dually successful at the highest level than forwards - approximately 65% of the players here listed are backs. Although pre-1995 there were many notable forwards who made the union to league switch. Since 1995 nearly 90% of the league to union converts who went on to play internationally have been backs.
The following is an incomplete list of dual-code internationals, listed by country.
New Zealand.
There have been thirty seven New Zealand dual-code rugby internationals, including eighteen who made their debuts before World War One. However, only two people became dual-code rugby internationals after first representing New Zealand in rugby league: Karl Ifwersen and Sonny Bill Williams. The comprehensive list is:
All Golds.
The 1907 Professional All Blacks (derisively referred to by the New Zealand press as the All Golds) left New Zealand in August 1907 for their ground-breaking tour of Britain via Sydney. The squad contained eight former All Blacks in George Smith, Thomas Cross, William Mackrell, Herbert Turtill, Duncan McGregor, Eric Watkins, Massa Johnston and Edgar Wrigley. These men became New Zealand's first dual-code internationals at the point they first played on the ten month tour.
The three matches in Sydney between 17 and 24 August against professional New South Wales rugby rebels were played under rugby union rules so do not qualify as international rugby league appearances. But full internationals under "Northern Union" (rugby league) rules were played against Wales in Aberdare on 1 Januard 1908 and three Tests against Great Britain in Leeds on 25 January 1907, Chelsea on 8 February 1907 and Cheltenham on 15 February 1908. Three Test matches were played in Australia on the homeward leg before the All Golds arrived home in June 1908 having played 48 games (tour matches and Tests) as internationals.
More than one country.
Dally Messenger
One week after his final Test appearance as a Wallaby, Messenger, who was born in Australia, toured Great Britain at the invitation of the All Golds in 1907 . His international rugby league debut was made on that tour representing New Zealand. His Australian international Test debut was made in Sydney in Australia's inaugural rugby league Test v the Kiwis on 9 May 1908. He made six further international rugby league appearances for Australia. His RU appearances for Australia and his subsequent RL appearance for New Zealand make him a dual country dual-code international. His international RL appearances for New Zealand and then Australia make him a dual-code international who represented two countries in one of those codes.
Emosi Koloto
Koloto grew up in New Zealand playing rugby union and represented Tonga in the code before switching to league and moving to England. He was called up into the Kiwis in 1991 from the Widnes club and played five tests that year.
John Schuster
Schuster first played rugby union, representing both Samoa and New Zealand. Later he switched to rugby league and captained Western Samoa in their two pool games at the 1995 World Cup.
Henry Paul
Paul was born in New Zealand. His senior club rugby league career was played in England but between 1995 and 2001 he regularly returned to New Zealand to make international appearances for the Kiwis. When he switched to union in 2002 he became eligible to represent England by ancestry of his grandfather and he did so in 2002.
Brad Thorn
Thorn was born in Mosgiel, New Zealand. From age eight he played rugby league in Queensland and at twenty-two he represented for Australia (Super League) during the Super League split year. When the code re-united in 1998 he also represented in the Australia national (ARL) side.
In 2001 he moved to New Zealand and switched to rugby union. He appeared in twelve Tests for the All Blacks from 2003. For 2005-06 he returned to the National Rugby League in Australia, winning a premiership with the Brisbane Broncos and representing at state level. In 2008 he switched to rugby union for a second time and was again selected for the All Blacks. He is thus a dual-code and dual-country international who has made the code switch twice and has represented internationally at rugby union in two different stages of his career.
Michael Horak
Horak was born in South Africa and represented for the South Africa national rugby league team. He switched to rugby union in 1998 moving to England to play with the Leicester Tigers. He qualifies to represent England via his English mother and did so in 2002.
Lesley Vainikolo
Vainikolo was born in Tonga but raised in New Zealand playing rugby league at school. His league club career was played with the Canberra Raiders in Australia and the Bradford Bulls in England. During that period he made twelve national representative appearances for Kiwis.
He took up union with Gloucester Rugby in 2007. He was eligible to play for Tonga by birth, New Zealand by parentage or England by residence. He had previously declined to play for Tonga in the 2007 Rugby World Cup so that he could play for his adopted nation. He made his international rugby union debut for England v Wales in February 2008 and played in five tests that season.
Craig Gower
After a successful eleven year Australian rugby league career from 1996 to 2007 with the Penrith Panthers during which he made five State of Origin appearances for New South Wales and twenty-three Test appearances for Australia (5 x Super League and 18 ARL), Gower moved to Europe, switched codes and signed with French rugby union side Bayonne from 2008. He is eligible to play for Italy through the heritage of his Italian grandfather. He was selected for Italy on their mid-season tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2009.
Shontayne Hape
Hape, a New Zealand Mãori, had a very successful rugby league career in both hemispheres, first with the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL (1999–2002) and then with the Bradford Bulls in Super League (2003–2008). He made his Test debut for New Zealand in the 2004 Tri-Nations, and eventually appeared in 14 Tests for New Zealand. Hape switched codes in 2008, signing with Bath, for whom he still plays. Under IRB rules, he was already eligible to represent England on residency grounds, having lived there for well over the three years required to qualify. Hape made his union Test debut for England in 2010 against Australia.
Maurie Fa'asavalu
Maurie Fa'asavalu is a Samoan rugby union player who formerly played rugby league for St Helens. He was picked in the Great Britain rugby league squad after living in England for 4 years. He also played for England in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup
Bill Hardcastle
A New Zealander and an 1897 All Black, Hardcastle journeyed to Sydney in 1899 on hearing that the visiting British rugby union team would be not be travelling to New Zealand. Australian rugby in those days had no residential rules and once he joined Sydney's Glebe RU club he qualified for Australian national selection. He was chosen for Australia in the fourth test of 1899 against Great Britain.
In rugby league he made two Test appearances for Australia and six minor appearances on the 1908 Kangaroo tour.
Va'aiga Tuigamala
Tuigamala initially represented New Zealand in rugby union and gained the nickname “Inga the Winger”. He then switched codes, joining Wigan in 1993. While playing league he represented Western Samoa at the 1995 World Cup. When rugby union turned professional he returned to his original code. Between 1996 and 2000 he represented Samoa in rugby union.
Lote Tuqiri
Born in Fiji, Tuqiri was a junior Australian rugby league international at age 19 in 1998. When he missed selection for Australia's 2000 Rugby League World Cup squad he opted to play for Fiji and captained the side in their three pool match appearances. He later played four rugby league Tests for Australia in 2001 before his 2003 switch to union and a long international representative career in that code.
Fred Jackson
Jackson toured Australasia with the 1908 Anglo-Welsh Lions. However during the tour he was accused of professionalism and recalled to England by the Rugby Football Union. Jackson left the touring party but failed to return to England to face the accusations. In 1910 Jackson played rugby league in New Zealand and represented both Auckland and New Zealand against the touring Great Britain side.
First dual-code rugby international.
England's Anthony Starks and Wales' Jack Rhapps took the field in the inaugural rugby league international of 5 April 1904 between England and Other Nationalities Starks had made two rugby union Test appearances for England in 1896, and Rhapps had made a single rugby union Test appearance for Wales in 1897, and thus in April 1904 they became the world's first dual rugby code internationals.
The first tour matches played by the New Zealand All Golds in Britain in Nov & Dec 1907 would have seen international cross-code debuts by some of the seven touring former All Blacks. At this stage of the tour the New Zealanders were still familiarising themselves with the new Northern Union rules which they had not seen until they arrived in Leeds in October. The first full international of the tour against Wales on New Year's Day 1908 saw confirmed appearances by Mackrell, Turtill, Wrigley, Johnston & Cross for New Zealand and David Jones for Wales. Thus New Zealand's first five dual-code rugby internationals all achieved that feat in the same match.
Dual-code internationals who also represented in a third sport.
Michael Cleary represented Australia in track & field at the Commonwealth Games making him an international at the senior level in three sports. Dick Thornett achieved the same distinction having also represented for Australia in water polo at the 1960 Rome Olympics.
Disputed dual-code rugby internationals.
Robert Graves.
Robert Graves is erroneously excluded from some published sources listing Australian dual-code internationals (including a number of editions of David Middletons' Australian Rugby League Yearbook). This is most likely because his single Wallaby appearance was made as a reserve.
Len Smith.
Len Smith's international status in rugby league is undoubted, despite the infamy of his 1948 selection controversy. Both his international league appearances were made as captain. What is contested is whether he ever made an international rugby union appearance.
Smith was selected as an Australian rugby union international for the ill-fated 1939 tour of Great Britain. Docking at Southampton the day before World War II was declared, the team left England without playing a game. The Whiticker reference records that "the squad played an exhibition match in Bombay on the journey home so that the players could be afforded international status". However rugby league historian Sean Fagan casts doubt on this, citing his 1998 interview with Smith where Smith said the game was played between one-half of the touring squad against the other with the numbers made up by military personnel on hand in Bombay. This is supported by the Pollard reference which records that the Australia played against a "Gymkhana XV made up of military men and others".

Betsimisaraka people

The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") make up approximately fifteen percent of the Malagasy people and are the second largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina. 
They occupy a large stretch of the eastern seabord of Madagascar, from Mananjary in the south to Antalaha in the north. 
Ethnic identity.
Like the Sakalava to the west, the Betsimisaraka are composed of numerous ethnic sub-groups united by historical circumstances under the same denomination. Most Betsimisaraka are of mixed Bantu African and Asian Austronesian descent. The Betsimisaraka area has included the port of Toamasina, Fénérive Est and Maroansetra. The territory today is a thin area of land that stretches along the east coast of Madagascar from the River Bemarivo to the River Mananjary in the south.
History.
Until the beginning of the 18th century, the peoples who would constitute the core of the Betsimisaraka were the Tsikoa (or Betanimena) of the south, the Varimo of the central east coast, and the Anteva of the northeastern coast. Each of these groups was culturally and linguistically distinct and would periodically enter into conflict with one another. These conflicts were actively encouraged by Europeans, a presence that dramatically increased from the 17th to 18th centuries. Europeans engaged with locals to sell arms in exchange for slaves and other forms of trade and conflict between locals could work to the Europeans' economic advantage. 
With increased European presence there emerged a class of mulatto Malagasy ("malata" or "zana-malata") issuing from unions between European men and Malagasy women. Ratsimilaho, the founder of the Betsimisaraka kingdom, was a "malata". His father, named either Tom Tew (according to Guillaume Grandidier) or Thomas White (according to J.-M. Filliot) was an English pirate who was married in 1695 to Rahena, an Anteva princess of the Zafindramizoa family of Foulpointe. 
Around 1710, after much effort and several failures, Ratsimilaho united the northeastern coastal people and led them in a successful resistance against incursions by the powerful king Ramanano who wished to secure control over a greater portion of the lucrative commerce with Europeans. Upon Ramanano's defeat, Ratsimilaho was able to establish himself as king over his people as well as Ramanano's (the latter taking the name Betanimena - "those of much red soil," in reference to burial or violent death - upon the loss of their king and sovereignty). The Betanimena continued to resist his rule, however, leading him to extend his southern alliances and territory through marriage to the daughter of King Kaleheka, whom he persuaded to join in his long and bloody but ultimately successful war to subdue and unite the eastern coast. But after his death in 1750, his queen Bity and then his son ended up losing the power that Ratsimilaho had once commanded. The union dissolved into warring clans, facilitating the campaign to bring them under the rule of Merina king Radama I. This campaign, which began in 1817, was successful and the Merina maintained their authority over the Betsimisaraka until the beginning of the French colonial period in 1896.
Language.
The Betsimisaraka speak several dialects of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo.

Spin contamination

In computational chemistry, spin contamination is the artificial mixing of different electronic spin-states. This can occur when an approximate orbital-based wave function is represented in an unrestricted form – that is, when the spatial parts of α and β spin-orbitals are permitted to differ. Approximate wave functions with a high degree of spin contamination are undesirable. In particular, they are not eigenfunctions of the total spin-squared operator, "Ŝ"2, but can formally be expanded in terms of pure spin states of higher multiplicities (the contaminants).
Open-shell wave functions.
Within Hartree–Fock theory, the wave function is approximated as a Slater determinant of spin-orbitals. For an open-shell system, the mean-field approach of Hartree–Fock theory gives rise to different equations for the α and β orbitals. Consequently there are two approaches that can be taken – either to force double occupation of the lowest orbitals by constraining the α and β spatial distributions to be the same (restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock, ROHF) or permit complete variational freedom (unrestricted Hartree–Fock UHF). In general, an "N"-electron Hartree–Fock wave function composed of "N"α α-spin orbitals and "N"β β-spin orbitals can be written as
where formula_2 is the antisymmetrization operator. This wave function is an eigenfunction of the total spin projection operator, "Ŝ"z, with eigenvalue ("N"α − "N"β)/2 (assuming "N"α ≥ "N"β). For a ROHF wave function, the first 2"N"β spin-orbitals are forced to have the same spatial distribution:
β electrons are constrained to share common spatial orbitals and the renaming "N" - 2"M" are unpaired, with "N" = "N"α + "N"β.-->There is no such constraint in an UHF approach.
Contamination.
The total spin-squared operator commutes with the nonrelativistic molecular Hamiltonian so it is desirable that any approximate wave function is an eigenfunction of "Ŝ"2. The eigenvalues of "Ŝ"2 are "S"("S" + 1) where "S" can take the values 0 (singlet), 1/2 (doublet), 1 (triplet), 3/2 (quartet), and so forth.
The ROHF wave function is an eigenfunction of "Ŝ"2: the expectation value "Ŝ"2 for a ROHF wave function is
However, the UHF wave function is not: the expectation value of "Ŝ"2 for an UHF wave function is
The sum of the last two terms is a measure of the extent of spin contamination in the unrestricted Hartree–Fock approach and is always non-negative – the wave function is usually contaminated to some extent by higher order spin eigenstates unless a ROHF approach is taken. Naturally, there is no contamination if all electrons are the same spin. Also, there
is often no contamination if the number of α and β electrons is the same. A small basis set could also constrain the
wavefunction sufficiently to prevent spin contamination.
Such contamination is a manifestation of the different treatment of α and β electrons that would otherwise occupy the same molecular orbital. It is also present in Møller–Plesset perturbation theory calculations that employ an unrestricted wave function as a reference state (and even some that employ a restricted wave function) and, to a much lesser extent, in the unrestricted Kohn–Sham approach to density functional theory using approximate exchange-correlation functionals.
Elimination.
Although the ROHF approach does not suffer from spin contamination, it is less commonly available in quantum chemistry computer programs. Given this, several approaches to remove or minimize spin contamination from UHF wave functions have been proposed.
The annihilated UHF (AUHF) approach involves the annihilation of first spin contaminant of the density matrix at each step in the self-consistent solution of the Hartree–Fock equations using a state-specific Löwdin annihilator. The resulting wave function, while not completely free of contamination, dramatically improves upon the UHF approach especially in the absence of high order contamination.
Projected UHF (PUHF) annihilates all spin contaminants from the self-consistent UHF wave function. The projected energy is evaluated as the expectation of the projected wave function.
The spin-constrained UHF (SUHF) introduces a constraint into the Hartree–Fock equations of the form λ("Ŝ"2 − "S"("S" + 1)), which as λ tends to infinity reproduces the ROHF solution.
All of these approaches are readily applicable to unrestricted Møller–Plesset perturbation theory.
Density Functional Theory (DFT).
Although many DFT codes simply calculate spin-contamination using the Kohn-Sham orbitals as if they
were Hartree-Fock orbitals, this is not necessarily correct.

Yury Patrikeyev

Yury Patrikeyev (, , born September 28, 1979 in Kirovo-Chepetsk, Russian SSR) is an Armenian-Russian Greco-Roman wrestler. He is a four-time European Champion and World and Olympic medalist. Patrikeyev has been awarded the Master of Sport of Russia, International Class title.
Early life.
Yury Patrikeyev started Greco-Roman wrestling in his hometown of Kirov-Chepetsk under the direction of Paul Vertunova. In 1996, he enrolled in the Kuban State University of Physical Education and moved to Krasnodar, where he began wrestling under the direction of the honored coach of Russia, Igor Ivanov. Patrikeyev became a World Champion as a cadet in 1995 and a World Champion as a junior in 1999.
Career.
Patrikeyev became a member of the Russian national Greco-Roman wrestling team in 2000. Two years later, he won a gold medal at the 2002 European Wrestling Championships and a bronze medal at the 2002 FILA Wrestling World Championships.
Patrikeyev won a gold medal at the 2004 European Wrestling Championships. Despite becoming European Champion, Patrikeyev lost in the finals of the Russian Championships against Khasan Baroyev later that year and was not included in the Russian national wrestling team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Patrikeyev considered the decision of the coaching staff unfair because Baroyev had long been exempted from participation in international competitions and had the opportunity to conduct targeted training for the Championship of Russia. In connection with this, Patrikeyev had a conflict with the head coach of the Russian national team in Greco-Roman wrestling, Gennady Sapunov, and in 2005, he made the decision to change his Russian citizenship to Armenian. At the same time, Yury continued to live and train in Krasnodar, but later served under the flag of Armenia. He officially left the Russian national team in 2005.
Now a wrestler of Armenia, Patrikeyev won a bronze medal at the 2007 FILA Wrestling World Championships. The following year he won his third gold medal at the 2008 European Wrestling Championships. Patrikeyev competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He won an Olympic bronze medal. Patrikeyev became the first Olympian to win an Olympic medal for Armenia that wasn't born in Armenia.
Patrikeyev was a member of the Armenian Greco-Roman wrestling team at the 2009 FILA Wrestling World Cup. The Armenian team came in third place. Patrikeyev personally won a silver medal. Patrikeyev became a fourth-time the European Champion at the 2009 European Wrestling Championships, winning yet another gold medal. Patrikeyev returned to his native Russia for the 2010 World Wrestling Championships in Moscow. He won a silver medal at the competition.
Patrikeyev was a member of the Armenian Greco-Roman wrestling team at the 2010 FILA Wrestling World Cup. The Armenian team came in third place. Patrikeyev personally won a gold medal.
Patrikeyev won bronze medals at both the 2011 European Wrestling Championships and 2012 European Wrestling Championships. Patrikeyev qualified for the At 2012 Summer Olympics in London by coming in first place at the European Qualification Tournament. In the first round, Patrikeyev defeated Baroyev, but in the next round lost to Bashir Babajanzadeh and was unable to win a medal. He came in eighth place.
Personal life.
Patrikeyev has a wife and daughter. He has also stated that he considers himself an Armenian as much as a Russian.

Perrys is a long established franchised automobile dealer in the United Kingdom, with its Head Office in Northampton, England. It represents many motor brands including Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat, Alf Romeo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Seat, Renault, Mazda, Kia, Chevrolet, and Ford.
A Short History.
The business was founded by Harold Perry in 1908, selling motor accessories. 
Harold Perry formerly worked for the UK distributor for Ford, and the company’s association with the Ford marque continues to this day. In 1912 Harold Perry was appointed Ford dealer for London. A year earlier Harold’s brother, Percival, had persuaded Henry Ford to launch the Ford Motor Company in England. Percival later became chairman of Ford’s UK company. Later still, in 1922, Sir Percival Perry helped André Citroën to establish commercial and manufacturing subsidiaries for the early Citroen automobile business in England.
World War 2 Changes Role.
Perrys continued to acquire dealerships until the outbreak of World War Two, in 1939. As part of the war effort, sections of its North London dealership were converted to a meat distribution centre and workshops for overhauling military vehicles and making wings for gliders.
Expansion.
By the 1980s Perrys were acquiring non-Ford dealerships: firstly Vauxhall, then Rover, Jaguar and Land Rover dealerships were brought into the company. The 90’s saw a further programme of dealership acquisitions including Peugeot, Toyota, Renault, Iveco Ford, Nissan and Lexus franchises.
Management Buyout.
In 2001 the Perry Group Plc sold its Motor Division to the Management Team, setting the stage for Perrys Motor Sales rapid recent expansion – including taking on further dealerships and marques. The group now employs 1,400 people across thirty-nine UK locations with an annual turnover of £400 million and has its own training centre.

Johnny Devlin

Johnny Devlin, born John Lockett Devlin (11 May 1938), was an influential early New Zealand rock musician, sometimes called "New Zealand's answer to Elvis Presley".
His cover of Lloyd Price's "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" in 1958 went number one in New Zealand, with sales of more than 100,000, launching a long-term career. He spent much of his time in Australia from 1959 - touring in support of The Everly Brothers in that year, and often appearing on Australian television shows such as "Bandstand" and "Six O'Clock Rock". In 1964 he toured Australia as a support act for The Beatles.
Early years.
John Lockett Devlin was born on 11 May 1938, the son of a railway ganger stationed in the small mid-North Island town of Raetihi. The family soon shifted to near-by Ohakune and then Marton before eventually settling in Wanganui, where John spent his formative years. He received a guitar for his eleventh birthday and it never left his side. His parents and three other brothers were all musically minded and when in his early teens, they formed a group called the Devlin Family. They performed country songs at Wanganui talent quests. The family used to listen to the Lever Hit Parade to get new songs to perform. One night they heard "Rock Around the Clock" and were blown away.
The Devlin Family had been performing regularly until 1955, when the parents retired from the entertainment game. The four brothers, plus the odd friend or cousin, continued to perform as the River City Ramblers, playing country and western, skiffle, and later Bill Haley style rock'n'roll. Throughout 1956, enthusiasm began to ebb, and one by one the brothers dropped out, and more frequently weekends would see Johnny performing as a soloist. By the end of the year, the River City Ramblers were no more. It was then that he heard "Heartbreak Hotel" and his life was changed forever.
Devlin entered every amateur talent quest he could find and chasing up every Elvis Presley recording he could lay his hands on, for the next eighteen months he would perform nothing but Presley material. On weekends, Devlin would often go to Palmerston North and whenever he had the chance he would sing his Elvis songs in talent contests run at the youth club there by pioneering New Zealand rock'n'roller Johnny Cooper. The first to recognise a certain something in Devlin, Johnny Cooper took him under his wing, coached him in the art of stagecraft and persuaded him to practice his moves in front of a mirror. He said to Devlin, with a bit of work, you could become New Zealand's Elvis Presley.
So in February 1957, an 18 year old bank clerk from Wanganui, won his first talent quest as a rock'n'roll performer. Over the next four months, he gyrated, jumped, grimaced and growled at quests in the towns nearby. He didn't win them all, but the younger members of the audience knew who the night's star was. One weekend in Palmerston North he met Dennis Tristram, a rock'n'roll dancer, who tried to persuade Devlin to move to Auckland. Devlin was happy to stay where he was, but did run into Tristram again, a month or so later, when he was in Auckland. Dennis persuaded Johnny to come down to the Jive Centre and sing with the resident band. The owner, Dave Dunningham, gave him an audition and agreed to let him do a set that night. Johnny Devlin's debut at the Jive Centre featured an all-Presley repertoire and although there was a general buzz in the audience before he commenced, no-one was prepared for what was to follow. By the time he completed his set, girls were screaming and everyone else was in awe and disbelief. Dave Dunningham was impressed and offered him a regular spot. Back in Wanganui he thought it over and a month later, March 1958, he returned to Auckland.
Dave Dunningham became his manager and within a month he had made Johnny Devlin the talk of the town. With Auckland conquered, Dunningham realised that the quickest way to break Devlin nationally was with a record release, but all the record companies in the country gave the thumbs down. They were very nervous about this type of music.
Prestige.
Phil Warren, a part-time drummer, began working at Begg's Music Store in 1955, and later formed Prestige Records, primarily to distribute overseas releases from independent labels. Dunningham pressured Warren into recording Devlin, so they came to an agreement and selected a poor-selling Presley release, "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" for the debut single. It was recorded at the Jive Centre one Sunday afternoon in May 1958, using the Dixielanders as the backing group, and given the primitive circumstances of the session and surroundings, the quality was awful, but "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" launched Johnny Devlin as New Zealand's first superstar when it was released in June 1958 on the Prestige label. Recorded at the same session was the flipside, "When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again". A romping sax break replaces the guitar on Elvis's version.
Although the single got very little airplay, the broadcast panel thought it was not of sufficient quality, it was snapped up by Auckland's teens in an unprecedented frenzy. Once sales had topped the 2000 mark, the radio stations could no longer ignore it, and within a few weeks the disc was at the top of the Lever Hit Parade. By now the Dixielanders were out of the picture and Johnny was working with the Bob Paris Combo as his back-up band.
Devlin was now in great demand and by August, his record sales had passed the 10,000 mark. Time to record more records. With this he entered Bruce Barton's Wellesley Street studio for his second recording session. Between August and October Devlin recorded a dozen tracks, to be released as Phil Warren saw fit. The Bob Paris Combo were used as backing on all of these tracks. Warren was receiving little-known records from American artists for distribution by his record company, but selected a few to give to Devlin to record.
His second single was a cover of both sides of a Jimmy Lloyd record, "I Got A Rocket In My Pocket"/"You're Gone Baby". An excellent recording, it unfortunately received little airplay and sold only moderately well, but within a fortnight Devlin's third single appeared. "Slipping Around"/"Straight Skirt" sold a lot better and without the Presley influence, it demonstrated that New Zealand could produce credible rock'n'roll.
By November 1958, his three singles had sold 50,000 copies. Between November 1958 and May 1959, Prestige released eight further singles, plus three EP's and an album, amassing total sales in excess of 200,000.
Graham Dent was an employee of the Kerridge Organisation which operated a string of theatres and cinemas throughout the country. Dent had been responsible for making the "Rock Around the Clock" movie successful in the cinemas. He was promoted to manage a new cinema in the Auckland suburb of Point Chevalier. On Sunday afternoons he ran concerts for the local youth club and talent quests. Recognising Devlin's potential, he organised a concert there. With its success he approached his boss, Robert Kerridge, about the possibility of using their theatre chain to promote a national tour. After some initial doubt, his boss agreed to a two-week tour with extensions if successful.
Dave Dunningham left the management to Phil Warren, so Phil and Graham put together a schedule. Bob Paris and his band weren't keen on going on the road, so a new backing band had to be put together. Dent asked multi-instrumentalist Claude Papesch if he could put a band together. Claude was a sixteen-year-old blind musician, who was a regular at the Point Chevalier youth club. Papesch recruited guitarist Peter Bazely, bassist Keith Graham and drummer Tony Hopkins. Together they became the Devils, one of New Zealand's first truly rock'n'roll bands.
The tour kicked of at Wellington on 21 November 1958. Over the next two weeks he performed for close to 20,000 ecstatic fans in Wellington, Palmerston North, Masterton, Napier, Gisbourne and Tauranga. The press raved and chaos broke out at every performance. The shows exceeded everyone's expectations, with New Zealand having never seen anything remotely like it.
Back in Auckland, another two-week tour was being organised, but before setting out, Devlin was rushed back into the studio, where in one night he recorded sixteen more tracks. In late November his fourth single, recorded earlier in the year, was released. It was "6.5 Hand Jive"/"Play Rough". In December, five more records were released, three singles and two EP's. The singles were "Wild One"/"The Watch", "Crazy Baby Crazy"/"My True Love", and "Bony Moronie"/"Leroy". The first EP was a freebie called "Hit Tunes" put out by Coca-Cola, who had been part sponsoring his tour. It contained the tracks "Cast Iron Arm", "Nervous", "Say Yeah", "Matador Baby", "Believe Me" and "Rave On". The other EP was called "How Would Ya Be?" and contained "Straight Skirt", "How Would Ya Be", "Slipping Around" and "I'm Grateful".
Devlin set off on the second leg of his tour and the media followed him wherever he went. He was constantly making headlines. After his shows he was mobbed by screaming girls and on one occasion lost sleeves from his shirt. This was big news with headlines claiming "Girls fight over singer's shirt" and from then on a piece of his shirt was every girl's aim.
By the end of 1958, Devlin had conquered the North Island, but was still relatively unknown in the South Island. A tour down there was going to be a challenge as there was a local lad in Christchurch who was also attracting attention. He was Max Merritt & the Meteors. His fans were fiercely loyal and the bookings for the Christchurch show were light. Dent was going to cancel the show, but came up with an idea. He invited MP and Cabinet Minister Mabel Howard to a champagne party followed by the Devlin show, and after the pair would be driven off to meet up with Max Merritt. A pink convertible was used and of course the press were there, along with the usual mob of screaming fans. A stroke of genius and from there on the South Island was bedlam.
By February 1959, Johnny Devlin's record sales had reached astronomical proportions. A new single was released, "20 Flight Rock"/"Move It" and another EP called "Johnny Sings Ballads". Its tracks were "Love Me", "I'm Counting On You", "Susie Darling" and "When My Mother Prayed For Me". Devlin's original recording of "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" had sold steadily since its mid-1958 release. With sales in excess of 30,000 and orders for another 10,000 after his South Island tour, it was decided to re-record the song under better conditions. The new version was released in February 1959 and well and truly out sold the original version, two to one, with combined sales exceeding 100,000. "Susie Darling" was placed on the flipside of the new version.
In the next two months, two more singles and another EP were released. The first was "Nervous Wreck"/"Queen Of The Hop" and the second a tribute to his backing band "Rock With The Devils" backed with "Devil's Rock", an instrumental by the Devils. The EP was just called "Johnny Devlin" and contained "High Heeled Shoes", "Hard To Get", "Big Green Car" and "Your Cheatin' Heart".
In March 1959, Devlin left on what was to be his final tour of the country. He took in the smaller centres that hadn't experienced the Devlin hysteria and madness. It was same old story wherever he went, but inside the show, things were starting to fall apart. There was internal bickering, and being mobbed and screamed at was no longer a novelty. The whole touring thing was becoming a bore. The only remaining highlight came when in Wellington, he met the touring evangelist Billy Graham and the Prime Minister Walter Nash. A picture of the three of them appeared in the following day's newspaper. A week later, having had enough of the goings-on, Robert Kerridge pulled the plug on the tour.
With his career in temporary limbo, Devlin returned home to Wanganui to celebrate his 21st birthday. Meanwhile, Phil Warren received a phone call from Sydney-based American promoter, Lee Gordon, who was in the process of organising an Australasian tour for The Everly Brothers. He wanted to know if Phil could handle the New Zealand leg. Phil agreed on the condition that Devlin be placed on the bill for the Australian concerts. They agreed and with no fuss, fanfare or farewell concert, Johnny Devlin and the Devils slipped out of New Zealand in the last week of May 1959. Although he was moderately successful in Australia, his reign as a social phenomenon was over. It had lasted a mere twelve months.
Another EP, also called "Johnny Devlin" was released, containing "Flat 13", "Queen of the Hop", "I Was Robbed" and "Patty". The last two Prestige singles also came out. They were "White Lightning"/"Doreen" and "I Was The One"/"Pointed Toe Shoes". Prestige also released an album called "Johnny" in 1959.
1959 onwards.
Devlin continued to record while in Australia. Between 1959 and 1981, while using at least 14 different record labels, he released a further 40 singles, ten EP's and three albums. Music World released an album called "24 Original Golden Greats" in 1980 that contained all of his New Zealand singles. In 1963 and 1964 he recorded "Stomp The Tumbarumba", "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" on which the Bee Gees sang backup vocals on the three songs.
Johnny Devlin still continues to perform on the club level in Australia. Of the original Devils, only Claude Papesch dedicated his life to music. Widely traveled around Australasia, he eventually settled in NSW, working more in the jazz field than the rock'n'roll which launched him. Battling cancer during the last years of his life, he served time on the Lithgow City Council and was elected Mayor of Lithgow in 1984 but due to ill health was unable to complete his term. Claude died in February 1987, aged 45. Keith Graham went on to play with the Embers. 
Festival released two CDs that cover pretty much all of Johnny's work. The first in 1998 covers his Australian years, while the second, released in 2001, was a compilation of his New Zealand Prestige years.

He received his B.Sc. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1989, performed national service from 1989–1993, received his M.Sc. in 1993, and obtained his PhD under Robert Benny Gerber and Ofer Biham, 1997, with a thesis entitled "Structural Characterization of Disordered Systems" also from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Career.
In 1997–2000, he was a postdoc at UC Berkeley, having been awarded Rothschild Foundation and Fulbright Program fellowships (the latter of which he declined); in 2000–2005, he was an assistant professor and then later an associate professor of Chemistry at the University of Toronto, with cross-appointments in Physics and Mathematics. While at Berkeley, he was a collaborator with Magiq Technologies and while at Toronto he collaborated with D-Wave Systems. He moved to the University of Southern California in 2005 as an associate professor of Chemistry and Electrical Engineering, with a cross-appointment in Physics. Lidar's research interests lie primarily in the theory and control of open quantum systems, with a special emphasis on quantum information processing. His past interests include scattering theory and fractals.
Honors.
He is the recipient of a number of awards and honors, including a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, the Young Explorer Award given by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research for the top 20 researchers in Canada under age 40, and the John Charles Polanyi Prize in Chemistry awarded by the Ontario Council of Graduate Studies. He is a 2007 Fellow of the American Physical Society and Senior Member of the IEEE. He is listed as one of the top 20 authors of the decade 2000–2009 in Quantum Computing by Thomson Reuters' Sciencewatch. In 2009 he was elected an Outstanding Referee of the American Physical Society.
Research.
Lidar's research in quantum information processing has focused primarily on methods for overcoming decoherence. He wrote some of the founding papers on decoherence-free subspaces, most notably his widely cited paper "Decoherence-free subspaces for quantum computation", and their generalization, noiseless subsystems. These contributions were noted in his APS Fellow citation. He has also made major contributions to dynamical decoupling, in particular the invention (with his student Kaveh Khodjasteh) of the concatenated dynamical decoupling (CDD) method. He has made a proposal to protect adiabatic quantum computation against decoherence, using dynamical decoupling, one of the only proposals to date dealing with error correction for the adiabatic model. Lidar has also worked on quantum algorithms, having written some of the pioneering papers in the subject on simulation of classical statistical mechanics and quantum chemistry. In his PhD work he made a widely cited observation on the limited scaling range of empirically observed fractals, which led to a lively exchange with Benoit Mandelbrot.

Software ecosystem

Software Ecosystem is a book written by David G. Messerschmitt and Clemens Szyperski that explains the essence and effects of a "Software Ecosystem", defined as a set of businesses functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with relationships among them. These relationships are frequently underpinned by a common technological platform and operate through the exchange of information, resources, and artifacts.
The term in software analysis.
In the context of software analysis, the term software ecosystem is defined by Lungu as “a collection of software systems, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment”. The environment can be organizational (a company), social (an open-source community), or technical (the Ruby ecosystem). The ecosystem metaphor is used in order to denote an analysis which takes into account multiple software systems. The most frequent of such analyses is static analysis of the source code of the component systems of the ecosystem.
Objection to the use of the term "ecosystem" to describe software.
Richard Stallman argues that software has nothing in common with an ecosystem which is a natural system of combined physical and biological components of a natural environment. "It is a mistake to describe the free software community, or any human community, as an "ecosystem", because that word implies the absence of (1) intention and (2) ethics."

Tees Viaduct

The A19 Tees Viaduct or Tees Flyover is a six-lane dual carriageway road bridge in the North East of England carrying the main A19 trunk road north-south across the River Tees.
It is situated between Middlesbrough and borough of Stockton-on-Tees just north of the A19's interchange with the A66 trunk road.
The Teesdale Way long-distance footpath, the Tees Valley Line, the B6541 (Old A66/A67, Stockton Road) and the A66 pass under the bridge on the southern bank of the Tees.
The bridge was built with sufficient clearance to allow ships to pass, although the port of Stockton-on-Tees up-river was virtually redundant by then.
Since the Tees Newport Bridge had its lifting deck permanently fixed in the down position in 1990, large shipping can no longer reach the Tees viaduct, further reducing the need for such a high structure.
The bridge was constructed from 1973 to 1975 and opened in 1975. It is made of reinforced concrete piles, steel-plate girders and a composite deck and is the largest such bridge in the British Isles.
There have been problems with corrosion since the bridge was opened and repairs have been necessary at times.
Expansion joints were cracking and allowing de-icing salts to wash from the bridge carriageway into the piers, cross beams and columns giving rise to extensive chloride attack and it was decided the best solution was the complete demolition and reconstruction of most of the piers and repair of others.
From 1988 the underside was enclosed with a steel and GRP panelling structure to protect the primary structure from the effects of weather and to allow safe and easy inspection and maintenance.
The bridge now carries some 70,000 vehicles a day
and there are concerns that the capacity of the road is being exceeded at peak times
Because of this CCTV cameras were installed on the bridge to record incident related congestion and respond more quickly.
In 2006 the detailed principal inspection report concluded that the Tees Viaduct is overall in fair condition.

Port of Poulsbo is located on Puget Sound, in Liberty Bay, Washington, USA. It includes 7 main docks, which contains 254 permanent slips, 130 guest slips, floatplane dock, fuel dock, sanitation pump-out facilities, shower and restroom facilities, launch ramp and laundry facilities.
History.
The port begins its history in 1880’s In the early 1900s a fishing fleet that worked in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca became the base of several larger boats working the fishing grounds of Alaska, under sails, for salmon and cod. In the 1950s, local ferries and the “mosquito fleet” of steamboats to and from Kitsap County and Seattle serviced the port and city. The harbor was home to a codfish fleet and had several fish processing plants and oyster beds. In the 1960s the harbor still retained it fishing history with a great number of working vessels and in 1964 the Port of Poulsbo was formally created as a port.
Pumpout.
Port of Poulsbo Marina has accessible pumpout with Porta-Potty dump station. Pump out is available all year round. Slips are offered for pumpout usage. Access to pumpout is limited to vessels with a length of no more than 80 feet. There is also a stationary pumpout, which is located next to the fuel dock. The Porta-Potty dump station is situated by the stationary pumpout.

USS "Metomkin" (AG-136/AKL-7) was a "Camano"-class cargo ship constructed for the U.S. Army as USA "FS-316" shortly before the end of World War II and later acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1947. She was configured as a transport and cargo ship and was assigned to serve the World War II Trust Territories in the Pacific Ocean.
Constructed in Camden, New Jersey.
The first ship to be so named by the Navy, "Metomkin" (AG 136) was built by John A. Mathis Co., Camden, New Jersey, in 1944; operated by the Army as a freight supply ship in the Pacific Ocean during and after World War II; acquired by the Navy as "FS-316" at Subic Bay, Luzon, 28 February 1947; renamed "Metomkin" 3 April 1947; and commissioned at Apra Harbor, Guam, 16 August 1947, Lt. (jg.) W. O. Ball in command.
Pacific islands operations.
Following completion of conversion for Navy use, "Metomkin" began passenger and cargo shuttle duty in the central and western Pacific. Assigned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, she made runs to American bases in the Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Caroline Islands. 
Operating out of Apra Harbor, she completed numerous runs from the Palau Islands eastward to Pearl Harbor, and during the next 4 years she maintained a busy schedule while transporting military and civilian passengers as well as tons of general cargo. On 31 March 1949 she reclassified as "AKL-7".
"Metomkin" continued her important logistics support duty to military bases in the Pacific until 22 June 1951 when she completed her final run from the Carolines.
Transfer to Department of Interior.
She decommissioned at Guam 3 August 1951 and was transferred the same day to the U.S. Department of Interior. Her name was struck from the Navy List 16 January 1952. Her subsequent fate is not known.

<doc id="18860788" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18860788" title="Continuous emissions monitoring system">
Continuous emissions monitoring system

Continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) were historically used as a tool to monitor flue gas for oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide to provide information for combustion control in industrial settings. They are currently used as a means to comply with air emission standards such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Acid Rain Program, other federal emission programs, or state permitted emission standards. Facilities employ the use of CEMS to continuously collect, record and report the required emissions data.
The standard CEM system consists of a sample probe, filter, sample line (umbilical), gas conditioning system, calibration gas system, and a series of gas analyzers which reflect the parameters being monitored. Typical monitored emissions include: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, airborne particulate matter, mercury, volatile organic compounds, and oxygen. CEM systems can also measure air flow, flue gas opacity and moisture.
In the U.S., the EPA requires a data acquisition and handling system to collect and report the data. SO2 emissions must be measured in pounds per hour using both an SO2 pollutant concentration monitor and a volumetric flow monitor. For NOx, both a NOx pollutant concentration monitor and a diluent gas monitor are required to determine the emissions rate (lbs/mmBtu). Opacity must also be monitored. CO2 measuring is not a current requirement, however if monitored, a CO2 or oxygen monitor plus a flow monitor should be used. In monitoring these emissions, the system must be in continuous operation and must be able to sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes and then averaged hourly.
Operation.
A small sample of flue gas is extracted, by means of a pump, into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that combust fossil fuels often use a dilution-extractive probe to dilute the sample with clean, dry air to a ratio typically between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data.
Another sample extraction method used in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is commonly referred to as the "hot dry" extractive method or "direct" CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated sample line at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a chiller, to remove moisture. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling manifold and is measured using the same methods above. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure % oxygen in the sample, which is often required in the regulatory calculations for emission corrections. Since dilution mixes clean dry air with the sample, dilution systems cannot measure % oxygen.
Quality assurance.
Accuracy of the system is demonstrated in several ways. An internal quality assurance check is achieved by daily introduction of a certified concentration of gas to the sample probe. The EPA also allows for the use of Continuous Emissions Monitoring Calibration Systems which dilute gases to generate calibration standards. The analyzer reading must be accurate to a certain percentage. The percent accuracy can vary, but most fall between 2.5% and 5%. In power stations affected by the Acid Rain Program, annual (or bi-annual) certification of the system must be performed by an independent firm. The firm will have an independent CEM system temporarily in place to collect emissions data in parallel with the plant CEMS. This testing is referred to as a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA).
In the U.S., periodic evaluations of the equipment must be reported and recorded. This includes daily calibration error tests, daily interference tests for flow monitors, and semi-annual (or annual) RATA and bias tests.

Dunkley had spent much time away from Jamaica, as a seaman employed by the United Fruit Company, and he returned to Port Antonio, Jamaica on December 8, 1930, where he switched professions, becoming a street preacher. His studies of the Bible had convinced him that the newly crowned Haile Selassie was the returned Messiah, and that "Rastafari" was a name of God. By 1933, he had relocated to Kingston, where the King of Kings Ethiopian Mission was founded. Following Howell's December 1933 imprisonment for sedition, Dunkley too was imprisoned briefly by the authorities a number of times in 1934 and 1935 on charges of "disorderly conduct". In August 1938, he became one of the foundation members of the first Jamaican local chapter of the Ethiopian World Federation, Local 17, which however became dormant soon afterward, to be replaced by the more permanent Local 31.
Although not as much is known of his life as that of Howell (the most outspoken founder of Rastafari), Dunkley was reported as still alive as of 1991.

OverSim

OverSim is an OMNeT++-based open-source simulation framework for overlay and peer-to-peer networks, developed at the Institute of Telematics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
The simulator contains several models for structured (e.g. Chord, Kademlia, Pastry) and unstructured (e.g. GIA) peer-to-peer protocols. An example implementation of the framework is an implementation of a peer-to-peer SIP communications network. 
OverSim Features.
Some of the main features of the OverSim simulation framework include:
Flexibility.
The simulator allows to simulate both structured and unstructured overlay networks (currently Chord, Pastry, Koorde, Broose, Kademlia, and GIA are implemented). The modular design and use of the Common API facilitate the extension with new features or protocols. Module behavior can easily be customized by specify parameters in a human readable configuration file. 
Interactive GUI.
In order to validate and debug new or existing overlay protocols you can make use of the GUI of OMNeT++, which visualizes networks topologies, messages and node state variables like the routing table. 
Exchangeable Underlying Network Models.
OverSim has a flexible underlying network scheme, which on the one hand provides a fully configurable network topology with realistic bandwidths, packet delays, and packet losses (INETUnderlay), and on the other hand a fast and simple alternative model for high simulation performance (SimpleUnderlay). 
Scalability.
OverSim was designed with performance in mind. On a modern desktop PC a typical Chord network of 10,000 nodes can be simulated in real-time. The simulator was used to successfully simulate networks of up to 100,000 nodes.
Base Overlay Class.
The base overlay class facilitates the implementation of structured peer-to-peer protocols by providing a RPC interface, a generic lookup class and a common API key-based routing interface to the application. 
Reuse of Simulation Code.
The different implementations of overlay protocols are reusable for real network applications, so that researchers can validate the simulator framework results by comparing them to the results from real-world test networks like PlanetLab. Therefore, the simulation framework is able to handle and assemble real network packets and to communicate with other implementations of the same overlay protocol. 
Statistics.
The simulator collects various statistical data such as sent, received, or forwarded network traffic per node, successful or unsuccessful packet delivery, and packet hop count.
Criticism.
The framework is outdated and requires an older version of the INET framework. Also, the code contain reported bugs.

Streptazolin

Streptazolin is an antibiotic and antifungal substance isolated in 1981 from "Streptomyces viridochromogenes".
Because of its polymerisation tendency, it is not suitable for therapeutic use. 1,4-reduction of the conjugated diene gives dihydrostreptazolin which is stable, but has very limited microbial properties.
The first total synthesis of (racemic) streptazolin was achieved in 1985 with the aid of a modified Ferrier rearrangement.

<doc id="18860929" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18860929" title="Semagacestat">
Semagacestat

Semagacestat (LY450139) was a candidate drug for a causal therapy against Alzheimer's disease. It was originally developed by Eli Lilly and Élan, and clinical trials were conducted by Eli Lilly. Phase III trials included over 3000 patients, but in August 2010, a disappointing interim analysis, in which semagacestat performed worse than the placebo, led to the trials being stopped.
Mechanism of action.
β-Amyloid is a peptide of 39 to 43 amino acids. The isoforms with 40 and 42 amino acids (Aβ40/42) are the main constituents of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. β-Amyloid is formed by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Research on laboratory rats suggest that the soluble form of this peptide is a causative agent in the development of Alzheimer's.
Semagacestat blocks the enzyme γ-secretase, which (along with β-secretase) is responsible for APP proteolysis.
Clinical trials.
Phase III double-blind clinical trials started in March 2008 with the IDENTITY study (Interrupting Alzheimer's dementia by evaluating treatment of amyloid pathology), including 1500 patients from 22 countries. This study was intended to run until May 2011. The successor trial with further 1500 patients, IDENTITY-2, started in September 2008. The open-label trial IDENTITY-XT, which included patients who have completed one of the two studies, started in December 2009. On 17 August 2010, it was announced that the phase III trials failed. Preliminary findings show that not only did semagacestat fail to slow disease progression, but that it was actually associated with “worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living”. Furthermore, the incidence of skin cancer was significantly higher in the treatment group than the placebo group.
Issues.
A number of issues have already been raised during clinical trials:

Piboserod is a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist which was marketed and manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) under the trade name Serlipet for the management of atrial fibrillation and irritable bowel syndrome. In 2007 the Norwegian company Bio-Medisinsk Innovasjon AS (BMI) completed a clinical phase II study to investigate the effect of piboserod in patients with chronic heart failure.
Mechanism of action.
In 2002 a research group at the University of Oslo discovered that muscles from the ventricle of failing hearts have increased responsiveness to serotonin. They later demonstrated that the effect was due to an expression of functional 5-HT4 receptors in the failing muscle. On the basis of these findings, and in analogy with the success of betablockers in heart failure, the group made the hypothesis that 5-HT4 receptor antagonists could be useful to treat heart failure. Their hypothesis was tested in animal models of heart failure with positive results.

Details.
Perhaps they wanted to overawe their enemies and subjects with an enormous show of wealth and power, represented by these temples. Or perhaps they wanted to impress their subjects with a show of love for the religion. Or perhaps they wanted to atone for the sins they had committed by killing innumerable innocent people in the bloody wars they fought. The temples were built by teams of architects, artists, sculptors and masons, who remain anonymous.
Inscriptions.
The presence of two 12th-century stone inscriptions in Unkal village show that the temple belongs to 11th or 12th century.
Conservation and Restoration of the temple.
There is an urgent need of Conservation and Restoration of the Chandramouleshwara temple at Unkal.
The temple premises serve as a playground for children and youngsters to play cricket. It has become a victim of government apathy and urbanization. There is virtually no approach road to this temple, encroachments on all the four sides of the temple. The roads leading to the temple are very small with arrack shops and other illegal trades. One has to cross rows of houses and narrow lanes to reach Chandramauleshwara temple. The local representatives should take interest and also work towards the restoration of this glourious temple which is the one and the only in and around Hubballi-Dharwad.

Saint Joe River

The Saint Joe River (sometimes abbreviated St. Joe River) is a long tributary of Coeur d'Alene Lake in northern Idaho. Beginning at an elevation of in the Northern Bitterroot Range of eastern Shoshone County, it flows generally west through the Saint Joe River Valley and the communities of Avery and Calder. Past Calder, it flows into Benewah County and through the town of St. Maries, where it receives its largest tributary, the Saint Maries River. It then turns northwest, passing through Heyburn State Park before reaching its mouth just north of the Kootenai County line. Much of the river's route through Heyburn State Park is partially flooded due to raised water levels from Post Falls Dam on the Spokane River below Coeur d'Alene Lake. With a mouth elevation of , it has been described as the highest navigable river in the world.
In 1978, of the river were protected by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, with designated as wild and another designated as recreational.
The Saint Joe River drains of the Idaho Panhandle. It is part of the Spokane River watershed, which in turn is part of the Columbia River basin. About 68 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service (the St. Joe National Forest), 4 percent is owned by the Bureau of Land Management, 2 percent is owned by the State of Idaho, and the rest is privately owned.
The Saint Joe River watershed is covered primarily by mixed coniferous forest, which includes species such as Douglas fir, true fir, larch, and pine. Alder is common in the riparian zones of high altitude river valleys, while cottonwood dominates the lower altitude riparian zones, much of which have been converted to agricultural land. Rush, sedge, and cattails are common in the river's floodplains, which are also used to grow wild rice.
The river is home to many species of fish, including native cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, cedar sculpin and other cottids, shiners, and nonnative rainbow trout, brook trout, Chinook salmon, and Kokanee Salmon. The upper Saint Joe River is also home to the last self-sustaining population of vulnerable bull trout in the Coeur d'Alene Lake watershed.

Ibasis

Based in Burlington, Massachusetts, iBasis is a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal KPN, N.V., the Dutch incumbent telecommunications carrier. iBasis is a wholesale carrier of international long distance telephone calls, with enhanced services for mobile operators, and a provider of retail prepaid calling services. In Fiscal Year 2010, iBasis had total revenues of $1.2 billion, carried approximately 24 billion minutes of international voice traffic, and employed approximately 370 people.
More than 1,000 mobile and fixed line telecommunications carriers and service providers worldwide outsource some or all of their international voice traffic to iBasis. It is one of the largest carriers of international voice traffic in the world. iBasis customers include many of the world’s largest carriers, mobile operators, and emerging service providers including Verizon, Vodafone, VSNL, China Mobile, China Unicom, IDT, Qwest, Skype, Telecom Italia, and Telefonica.
The company also offers online pre-paid international calling services to business and consumer customers through a product called Pingo.
Company history.
iBasis was founded in 1996 by Ofer Gneezy and Gordon VanderBrug to provide wholesale international long distance services to carriers using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. It held an initial public offering in November 1999 and was ranked the No. 1 fastest growing company in New England for 2000, 2001 and 2002 by Deloitte & Touche.
In October 2007, iBasis acquired KPN Global Carrier Services, the international voice business of Royal KPN N.V., the national carrier of the Netherlands. KPN became a majority stockholder of iBasis as part of the transaction. The combined entity carried nearly 24 billion minutes of international voice traffic in 2007.
According to international telecom research firm TeleGeography, that resulting traffic made the new iBasis one of the three largest carriers of international voice traffic in the world, handling a volume roughly equal to AT&T’s international voice traffic and behind worldwide leader Verizon.
In April 2008, iBasis also acquired the international wholesale voice business of TDC A/S, a Danish carrier, for $10 million cash, which added 2 billion minutes of annual traffic and was estimated to increase annual revenues by $80 million. The company plans to pursue similar deals as part of its ongoing growth strategy. 
On December 21, 2009 iBasis became a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal KPN N.V. (NYSE: KPN), the national carrier of the Netherlands and a leading provider of fixed, mobile, and enterprise communications solutions in Europe. iBasis is no longer a publicly traded company.
The iBasis Network and Technology.
The iBasis Network includes one of the largest international VoIP networks in the world with more than 1,000 points of presence in over 100 countries. iBasis uses technology from Cisco Systems and GenBand (formerly NextPoint and NexTone) and has developed its own patented monitoring and route quality management technology to determine and select the best available route for every call. The company has introduced technological advancements and has been enlisted to support industry initiatives including testing the GSM Association’s IP eXchange, which is being developed as a global IP backbone for fixed and mobile service providers.

Retko te viđam sa devojkama

"Retko te viđam sa devojkama" ("I Rarely See You With Girls") is the second song which appeared on the first single by Serbian new wave band Idoli (the first being "Pomoć, pomoć"). The song did not actually appear as a B-side as both of the songs appeared on the A-side while the B-side contained Slobodan Škerović's narrative poem called "Poklon".
History.
Having formed as a band, Idoli got a chance to record their first single within a month after their formation, which was a true record in former Yugoslavia and later. The band recorded two songs which would appear as the A-side of the single given as a present with the May release of the "Vidici" magazine.
The song was credited to Vlada Divljan. However, other sources claim that it was written by the former Idoli member Aleksandar Prokopiev. This is one of the first gay-themed songs in Yugoslavia (the first was "Neki dječaci" by Prljavo kazalište).
In the 1990s and 2000s, allegations have been made in ex-YU press that the song text refers to Boris Tadić, as e.g. in Serbia and on a Germany-based internet news service in Serbian, who was a childhood friend of the Idoli member Nebojša Krstić (and whom he later appointed as his media relations advisor while in office as President of Serbia). 
Second version.
"Retko te viđam sa devojkama" was recorded once again in Zagreb with producer Goran Bregović and was released as a B-side of the Maljčiki single. This version of the song also appeared on the "Svi marš na ples!" compilation.

Castalia (simulator)

Castalia is a simulator for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Body Area Networks and generally networks of low-power embedded devices. It is based on the OMNeT++ platform and used by researchers and developers to test their distributed algorithms and/or protocols in a realistic wireless channel and radio model, with a realistic node behaviour especially relating to access of the radio. Castalia uses the lognormal shadowing model as one of the ways to model average path loss, which has been shown to explain empirical data in WSN. It also models temporal variation of path loss in an effort to capture fading phenomena in changing environments (i.e., the nodes or parts of the environment are moving). Castalia's temporal variation modeling is designed to be fitted to measured data instead of making specific assumptions on the creation of fast fading. Other features of Castalia include: physical process modeling, sensing device bias and noise, node clock drift, and several MAC and routing protocols implemented. 
Castalia is developed at the National ICT Australia since 2006. Since 2007 it is made public as an open source project under the Academic Public License. The current release version is 3.2.

Electoral district of Eyre

Eyre is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district covers large tracts of the rural south-east of Western Australia. It includes the following local government councils: Shire of Coolgardie, Shire of Dundas, Shire of Esperance, Shire of Ravensthorpe, Shire of Yilgarn, as well as a large part of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. The district includes the towns of Bodallin, Boulder, Coolgardie, Dundas, Esperance, Eucla, Kambalda, Marvel Loch, Ravensthorpe and Southern Cross.
Politically, the district appears to be a safe Liberal seat. Based on the results of the 2005 state election, the newly drawn electorate was created with a Liberal Party majority of 64.9% to 34.1% versus the Labor Party, according to one analysis.
History.
Eyre was first created for the 1950 election and abolished ahead of the 1962 election. Labor MP Emil Nulsen, who had previously held the seat of Kanowna, was the district's only member over the period, and was unopposed on two occasions.
Eyre was again created for the 1989 election and abolished ahead of the 2005 state election. The district ultimately included the Shires of Coolgardie, Dundas, Laverton, Leonora, Menzies and Yilgarn, as well as the Boulder district and non-metropolitan components of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. It was held at all times by the Labor Party, and historically, only Southern Cross returned a consistent majority for the Liberal Party. The district was largely replaced by Murchison-Eyre.
An electorate named Eyre was created for a third time, on this occasion for the 2008 election. The new district was drawn from parts of Murchison-Eyre and Roe – both of which were abolished – as well as a small part of Kalgoorlie. Eyre is centred further south and west than its previous incarnations, incorporating large parts of the former Roe district – which was always a non-Labor seat – in particular, the towns of Esperance and Ravensthorpe. For this reason, the new seat of Eyre is much less favourable to Labor than its predecessors. The new district's first and current member is Liberal MP Graham Jacobs, who was previously the member for Roe.

Chartreuse Notre-Dame des Prés

The Chartreuse Notre-Dame des Prés was a Carthusian monastery (Charterhouse) in northern France, at Montreuil, in the Diocese of Arras, now Pas-de-Calais.
The charter of foundation is dated from the chateau d'Hardelot on 15 July, 1324; the church was consecrated in 1338. 
Early history.
The foundation, being close to Calais, was liable to disturbance in time of war. Thus it was often sacked by the English during the wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and was for a time abandoned. The religious returned when peace was restored. 
In 1542 the monastery was again wrecked by the Imperial troops and in the wars of religion fresh troubles attended the community. Finally the house was rebuilt by Dom Bernard Bruyant in the latter part of the seventeenth century and remained undisturbed until the French Revolution. In 1790 the monastery was suppressed and its property sold by auction the following year. 
Nineteenth century.
Eighty-two years later the Carthusians repurchased a portion of their old estate and the first stone of the new monastery was laid on 2 April 1872. The work was pushed forward by the Prior, Dom Eusèbe Bergier, and was finished in three years. The monastery contained twenty-four cells in its cloister. 
Montreuil took a special position among Carthusian houses, owing to the establishment there of a printing press from which has been issued a number of works connected with the order. Dom le Couteulx's "Annales" (in eight vols.) and the edition of Denys the Carthusian may be quoted as examples. By the "Association Laws" the community of Montreuil were once more ejected. The monks lodged in the Charterhouse of Parkminster, England; the printing works was transferred to Tournai, in Belgium.

Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf

Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf () (born 1957) has served as the Prime Minister of Mauritania since August 2008.
Life and career.
Laghdaf was born in Néma. An engineer and a member of the Tajakant tribe, he became Mauritania's Ambassador to Belgium and the European Union in 2006 before being appointed as Prime Minister by junta leader Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz on August 14, 2008. His appointment followed a military coup earlier in the month, and some suggested that he might have been appointed in hopes that doing so would improve Mauritania's foreign relations, given Laghdaf's diplomatic service in Europe. Laghdaf was already viewed as being closely associated with Abdel Aziz prior to his appointment.
On August 26, the Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD), the Alliance for Justice and Democracy - Movement for Renovation (AJD-MR), and the Movement for Direct Democracy (MDD) announced their decision to not participate in the Laghdaf's government because the junta had not clarified whether or not someone serving in the military would be allowed to stand as a presidential candidate and had not specified how long it intended to remain in power. The new government led by Laghdaf was appointed on August 31 and announced on television early on September 1. This government was composed of 28 members, aside from Laghdaf, and its members were considered to be politically obscure technocrats. The government included several members of the RFD, despite that party's refusal to participate; the RFD responded by saying that the RFD members who had accepted posts in the government had "automatically resigned" from the party by doing so.
Laghdaf announced on September 6, 2008 that an "open and constructive debate" would be held, in which members of parliament, political parties, and other organizations would be invited to participate. The purpose of this debate, according to Laghdaf, was to determine a timetable for holding a new election and consider various matters related to that election, including proposals for constitutional amendments and improved delineation of executive and legislative powers.
As part of a deal with the opposition, a national unity government was formed in June 2009 to lead the country at the time of the July 2009 presidential election; Laghdaf was retained as Prime Minister. Abdel Aziz then won the presidential election and took office as President on August 5, 2009; Laghdaf resigned as Prime Minister, but Abdel Aziz reappointed him to lead a new, 27-member government on August 11.

Type 139 patrol trawler

The Type 139 patrol trawler was a class of vessel used as a training ship by the Federal German Navy. Both vessels in the class were originally built for the Royal Navy in 1942 as naval trawlers.
History.
The trawlers and were launched in 1942 at the G.T. Davie & Sons yard in Lauzon, Quebec, and served in the anti-submarine warfare role to the end of World War II. Placed on the postwar disposal list, they were sold for mercantile use. When the Federal German Navy was established in 1956, "Dochet" and "Flint" were acquired and classified as Type 139 patrol trawlers. "Dochet" was named while "Flint" became .
Since the days of World War I, Germany had had a tradition of employing patrol trawlers. The type was classified before 1945 as a Vorpostenboot (literally, "outpost boat"). In the Federal German Navy, "Eider" and "Trave" were employed as fishery protection vessels and for training with light-caliber guns. Later they were used in radar instruction.
After two decades of service in the West German navy, "Eider" and "Trave" were discarded in the mid-1970s. Both "Eider" and "Trave" were sold for scrap.

Year 1809

Year 1809 ("Märkesåret 1809" in Swedish and "Merkkivuosi 1809" in Finnish, literally meaning "The Significant Year 1809" ) was a joint Swedish/Finnish government project about the 2009 bicentennial of the division of Sweden, when Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia. Both Sweden and Finland observed the bicentennial with various activities, which showed both the history of the partition and the close connection between the two countries since the mid 13th century.
Background.
For 560 years, since the Second Swedish Crusade in 1249, Sweden and Finland had been one country; but after the Russian victory in the Finnish War 1808-1809, Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on 17 September 1809. Russia in turn made Finland the autonomous grand principality the Grand Duchy of Finland, a constitutional monarchy within the autocratic Russian Empire.
Year 1809 was significant in many ways for both countries, beside being the year that separated Finland from Sweden. For Sweden, 1809 was also the birth year of modern Swedish constitutional monarchy, as the Constitution of 1809 returned Sweden to parliamentarism and put an end to the enlightened absolutism that Gustav III had introduced through a "coup d'état" in 1772. It was also the year when the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Committee on the Constitution were created. For Finland, the eventual realisation that it would never be reunited with Sweden, gave birth to Finnish nationalism, thus creating the foundation for the Finnish independence in 1917.
The separation of Sweden and Finland had consequences outside the two countries. When the Finnish War started, after an attack from Russia in February 1808, Sweden had just started an invasion of Norway, having joined the British side in the Napoleonic Wars against France and its ally Denmark–Norway. This two-front war was largely the reason for the loss against Russia. In 1812 and early 1813, the newly elected Swedish crown prince, the French marshal and former commander under Napoleon, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte held secret negotiations with both Russia, United Kingdom and Prussia, where he offered to join the battle against Napoleon in return for Sweden getting Norway as prize. They agreed, and in 1813 he allied Sweden with Napoleon's enemies of the Sixth Coalition in order to secure this. Charles John, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Army, successfully defended the approaches to Berlin and was victorious in battle against Oudinot in August and against Ney in September at the Battles of Grossbeeren and Dennewitz. But after the Battle of Leipzig he went his own way, determined at all hazards to cripple Denmark and to secure Norway, defeating the Danes at Bornhöved in December. His efforts culminated in the Treaty of Kiel, where king Frederick VI of Denmark agreed to cede Norway to Sweden. The Norwegians weren't as keen, though, but after losing the Swedish-Norwegian War of 1814, Norway entered a personal union with Sweden which lasted until 1905, when Norway reached full independence.

<doc id="18861559" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18861559" title="Forest dormouse">
Forest dormouse

The forest dormouse ("Dryomys nitedula") is a species of rodent in the Gliridae family found in eastern Europe, the Balkans and parts of western Central Asia. It is categorized as being of least concern in the "IUCN List of Threatened Species" due to its wide range and stable population trend. Forest dormice have a diploid count (2n) of 48 chromosomes. Even though this species lives in a variety of geographic locations, its greatest population density is in the forests of central Moldova, in Transcaucasia, in the mountains of Central Asia. In most other locations, population density of this species is rather low. Population density is dependent on many factors. But the main features that this species depends on for choosing a location are the presence of the appropriate food sources as well as good foliage that can be used for a habitat. The reason why the forests in central Moldova have the highest population density is they provide the largest diversity of food sources which are available throughout the year. This location also provides the best type of foliage for the forest dormice to build their nests as well as swing from branches. The combination of both of these aspects allows for this species to have its highest needs met. Therefore, during mating season they produce offspring who also stay in the same general area when they mature. It makes sense not to move from an area if it is providing for your most basic needs.
The common name for "Eliomys" is the garden dormouse. "Dryomys" are often compared to "Eliomys" as they have many similarities. However, "Dryomys" is smaller in size. Two more differences between the two are the braincase for "Dryomys" is more rounded and the auditory bullae is smaller than that of "Eliomys". In addition, their tails are slightly different. The "Dryomys's" tail is more uniform in color than that of "Eliomys". The forest dormouse competes in artificial and natural nests with hazel dormice, fat dormice, and birds. Its biggest competitors are those species which eat similar types of food and who live in the same kind of habitat.
Morphology.
Its appearance is squirrel-like. On average, the forest dormouse is 110 mm long with a fluffy grey tail nearly as long as its body. The head and body length can range from 80 mm to 130 mm, while the length of the tail can range from 60 mm to 113 mm. The range of its body mass is between 18 grams and 34 grams. The fur on the upper parts of the body is grayish-brown while the underparts are yellowish-white. A black stripe surrounds the eye and extends to the small ear. The whiskers form a bushy tuft about 10mm long. There are six pads on each paw. It has bilateral symmetry and is endothermic.
Distribution and habitat.
The range of the forest dormouse is from Switzerland in the west, through central, eastern and southern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, northward to the Baltic Sea and eastward to the Volga River and the Ural Mountains in Russia. Isolated populations occur outside this range, including in Israel, central Iran, Afghanistan, the Tien Shan mountains and Sinkiang in China. The forest dormouse lives in a wide range of habitats, including broad-leaved, mixed and coniferous woodlands. It is also found in rocky areas, dwarf montane woodland, evergreen shrubland and wood-steppe. It is reported to be found at altitudes up to 3,500 m.
This species is most likely to be found in dense forests. Forest dormice tend to create their natal nests on top of lower tree branches or in the midst of thick shrubbery. These nests are usually one to seven meters above ground level. They are spherically shaped with a diameter between 150mm to 250mm. Typically these nests only have one entrance and it faces the tree trunk. The outside of the nest is made from leaves and twigs. The inside of the nest has a lining that is created from bark and moss pieces. Forest dormice tend to pay great attention to detail when they create these natal nests. They want to make sure their young are protected.
Biology.
Depending on where this species is geographical located determines whether or not it hibernates and for how long. In Israel, forest dormice stay active throughout the year. However, during the winter they do go through a period of torpor for a certain amount of time each day. Forest dormice located in the north tend to hibernate from October until April. During this period of hibernation, northern dormice will sit on their back legs and curl up into a ball. Its tail will wrap around its body and its hands may touch its cheeks. In all hibernating species, body temperature decreases from the range of 35-37°C to about 5°C.
Not much is known about the mating rituals of this species. It is known that this species is dependent on maternal care for the first couple of weeks after birth. Female forest dormice have eight mammary glands. Forest dormice breed during various times of the year depending on their geographical location. For example, forest dormice who live in Israel have a breeding season that starts in March and lasts until December. However, in Europe breeding season is much shorter as it starts in March and only lasts until the end of August. There is a correlation between length of the breeding season and number of litters produced per year. For this reason, forest dormice who live in the south who have a longer breeding season usually produce two litters while the dormice who live in the north and have a very short breeding season usually only have time to produce one litter. The gestation period lasts about four weeks, and usually four or five young are born per litter. From time to time, it is possible for the female to give birth to up to seven young at one time. When the young are born, they weigh about 2 grams. The young dormice open their eyes at two weeks, and start eating solid food a week later. During the dependency period, the mother provides food, milk, grooming, and protection to the young. They leave the nest after about another three weeks and become sexually mature in the following year.
There has not been much evidence for paternal care. However, it should not be ruled out. The average lifespan of forest dormice in the wild is five and a half years. The gender ratio is about 1:1, with insignificant predominance of females.
Ecology.
When it comes out of hibernation in the spring, the forest dormouse eats small invertebrates, baby birds, buds, shoots and the green parts of plants. Later in the year, the dormouse predominately eats fruits, nuts and seeds. In fact, this species eats fruits from about twenty different tree and bush species including: apricots, apples, cherries, plums, cherry plums, pears, peaches, blackberries. The population does not fluctuate much because the young reared each year only just makes up for those that die during hibernation. Sixty percent of young individuals and the majority of elderly adults (over the age of four) do not survive the winter. Another cause of mortality is storms which may cause the death of juveniles in unprotected nests. Dormice are also preyed upon by pine marten, stone martens, wildcats, owls and crows. Two of its main predators are tawny owls ("Strix aluco") and Eurasian eagle-owls ("Bubo bubo"). However, due to individuals being extremely careful not to travel away from brushy cover forest dormice are difficult prey to find.
Forest dormice are very aggressive. Not even in captivity are they tame. It has been noted that they may allow humans to pet them. However, when efforts are made to hold them, they bite with their sharp teeth. If agitated while resting they may wake up suddenly, leap high, spit, and hiss. Forest dormice may have a negative impact for humans due to raiding fruit orchards and chewing on the bark of coniferous trees. They have also been known to be vectors for such diseases as tick-born encephalitis, leptospirosis, and possibly the Black Death. They may have a positive impact by controlling arthropod populations and scattering seeds.
Behavior.
Forest dormice spend a great amount of times in trees. They are capable of climbing with excellent agility as well as leap to and from branches as great as 2 meters apart from one another. This species has a natural tendency to create temporary nests which are fragile. This species does not spend much time on these temporary nests because much more energy is placed in making the natal nests.
This species is nocturnal. It is also very territorial. Adults live in low densities, usually only two to three per acre. Their territory range is from 65m to 100m in diameter.
Forest dormice produce a variety of noises for a variety of reasons. The most significant is the sound for an alarm call which is a melodious squeak. They also have the ability to produce ultrasounds which are used for communication. The different communication methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, acoustic, and chemical. It is not known exactly how these forms of communication are used specifically for this species. However, it is known that most mammals use tactile communication during mating, conflict, and raising young. Chemical communication can play a significant role in being able to identify a specific individual. Visual cues are given off through means of body posture as a way to designate whether it is a hostile or friendly environment. The different perception methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, ultrasound, and chemical.
Status.
This species is considered endangered in the Czech Republic and as rare in a majority of the other European countries. The population is mostly threatened by the destruction of forests which is their habitat. There are many programs in place to help maintain and increase the forest dormice population. There is an international law to protect this species and it is under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Appendix III). All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe hazel dormice. However, the program components are used to observe and track all species of dormice.
Ancestry.
Recently, a fossil of a dormouse-like mammal was discovered. This fossil is thought to be the earliest eutherian ancestor. The fossil was complete and well preserved in a lake bed located in China. It was given the name Eomaia, which means ancient mother. The fossil has skeletal features that are closer to modern placentals than to marsupials. This is significant as it indicates the split between these two groups that occurred more than 125 million years ago. Before this fossil was discovered, the oldest recorded fossil of a placental mammal was teeth aging 110 million years old. The oldest skull and skeleton fossil for a placental mammal is only 75 million years old.

Crataegus oxyacantha

The name Crataegus oxyacantha L. has been rejected as being of uncertain application, but is sometimes still used.
Taxonomy.
Linnaeus introduced the name "Crataegus oxyacantha" for a species of Northern European Hawthorn and the name gradually became used for several similar species which were assumed to be the same, particularly the Midland Hawthorn "C. laevigata" and the Common Hawthorn "C. monogyna". In 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed and described a single-styled species similar to the Common Hawthorn, and the Midland Hawthorn was effectively a later discovery. However, Byatt showed that confusion over the true identity of "C. oxyacantha" remained, and the name was formally rejected as ambiguous by the International Botanical Congress. More recently, Christensen concluded that the species studied by Linnaeus matches "C. rhipidophylla" Gand., a relatively rare species.

Antoine Burke (born 20 July 1975) is a retired Irish athlete born in Limerick. Burke attended University College Dublin on an athletics scholarship and also studied at the University of Limerick. He had an eclectic athletic career representing Ireland as a senior athlete at the high jump, long jump, 400 metres and 400 metre hurdles. He was runner up at the 1994 World Junior Championship in the high jump and four years later jumped a personal best of 2.24 metres. Burke never subsequently met the expectations set by his silver medal but competed for some number of years both in the high jump and other events. Whilst some observers of Irish athletics mused that 6 ft 4 tall Burke who was in and around fourteen stone could have fond his ultimate forte as a decathlete he was a surprisingly poor and unathletic thrower making success in this field quite uncertain. 
As a high jumper he also finished nineteenth at the 1992 World Junior Championships, and thirteenth at the 1998 European Indoor Championships. He was a member of the Irish 4x400mts Relay team who were 5th place finalists at the 2002 European Championships.
In the late 1990s he moved to Liverpool to train with renowned UK high jump coach Mike Holmes. The training group was a who's who of UK high jump talent. Antoine joined such stars as Olympic bronze medalist Steve Smith, Irish record holder Brendan Riley and multi-title holder Danny Graham.

Imagine Island

Imagine Island is a children's television program designed to teach English as a second language (ESL) to younger children. Each episode features stories, songs, and focuses on one letter of the English alphabet. The show is based on Imagine Learning English, an ESL computer program created by Imagine Learning, Inc. a software company based in Provo, Utah.
History.
Formed in 2004, Imagine Learning, Inc. developed Imagine Learning English, an English language software program. Employing research-based English teaching practices, the software acted like a human tutor, adapting to each child’s individual learning needs; it also gave feedback so teachers could see how the child was progressing. The aim of those at Imagine Learning, Inc. was to accelerate children's English language learning and give them the foundation they need to be able to speak fluent, accent-free English.
In early 2007, Imagine Learning, Inc. began developing the idea for a television program. Each episode would draw heavily from the Imagine Learning English software. Activities from the software would be tied together by a host who would also drive the narrative. A pilot was shot and presented to BYU Broadcasting, a division of Brigham Young University, also located in Provo, Utah. BYU Broadcasting had recently launched BYU Television International, and was searching for content in other languages, specifically Spanish and Portuguese.
An agreement was reached in late 2007; Imagine Learning, Inc. would produce 26 episodes of Imagine Island, and BYU Television International would begin airing them in 2008. Production commenced in February 2008, and wrapped in June 2008. The first episode of Imagine Island aired on July 5, 2008.
Format.
Hank Florence plays Jack, a treasure collector who works for the Imagine Museum. Each episode he travels to Imagine Island with his robot assistant, Booster, to collect treasures for the museum. The show employs the clever device of having Booster speak the viewer's native language, while Jack only speaks English. Booster mirrors Jack's dialog somewhat, so the viewer is able to understand. Each episode focuses on a letter of the alphabet, and teaches it through vocabulary words, songs, and stories. Instruction is reinforced through repetition. About 2/3 of each episode is content from the computer software, with the remaining 1/3 being scenes with Jack and Booster. Jack is shot on a green screen, so Booster, the island, and all other characters are animated.
Actors/Characters.
Hank Florence ("Jack").
Hank Florence was studying theater and acting at BYU when he auditioned for the role of Jack. He beat out dozens of professional actors for the part. He and his wife had recently lived in China, teaching English to children there, so he was familiar with ESL, and working with children specifically.
Booster.
Booster is a flying, animated robot. He is Jack's assistant, and usually is getting him out of trouble. Booster speaks different languages, depending on what country the show is airing in. Jack understands everything he says, however, but always answers him in English.
Amanda.
Amanda is a panda bear. Just as in the Imagine Learning English software, her role is to teach reading and listening comprehension. She reads each story in the episodes of Imagine Island.
Chloe.
Chloe is a cricket. As in the ILE software, her specialty is vocabulary. She resides in the library and teaches children not only the letters of the alphabet, but vocabulary words as well.
Mike.
Mike is an animated microphone. His function is spoken-language development. He shows videos that model real kids speaking English, and then he has the viewer practice a word or phrase.
Pete.
Pete is a prairie dog. In the software, he helps the children practice their English through games and quizzes. In the television show, however, he primarily functions as a narrative device to move the plot forward.
Awards.
In March 2008 Imagine Island received a bronze Telly Award. In 2009 it received two more Telly awards, this time receiving a Silver Award (the highest honor) for best children's program, and another Silver Award for best educational program.

Sindhi bhagat

Sindhi Bhagat is a Sindhi folk art incorporating song, dance, story and drama. It is the most popular Sindhi folk form of entertainment.
History.
Bhagat developed through the years. Its origin could be traced to the ancient bards who wandered through the countryside singing and narrating the old heroic ballads of the lovers and warriors of the olden times. The Sindhi Bhagat acquired its distinct form over a century ago, gradually developing into the current popular source of cultural entertainment. Its performances became more professional and it became a collectively created folk-art form.
Performance.
The pivotal character in the performance is the "Bhagat", after whom the art form is named. He is the prime dancer, the storyteller, and the soul of the performance. The others are the "Boldias" (supporting players) and also the players of musical instruments such as harmonium, tabla, dholak, khanjri, etc., simple rhythmical instruments.
The Bhagat combines the finer qualities of different performing arts in such an effective and appealing order that the audience are kept spellbound for hours together, because the Bhagat is supposed to start late in the evening, when the village or town folk have taken their night meal and are ready to sit till the early hours of the next morning. Men, women and children partake of the bewitching pleasure of the performance, often sitting through the night.
The Bhagat with his melodious voice, the delicate rhythm of his steps, body movements and very effective dramatised storytelling, keeps the audience glued to their seats without even blinking their eyes throughout the show. He has a variegated voice, creating different moods – be it pathos, agony, humour, melody, glory, or tragedy as required for the narration. He moves the hearts of his audience, bringing laughter or tears as the situation demands.
Sindhi Bhagat today.
Bhagat is the most important and integral part of Sindhi folk-art, a rich cultural heritage of the Sindhi community and widely acclaimed. There were once scores of these versatile artists in the countryside as well as in the urban pockets of Sind. However, after partition of the country this folk art is on the decline due to a variety of reasons, including the influence of electronic mass media and socio-economic compulsion. However, there are still a few prominent Bhagats who are dedicated and perform occasionally. 
thanks to Shri Kirat Babani for giving us this input and information.

The following is an incomplete list of Sindhi Bhagats who are considered to be promoters and preservers of the rich Sindhi heritage and culture:

Malt house

A malt house, or maltings, is a building where cereal grain is converted into malt by soaking it in water, allowing it to sprout and then drying it to stop further growth. The malt is used in brewing beer, whisky and in certain foods. The traditional malt house was largely phased out during the twentieth century in favour of more mechanised production. Many malt houses have been converted to other uses, such as Snape Maltings which is now a concert hall.
Production process.
The grain was first soaked in a steeping pit or cistern for a day or more. This was constructed of brick or stone, and was sometimes lined with lead. It was rectangular and no more than deep. Soon after being covered with water, the grain began to swell and increase its bulk by 25 percent.
The cistern was then drained and the grain transferred to another vessel called a couch, either a permanent construction, or temporarily formed with wooden boards. Here it was piled deep, and began to generate heat and start to germinate. It spent a day or two here, according to the season and the maltster's practice. 
It was then spread out on the growing floor, the depth dictated by the temperature, but sufficiently deep to encourage vegetation. It was turned at intervals to achieve even growth and over the next fourteen days or so it is turned and moved towards the kiln. The temperature was also controlled by ventilation. A day or two after the grain was turned out on to the floor, an agreeable smell was given off, and roots soon began to appear. A day or so later the future stem began to swell, and the kernel became friable and sweet-tasting. As the germination proceeded the grain was spread thinner on the floor. The process was halted before the stem burst the husk. At this stage much of the starch in the grain had been converted to maltose and the grain was left on the floor to dry. The art of malting depends on the proper regulation of these changes in the grain. Maltsters varied in their manner of working, and adapted to changes in climatic conditions.
The barley was then moved into the kiln, , for between two and four days, depending on whether a light or dark malt was required. A slow fire was used to start, and then gradually raised to suit the purpose of the malt and the desired colour. The barley was then sieved to remove the shoots and stored for a few months to develop flavour.
Malt houses in the United Kingdom.
Many villages had a malt house in the eighteenth century, supplying the needs of local publicans, estates and home brewers. Malt houses are typically long, low buildings, no more than two storeys high, in a vernacular style. The germination of barley is hindered by high temperatures, so many malt houses only operated in the winter. This provided employment for agricultural workers whose labour was not much in demand during the winter months.
During the nineteenth century many small breweries disappeared. Improved techniques allowed larger breweries and specialist maltsters to build their own maltings and operate year round. These were often housed in multi-storey buildings. It was also more efficient to transport malt than barley to the brewery, so many large breweries set up their own maltings near railways in the barley growing districts of eastern England.
Towards the end of the nineteenth century, pneumatic malting was introduced, in which the barley is aerated and the temperature carefully controlled, accelerating the germination. Large malting floors were no longer necessary, but power consumption was high, so floor malting held on well into the twentieth century. Only a handful of traditional malting floors are still in use.
Malt tax.
The malt tax was introduced in Britain in 1697, and was repealed in 1880.
The rate for malted barley was 6d. per bushel in 1697 and had risen to 2s. 7d. in 1834. In 1789 the malt tax raised £ million, 11.5% of all taxes. In 1802 the malt duty rose from 1s. 4d. a bushel to 2s. 5d., then to 4s. 5d. in 1804, driven upwards by the need to finance the French Wars of 1793–1815. In 1865 the total revenue was reported to be six million sterling a year.
There were also numerous regulations in place regarding the malting process. The cistern and the couch-frame had to be constructed in a particular manner, to permit the excise officer to gauge the grain. The maltster had to give notice before wetting any grain; 24 hours in the city or market-town, 48 hours elsewhere. The grain had to be kept covered with water for 48 hours, excepting one hour for changing the water. Grain could only be put in the cistern between 8am and 2pm, and taken out between 7am and 4pm. It had to remain in the couch frame for at least 26 hours. Once thrown out of the cistern, it could not be sprinkled for 12 days. A survey book or ledger had to be kept to record the process and the gauging of the grain in the cistern, the couch, and on the floor. The volume of the grain was carefully measured, based upon the mean width, length and height, and calculated by mental arithmetic, pen and paper, or slide rule. The duty to be charged was based upon the largest gauge of either the cistern, couch or floor after a multiplying factor of 1.6 was applied to the larger of the cistern or couch gauges.

HMS San Josef (1797)

HMS "San Josef" was a 114-gun first rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was captured from the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797 (when she was still named in Spanish "San José"). In 1809 she served as the flagship of Admiral John Thomas Duckworth.
Battle of Cape St Vincent.
The "San José" was among the Spanish fleet during the battle, during which HMS "Captain", under the command of Captain, Horatio Nelson came out of the line to attack the "San Nicolás". After exchanging fire, Nelson led his forces aboard the "San Nicolás". While the English were fighting their way aboard the "San José" continued to fire upon the "Captain" and the "San Nicolás". The "San José" then fell upon the "San Nicolás" and their rigging became tangled. Trapped, the men from the "San José" continued to fire on the British boarding parties with muskets and pistols. Nelson then took his men from the decks of the "San Nicolás" aboard the "San José", forcing the Spanish to surrender, with their Admiral badly injured. The "San José" and the "San Nicolás", both captured by Nelson, were two of the four ships captured during the battle. After their capture they were renamed "HMS San Josef" and "HMS San Nicolas" respectively. The feat of using one enemy vessel as a 'stepping stone' to capture another was afterwards known in the Royal Navy as "Nelson's patent bridge for boarding first rates".
Later career.
From 1839 "San Josef" was used as a gunnery training ship. From 10 August 1841 she was commanded by Captain Joseph Needham Tayler, serving as a guard ship at Devonport (established gunnery school). Other captains who served in her include: Captain Frederick William Burgoyne, while serving as the flagship of Samuel Pym, Plymouth; Captain Henry John Leeke; and Captain Thomas Maitland, as the flagship of Admiral William Hall Gage, Devonport. She was broken up a Devonport in May 1849.
A very small piece of the "San Josef" still survives to this day; it is in the form of part of a wooden gun carriage; called a Quoin. This quoin can be found among the Valhalla figurehead collection in Tresco Abbey Gardens in the Isles of Scilly.
Legacy.
San Josef Mountain on the South Coast of British Columbia, on the south side of Estero Basin on Frederick Arm to the west of the mouth of Bute Inlet, was named in 1864 by Captain Pender for the "San Josef", while Departure Bay and Nanaimo Harbour at the city of Nanaimo were originally named (in 1791) the "Bocas de Winthuysen" after Rear-Admiral Don Francisco Xavier Winthuysen.

<doc id="18861977" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18861977" title="Fall River Government Center">
Fall River Government Center

Fall River Government Center (also known as "city hall") is the location of the municipal government offices in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. Located at One Government Center, and constructed directly over Interstate 195, it was the first public building built over a Federal interstate highway. It replaced the city's historic 19th century city hall which had been demolished in the early 1960s as part of the construction of Interstate 195, which cuts through the center of the city's downtown area. Delayed and plagued by problems during construction, the new city hall opened in 1976. In 2008, the building and site underwent a multi-million dollar exterior renovation.
Location.
The current Fall River Government Center is located at the historic "crossroads" of the city, at the intersection of Central Street (Bedford Street) and Main Street. Fall River's first town hall was destroyed in the first great downtown fire of 1843, which destroyed over 200 buildings in the center of town.
Old city hall.
The city's historic 19th century city hall was demolished in the early 1960s for construction of Interstate 195, which cut through the heart of downtown Fall River. It was a time of so-called "urban renewal" in the city after the tough years since the collapse of the city's textile industry in the 1920s and 1930s. Several other 19th and early 20th century buildings were also demolished as part of the new highway construction. The old city hall, which had survived two fires was constructed directly over the Quequechan River, the source of power for the early textile mills. As part of the highway project, the river was diverted into an underground culvert which parallels the highway, along the south side of the current city hall. Two granite columns from the front of the old city hall are located across from the current building, along Sullivan Drive, next to the Academy Building. The eagle which topped the spire of the old city hall is currently located in the foyer of the new building.
Current building.
The new Government Center (city hall), constructed of reinforced concrete and glass, in the popular Brutalist style of the 1960s and 1970s opened in 1976, after years of construction delays and quality control problems. The main buildings occupies a space further east than the original city hall, which was closer to South Main Street. A wing of the current building, which contains the city council chambers is located at the west end of the site, closer to South Main Street. A plaza was created north of the new city hall, between the adjacent United States Post Office. The original scheme for the new city hall included a parking garage, that was later eliminated from the design.
The main building is a concrete cube, approximately 144 feet (44 m) square, with a smaller glass-enclosed cube forming the middle floors. The building is set atop an elevated "basement" containing mechanical and storage areas constructed atop the steel platform which spans the highway. The platform also includes South Main Street to the west and Second Street to the east, creating a 900 foot (274 m) long tunnel.
Recent history.
In March 1999, concrete slabs forming the ceiling of the tunnel beneath Government Center fell onto the westbound lanes of Interstate 195, causing a six-vehicle accident in which a minivan overturned. Amazingly nobody was killed in the incident which was later determine to have resulted from corrosion of the support brackets which held the concrete slabs. As a result, state highway officials ordered the immediate removal of all the concrete ceiling slabs beneath Government Center. This however, left the underside of the building vulnerable to fire, in the event of an accident within the tunnel.
As a result of the fire protection panels being removed from beneath Government Center, it was decided by state and local officials that all trucks carrying hazardous cargo (gasoline, oil, etc.) could not pass under the building along Interstate 195. For several years, these vehicles were detoured through the city streets around Government Center. In May 2008, with the replacement of the concrete panels complete, this restriction was removed.

Kurt Foss

Kurt Foss (January 1, 1925 - October 17, 1991) was a Norwegian composer, singer and vaudeville artist.
He was born in Bergen, and together with Reidar Bøe Kurt Foss created the hugely popular duo "Radiofantomene" ("The Radio Phantoms") that was active throughout the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Their biggest success was the song "Blåveispiken" ("The Liverwort Girl") with lyrics by Arne Paasche Aasen and which was released in 1950 selling 100,000 records. They later produced humorous songs and tender vises, among these were "Tre yndige små mus" ("Three Cute Little Mice") in 1950, composed by Kristian Hauger, "Nordlandsnetter" ("Nordland Nights") in collaboration with Jens Book-Jenssen in 1952, "Det ringer, det ringer" ("It's Ringing, It's Ringing") in 1953, "Kallen og katten" ("The Old Man and the Cat") in 1954, which was one of several adaptaions into songs of the poetry of Jakob Sande, and also "De nære ting" ("The Things Near") in 1951, that song was also with lyrics by Arne Paasche Aasen. After the death of Reidar Bøe in 1969, Foss didn't thrive in the limelight as he had used to. During the subsequent years he worked as, among other things, stage manager at some of Oslo's theatres. Nevertheless, he still performed some during the 1970s as well as the 1980s, initially together with his wife Torhild Lindal who was also a stage artist, and later with other, one of these being Jon Eikemo. He was awarded the Gammleng Award in the veteran category in 1986. In 1989 he moved back to his home town, Bergen, and he lived there until his death in 1991, at the age of 66.
The first CD release of "Radiofantomene" came in 2004, and the second collector's album was released in August 2005. A third record with musical adaptations of Jakob Sande poems came in November 2006.

Museum of Design, Zürich

The Museum of Design, Zürich (German: "Museum für Gestaltung Zürich") is a museum for industrial design, visual communication, architecture, and craft in Zurich, Switzerland.
Overview.
The museum is part of the Department of Cultural Analysis of the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK).The museum's four extensive collections (Poster, Graphics, Design and Applied Art) are of international importance.
The Museum of Design is located in Zürich's Kreis 5, close to Zürich Hauptbahnhof. Parts of its collections are housed opposite the museum's main building on Limmatstrasse (the Plakatraum, or Poster Collection), and in a commercial building on Förrlibuckstrasse (the Design Collection and Graphics Collection). The museum also operates the Museum Bellerive, located in a former villa on the shores of Lake Zurich. It contains the museum's collection of Applied Art.
History and buildings.
Situated in Zurich's former School of Arts and Crafts the Museum of Design's main building contains an exhibition hall, gallery, reception area, cafeteria, shop and the vestibule to the lecture hall. The Museum of Design developed out of the Museum of Arts and Crafts, which was founded in 1875. In 1933, the museum and the School of Arts and Crafts (today known as the Zurich University of the Arts) moved into its present building designed by Adolf Steger and Karl Egender. In its combination of aesthetic and functional qualities, the building exemplifies the Modern Architecture movement in Switzerland. In 1968 the Museum of Design acquired the former home of the textile manufacturer Julian Bloch and moved part of its Applied Art collection into it. Renamed the Museum Bellerive, the building houses the collection of glass, ceramic, wood, metal and textiles.
Exhibitions.
The Museum of Design shows between five and seven temporary exhibitions annually in the hall and the gallery of the main building, small interventions within the museum, three temporary exhibitions in the Museum Bellerive and two in the Plakatraum. Most of the exhibitions shown in the Museum of Design are produced in-house and are developed in dialogue with the museum collections or through research projects. Exhibitions loaned from other institutions make up a small part of the exhibition program.
The exhibitions, which are mostly interdisciplinary in character, focus on historical phenomena, contemporary tendencies and innovative approaches. Backed by sound scholarship, exhibitions are presented in a visually interesting and engaging way. Their aim is to appeal to both a broad general public, as well those with specialized knowledge.
In translating the themes and concepts of the visual communication into exhibitions, the Museum of Design works from project to project with different teams of exhibition designers, architects and visual designers. This approach has resulted in design awards for the museum's exhibitions and related publications.
Exhibitions are accompanied by a program of tours, symposia, panel discussions, talks with artists, film and theatre performances and concerts. A specifically tailored educational program is devised for each exhibition.
Collections.
The four collections of the Museum of Design emerged from a teaching collection amassed by the Museum of Arts and Crafts. Today they are of international importance. Objects from the collection are to be found in international research projects and exhibitions, while within the Zurich University of the Arts they are used for studying design solutions, materials, techniques and styles. Part of the collection is accessible online.
Poster Collection (Plakatraum).
The Poster Collection is among the most comprehensive and important archives of its kind in the world. It comprises 330,000 posters (of which 120,000 have been photographed and indexed) and documents the international history of the poster from its mid-19th-century origins to the present-day.
The collection includes political, cultural and commercial posters. For reasons explicable in terms of design history the geographical focal points are Switzerland, Europe, Japan, Cuba, the former Soviet Union and the USA.

The Design Collection includes 10,000 products and 20,000 examples of packaging produced by famous designers, as well as representative examples of anonymous everyday design. Mass-produced products from the 20th century and the present are collected, with emphasis placed on Swiss design.
Through its permanent loans from the field of product design (an area that has been subsidized by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture since 1989) the Swiss Confederation makes available objects that pertain to the current design discourse. Parallel to the collection of objects, an archive for Swiss Design is being built up that benefits and assists scholarly research in the field. The archive contains concepts, project studies, design drawings, user guides, patent specifications, advertising material and source texts, as well as parts of the archives of design studios, companies and associations.
Graphics Collection.
The Graphics Collection has existed since the museum was founded. It documents the aesthetic and cultural transformation of graphics in everyday life from Gutenberg to the present. The diversity of works and its current focus on European graphic design is unique in Switzerland.
Originally intended as an international collection of examples, the Graphics Collection includes almost all graphic disciplines that were of importance for teaching at the former School of Arts and Crafts. The core was initially formed by drawings, prints and illustrated books, as well as textbooks from the 15th to the 20th century. Press work, East Asian works, artists books, photographs and commercial art were added later.
Today collecting concentrates on advertising and information graphics, fonts, typography and book design. The collection is developed further by acquiring current works by innovative graphic designers, advertising agencies, the legacies of important designers as well as examples of the corporate design of important companies.
Applied Art Collection (Museum Bellerive).
Housed in the Museum Bellrive, the Applied Art Collection includes over 15,000 pieces and is one of the most important collections of international applied art in Switzerland. Originally assembled as a study collection by the Museum of Art and Design, the collection contains diverse objects in the areas of glass, ceramics, textiles and furniture spanning the 19th and 20th centuries. In geographical terms, it concentrates on Europe, the USA and modern Japan. The quality of the collection is high and contains examples of work by well-known artists, designers and craftspeople. It is justly famous for its Jugendstil department, which contains works by William Morris, Emile Gallé, René Lalique, Hermann Obrist and Henry van de Velde. It has a well-known collection of marionettes and puppets that includes works by Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Alexandra Exter. The museum's collection of musical instruments is composed of around 200 historic pieces. Its glass department is particularly strong in objects made from 1880 to after 1970 and includes glass designed and/or made by Jaroslava Brychtová and Stanislav Libenský, Pavel Hlava, Eric Höglund, Livio Seguso and Jan Zoritchak. The Studio Glass generation of artists is represented in objects by, among others, Dale Chihuly, Erwin Eisch, Marvin Lipofsky, Harvey Littleton and Mary Shaffer.
Research and services.
The contents of the collections are continuously analyzed and researched in collaboration with the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) as well as other university-level institutions with the aim of contextually positioning them from a present day viewpoint and opening them up for cross-disciplinary projects. In addition to study, documentation and conservation, other services such as research, specialist evaluations and reproductions are also offered.
Publications.
The Museum of Design produces publications, either self-printed or in collaboration with well-known publishing houses, which function as an important part of the exhibition program. These include thematically organized series such as the "Design Collection" or the "Poster Collection" as well as anthologies of classic design history and current themes, and monographs about pioneers in the fields of theory and practice.

Annual effective discount rate

The annual effective discount rate is the annual interest divided by the capital including that interest, which is the interest rate divided by 100% plus the interest rate. This rate is lower than the interest rate; it corresponds to using the value after a year as the nominal value, and seeing the initial value as the nominal value minus a discount. It is used for U.S. Treasury bills and similar financial instruments. It is the annual discount factor to be applied to the future cash flow, to find the discount, subtracted from a future value to find the value one year earlier.
For example, consider a government bond that sells for $95 and pays $100 in a year's time. The discount rate is
The interest rate is calculated using 95 as the base
For every annual effective interest rate, there is a corresponding annual effective discount rate, given by 
or inversely,
where the approximations apply for small "i" and "d"; in fact "i" - "d" = "id".
Annual discount rate convertible formula_5thly.
A discount rate applied formula_5 times over equal subintervals of a year is found from the annual effective rate d as
where formula_8 is called the annual nominal rate of discount convertible formula_5thly.
formula_11 is the force of interest.
The rate formula_8 is always bigger than d because the rate of discount convertible pthly is applied in each subinterval to a smaller (already discounted) sum of money. As such, in order to achieve the same total amount of discounting the rate has to be slightly more than 1/pth of the annual rate of discount.
Business calculations.
Businesses consider this discount rate when deciding whether to invest profits to buy equipment or whether to deliver the profit to shareholders. In an ideal world, they would buy a piece of equipment if shareholders would get a bigger profit later. The amount of extra profit a shareholder requires to prefer that the company buy the equipment rather than giving them the profit now is based on the shareholder's discount rate. A common way of estimating shareholders' discount rates uses share price data is known as the capital asset pricing model. Businesses normally apply this discount rate by calculating the net present value of the decision.

1998–99 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 1998–99 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a quiet season that had the fourth-lowest number of days with tropical storm or tropical cyclone activity. Most of the storms formed either in the Mozambique Channel or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent Australian basin east of 90º E. As a result, few storms impacted Madagascar, and none made landfall on the African continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, Réunion island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion. There were only two tropical cyclones – a storm with winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph).
Activity began late, with the first tropical storm – Alda – forming on January 16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the Mozambique Channel, which was one of few favorable areas for tropical cyclogenesis in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the Mascarene Islands. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on Réunion and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm – Evrina – peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90ºE, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) in the basin. The final storm was unnamed, crossing from the Australian basin on April 21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating. There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions, many short-lived. The first of these formed on September 3 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status.
Season summary.
The Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season. The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique, and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90º E, south of the equator. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center – a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force – also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the region. Wind estimates from Météo-France and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10 minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1 minute. 10 minute winds are about 1.14 times the amount of 1 minute winds. Most storms formed and dissipated within the tropics, with the exception of Severe Tropical Storm Alda.
During the season, atmospheric conditions shifted from El Niño to La Niña, but despite the shift, the season was similarly inactive as its predecessor. In general, sea surface temperatures were below normal, and atmospheric pressures were above normal, both unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. In the month of February, on average the peak time for activity, there was a general lack of convection, or thunderstorms, east of Madagascar. The average monthly pressure on Réunion was the highest since reliable records began in 1953. The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere. In its summary of the season, the MFR described the lack of activity as "rare and remarkable", possibly related to a Walker circulation. The agency monitored 14 tropical disturbances, of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24 hours. Six of these intensified into tropical storms, three less than the average of nine, of which only two attained tropical cyclone status, or half the average. There were 28 days in which there was storm or tropical cyclone activity, less than the average of 42 and at the time the fourth lowest since reliable record-keeping began in 1967 with the advent of satellite imagery. The only seasons with a lower number of storm days were 1982–83, 1986–87, and 1997–98.
Storms.
Tropical Depression H4.
The South Indian Ocean basin, the tropical cyclone season is considered to end on July 31 while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) considers it to begin on July 1. Therefore, RSMC La Reunion regarded this system as the last of the 1997-98 season, while the JTWC regarded it as the first of the 1998-99 season, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 01S.
La Reunion issued the first advisory for this disturbance on July 20 while it was centered about east of Diego Garcia. For the next couple of days the system moved slowly toward the west-southwest. On July 22, it was upgraded to a tropical depression by La Reunion. Tropical Depression H4 was already weakening on the 23rd when the JTWC issued its first advisory, placing the center about southeast of Diego Garcia. The system experienced considerable vertical wind shear throughout its life, but by July 23, the hostile conditions had abated somewhat. Given its proximity to Diego Garcia, the JTWC decided to initiate advisories on the system. In post-operational analysis, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical cyclone on the 22nd.
Severe Tropical Storm Alda.
After a subtropical depression exited the Mozambique Channel, another area of convection formed in the region on January 8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January 12, which split off a cutoff low pressure area. Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira, Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection. The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east. On January 16, the MFR reclassified the system as a tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had began an eastward movement, but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high pressure areas. Late on January 16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast. Also that day, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 12S. This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm, at the time the third-latest on record.
Neither the MFR nor the JTWC anticipated much strengthening after Alda attained tropical storm status. Around the time of its upgrade, Alda passed about 20 km (12 mi) west of Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, where sustained winds reached and gusts were as strong as . A building ridge southeast of Madagascar turned the storm to the southwest. After an increase in wind shear diminished the convection, the JTWC discontinued advisories on January 17, although the thunderstorms redeveloped following an unexpected decrease in wind shear. Alda turned to the southeast ahead of an approaching trough, and developed a ragged eye feature on January 18. That day, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), and the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane. The latter agency also reissued one advisory when the storm was at its peak. Alda accelerated to the southeast and gradually lost tropical characteristics, becoming extratropical on January 19 before being absorbed by the approaching cold front.
Following rainfall from an earlier subtropical depression, Alda dropped of rainfall in Morombe in southwestern Madagascar. The rainfall caused flooding that affected thousands of people. The rainfall was beneficial in alleviating previously dry conditions that had prevented crops to be planted. The passage of the storm also caused temperatures to decrease in Mozambique and Madagascar.
Moderate Tropical Storm Damien-Birenda.
On January 21, a tropical disturbance formed in the Australian region about south of the Indonesian island of Java. Moving west-southwestward, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Damien on January 23, and attained tropical cyclone status two days later while passing south of the Cocos Islands. Subsequently, an increase in wind shear induced steady weakening, causing the circulation to be briefly exposed from the convection on January 26. Damien maintained an area of convection nearby the circulation, and exited into the south-west Indian Ocean on January 28 as a minimal tropical storm; at that time, the Mauritius Meteorological Services renamed the storm as Birenda. The storm turned more to the west and west-northwest due to a building ridge to the south. Increasing wind shear weakened Birenda to tropical depression status on January 29 and into a tropical disturbance the next day. Although convection was intermittent, the circulation dissipated on February 3.
Moderate Tropical Storm Chikita.
Soon after Damien-Birenda exited the Australian region, another tropical disturbance formed north of the Cocos on January 29, which was initially weak but gradually organized. The disturbance tracked quickly west-westward due to a powerful ridge to the south, remaining in tandem with Tropical Storm Birenda about to the east. On January 31, the system crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean. The fast forward motion caused the effects of wind shear to diminish as well as increase the circulation's strength, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chikita on January 31. At that time, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65 km/h (40 mph). Almost immediately thereafter, the convection began weakening due to lukewarm water temperatures, and Chikita weakened to tropical depression status on February 1. Continuing rapidly to the west, the circulation became exposed from the convection on February 3 due to increased wind shear. Around that time, Chikita passed about north of Rodrigues island, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical disturbance. On the next day, the circulation passed north of both Mauritius and Réunion, presenting an asymmetric structure with the strongest winds to the south. Chikita dissipated on February 5 off the southeast coast of Madagascar.
On Rodrigues, Chikita produced wind gusts of and a rainfall total of , the rainfall proving beneficial due to previously dry conditions. Despite only being a tropical disturbance, Chikita produced wind gusts of on Mauritius and in the mountainous peaks of Réunion. The rainfall rates in both islands varied greatly; the peak total on Mauritius was compared to the peak of in Bébourg in the heights of Réunion. Also on the latter island, there was a six hour rainfall total of at Piton de la Fournaise. Wet weather persisted after Chikita dissipated, resulting in four day totals of in Bébourg on Réunion, and easing drought conditions on Mauritius.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Davina.
After an extended period with no activity across much of the Indian Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) rebuilt toward the end of February, and spawned an area of convection on March 1 in the extreme eastern portion of the basin. The next day, a circulation was noted on satellite imagery to the northeast of the convection, which indicated that a tropical disturbance had developed. The influence of the monsoon trough steered the disturbance to the southeast into the Australian basin, where moderate wind shear prevented quick development. A building ridge to the south turned the system to the southwest, bringing it back into the south-west Indian on March 3 as a tropical depression. With decreasing wind shear, the depression slowly intensified as convection increased, becoming Tropical Storm Davina on March 4. An eye developed the next day, signaling Davina had intensified into a tropical cyclone, or reaching 10-minute winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph). On March 7, Davina became an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained 10-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). At around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). 
Continuing quickly to the west-southwest, Davina moved over an area of cooler waters and began weakening. On March 8, the system passed about northwest of Rodrigues as a minimal tropical cyclone. The next day, Davina re-intensified slightly to winds of 130 km/h (85 mph), and while near that intensity its eyewall crossed over Mauritius. After passing the island, the eye increased to a diameter of before deteriorating. On March 10, Davina passed about southeast of Réunion as a severe tropical storm. The next day, the storm slowed its forward motion and rapidly weakened due to increasing wind shear, becoming a tropical depression on March 12. The circulation turned to the northeast and later to the west in the trade winds. Davina looped off the east coast of Madagascar, eventually dissipating on March 19.
Cyclone Davina affected Rodrigues as a weakening storm, which limited wind gusts to and rainfall to only . After moving toward Mauritius for several days, the cyclone produced a peak wave height of . On the island, the airport at Plaisance recorded a peak gust of , strong enough to cause crop damage and injure 60 people. Rainfall peaked at , which failed to break the island's worst drought since 1904. On Réunion, wind gusts also peaked at at Piton Sainte-Rose. Davina produced wave heights of at Saint-Pierre. Rainfall on Réunion was highest in the southern portion of the island, mainly through the process of orographic lift; over a three hour period, of precipitation was recorded at Piton de la Fournaise, and the highest total was in the island's center. Due to the storm's slow movement, Davina produced scattered rainfall over Réunion for several days. Two people drowned in the Rivière des Galets, but otherwise the rainfall proved beneficial in alleviating dry conditions. The gusty winds damaged the sugar cane and banana crops, but overall damage was minor.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Frederic-Evrina.
On March 25, an area of convection formed along the monsoon trough in the Australian basin, gradually organizing into a tropical storm while moving west-southwestward and given the name Frederic. On March 29, the storm attained tropical cyclone status, and continued to strengthen due to warm waters. At its peak on March 31, Frederic developed a well-defined eye within a circular central dense overcast. The MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), and the JTWC estimated maximum 1-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Subsequently, Frederic encountered the combination of wind shear and cooler, dry air, which caused weakening. On April 1, the cyclone crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean with 10-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), at which time it was renamed Evrina. 
Continuing to the west-southwest upon entering the basin, Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April 2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30 hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April 5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects. On April 8, the circulation turned to the east, dissipating two days later to the south of Rodrigues.
Moderate Tropical Storm Hamish-F1.
On April 17, an area of convection persisted near the border of the south-west Indian and the Australian regions. The system moved eastward into the Australian basin, becoming a tropical disturbance on April 19. Turning to the southeast, the system gradually organized as the convection persisted. On April 20, the disturbance intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hamish. Shortly thereafter, the ridge to the south turned the storm to the southwest. After the BoM estimated peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), Hamish began quickly weakening due to increasing wind shear. On April 21, the storm crossed into the south-west Indian basin, still maintaining 10-minute winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Although the Mauritius Meteorological Services should have classified the system as Tropical Storm Francine, the storm remained unnamed, referred as Tropical Storm F1. However, the system weakened to tropical depression status within six hours of entering the basin, and dissipating on April 24. 
Other storms in 1998.
At the time, the MFR's cyclone season began on August 1, although the JTWC's cyclone season for the southern hemisphere began on July 1. The latter agency tracked a short-lived tropical storm toward the end of July, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 01S. The MFR named it Tropical Depression H4, estimating peak 10-minute winds of 55 km/h (35 km/h).
The first system of the season proper originated out of an area of convection in early September in the northeast portion of the basin. On September 3, the MFR initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance A1 about 1435 km (890 mi) east of Diego Garcia. The system tracked westward, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on September 4. Failing to intensify beyond winds of 45 km/h (30 mph), the disturbance dissipated on September 6. Later in the month, Tropical Disturbance A2 formed in a similar region within the monsoon trough, with the MFR initiating advisories on September 29. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02S. That day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status, although strong wind shear prevented intensification. The MFR quickly discontinued advisories, but the JTWC continued tracking it, again upgrading the system to tropical storm status on October 1. After the shear again increased, the storm weakened, dissipating on October 2.
In November, rapidly weakening Tropical Cyclone Alison moved from the Australian basin and dissipated immediately upon entering the south-west Indian Ocean on November 13. On December 4, short-lived Tropical Disturbance A3 was classified by MFR, subsequently drifting into the Australian region. Possibly related to the previous system, Tropical Cyclone Cathy moved from the Australian basin into the basin on December 28, quickly dissipating.
Other storms in 1999.
On January 1, an area of convection persisted in the Mozambique Channel, with an associated circulation located on land in Mozambique. The system drifted to the east and southeast over warmer waters, gradually organizing. On January 3, the MFR classified the system as Tropical Disturbance A4 near the Mozambique coastline. The disturbance accelerated to the southeast, passing southwest of Madagascar with an asymmetric structure; most of the convection was on the eastern periphery due to strong wind shear. Heavy rainfall occurred along the southwest Madagascar coast, peaking at over a 48 hour period in Morombe. Wind gusts there reached , although the disturbance's maximum sustained 10-minute winds were 55 km/h (35 mph). The disturbance transitioned into a subtropical depression on January 5, but soon after became extratropical while accelerating southeastward.
During an extended period of quiet conditions across much of the basin, an area of low pressure persisted along the eastern coast of Mozambique. Convection fluctuated daily but became more persistent on February 11. That day, the thunderstorms organized into a circulation that had formed less than southeast of Beira, Mozambique, becoming Tropical Disturbance D1. After forming, the system moved southward, developing a central dense overcast with northeasterly outflow. Based on the organization, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression on February 13. Although there were gale force winds in the southwest periphery, the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection. The depression neared tropical storm intensity, but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), making the system a tropical storm by their assessment. A building ridge to the south turned the depression to the northeast, bringing the system near Europa Island. A station on the island recorded sustained winds of with gusts to about three hours before and after the closest approach; the observations suggested that the depression could have become a tropical storm. Soon thereafter, the associated convection dissipated and the circulation turned westward. After crossing over its former path, the depression dissipated on February 17 very close to where it developed.
Similar to the previous depression and Tropical Storm Alda, Tropical Disturbance D2 developed in the Mozambique Channel, initially subtropical in nature. On February 20, a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique, spawning an area of convection. A weak low pressure area developed on February 23, which proceeded to move southeastward. Due to unfavorable wind shear, the system failed to organize much, although initially it produced strong wind gusts. On February 28, much of the convection was removed from the circulation, which looped over southwestern Madagascar to turn back to the west. On March 4, when Tropical Storm Davina was named, the disturbance was renamed E1. The next day, the circulation executed a small loop, dissipating on March 6 over eastern Mozambique.
A long-lived system developed on February 28 in the Australian region south of February 28, and moved westward. On March 7, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March 8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along the northern edge of a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March 16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March 20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March 11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop more, but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March 14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March 16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March 18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.
Storm names.
A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year, and this list was provided by the country of Seychelles.

Congregation Ahavath Chesed

Congregation Ahavath Chesed is a Reform Jewish synagogue in Jacksonville, Florida. It is the oldest Jewish congregation in Florida and one of the first formally incorporated. 
History.
Although Jews were already living in Florida in the late 18th century, Jacksonville probably was the first Jewish community organized in Florida. The Jacksonville Hebrew Cemetery was established in 1857. It is the oldest Jewish communal institution in Florida of which a record has been found.
In 1867 the “Israelites of Jacksonville” formed a congregation. The congregation was primarily composed of Jews from Prussia and Germany. For a number of years an organization called the Hebrew Benevolent Society also existed. Congregation Ahavath Chesed was organized in 1880. This congregation, led by Jacksonville's Jewish Mayor, Morris A. Dzialynski, received a legal charter in 1882. The congregation hired Rabbi Marx Moses, and dedicated, on September 8, 1882, a synagogue building.

Moshe Koussevitzky

Moshe Koussevitzky (, ; June 9, 1899, Smarhoń - August 23, 1966, New York) was a cantor and vocalist. A relative of noted conductor Sergei Koussevitzky, he made many recordings in Poland and the United States.
Born June 9, 1899, he moved to Vilna in 1920, and served there as cantor at the Sawel Synagogue, and, starting in 1924, at the Great Synagogue of Vilna. In 1927 or 1928 he became cantor of the Tlomackie Synagogue in Warsaw, succeeding Gershon Sirota. Koussevitzky first performed in the United States in 1938, at New York's Carnegie Hall. He and his family escaped the Nazis during the Holocaust by fleeing to the Soviet Union.
In 1947 Koussevitzky and his family emigrated to the United States. He became cantor of Borough Park, Brooklyn's Temple Beth-El in 1952, living in Great Neck during the week and in Borough Park on the Sabbath. He died on August 23, 1966, and was buried in Israel.
Notes.
Moshe Koussevitzky was a lyric tenor with a spectacular and perhaps unparalleled upper register among cantors. Koussevitzky is regarded as among the greatest Cantors of the 20th century. Some would place him first among peers, though that distinction is more often given to Yossele Rosenblatt or Gershon Sirota, both of whom were a generation older than Koussevitzky.

New York Society of Security Analysts

The New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) was established in 1937 by a group of financial professionals that included Benjamin Graham, a pioneer in the financial industry. NYSSA currently has more than 9,000 members and is the largest society within the CFA Institute, which has more than 90,0000 members.
History.
In 1937 a small group of security analysts decided to turn their casual lunch gatherings into a series of regular meetings. They held an organizational luncheon in a private dining room of the New York Chamber of Commerce. It was there that NYSSA was conceived, with a membership of approximately 20 analysts, including Benjamin Graham, the “father of securities analysis.” In September of that year, the society held its first formal program, at which Lawrence Klybert of Alexander Eisemann & Co. spoke on “Options – Their Effect on the Market Price of Stocks.” By 1939, the Society had grown to 82 members. In 1945 NYSSA published the first issue of "Analysts Forum", which featured the first public discussion of idea of analyst certification in its premier issue. That same year the NYSSA membership voted NYSSA votes 90–6 for establishment of the QSA rating scheme, a precursor to the CFA designation.
Famous NYSSA members include Benjamin Graham, Irving Kahn, Byron Wien, and John J. McCabe.
Educational Programs.
NYSSA provides review courses for the CFA Exam, as well as professional development courses on a range of topics, from financial modeling to corporate valuation methodologies to deal structuring.
Publications.
Benjamin Graham and Irving Kahn were among the analysts serving on the editorial board of the "Analysts Journal", which was published by the society from 1945 to 1953. In 2008 the society launched a magazine/peer-reviewed journal, "The Investment Professional". The last issue of this magazine was published in the Fall of 2009. It was then replaced with a blog, the "Finance Professionals' Post".
Committees.
Activities vary by committee. The responsibilities of membership on most committees include 
• Building relationships with related organizations on Wall Street. 
• Developing presentations and conferences relevant to the committee and NYSSA membership. 
• Planning and attending social and networking events.
• Sharing information and resources on a particular topic.

Luke Fulghum

Luke Fulghum (born October 16, 1980 in Colorado Springs, Colorado) is an American professional ice hockey forward, currently playing for the Colorado Eagles of the ECHL.
Playing career.
Fulghum began his career in 1998 playing at junior level for the Waterloo Black Hawks in Waterloo, Iowa. The Black Hawks are a Tier 1 junior level hockey team, but despite the high standard, Fulghum adapted well, playing in 52 USHL games and scoring 30 points. His production would improve the following season to a point per game in a 47 game spell, helping the Black Hawks into the post-season.
In his final season in Waterloo, Fulghum featured in 21 games and scored 31 points before being traded mid-season to the Dubuque Fighting Saints, fierce rivals to the Black Hawks. Again Fulghum would consistently score points, managing 31 points in 34 games to the end of the season. For the 2001–02 season, Fulghum would move into college hockey, signing for the University of Denver in his home state of Colorado.
In his first season at NCAA level, Fulghum took time to adapt but established himself as a regular player, scoring 12 points in 35 games. This would improve in the 2002–03 season to 28 points in 40 games. After four productive seasons in Denver, Fulghum would total 112 points and move on to the ill-fated AHL St. John's Maple Leafs, but would move on after just two games. He would split the 2005–06 season between the ECHL Pensacola Ice Pilots and the AHL Toronto Marlies. Fulghum would again play for the Marlies in the 2006–07 season, but spent the majority of the season again at ECHL level, this time with the Columbia Inferno.
For 2007–08, Fulghum became a Bridgeport Sound Tigers player, but again failed to establish himself, playing just once before returning to ECHL level. This would be with the Stockton Thunder. After just five games another mid-season move would ensue, this time to the Elmira Jackals. With a regular run in the team, Fulghum again found his scoring touch, with 24 points in 34 games, totals that would push the Jackals into the post-season where Fulghum would score 4 points in 6 games prior to the Jackals elimination.
In the summer of 2008, Fulghum made the decision to play his hockey in Europe for the first time, signing for the EIHL Manchester Phoenix, a team icing at the highest level of hockey in the United Kingdom. The deal was announced in August 2008 by head coach Tony Hand. Fulghum's first season in UK ice hockey was a positive one which showed off his high work-rate and point scoring ability - Fulghum would score 84 points in just 67 games. At the end of the season due to off-ice financial problems the Phoenix would choose to play in the EPL instead, meaning they could not keep Fulghum on their roster due to him not having a dual passport. He opted to remain in the EIHL and in June 2009 signed for the Coventry Blaze. 
He was released from his contract with the Coventry Blaze on December 1, 2011, and was immediately snapped up by the Sheffield Steelers
On June 21, 2012, Fulghum signed with the Denver Cutthroats for their 2012–13 inaugural season. In doing so, he became the second player in franchise history to join the team, following defenseman Aaron MacKenzie.
After a solitary season with the Cutthroats in which he contributed with 20 goals and 53 points in 65 games, and after initially re-signing with the Cutthroats for another year, Fulgham switched over to cross-town competitors the Colorado Eagles of the ECHL on September 12, 2013.

<doc id="18862235" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18862235" title="Marc H. Tanenbaum">
Marc H. Tanenbaum

Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum (1925–1992) was a human rights and social justice activist who was known for building bridges with other faith communities to advance mutual understanding and cooperation and to eliminate entrenched stereotypes, particularly those rooted in religious teachings. He was an advocate during the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) on behalf of what eventually emerged as Nostra Aetate, a landmark document which overturned a long tradition of hostility toward Jews and Judaism—including the charge that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus—and affirmed the Jewish roots of Christianity. Nostra Aetate established a new policy of outreach in dialogue to Jews and set Catholic-Jewish relations on a new course.
Tanenbaum was dubbed "the human rights rabbi" for his work on behalf of Vietnamese boat people and Cambodian refugees. He helped organize humanitarian relief for victims of the Nigerian Civil War.
Biography.
The son of poor Orthodox Jewish Ukrainian immigrants, Tanenbaum grew up in Baltimore. He excelled in school,graduating with a scholarship to attend Yeshiva University in New York City. He pursued both pre-medical and rabbinical studies. Upon graduating from Yeshiva University, he was accepted into medical school, but after only one day of classes, he realized that medicine was not the path for him.
Always interested in writing, both creative and journalistic, he found work at a weekly newsletter. A chance encounter with former classmate Harold M. Schulweis, who later became a distinguished rabbi and author, led to Tanenbaum's application for and admission to the Jewish Theological Seminary. At the seminary he pursued his interests in both Judaism and journalism, writing for "The Eternal Light," a radio show produced by the seminary.
After ordination, Rabbi Tanenbaum knew he wanted to serve the Jewish community but not in what capacity. He worked in various positions as a writer and editor, and, for a time, was the religion writer for "Time" magazine. In 1952, he became director of the Synagogue Council of America, an organization formed to represent the combined voices of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Judaism in the United States in the area of public policy and intergroup relations. At the Synagogue Council he forged contacts with Christian leaders, including televangelists and Greek Orthodox primates and befriended the late Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. He became involved in national public affairs, serving as the vice president of the White House Conference on Children and Youth, where he invited Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to deliver a major paper. The intersection of religion and public policy had a particular appeal for Tanenbaum, and he saw it as a fertile field for interreligious cooperation. He believed that Jews needed to take an active role in public life in order to prevent marginalization and to counter anti-Semitism.
In 1983, Rabbi Tanenbaum became director of International Affairs of the American Jewish Committee where he focused on issues of human rights and humanitarian work.
During his career as director of first Interreligious and then International Affairs at the AJC, Marc Tanenbaum won public recognition. "Newsweek" magazine dubbed him as "the American Jewish community's foremost apostle to the gentiles." "New York Magazine" called him "the foremost Jewish ecumenical leader in the world today." In a poll of newspaper editors ranking the ten most respected and influential religious leaders in America, Rabbi Tanenbaum came in fourth.
He served on the boards of various institutions, including the American Jewish World Service, the International Rescue Committee, the Overseas Development Council, the United Nations Association, the National Peace Academy, the A. Philip Randolph Institute, and Covenant House. He was founder and Chairman of the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry, which, under the directorship of Ann Gillen, vigorously pursued the cause of oppressed Jews and Christians in the Soviet Union. He was awarded fifteen honorary degrees, and was honored by the International Council of Christians and Jews and the New York Board of Rabbis.
Tanenbaum was known for his weekly radio broadcasts, which addressed current events with commentary. He also wrote editorials and articles directed to the Jewish community, upholding the value of interreligious dialogue.
Tanenbaum’s first marriage in 1955 to Helga Weiss ended in divorce in 1977. They had two daughters, Adina and Susan, and a son, Michael. He was married in 1982 to Dr. Georgette Bennett, an author, broadcast journalist, criminologist and business consultant.
He died of heart failure in 1992 at the age of 66, seven weeks before the birth of his son, Joshua-Marc Tanenbaum. In 1993 Dr. Bennett launched the Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum Foundation, which operates today as the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding.

Double Mountains (Texas)

Double Mountains is the name of a pair of flat-topped buttes located southwest of Aspermont in Stonewall County, Texas. While the Handbook of Texas gives their elevation as either or , United States Geological Survey maps give the elevation of the western mountain as and that of the eastern mountain as between and . Together, the mountains form part of the high ground dividing the watersheds of the Salt Fork and Double Mountain Fork Brazos River.
Rising some 500–800 feet (150–250 m) above the surrounding plains, the higher eastern mountain is the highest point in Stonewall County and the most topographically prominent point for almost , the nearest more prominent peak being Mount Scott in Oklahoma. As such an isolated geographical feature, the mountains are visible from a great distance, and feature commanding views from their tops.
Their prominence has long made them important regional landmarks, dating back at least to 1788, when Jose Mares opened a trail from San Antonio to Santa Fe; thereafter, the mountains were waymarkers "for every westward expedition and a rendezvous for buffalo hunters." They were also cited by the surveying party of Randolph B. Marcy in 1849.
Although paved roads do not lead directly to the mountains, they are accessible via paved Farm to Market Roads 2211 and 610 and dirt county roads; a steep dirt road leads up to the summit of each of the pair of mountains. A prominent radio tower stands on the eastern summit.
At one time, Comanche leader Quanah Parker and his band lived on or near the mountains, and according to one source, the mountains were once a sacred place to the Comanches.
Town of Double Mountain.
A town of Double Mountain once existed a few miles north of the hills. Established in 1886, the community featured a post office, sheriff, schoolhouse, and Methodist and Baptist churches for several years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but had become a ghost town by the 1980s.

Learning and skills in England

In England, learning and skills refers typically to post-compulsory education and training, provided by further education and sixth form colleges, schools with sixth forms, local authority and adult education institutions, private and voluntary sector providers, offender learning, and workplace learning including Apprenticeships and other employer-facing initiatives. 
The learning and skills sector is vital to increasing productivity, economic competitiveness and sustainable employment in the UK
Learning and skills also refers to the actual learning which learners undertake and the skills they acquire.
Responsibility for learning and skills.
Funding of provision is subject to frequent change. The former Learning and Skills Council (2001-2010) was replaced by the Skills Funding Agency (still operating April 2012)and the Young People's Learning Agency (now closed and incorporated into the Education Funding Agency from April 2012). It is wise to consult government department websites - Department for Education, and DBIS, to get an up to date view.
Providers of learning and skills.
The learning and skills sector is made up of a number of different training providers, such as colleges and private organisations, and also includes workplace learning and offender learning.
Further education colleges and adult education institutes.
Further education colleges can vary considerably in size, and in the subjects and facilities they offer. Many are ‘general’ FE colleges and offer courses in a wide range of subject areas.

<doc id="18862338" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18862338" title="Planet Poker">
Planet Poker

Planet Poker was the first real-money cardroom for playing online poker, opening in 1998.
History.
The pioneer.
Without an existing model to follow, Planet Poker founder Randy Blumer was entering uncharted territory. During the initial launch and testing phases in late 1997, Planet Poker started to build a customer base, placing advertisements in "Card Player" magazine. By the time the first real money table opened, a handful of customers were ready to play. 
On 1 January 1998, after several months of planning and preparation, Planet Poker dealt a $3–$6 game of Texas hold 'em poker. As days turned to weeks, the small group of customers began to grow and the poker games started to run longer. Sometime in February 1998, a game continued through the night with enough players rotating in and out the game that it carried all the way through to the next evening. It was one of the major milestones in the history of online poker.
By the early summer of 1998, Planet Poker had amassed a following, and games regularly ran around the clock. Game selection was increased to meet the demand of the steady stream of new players. For the remainder of 1998, Planet Poker continued to grow, but as with any rapidly growing business, new challenges emerged. Credit card payments were accepted to allow customers an easy means of getting money into and out of the game. However, by far the largest challenges were technical in nature, and problems often required days to fully resolve. The Internet itself was in its infancy and was often plagued by geographic outages and poor connections. Nearly all the players were using dial-up Internet access. 
Technical problems were further compounded by the growing demand for more features and enhancements. The site lacked many of the necessary playing features, and the backend capability did not adequately manage the cardroom. Planet Poker assembled an in-house team to address the backend issues, but the playing features were more of a challenge.
Implementation of new playing features required changes to the core game software and Planet had to rely on the third-party supplier to make them. Recognizing the importance of getting these features in place, agreements were renegotiated with the supplier that provided the software provider with generous payments to implement needed changes. However, the software supplier had mixed business interests, and the pace of developing the changes was less than required to keep pace with the evolving online poker industry. Maintaining a relationship with the software supplier soon became a time consuming effort that diverted resources from other aspects of the business.
Competition arrives.
Then in 1999, without advance notice, a new cardroom called Paradise Poker emerged. Coincidentally, in the week that Paradise Poker launched, Planet Poker was plagued with technical problems that led to several days of downtime. By the time Planet Poker recovered, Paradise had established a foothold, and the online poker industry got its first taste of competition. 
Almost overnight, Paradise Poker attained instant success, and its customer base soon surpassed Planet’s, despite Planet’s growth continuing at a record pace. In a few short months, the number of concurrent players at peak times grew from 400 at Planet to 1500 at Planet and Paradise combined, with Paradise emerging as the clear industry leader with superior features and improved stability.
Planet staff recognized that it would take time to catch up to Paradise Poker on the technical front. Planet focused on providing the highest level of integrity and security for their customers. Mike Caro was engaged as one of the most respected, recognized names in poker to guide and represent Planet Poker’s operation. The "mad genius of poker" provided instant credibility to Planet Poker and the online poker industry as a whole. Roy Cooke also joined the Planet team, as the cardroom manager.
By early 2000, the capability gap between Planet Poker and Paradise Poker was continuing to widen. A new company, Acekicker.com Holdings Inc., was formed to develop software for Planet Poker. Based on Planet’s operational experience, a set of requirements was formulated that would allow Planet to re-capture the number one position in the industry. AceKicker’s initial efforts were plagued by issues with an offshore software developer, and the development of the software was delayed. By the time the issues were resolved and the development was moved to Canada, there were several new well-funded entrants in the online poker industry, and Planet was chasing a moving target. Most of Planet’s financial resources were diverted to software development. Planet now lacked the funding and expertise to compete with the industry giants in marketing. Planet would not launch its new system until 2004 and by this time, Party Poker dominated the industry, with a handful of rivals clustered near second place.
From 2002 onward, Planet Poker remained a steady fixture as the industry evolved. Many new poker rooms came and went. There was continuing explosive growth in the number of online poker players, but while Planet still retained a loyal customer base, it could never seem to increase its critical mass to a point where it could compete with the larger sites. Planet Poker would peak at around 1200 players, while other cardrooms were setting new daily records that would eventually exceed 100,000. Planet Poker continued on as a small cardroom, with its friendly atmosphere as the primary attraction.
Legislation.
In September 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in the U.S. changed the legal landscape for the industry. By the time the act was passed, Planet Poker had registered over three quarters of a million customers. 
In response to the UIGEA, however, Planet Poker suspended real money operations in March 2007. Planet Poker continues to operate as a free play (subscription based) poker site.

<doc id="18862350" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18862350" title="Timeline of Ulster Defence Regiment operations">
Timeline of Ulster Defence Regiment operations

Most Ulster Defence Regiment operations were to assist the police by guarding key installations in Northern Ireland, and provide patrols and vehicle checkpoints on public roads to hamper the activities of paramilitary groups.
The Ulster Defence Regiment was not permitted to engage in "crowd control" situations, due to the fear of pitting neighbour against neighbour. According to Chris Ryder in "The UDR - An Instrument of Peace", this became more acute as Catholic membership dwindled in the regiment and the use of the predominantly Protestant force against Catholic protesters would have been singularly provocative. Additionally, Ryder notes, the regiment was forbidden from patrolling "hard-line Catholic" urban areas such as the Bogside in Derry or parts of west Belfast.
As the force was initially predominantly part-time, the presence of its members was mostly felt during evenings and weekends. It was expected to answer to general call-outs and was mobilised on a permanent basis on several occasions such as Operation Motorman to provide manpower assistance to the police and regular army, and during the bombing campaign against Belfast city centre in January 1992, when three battalions were called to full-time active duties. Full-time call-outs were restricted, however, because problems arose with part-time soldiers when they were taken from their normal day-jobs. During the Ulster Workers' Council strike in 1974 the entire regiment was mobilised full-time for five days. Many employers complained to local and provincial UDR commanders about being deprived of the services of their employees for so long and in some cases refused to pay wages. Despite negotiations with the Northern Ireland Office, no compensation package for part-time soldiers was ever agreed and on call-out they were reduced to the pay of a regular Army soldier of equivalent rank.
As the regiment evolved into a predominantly full-time unit and with Ulsterisation it assumed more duties previously assigned to the police or regular Army in support of Operation Banner. By 1980, the full-time element had narrowly become the majority and the regiment's role had expanded to include tactical responsibility for 85% of Northern Ireland.
Because UDR soldiers lived within their own communities and not in barracks they were also able to provide intelligence to the Army, particularly part-time soldiers whose day jobs often took them into places which were hostile to police or army patrols. Tim Ripley and Mike Chappell, in "Security Forces in Northern Ireland 1969-92"', note this also made many soldiers vulnerable to attack: 155 of all UDR personnel killed by the IRA were killed off duty, a further 61 after leaving the regiment.
A major advantage of the large numbers available to the UDR in each battalion area was the ability to seal off entire towns or rural areas through vehicle checkpoints (VCPs), thereby preventing the movement of weapons and explosives. This led to the discovery of many weapons and bombs which had been intended for use in the destruction of property in town centres. At VCPs patrols would use the Vengeful system to check the registration numbers of civilian vehicles and record the movements of these and their occupants.
Listed below is a chronology of Ulster Defence Regiment operations:
1975.
"The Provisional IRA ceasefire was in operation throughout most of the year"
1976.
"Ulsterisation and Operations Platoons were introduced in 1976"
In the first six months of the year, joint operations by 3 and 10 UDR recover 5,000 rounds of ammunition and 3,000 lb of explosives belonging to loyalist paramilitaries on the Ards Peninsula.
1977.

Electoral district of Kalamunda

Kalamunda is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
Politically, the district is a marginal one. Based on the results of the 2005 state election, the seat was created with a Liberal Party majority of 50.2% to 49.8% versus the Labor Party.
History.
Kalamunda was first created for the 1974 election and abolished ahead of the 1989 election. Despite the name, the seat was actually centred on Greenmount in the eastern Hills region, and Kalamunda itself was split between the Kalamunda seat and the neighbouring Darling Range. Despite being within the metropolitan area of Perth, it was regarded as non-metropolitan, and was assigned to the West Province in the Legislative Council. As a result, it had about half the enrolment of the neighbouring seat of Helena. Under the "Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987", which reclassified "metropolitan" in the Electoral Act 1907 to include all land within the Metropolitan Region Scheme boundaries and at the same time increased overall metropolitan representation, Kalamunda was merged with Darling Range, and its member, Ian Thompson, won Darling Range on the new boundaries in 1989.
A new seat named Kalamunda was created for the 2008 state election when the number of metropolitan seats was increased in accordance with the new one vote one value legislation. The new district was drawn largely from Darling Range, but also from parts of Kenwick, Midland and Swan Hills.
Geography.
Kalamunda is based in the eastern suburbs of Perth. Its boundaries cover two distinct areas. The northern area, centred on Kalamunda, includes Gooseberry Hill, Lesmurdie, Paulls Valley, Piesse Brook and Walliston along with tiny sections of Maida Vale and Forrestfield and all populated portions of Bickley and Carmel. A narrow section extends north to include all of Darlington. In the south, it includes much of Canning Mills, Martin and Orange Grove and the major residential portion of Maddington, excluding its commercial and industrial areas.
The earlier incarnation included the districts of Boya, Darlington, Glen Forrest, Gooseberry Hill, Greenmount, Piesse Brook and Paulls Valley, as well as northern sections of the suburb of Kalamunda including its town centre.

Sean Dunphy (footballer)

Sean Dunphy (born 5 November 1970) is a former English footballer. He played as a centre-back and made 70 appearances in the Football League, principally for Lincoln City.
League career.
Dunphy began his career with Barnsley before following manager Allan Clarke to Lincoln City in the summer of 1990. However, disaster struck Dunphy in a pre-season match against Leeds United when he was stretchered off with a serious knee injury. The injury would keep him out of action for almost two years and it was not until April 1992 that Dunphy made his debut for Lincoln. The 1992–1993 season saw Dunphy establish a regular berth at the heart of Lincoln's defence and he would go on to make 31 league appearances that season. The 1993–1994 season saw Lincoln, under the stewardship of new manager Keith Alexander, make a sticky start collecting just four points from the first six league games. Following the 1–0 home defeat to Mansfield Town on 11 September 1993 Alexander transfer listed most of his squad and dropped a number of players, Dunphy amongst them, from the team. Dunphy soon linked up with Doncaster Rovers on loan, making a solitary league appearance against Bury on 16 October 1993 before returning to Sincil Bank. He returned to the team towards the end of the season but found himself loaned out to Scarborough at the commencement of the 1994–1995 season.
Non-league career.
In February 1995 he joined the then GM Vauxhall Conference side Kettering Town where he made a single appearance before dropping down to the Unibond League and joining Gainsborough Trinity. After just two games he stepped back up to GM Vauxhall Conference joining Halifax Town where he made his debut in the 0–0 away draw with Bath City on 27 March 1995. He was substituted at half-time in his next, and final, appearance and returned to Gainsborough Trinity for the remainder of the season. 
At the beginning of the 1996–1997 season, Dunphy joined Stocksbridge Park Steels and enjoyed the most productive period of his career. He made a total of 139 appearances for the Steels, scoring seven times before moving on to Hallam.
In February 2008 he was appointed club coach at hometown club Maltby Main working under the newly appointed manager Robbie Barron. Barron succeeded in keeping Main in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division but resigned at the end of the season due to work commitments and it remains to be seen whether Dunphy followed him.

<doc id="18862400" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18862400" title="Moulton Paddocks">
Moulton Paddocks

Moulton Paddocks was a racing stable in Newmarket, Suffolk, UK operated by Godolphin Racing. It is said to have the capacity for around 100 horses, many of which are of extremely high quality.
History of the Moulton Paddocks estate, Suffolk.
At one time Moulton Paddocks was known as Fidget Hall, a possible reference to Sam Chifney's Fidget Farm of 70 acres situated at the extremity of the Bury Hill gallop. He named the farm after the sire of a horse he had ridden when young. Owners of Moulton Paddocks have since included: Sir Robert Pigot, Lord William Cansfield Gerard, George Alexander Baird, Sir Ernest Cassel and Solly Joel.
In 1841 Fidget Hall was 64 acres and owned by George Samuel Ford, known in the racing fraternity as "Lawyer Ford". He was a financier to gentlemen and noblemen in distress, and one of the creditors of the bankrupt trainer Will Chifney - brother of Sam. Ford was passionately fond of racing: his horse "Poison" won the 1843 Oaks and "Guaracha" won the Coronation Stakes in 1846. 
In 1842 William Webber, surgeon and founder of the Norwich Royal Free Hospital for Incurables, owned Fidget Hall. He carried out extensive building work on the property and increased the size of the estate to 313 acres. During this period the name changed from Fidget Hall to Moulton Paddocks. Webber bred race horses and in 1842 the stallion "Erymus" stood at Moulton Paddocks but died there in January 1847. In 1849 Sir Robert Pigot leased the property from Webber; two of his children were later born there in 1850 and 1852.
Mr Willingham Franklin purchased Moulton Paddocks from Webber in 1857, but sold in 1859 (shortly before he died). Franklin, described as “barrister not in practice”, was the only son of Sir Willingham Franklin (a judge in the supreme court at Madras) and nephew of explorer John Franklin. In 1861 the property was occupied by Captain Astley Paston Cooper, who inherited a baronetcy in 1866 when his father -Sir Astley Paston Cooper, 2nd Baronet - died.
From the early 1860's, Moulton Paddocks belonged to the Fryer family. They more than doubled the area of land and improved the house before selling to Lord Gerart in 1885. In 1889 Gerard leased the great horse "Ormonde" from the Duke of Westminster to stand at Moulton Paddocks. However, the horse was ill and the fertility of the animal so poor that only one foal resulted.
Gerard sold Moulton Paddocks to George Alexander Baird in 1892 who moved his stud from Kentford. It was thought that he would also move his Bedford Lodge operation to Moulton Paddocks, but he died the following year. Lillie Langtry the actress was in a relationship with Baird at this time and she would have stayed at Moulton Paddocks. Langtry had a small number of horses in training at Baird's stable and after his death moved them to Kentford - about 3 miles from Moulton Paddocks. She gradually became more interested in racing, purchased additional horses, and in 1895 bought a house in Kentford called Regal Lodge.
Baird's executors let Moulton Paddocks on short leases until they found a buyer, and in 1899 Ernest Cassel took ownership. Cassel had become financial adviser to the Prince of Wales in 1897 and the two developed a close friendship. In 1892, the Prince had been persuaded by his racing manager to move his horses from John Porter’s stables at Kingsclere to those of Richard Marsh at Newmarket. This new arrangement was convenient for the royal residence of Sandringham House and when Cassel purchased Moulton Paddocks the Prince (and later when he was Edward VII) became a frequent visitor. By the time of Cassel's death in 1921, the Moulton Paddocks estate had been expanded to 1300 acres.
Solly Joel became the owner in 1922 after the death of Cassel. He and his brother Jack had a long running rivalry on the turf as owners, with Jack having the greater success over the years. When Solly purchased Moulton Paddocks, he already had a well established stud at Maiden Erlegh near Reading, Berkshire. He used the stables at Moulton Paddocks to train under Walter Earl. When Joel died in 1831 the estate passed to his son Dudley. After his death in 1941 the house fell into dis-repair and by 1950 had been demolished.

Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary (Winona, Minnesota)

Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM) Seminary is a Roman Catholic, Diocesan-sponsored college seminary in Winona, Minnesota. Located adjacent to the campus of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, IHM Seminary has provided college-level seminary training since 1948. Seminarians from various dioceses across the United States live at IHM Seminary and take classes from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota. While the current bishop of the Diocese of Winona, the Most Reverend John M. Quinn, is the true head of the seminary and Chairman of the Board, the rector of the seminary oversees the day-to-day activities at the seminary. 
History.
The early years.
In 1912, Bishop Patrick Richard Heffron of the Diocese of Winona, founded Saint Mary's College (now Saint Mary's University) on the terraced heights of Winona's Gilmore valley. Bishop Heffron founded the all-male college just two years after being ordained the second bishop of the Winona Diocese. Saint Mary's was founded for the higher education of all young men, but especially for the formation and education of future priests.
By 1933, Saint Mary's College was transferred from the Diocese of Winona to the Brothers of the Christian Schools (De La Salle Christian Brothers). This transfer, however, was not completed for ten years due to the fact that the Holy See viewed Saint Mary's as an approved seminary. The transfer was begun was Bishop Francis Martin Kelly and completed by Coadjutor Bishop Leo Binz.
By 1947, five years after the completed transfer of Saint Mary's to the Christian Brothers, Bishop Binz requested advice from Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, the Apostolic Delegate at the time, about beginning a diocesan seminary in Winona where seminarians would live at Saint Mary's and take classes therein. By the fall of 1947, a core group of students became the first seminary students at Saint Mary's and were taught by Fathers George Henry Speltz and William Magee, both priests of the Diocese of Winona.
The founding years.
Just a year after Bishop Binz's request for advice from Archbishop Cicognani, Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM) Seminary was founded and canonically erected on July 16, 1948. Father George Speltz, one of the priest-faculty members of Saint Mary's College, was named the first rector. During its founding year, IHM had an enrollment of twenty-five students. The following year, 1949, the first seminarian, Paul Halloran, graduated from IHM Seminary.
In 1950, Bishop Edward Aloysius Fitzgerald became the fourth bishop of Winona and completed the architectural plans for a new seminary dormitory. The Christian Brothers deeded a plot of land from Saint Mary's College to the Diocese of Winona for the construction of the seminary building. Ground was broken by Bishop Fitzgerald on May 1, 1950 and the cornerstone was laid by Archbishop Binz, then the coadjutor of Dubuque.
In the spring of 1951, just four years after the request of advice from Archbishop Cicognani, the first students moved into the new seminary building, Kelly Hall, named in honor of Bishop Francis Kelly, the third bishop of Winona and the bishop who began the process of transferring Saint Mary's College to the Christian Brothers. The altar in the Saint John Vianney Chapel of Kelly Hall was dedicated on April 22, 1951 by Bishop Fitzgerald and on March 2, 1952, the first Solemn Mass was celebrated by Father Speltz in the chapel.
The continuing years.
Shortly after the completion of Kelly Hall, construction on Mary Hall (nowadays referred to as the "Convent" or "Guesthouse") was undertaken. May Hall was completed in 1954 and became the home for the first Dominican Sisters who undertook domestic duties at the seminary.
Ten years after the completion of Kelly Hall, Saint Leo the Great Hall was completed in 1961. It was blessed by the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, on March 25, 1962. Archbishop Leo Binz, in whose honor the building was named, was present during the blessing ceremony. By 1974, the Fitzgerald Retreat Center would be housed in Leo Hall. The Retreat Center, named in honor of Bishop Fitzgerald, would be the home of diocesan priest retreats.
In 1963, Father Speltz was named Auxiliary Bishop of Winona and Bishop Fitzgerald named Monsignor Joseph McGinnis as the second rector of IHM Seminary. Shortly thereafter, during the 1966-1967 academic year, the highest total enrollment was reached at ninety seminarians studying at IHM Seminary. The third rector, Monsignor Roy Literski, was appointed by Bishop Fitzgerald in 1968.
1970 brought some changes to IHM Seminary. Post-conciliar reform lead to the remodeling of the Saint John Vianney Chapel. Bishop Loras Watters, fifth bishop of Winona, named Father Robert Brom as rector. Other changes occurred with the religious sisters as the Dominicans returned to Switzerland and the School Sisters of Notre Dame took over domestic duties.
The post–silver anniversary years.
1973 brought the twenty-fifth anniversary of IHM Seminary; an alumni gathering was held in June of that year. During 1986-1987, IHM Seminary was studied under the Papal Seminary Study and the chapel was renovated again in 1986. In June 1988, a fortieth anniversary alumni reunion was held at IHM. Just a year later, in 1989, the IHM Seminary Endowment fund was created.
Beginning in 1994, IHM Seminary and the priest faculty and staff began all sacramental ministry at Saint Mary's College, which was renamed a University in 1995. The second Papal Seminary Study was undertaken in the fall of 2005 and minor renovations of Kelly Hall were completed throughout 2002-2008. In August 2006, ground was broken on the Pope John Paul II Memorial Garden, located in front of Kelly Hall. The garden, completed by the summer of 2007 and is formed in the shape of the Celtic cross that is located atop of the bell tower of IHM Seminary. Located within the garden are the Stations of the Cross by American artist Lynn Kircher, a fountain, and an outdoor grotto with altar for outdoor Masses.
Pope John Paul II Memorial Garden.
Located in the front lawn of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary, the Pope John II Memorial Garden is a multi-acre garden which offers a serene and reflective area for seminarians and the general public. After Pope John Paul II's death in 2005, the rector at that time, was inspired to design a garden to honor the late pontiff. As the Stations of the Cross were one of the pontiff's favorite devotions, it was decided that the garden would center around the Stations of the Cross. Ground was broken for the garden in August 2006 and three months later the Stations themselves were installed. A year after groundbreaking, in August 2007, the centerpiece of the garden, the sculpture of the burial shroud of Christ was installed.
Purpose.
The purpose of the Pope John II Memorial Garden is simply to provide additional prayer and reflection areas for seminarians discerning a call to the priesthood and for the general public for devotional use. The Stations of the Cross can be prayed at one's leisure, taking time for prayer and meditation. Also, because of the outdoor grotto and altar, the Holy Mass can be celebrated outside on occasion.
Stations of the Cross.
Throughout the main part of the Pope John II Memorial Garden, the Stations of the Cross form the outline of a Celtic cross, the same cross that is located on the top of the seminary bell tower. In addition to the traditional fourteen stations, two extra stations were added off the main path. These two extra stations are (1) Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and (2) the Resurrection of Jesus. The Stations were designed by American artist Lynn Kircher.
Grotto and altar.
Set in local limestone, the outdoor grotto and altar provides a special area for outdoor gatherings and space for the Holy Mass. The area is dedicated to the Blessed Mother, with statues of Our Lady and Our Lady of Guadalupe, and provides space for votive candles and private prayer.
Shroud of Christ.
Located in the center of the garden is the empty tomb of Christ, with a life-sized solid bronze burial shroud, designed by Lynn Kircher. Located throughout the center of the garden, cast bronze birds perch on the outdoor works of art.
"New Life" water feature.
Located next to the empty tomb, a , solid limestone boulder sits in which water springs forth water representing the water of life and the redemptive gifts of the Lord. As the waters flows naturally down the boulder, the sounds of trickling water can be heard throughout the garden. The boulder also reminds visitors of the water God provided for the ancient Israelites brought forth from the rock by Moses.
About the artist.
Lynn Kircher is a full-time artist living in Jaroso, Colorado. An art teacher for nearly twenty years, Kircher pioneered programs and processes which live on through his students. In 1997, he turned his passion for sculpture and became a full-time artist. His art has been accepted into the Vatican Collection and he was interviewed by Pope John Paul II in 2002.
Seminary library.
As all students at Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary are full students at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, all students are welcome to use the Fitzgerald Library (named in honor of Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, fourth bishop of Winona) which has a collection of over 400,000 books, including many philosophical, theological, and canon law titles. At IHM Seminary, the Loras Library is open to all seminarians. The Loras Library is named in honor of the late Bishop Loras J. Watters, fifth bishop of Winona. The Loras Library, located on the first floor of Kelly Hall, houses a small collection of books, mainly philosophical and theological titles as well as a number of books on spirituality, scripture, and hagiography.
Program of study.
The majority of students who study at Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary do not come to IHM in possession of a bachelor's degree. Because of this fact, students study at IHM and Saint Mary's University to earn a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. The majority of these students major in a specially-designed philosophy major. Other courses in theology and Latin are also required. Students are free to double major or minor in fields of their choice so long as all the philosophical requirements are met. These students usually remain at IHM for four years, or until graduation and philosophy requirements are met (for transfer students).
Students who already possess a bachelor's degree (e.g., BA or BSc) are considered "pre-theology" students. Pre-Theology students are able to receive a B.A. in Philosophy from St. Mary's University of Minnesota under the Program of Priestly Formation.
Mission statement.
Flowing from its responsibility to build God's Kingdom on Earth, Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary (IHMS) nurtures and heartens a man's calling from God to the ministerial priesthood. IHMS strengthens and deepens the seminarian's personal commitment to Jesus Christ with the highest quality programs of spiritual, intellectual, pastoral, and human formation. While supporting and encouraging the development of each man's natural gifts, IHMS strives to help the men discern and answer God's call with hearts on fire!
Vision statement.
Always focused on the mission of God's Church, Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary is a beacon of Christ Himself, inviting men to follow His call, preparing a new generation of priests for leadership and service.
Seminary motto.
The official motto of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary is the Latin text of Psalm 133:1: "Ecce quam bonum et quam iucundum habitare fratres, fratres in unum" (Behold how good and how splendid where brothers dwell as one.) The Latin motto is often shortened to simply "Ecce Quam Bonum" (Behold How Good) as seen on the seminary crest, which was designed by the ninth rector of IHM Seminary, Father James Steffes. The English translation of Psalm 133:1 is not used for the motto.
Apostolic visitations.
Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary was visited by Vatican-appointed representatives during the Papal Seminary Study in February 1986 under the chairmanship of Bishop William H. Keeler of Harrisburg. The next apostolic visitation occurred in November 2005 when all U.S. seminaries and houses of formation were visited by Vatican-appointed representatives.

Bro Myrddin Welsh Comprehensive School

Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Myrddin () is a Welsh-medium school in Carmarthenshire, Wales. It is situated near the village of Croesyceiliog, about 2 km south of Carmarthen. Myrddin, the Welsh name of the legendary figure Merlin, is traditionally associated with the town of Carmarthen (Caerfyrddin: Myrddin's fort), and Bro Myrddin means "Myrddin's country (or vale)". 
All of the school's students speak Welsh, and most will have received a Welsh-language primary education, although many come from homes where Welsh is not the first language. 
History.
The School was founded in 1978, on the premises of the former Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Carmarthen. In 1996 the school was moved to its current purpose built campus at Croesyceiliog. Its first Pennaeth (Headteacher) was Mr Gareth Evans, who was succeeded upon his retirement in 1997 by Mr Eric Jones, and then by current head, Mr Dorian Williams, in 2006.
Ethos.
The school's motto is 'Heb Ddysg Heb Ddeall', which translates as 'Without learning there is no understanding'. The school colours are lilac and black.
Houses.
The school has four houses (which are referred to using the Welsh 'Llys'): Hengwrt (house colour: green), Hergest (red), Llwydiarth (black) and Peniarth (blue). The four houses annually compete in the school's own version of the Eisteddfod, in which there is a day of singing, playing instruments, reciting and numerous other events – held on the nearest Friday to St David’s day, and a sports day held in the summer term.

Satellite Soul

Satellite Soul is a critically acclaimed alternative country/folk rock band from Kansas. Their sound has developed and matured over the years from jangly roots rock to a hard cutting Alt-Country sound. They were formed in 1996 while living in Manhattan, Kansas and played extensively in the Midwest as an independent band. The band toured extensively nationwide, playing with many of the top acts in Christian music. They shared billing with artists such as the Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, Skillet, Smalltown Poets, Chris Tomlin, Steven Curtis Chapman, and others. They toured extensively with Big Tent Revival, Jennifer Knapp, Eli, Clear, Jason Ingram Band, Mitch McVicker, and others.
In 1997 they signed with Ardent Forefront Records and made their National debut with their self-titled first release. The band's first single, "Say I Am," was top three on the CHR charts and began a string of top ten radio hits that lasted for several years. Follow up hit "Fool," broke the top ten later that year and the music video "Either Way" was number one for several weeks on the Video Charts (ZooTV). "Wash" was another top ten favorite and also charted on Rock Radio. "Equal To the Fall" was the band's only Adult Contemporary hit.
The follow-up record, "Great Big Universe," had similar radio success. The record's highest charting single was "Revive Me," which topped out at number 5. Other top ten hits were "Great Big Universe" and "Broken Again." The record was critically acclaimed but never achieved the sales that Ardent Forefront had hoped for.
The third record was a live worship album recorded at New Earth Coffeehouse in Kansas City.
After a long hiatus the band reformed to record a full on alt-country record entitled "Straight Back to Kansas." Available only online through CDBaby and digital download, the record had modest indie success.
Then their fifth album was released independently in 2006.
As of mid-2009, the band was putting the finishing touches on another worship album, this time a solo project for front-man Tim Suttle, but all of the same players from the band did the record. All of the proceeds from the record will be donated to World Vision.

Cog Hill Golf &amp; Country Club

Cog Hill Golf & Country Club is a public golf course and country club located southwest of Chicago, in unincorporated Cook County near the village of Lemont, Illinois. Cog Hill hosted the PGA Tour's BMW Championship from 2009 to 2011 on its championship course Dubsdread.
History.
Three brothers moved to the Chicago area in 1920. John W., Martin J., and Bert Coghill bought the McLaughlin farm on the east side of Lemont Illinois in 1926 to build a golf club. They then hired David McIntosh, who owned Oak Hills, to build them a golf course. Cog Hill Course #1 opened on the Fourth of July weekend in 1927. Reservations for golf were taken at the Boston Store, which, at that time, was one of the downtown Chicago's leading department stores. The Chicago and Joliet Electric Railway ran from Chicago to Lemont giving golfers easy access for 25 cents. The club expanded in 1929 when the three brothers bought another from the Reed Family on the east side of Parker Road. Course #2 was designed and built by David McIntosh and Bert Coghill. It was opened in the fall of 1929, within days of Wall Street Crash of 1929. Even during the tough twelve years of the depression Cog Hill was able to prosper. In 1951, Joe Jemsek bought Cog Hill. Course #3 was added in 1963 and Dubsdread was completed in 1964. The Western Golf Association awarded the Western Open to Cog Hill in 1991. It changed its name to the BMW Championship in 2007. Tiger Woods shot a course record 9 under 62 on Dubsdread in 2009.
Tournaments.
Major championships held at Cog Hill's Dubsdread course.
Courses.
Course #1 Blue.
Course #1 is the oldest course at Cog Hill. The Blue course was designed and built in 1927. Green Fees are $45 on weekends and $37 on weekdays including a golf cart.
Course #2 Ravines.
Course #2 Ravines was designed and built in 1929. Ravines was adjusted for to host the 1997 United States Amateur Championship. Green Fees are $73 with cart.
Course #3 Red.
In 1963 Cog Hill added Course #3. Green Fees are $61 on weekends and $53 on weekdays including a golf cart.
Course #4 Dubsdread.
Dubsdread was designed and built by Joseph L. Lee/Dick Wilson in 1964. From September 2007 to September 2008, renowned golf course architect Rees Jones oversaw a renovation project to update the challenges envisioned in the original design of Dick Wilson and Joe Lee. Golfers now face 18 new greens with Sub-Air Systems, redesigned and repositioned sand bunkers, a risk-reward pond on Hole 7, additional tee options, and a 497-yd. par 4 finishing hole featuring a green moved perilously close to the nearby pond.
Green fee to play Dubsdread is $155.

1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was the longest on record, with both an unusually early start and unusually late ending. Most activity was from November through February. According to the Météo-France office (MFR) at Réunion, there were 21 tropical disturbances, 14 of which intensified into tropical depressions. There were 12 named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding sequentially until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also warned on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10–minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season.
In August, a tropical depression developed in the south-west Indian Ocean for the first time 27 years, and a month later, a rare September tropical disturbance formed. The first named storm, Antoinette, was the first of several to originate in the neighboring Australian basin, or east of 90º E; the subsequent two named storms also formed in the Australian region. In early December, Cyclone Daniella likely developed out of the remnants of previous Tropical Storm Chantelle. After reaching peak 10–minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), Daniella weakened and passed just southwest of Mauritius; there, the storm left heavy crop damage and indirectly caused three deaths. In early January, Tropical Storm Fabriola was the first in a succession of three storms to move over Madagascar. The next – Cyclone Gretelle – killed 152 people when it struck southeastern Madagascar. Between January and February, Cyclone Pancho-Helinda lasted about 20 days between both the Australian and south-west Indian basins. Also in February, Tropical Storm Josie killed 36 people in western Madagascar after causing severe flooding. The final named storm was Tropical Storm Lisette, which dissipated on March 3 after striking Mozambique, killing three people. Despite the early end to the named storms, there were two additional disturbances, one of which became the first July tropical depression in 25 years.
__TOC__
Season summary.
During the season, the Météo-France office (MFR) based on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin, as part of its role as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The agency estimated intensities via the Dvorak technique, which uses images from two satellites by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On certain days, the satellites had limited coverage in the eastern portion of the region, which limited warning capability. At the time, the MFR issued warnings on tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean from the coast of Africa to 90º E, south of the equator. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center – a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force – also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the region. Wind estimates from Météo-France and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10 minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1 minute. 10 minute winds are about 1.14 times the amount of 1 minute winds.
The MFR named storms from a sequential list provided by the nation of Seychelles, beginning with Antoinette. In addition to the named storms in the year, the list included Maryse, Nelda, Ocline, Phyllis, Rolina, Sheryl, Thelma, Venyda, Wiltina, and Yolette.
The season was active, about 50% above normal, and was the fourth consecutive above-normal season. There was a total of 100 days on which disturbances, depressions, storms, or cyclones were active, compared to the average of 68. There were 12 named storms, above the normal of 9. Five intensified into tropical cyclones, also above the normal of 4. The season was the longest on record, with the first depression in August 1996 and the final depression in July 1997. Despite the long season, there was minimal activity from March to May, which usually represents about 25% of total activity. In addition, February was relatively quiet despite being the climatological peak. Majority of the storms developed in the northeast portion of the basin, and the storms took a variety of tracks during their durations.
Storms.
Severe Tropical Storm Antoinette.
In the middle of October, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) was active over the northeast portion of the basin and into the adjacent Australian region, spawning a low pressure area on October 15 northwest of the Cocos Islands. With a large ridge to the south, the system tracked southwestward, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean as a tropical depression on October 17. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as Tropical Cyclone 4S. On October 18, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Antoinette after developing a well-defined central dense overcast, and began turning more to the west-southwest. That day, Antoinette strengthened to a peak intensity of just below tropical cyclone status, or with 10–minute winds just below 120 km/h (75 mph). Around that time, the storm developed an eye feature, but that quickly dissipated. Antoinette began weakening steadily on October 20 due to increasing wind shear, and by that time it was moving quickly westward. After the circulation became largely devoid of deep convection, the storm weakened into a tropical depression on October 21. The next day, Antoinette passed about north of the northern tip of Madagascar, and dissipated on October 24 in the Mozambique Channel.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Melanie-Bellamine.
In late October, the ITCZ developed a persistent area of convection west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October 28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to persistent wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October 31 to the north of the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November 1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the ridged moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November 3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone status, and the next day reached peak 10–minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph); this made it an intense tropical cyclone.
After reaching peak winds, Bellamine slowed its motion on November 4 while moving between two high pressure areas, and weakened slightly. After another ridge built, the cyclone resumed a steady west-southwest track, although its 10–minute winds decreased to 140 km/h (85 mph) by November 6. That day, Bellamine began restrengthening as the eye became increasingly well-defined, in diameter. On November 7, the storm re-attained intense tropical cyclone status, as well as its previous peak intensity according to MFR. This was a rare occurrence of an early November storm becoming an intense tropical cyclone on two occasions. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). A strong approaching trough turned Bellamine to the southeast on November 8 and incurred rapid weakening due to wind shear. After the trough passed the cyclone, Bellamine turned back to the southwest on November 10 as a weakening tropical depression. Two days later, the circulation dissipated without having affected land.
Severe Tropical Storm Chantelle.
Similar to previous storms Antoinette and Bellamine, Tropical Storm Chantelle originated from the ITCZ in the Australian region. On November 23, the MFR began tracking the system as a tropical disturbance off the west coast of Sumatra. The system fluctuated in intensity while moving westward, entering the south-west Indian as a tropical depression on November 24. Around that time, the JTWC had begun classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 7S. On November 26, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantelle, and the convection continued to organize despite the presence of wind shear. That day, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). On November 27, the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). An approaching trough imparted significant weakening, and Chantelle weakened to tropical depression status 18 hours after it was at peak intensity. A ridge behind the trough steered the weakening system to the northwest, causing Chantelle to reach the low latitude of 5º S. Widespread cloudiness made it difficult for MFR to continue tracking the circulation, and the agency issued the final advisory on November 30 northwest of Diego Garcia. The JTWC continued tracking the storm for several more days, and the remnants of Chantelle likely contributed to the formation of the subsequent Tropical Cyclone Daniella.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Daniella.
After the previous Tropical Storm Chantelle lost its circulation near Diego Garcia on November 30, residual convection persisted and moved to the southwest due to a large ridge. A new tropical disturbance developed on December 2 after wind shear diminished. Because the remnants took longer than 48 hours to redevelop, the MFR policy at the time was to treat the disturbance as a new system. On December 3, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Daniella, and an eye began to form the next day, indicative of further strengthening. The MFR upgraded Daniella to tropical cyclone status on December 5. At 1800 UTC that day, both the MFR and JTWC estimated peak winds; the former agency estimated 10–minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), making Daniella an intense tropical cyclone, and the JTWC estimated 1–minute winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). Around that time, the cyclone turned to the south due to an approaching trough. The eye, previously well-defined and in diameter at its peak, gradually became less organized due to decreasing water temperatures. Daniella turned more to the southeast on December 8, bringing it between the islands of Réunion and Mauritius after weakening into a strong tropical storm. A sharp increase in wind shear removed the convection from the circulation on December 9, weakening Daniella to tropical depression status. Two days later, the circulation dissipated.
Late in its duration, Daniella passed within of Mauritius, producing wind gusts of and about of rainfall. Port Louis recorded a storm surge of during the passage. About half of the island lost power and many lost water service. Daniella also left heavy crop damage, due to the heavy rainfall. All flights were canceled during the storm's passage. Three were three indirect deaths on Mauritius, including one from a road accident and another due to electrocution. After threatening to directly strike Réunion, the cyclone passed about northeast of the island. As a result, winds were not as strong as on Mauritius.
Moderate Tropical Storm Elvina.
In early December, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection near the boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December 8, the MFR estimated that a disturbance formed just within the Australian region, which entered this basin on December 9. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December 10. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). On December 11, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). By tha time, Elvina had been moving steadily west-southwestward, although the storm slowed on December 12. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December 14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December 16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia.
Severe Tropical Storm Fabriola.
Toward the end of December, the ITCZ produced a widespread area of convection to the northeast of Madagascar. A circulation developed on January 2 about of Tromelin Island, becoming a tropical disturbance. After the convection organized more, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Fabriola on January 3. Moving southwestward, the storm strengthened somewhat, reaching 10–minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) before making landfall on the Masoala Peninsula in eastern Madagascar. Around that time, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 1–winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). Fabriola quickly weakened into a tropical depression over land and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on January 5. Due to proximity to land, the system failed to re-intensify initially despite warm waters. On January 6, while turning to the south around western Madagascar, Fabriola again attained tropical storm status. The next day, the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), and after turning to the southeast, Fabriola struck southwestern Madagascar near Morombe late on January 7. The storm again quickly weakened over land, emerging back into the Indian Ocean on January 8 as a tropical disturbance. After turning more to the south, Fabriola dissipated on January 10 when it was absorbed by a nearby trough. Fabriola spread rainfall across Madagascar, which proved beneficial for crops.
Tropical Cyclone Gretelle.
The ITCZ spawned a tropical disturbance on January 19 just west of St. Brandon, and within a day intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle. With a large ridge to the southeast, the storm moved southwestward and gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January 22. Around that time, the storm passed about northwest of Réunion. Early on January 23, the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), while JTWC estimated 1–minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) the next day. While near peak intensity, Gretelle made landfall on southeastern Madagascar near Farafangana, the first cyclone to hit the region in 41 years. Gretelle rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land, but gradually re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm in the Mozambique Channel. A trough turned the storm to the southeast on January 28, and three days later the storm dissipated south-southwest of Madagascar.
In Réunion, Gretelle dropped nearly of rainfall in the mountainous center of the island. The cyclone produced wind gusts of over at Farafangana, Madagascar, along with heavy rainfall that washed away the local meteorological station. Flooding up to was reported in some areas, which washed away several boats and forced residents to hold onto trees to survive. Many houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 80,000 people homeless. The World Food Programme estimated that Gretelle destroyed 7,000 tons of rice, 123,500 tons of cassava, and 8,000 tons of cash crops, mostly to coffee. Overall, about 200 people were killed or left missing in Madagascar, with 152 confirmed fatalities by two weeks after the storm, and damage was estimated at $50 million (1997 USD). Later, the storm caused power outages and knocked over trees in southeastern Mozambique.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Pancho-Helinda.
The long-lived Cyclone Pancho-Helinda formed on January 18 in the Australian region from the monsoon trough to the north of the Cocos Islands. For several days, the system meandered in several directions before maintaining a southwest trajectory on January 21. Around that time, the system had intensified into Tropical Cyclone Pancho, reaching 10–minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) before weakening occurred. On January 23, the cyclone entered the south-west Indian Ocean, at which time Pancho was renamed Helinda. Around that time, the storm was located between two ridges, causing the motion to become nearly stationary, and by January 24 Helinda had re-entered the Australian region. Around that time, the storm began undergoing a large loop to the east of 90º E, during which the winds decreased below tropical storm status. The influence of the monsoon trough turned the storm back to the south on January 29, and a day later a building ridge turned the storm back to the west. On January 31, Helinda again crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean as an intensifying tropical storm.
With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Helinda attained cyclone status on February 1, and the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), slightly below its estimate for the cyclone's peak winds in the Australian region. Due to a powerful ridge near Île Amsterdam, Helinda turned to the southeast on February 2, where cooler water temperatures induced weakening. Two days later, strong wind shear contributed to further weakening, and the storm deteriorated to tropical depression status. Turning back to the west, the circulation was declared dissipated by the MFR on February 7, although the JTWC continued tracking Helinda until February 14 when the system was off the northeast coast of Madagascar.
Severe Tropical Storm Iletta.
On January 23, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection to the southwest of Diego Garcia, west of Helinda and east of Gretelle. The system quickly developed an organized central dense overcast, but failed to become a tropical cyclone due to the lack of a circulation in the region. Late on January 24, the system developed into a tropical depression, by which time the Mauritius Meteorological Services had named it Iletta. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm, but further development halted on January 25. Due to a nearby trough, the storm tracked to the southeast. Iletta resumed intensification on January 26, quickly reaching peak 10–winds of 100 km/h (65 mph); the JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1–minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened Iletta, and within 24 hours the storm had decreased from peak intensity to tropical depression status. After the trough passed the storm, Iletta turned to the north under the influence of a ridge to the south, dissipating on January 30 about 305 km (190 mi) east-southeast of where it initially formed.
Tropical Cyclone Josie.
In late January into early February, the ITCZ produced areas of convection around the northern tip of Madagascar. One such convective system spawned a low pressure area between Tromelin island and Agaléga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February 5, the system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February 8 and was named Josie by the Meteorological Services of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February 9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February 11, Josie re-attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. The storm quickly intensified once moving far enough away from Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 13 and soon after reaching peak 10–winds of 140 km/h (85 mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February 16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day.
In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy rainfall and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6 m (12 ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36 people were killed due to Josie, although there were initial reports of 500 people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130 km/h (81 mph), with gusts to , before blowing the anemometer away.
Severe Tropical Storm Karlette.
An area of convection formed in the northeast portion of the basin, developing into a tropical disturbance on February 14. Despite the presence of easterly wind shear, the system slowly organized into Tropical Storm Karlette on February 16. By that time, the storm had a large and disorganized area of convection, which quickly weakened due to an increase in wind shear. Early on February 17, Karlette weakened to tropical depression status, although later that day re-attained tropical storm status after the shear diminished. The storm had been moving generally to the west-southwest due to a large ridge to the southeast. The storm's restrengthening was short-lived, as Karlette again weakened to tropical depression status on February 20, only to re-intensify into a tropical storm for the third time just six hours later. With the convection reorganizing, the storm developed an eye feature, indicative of the restrengthening. Late on February 21, Karlette passed about 70 km (45 mi) south of Rodrigues, where wind gusts remained below ; also on the island, the storm dropped beneficial rainfall totaling around . Subsequently, Karlette attained peak 10–minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on February 22, while the JTWC estimated 1–minute winds of 120 km/h (75 km/h). Passing well to the southeast of Mauritius, the storm curved more to the south due to an approaching trough, dissipating on February 25.
Severe Tropical Storm Lisette.
Toward the end of February, the ITCZ spawned a system along the Mozambique coast. With a circulation and warm water temperatures, the system developed into a tropical disturbance on February 24 just offshore northeastern Mozambique. The system slowly organized while drifting southward between two ridges. After an increase in convection, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Lisette on February 28 according to the MFR, although by that time the JTWC had upgraded the storm to the equivalent of tropical cyclone status. A building ridge turned the storm sharply westward. On March 1, the MFR estimated peak 10–minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), making Lisette a severe tropical storm with an eye feature in the center. By comparison, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 130 km/h (85 mph). The storm failed to intensify further, making landfall at peak intensity just north of Beira, Mozambique early on March 2. Lisette turned to the west-northwest, dissipating over Zimbabwe on March 3.
Lisette dropped heavy rainfall across the region it traversed, causing severe flooding in central and northern Mozambique. Most of the south-central Mozambique was drenched with rainfall totals ranging from to , setting numerous records. Due to the precursor disturbance of Lisette, the Nampula Province in Mozambique was severely flooded by the storm, severely damaging several roads. Along the coast, the storm produced a wave height of about near Beira. Lisette and its resultant flooding destroyed 17,000 houses in Mozambique, affecting 300,000 people. Throughout the country, the cyclone killed 87 people.
Other storms.
In addition to the named storms, the MFR tracked seven tropical disturbances and two tropical depressions throughout the year. Most were short lived, often receiving few warnings. The first two systems developed before Tropical Storm Antoinette in October.
For several weeks in early August – the middle of winter in the southern hemisphere – an area of warm water temperatures of over persisted in the northeast portion of the basin. The region was unaffected by the progression of troughs that would usually decrease the water temperatures. On August 13, an area of convection persisted east of the Chagos, in association with the near-equatorial trough, later developing a low pressure area and well-defined circulation. On August 16, the system organized into a tropical disturbance, becoming Tropical Depression A1 the next day; this made it the first such storm in the month of August since Tropical Depression Aline in August 1969. Also on August 17, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 2S. The depression moved southward, developing a well-defined central dense overcast, despite the presence of northerly wind shear. On August 18, an anticyclone turned the depression eastward; that day, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and the MFR estimated a peak 10–minute intensity of 55 km/h (35 mph). The depression later began to weaken under the influence of an approaching trough, and was dissipating as it crossed into the Australian region on August 19. The JTWC tracked the circulation for another two days, estimating that the system turned sharply to the west, and the circulation dissipated on August 23.
Less than a month later, another area of convection developed within the near-equatorial trough near the Chagos archipelago, due to persistent warm water temperatures. On September 6, the MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance A2, and the next day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 3S while the storm was over the northeastern portion of the basin. This was a fairly unusual event, as there is only an average of 0.4 storms in the month of September across the southern hemisphere. Located along the northern side of a ridge, the storm tracked westward, but failed to intensity beyond 1–minute winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) due to wind shear. On September 10, the storm dissipated to the west-southwest of Diego Garcia. 
On January 3, the BoM and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone Phil in the Australian region, which previously moved over Western Australia. The system continued to the west, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on January 5. On January 8, the remnants of Phil slowed and turned to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC began reissuing advisories on Phil. The storm meandered and executed a small loop, and in the process reached peak 1–minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Phil turned back to the southwest, and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on January 12. Four days later, the circulation dissipated. Also in January, the JTWC briefly tracked Tropical Cyclone 18S from the Australian region, which entered the south-west Indian Ocean on January 12. At that time, the storm had peak 1–minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), although it quickly weakened and dissipated on January 13.
A tropical disturbance developed in late November, and two disturbances formed in the first few weeks of January. In the duration between when Iletta developed on January 23 and when Tropical Cyclone Josie formed on February 9, another two tropical disturbances formed, and the final two developed after Lisette originated in late February. The first, Tropical Disturbance M1, formed on May 11 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and later crossed into the Australian region to intensify into Tropical Cyclone Rhonda. The final disturbance of the season originated from a persistent area of convection near the equator on July 19, northeast of Diego Garcia. With warm enough water temperatures, the system developed further, becoming Tropical Depression M2 on July 20, the first July depression since 1971. That day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01S. As the JTWC considers the tropical cyclone year to begin on July 1, and the MFR considered it beginning on August 1 at the time, the storm was in different cyclone years in different agencies. Estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested that the system approached tropical storm status on July 21 after a central dense overcast formed, although the MFR only estimated peak 10–minute winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). Moving southwestward and later to the west, the depression began weakening due to wind shear on July 23, and dissipated two days later. At the time, July was within the annual tropical cyclone year, although a change in policy shifted the end of the tropical cyclone year to June 30, beginning in 2002.

Jason Donald (baseball)

Jason Thomas Donald (born September 4, 1984) is a professional baseball utility player in the Kansas City Royals organization.
Early life.
Donald attended Buchanan High School in Clovis, California, where his father is the coach of the baseball team and a history teacher. He played college baseball for the University of Arizona.
Professional career.
Donald was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the third round (97th overall pick) of the 2006 MLB Draft. He was originally drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 20th round of the 2003 MLB Draft directly from high school, but chose not to sign.
Donald was selected and participated in several All-Star games during the course of the 2008 season including the Eastern League All-Star game, and the premier event for minor leaguers, the MLB All-Star Futures Game (which in 2008 was played at Yankee Stadium.
In 2009, Donald played nine games with the Gulf Coast League Phillies, going 6 for 26 (.231) before being assigned to the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs of the International League. While with the Pigs, Jason had a .236 batting average with one home run over the course of 51 games.
On July 29, 2009, the Phillies traded Donald, along with Carlos Carrasco, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp to the Cleveland Indians for Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco.
Major league career.
Cleveland Indians.
On May 18, 2010, replacing injured Cleveland Indians shortstop Asdrúbal Cabrera, Donald played against the Tampa Bay Rays and recorded his first major league hit on his first plate appearance. In his second at bat, he singled to right field against Rays starter David Price to begin his major league career 2-for-2. He then walked in his third at bat. 
On June 2, 2010, Donald hit a ball to Detroit Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera that should have been the final out of a perfect game. When Cabrera tossed the ball to Armando Galarraga who was covering at first, umpire Jim Joyce incorrectly called Donald safe, thus nullifying Galarraga's perfect game. Donald was ultimately credited with an infield single, and Galarraga finished the game, recording a 1-hit shutout. After the game, Joyce made a statement regarding the call, "I took a perfect game away from that kid. I thought he beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay." When asked about the play, Donald said, "I didn't know if I beat the throw or not. But given the circumstances, I thought for sure I'd be called out."
Cincinnati Reds.
On December 11, 2012, Donald was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in a three-team deal that also involved the Arizona Diamondbacks. Shin-Soo Choo went with Donald to Cincinnati. Cleveland acquired Drew Stubbs from the Reds and Trevor Bauer, Matt Albers and Bryan Shaw from the Diamondbacks. Arizona received Lars Anderson and Tony Sipp from the Indians and Didi Gregorius from the Reds.
Kansas City Royals.
Donald signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals on December 28, 2013.
Olympics.
Donald and Indians backup catcher Lou Marson were selected to the United States national baseball team. Donald helped lead the United States to a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Donald homered in the bronze medal game and led the team at the games in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Donald batted .381 for the Games.
Awards and honors.
In 2008, Donald received the Arizona Fall League's Dernell Stenson Sportsmanship Award.

OC Transpo Route 2

OC Transpo Route 2 is a major cross-town bus route operated by OC Transpo in Ottawa, Canada. The route has its eastern terminus at Rideau Center and its western terminus at Bayshore. Some trips also end at Westboro on weekends. Although not recognized as a rapid transit route by OC Transpo, it goes across-town.
History.
Route 2 used to have its eastern terminus at Blair and its western terminus at Bayshore. It was often late because of the route's long length: 1hr 10min during non-peak times and as much as 1hr 40min during rush hour. A reason for this is that it went all the way through-town, crossing Downtown and making frequent stops. The route was split into route 2 to the west of the Rideau Centre and route 12 to the east.
Headway.
Route 2 runs every 20 minutes during weekdays and Saturdays, with service increasing to every 10 min during rush hour. 30 min service is provided on Sundays.

Order of battle of the Battle of Trenton

[[File:George Washington Before the Battle of Trenton John Trumbull.jpeg|thumb|upright|right
The Battle of Trenton was fought on December 26, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War campaign for New Jersey. In a surprise attack, the Continental Army led by George Washington attacked the winter quarters of a brigade composed primarily of German troops from Hesse-Kassel in Trenton, New Jersey. The Hessian brigade was under the command of Colonel Johann Rall; he died of wounds sustained in the battle, and about two thirds of his men were taken prisoner. It was the first major victory after a long string of defeats that had resulted in the loss of New York City, and was a significant boost to American morale. It was followed by two more American victories, first in a second battle at Trenton on January 2, 1777, and then on January 3 at Princeton.
Most of the German brigade comprised three Hessian regiments: those of Rall, von Lossberg, and von Knyphausen. The remainder of the brigade consisted of artillery corps attached to each regiment, a detachment of Jäger, and a small company of British dragoons. The attacking American army consisted of units from the Continental Army, including companies of its artillery, and a few companies of militia. Additional units were intended to also participate either in the attack, or in diversions to draw attention from the main thrust; these units failed to cross the icy Delaware River and did not participate in the action.
Hesse-Kassel and British Army.
After the war broke out in 1775, the British government realized that it would need more troops than it could raise on its own to fight the war, so it sought to hire troops from willing third parties in Europe. All of these hired troops came from German principalities of the Holy Roman Empire. The single largest contingent, with more than 12,000 arriving in North America in 1776, came from the Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel. The garrison that was quartered at Trenton was a brigade of about 1,400 men, almost all from Hesse-Kassel, under the command of Colonel Johann Rall. The brigade was composed of three regiments, each of which had an artillery company attached. Also included in the brigade were a company of Hessian Jäger (basically light infantry) and a small company from the British 16th (Queen's) Light Dragoons.
The Hessian regiments were named for their formal commanding officers. Since many general officers were also commissioned as colonels of regiments, they were often not present with the regiment, or were busy with their other duties even if the regiment fell under their higher-level command. Since Rall commanded the entire brigade, his regiment's operations were directed by its lieutenant colonel, as were the regiments of Lieutenant Generals Wilhelm von Knyphausen and Friedrich Wilhelm von Lossberg, the second and third ranking general officers in the North American forces of Hesse-Kassel after Lieutenant General Leopold Philip von Heister.
The information in this table is based primarily on the reports of surviving Hessian officers submitted during inquiries into the disaster demanded by Frederick II, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, with some estimates provided by David Hackett Fischer and other historians. The reported strengths do not include the 28 regimental officers. The casualty figures are from an official Hessian return (a formal report on the unit's strength) that also does not include officers. Officers killed or who died of their wounds included Col. Johann Rall and Maj. Friedrich von Dechow, the acting commander of the Knyphausen regiment.
Continental Army.
[[File:ContinentalArmy LeffertsWatercolor.jpg|thumb|upright
Washington organized his army into two columns for the attack on Trenton. After crossing the Delaware River, Brigadier General Adam Stephen's troops guarded the bridgehead while the remaining troops crossed. The divisions marched together for several miles before taking different roads into Trenton. Stephen's men led Major General Nathanael Greene's division southward along an inland road (which was accompanied by Washington and his entourage), while Major General John Sullivan's division followed a road along the river, intending to prevent the Hessians from retreating across the Assunpink Creek.
Most of the figures in this listing are derived from a return prepared by George Washington on December 22, 1776, four days before the battle. Historian David Hackett Fischer includes estimates made by either himself or other historians for strength counts that were not provided in Washington's return. The counts include all officers and musicians, in addition to the rank and file marked as present and fit for duty. Washington required everyone to carry muskets, including officers and musicians who did not normally carry them.
American casualties in the battle were very light, and are therefore not listed in the table below. Two Virginia officers, Capt. William Washington and Lt. James Monroe of the 3rd Virginia Regiment, were injured, as was James Buxton, an ensign in the 4th Virginia Regiment. (Monroe, the future United States president, suffered a wound to the neck that very nearly killed him. His life was saved by a doctor who volunteered his services to the army as it marched through New Jersey that morning.) Two privates are known to have died in the battle, and one account includes mention of two men dying from exposure on the march. The most pessimistic estimate of American casualties lists four killed and eight wounded, although Fischer points out that many more American troops probably died of non-combat causes (including illness, hypothermia, malnutrition, and exhaustion) in the days and weeks following the campaign of late December and early January.
Other American units in the campaign.

The people in the boat represent a cross-section of the American colonies, including a man in a Scottish bonnet and a man of African descent facing backward next to each other in the front, western riflemen at the bow and stern, two farmers in broad-brimmed hats near the back (one with bandaged head), and an androgynous rower in a red shirt, possibly meant to be a woman in man's clothing, there is also a man at the back of the boat that looks to be Native American.
Behind the boat carrying Washington more boats are visible, carrying troops, horses, and supplies across the river. More men and equipment are visible on a snowy riverbank in the distance.
Although the main Continental Army force was the only American formation involved in the attack on Trenton, Washington had planned two additional crossings of the Delaware to assist in the attack. Pennsylvania militia Brigadier General John Cadwalader's brigade, composed of militia companies called "associators" and a number of smaller Continental Army regiments, did get some units across the river at Dunk's Ferry, but ice jams on the far side made it impossible to cross everyone, including Cadwalader and the artillery, and the effort was abandoned. A battalion of Marines under Major Samuel Nicholas was attached to Cadwalader's brigade but did not participate in Battle of Trenton. Pennsylvania brigadier James Ewing was unable to cross any of his troops (militia companies that had been assigned to the reserve force known as the Flying Camp earlier in the year) due to difficult icy conditions at the Trenton Ferry. Ewing's artillery did fire across the river during the battle.

Aheria

The Aheria are an ethnic community of India that number about 140,000. Their name means hunter. This was their main occupation prior to the 1920s. Since then they have become farmers. The Aheria are found mainly in the states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
Most of the Aheria are Hindus and speak Hindi. However there are 17 other languages spoken by Aheria people, the most numerous being Harauti which has about 2000 speakers among the Aheria.
The Aheria are also known as Aheriya, Aheri, Ahiria, Bahelia or Baheliya, Beta, Herbi, Heri, Hersi, Hesi, Karwal or Karbal, Naik, Thori or Turi. 
In Punjab, a group named "Aheria, Aheri, Heri, Naik, Thori or Turi" was identified as an Other Backward Class in 1993, and is listed as such by the National Commission for Backward Classes.
History.
According to the 1908 "Encyclopaedia of religion and ethics", they are a Dravidian tribe, numbering around 35,000, who mainly held animistic beliefs, besides Hinduism. They also worshiped Gugga, a Rajput warrior-king who had acquired the status of a saint.
Aheria of Rajasthan.
In Rajasthan, the community is said to have get their name from the word ahera, which was a term given to the hunting games organised by the local Rajput princes. As a community that was employed as trekkers and guides in ahera, this association over time led them to become known as Aheri. According to their own traditions, they are of Rajput origin. In Rajasthan, they are found mainly in Kota and Jhalawar districts, and speak the Hadoti dialect of Rajasthani. One of the largest concentrations of Aheri is at Gani Gutta village situated near Kishargarh. Like other North Indian Hindus, the Aheri practice clan exogamy. There clans are referred to as gotras, and all of these clans are of equal status with regards to marriage. There main clans are the Kachwaha, Parmar, Chauhan, Gehlot, Tanwar and Padyan, all of which are well known Rajput clans.
The traditional occupation of the Aheri in Rajasthan was hunting, as well as acting as trekkers and guides for the hunts organized by the Rajput princess. However, in 1920, hunting was banned, and this led to the disappearance of their principal occupation. The community are now engaged mainly in cultivation, or a great majority are now employed as agricultural labourers. They supplement their income by selling firewood.
The Aheri have fairly strong caste council, the jati panchayat, which exercises control over the community. Almost all disputes are referred to the panch, who traditional heads of the panchayat. Violation of social or religious norms invite monetary punishments. There traditional tribal deity is Vijaisan Mataji, who temples the Aheri regularly visit.
