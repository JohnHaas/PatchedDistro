HIV/AIDS in Nepal

The infection rate of HIV/AIDS in Nepal among the adult population is estimated to be below the 1 percent threshold which is considered "generalized and severe". However, the prevalence rate masks a concentrated epidemic among at-risk populations such as female sex workers (FSWs), injecting drug users (IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and migrants. Cultural factors have also been shown to play a significant role in the spread of HIV and AIDS in Nepal. Since Nepal's first cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in 1988, the disease has primarily been transmitted by injecting drug use and unprotected sex. Available data indicate that there was a sharp increase in the number of new infections starting in 1996, coinciding with the outbreak of civil unrest. However, the incidence appears to be leveling off with recent evidence of reduced prevalence and lower overall numbers.
Prevalence.
As of December 2007, the Government of Nepal "reported" 1,610 cases of AIDS and 10,546 HIV infections, which has grown to 13,000 infections by World AIDS Day 2008. UNAIDS estimates from 2007 indicate that approximately 75,000 people in Nepal are HIV-positive, including all age groups. The Government of Nepal's National Center for AIDS & STD Control (NCASC) estimated that number to be closer to 70,000 in December 2007.
The epidemic in Nepal is driven by IDUs, migrants, sex workers and their clients, and MSM. Results from the 2007 Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance Study (IBBS) among IDUs in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and East and West Terai indicate that the highest prevalence rates have been found among urban IDUs, 6.8 percent to 34.7 percent of whom are HIV-positive, depending on location. However, in terms of absolute numbers, Nepal's 1.5 million to 2 million labor migrants account for the majority of Nepal’s HIV-positive population. In one subgroup, 2.8 percent of migrants returning from Mumbai, India, were infected with HIV, according to the 2006 IBBS among migrants. As of 2007, HIV prevalence among FSWs and their clients was less than 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, and 3.3 percent among urban-based MSM. HIV and AIDS case reporting by the NCASC reports HIV infections to be more common among men than women, as well as in urban areas and the far western region of the country, where migrant labor is more common. According to Nepal's 2007 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) report, labor migrants make up 41 percent of the total known HIV infections in the country, followed by clients of sex workers (15.5 percent) and IDUs (10.2 percent).
Migrants have become so vulnerable to infection due to uncertainty about their immigration status. While India and Nepal have an open borders policy, whereby Nepalese citizens have the same rights as Indians to live and work in India and vice versa. However, there is low awareness of this agreement and as a result many migrants avoid any contact with the state, including health services. There are also many cases of human trafficking for the sex trade. Not only are all sex-workers at risk, but Nepalese sex workers are often isolated from peers due to language barriers. Those peer network are important for providing information about prevention.
While the most recent data demonstrate a stabilizing of the epidemic and a downward trend in seroprevalence among several of the key high-risk groups, a number of issues pose continued challenges for Nepal. Many sex workers are also IDUs, migrants, or both, increasing the spread of HIV among at-risk groups. A large portion of men who purchase sex are also married, making them potential conduits for HIV to bridge to the general population. Poverty, low levels of education, illiteracy, gender inequalities, marginalization of at-risk groups, and stigma and discrimination compound the epidemic's effects. Unsafe sex and drug injection practices, civil conflict, internal and external mobility, and limited adequate health care delivery multiply the difficulties of addressing HIV/AIDS. Moreover, existing care and support services are already overwhelmed as increasing numbers of HIV-infected individuals become sick with AIDS.
Street children are also one of the most vulnerable groups. The UNICEF report, "Increasing Vulnerability of Children in Nepal", estimates the number of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS to be more than 13,000. The national estimate of children 0 to 14 years of age infected by HIV is 2,500 (2007).
Nepal has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with 81 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. HIV infects 3.1 percent of adult TB patients, and HIV-TB co-infections complicate treatment and care for both diseases.
National response.
The NCASC coordinates Nepal's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1992, the Government of Nepal founded the National AIDS Coordination Committee to lead the multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS and followed with the establishment of the National AIDS Council to oversee the Committee's efforts. However, both the Council and the Committee have been ineffective, in part because of civil strife.
Despite this fact, substantial progress has been made with respect to national commitment and a strengthened response to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country. HIV and AIDS have been recognized as a priority in the new interim three-year development plan. The national program is implemented under one national HIV/AIDS action plan framework. A national monitoring and evaluation system has been developed, and the Government of Nepal has taken initial steps toward establishing a semi-autonomous coordination body for HIV and AIDS. There is strong civil society engagement in the response.
Given the nature of the epidemic in Nepal, most of the national initiatives have focused on leadership, partnerships and the involvement of civil society for prevention, care, and support for its most-at-risk populations. From 2003, the NCASC implemented the HIV/AIDS Operational Plan based on the National Strategy 2002–2006. Currently, the HIV/AIDS activities are shaped by the second National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2007–2011, and implementation is coordinated under the 2006–2008 National Action Plan, which has the following priorities:
The vision of the national strategy is to expand the number of partners involved in the national response and to increase the effectiveness of Nepal's response. It also emphasizes prevention as key for an effective response to the epidemic, particularly in areas with high levels of out-migration. The strategy includes care and support for people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS while recognizing the contribution of care and support to effective prevention. It also recognizes the importance of accurately tracking the epidemic to monitor the effectiveness of interventions.
Nepal's political instability has resulted in nominal government support for national HIV and AIDS programs. Therefore, most HIV/AIDS activities are funded by external development partners. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage has increased from no free or publicly available treatment three years ago to 13 percent of those estimated to need ART accessing free treatment. ART drugs are provided through a grant from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. While there is a need to expand services further, several organizations provide community care and support services.
Nepal receives assistance from several international donor organizations, including The Global Fund and Great Britain's Department for International Development. The Global Fund approved a second-round grant in 2003 to support HIV/AIDS prevention among labor migrants and young people and to care for HIV-infected individuals. Nepal was also approved for a seventh-round grant in 2007 that will focus on labor migrants and target gaps in services for MSM and IDUs.
Non Government Organisations (NGOs) in Nepal.
NGOs operating in Nepal must be registered with the Social Welfare Council. The number of registered NGOs in Nepal is significant. The various NGOs provide a range of services within the communities served including Care and Support, Health Education, Advocacy, Income Generation etc.
On 28 September 2008 a number of NGOs met with representatives from the Constituent Assembly in an interaction programme organized by Naulo Ghumti Nepal, a local NGO. At this meeting Rabindra Prasad Adhikari acknowledged that an effective response to HIV has to be a joint response between the Government and NGOs operating in Nepal. After this event, an informal caucus of four parliamentarians namely Sapana Pradhan Malla, RajKaji Tamu, Dhanraj Gurung, and Rabindra Adhikari was formed. The group was requested to act as a focal point of HIV in the parliament.

Ammi visnaga

Ammi visnaga is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family known by many common names, including bisnaga, toothpickweed, and khella. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it can be found throughout the world as an introduced species. This is an annual or biennial herb growing from a taproot erect to a maximum height near 80 centimeters. Leaves are up to 20 centimeters long and generally oval to triangular in shape but dissected into many small linear to lance-shaped segments. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of white flowers similar to those of other Apiaceae species. The fruit is a compressed oval-shaped body less than 3 millimeters long. This and other "Ammi" species are sources of khellin, a diuretic extract.
Traditional medicine.
In Egypt, a tea made from the fruit of this species has been used as an herbal remedy for kidney stones. Laborarory rat studies show that the extract slows the buildup of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and acts as a diuretic.
Chemical constituents.
Khellin, a chemical obtained from "Ammi visnaga" gives rose red color with KOH (solid) or NaOH & 2-3 drops of water, was used at one time as a smooth muscle relaxant, but its use is limited due to adverse side effects.
The chemical visnagin, which is found in "A. visnaga", has biological activity in animal models as a vasodilator and reduces blood pressure by inhibiting calcium influx into the cell.

HIV/AIDS in the Philippines

Prevalence.
Officially, the Philippines is a low-HIV-prevalence country, with less than 0.1 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. As of January 2013, the Department of Health (DOH) AIDS Registry in the Philippines reported 10,514 people living with HIV/AIDS.
Means of transmission.
Of the 10,514 HIV positive cases reported from 1984 to 2013, 92% (9,637) were infected through sexual contact, 4% (420) through needle sharing among injecting drug users, 1% (59) through mother-to-child transmission, <1% (20) through blood transfusion and needle prick injury <1% (3). No data is available for 4% (375) of the cases. 
Cumulative data shows 33% (3,147) were infected through heterosexual contact, 41% (3,956) through homosexual 
contact, and 26% (2,534) through bisexual contact. From 2007 there has been a shift in the predominant trend of 
sexual transmission from heterosexual contact (20%) to males having sex with other males (80%) 
Overseas workers from the Philippines (e.g., seafarers, domestic helpers, etc.) account for about 20 percent of all HIV/AIDS cases in the country.
At-risk groups.
Most-at-risk groups include men who have sex with men (MSM), with 395 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among within this group from January to February 2013 alone, 96% up from 2005’s 210 reported infections. A spokesperson of the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) of the Department of Health says that the sudden and steep increase in the number of new cases within the MSM community, particularly in the last three years (309 cases in 2006, and 342 in 2013), is “tremendously in excess of what (is) usually expected,” allowing classification of the situation as an “epidemic". Of the cumulative total of 1,097 infected MSMs from 1984 to 2008, 49% were reported in the last three years (72% asymptomatic); 108 have died when reported, and slightly more MSMs were reportedly already with AIDS (30%).
Among MSM's, ninety percent of the newly infected are single (up to 35% of past cases reported involved overseas Filipino workers or OFWs and/or their spouse), with the most of the affected people now only 20 to 34 years old (from 45 to 49 years old in the past). The highest number of infections among MSMs is from Metro Manila. An HIV surveillance study conducted by Dr. Louie Mar Gangcuangco and colleagues from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital showed that out of 406 MSM tested for HIV from entertainment areas in Metro Manila, HIV prevalence using the rapid test was 11.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.7- 15.0). Increasing infection rates were also noted in the cities of Angeles, Cebu, and Davao. 1 to 3 percent of MSM's were found to be HIV-positive by sentinel surveillance conducted in Cebu and Quezon cities in 2001.
Another at-risk group are injecting drug users (IDUs), 1 percent of whom were found to be HIV-positive in Cebu City in 2005. A high rate of needle sharing among IDUs in some areas (77 percent in Cebu City) is of concern. Sex workers, because of their infrequent condom use, high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and other factors, are also considered to be at risk. In 2002, just 6 percent of sex workers interviewed said they used condoms in the last week. As of 2005, however, HIV prevalence among sex workers in Cebu City was relatively low, at 0.2 percent.
National risk profile.
Several factors put the Philippines in danger of a broader HIV/AIDS epidemic. They include increasing population mobility within and outside of the Philippine islands; a conservative culture, adverse to publicly discussing issues of a sexual nature; rising levels of sex work, casual sex, unsafe sex, and injecting drug use.
There is also high STI prevalence and poor health-seeking behaviors among at-risk groups; gender inequality; weak integration of HIV/AIDS responses in local government activities; shortcomings in prevention campaigns; inadequate social and behavioral research and monitoring; and the persistence of stigma and discrimination, which results in the relative invisibility of PLWHA. Lack of knowledge about HIV among the Filipino population is troubling. Approximately two-thirds of young women lack comprehensive knowledge on HIV transmission, and 90 percent of the population of reproductive age believe you can contract HIV by sharing a meal with someone.
The Philippines has high tuberculosis (TB) incidence, with 131 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. HIV infects 0.1 percent of adults with TB. Although HIV-TB co-infection is low, the high incidence of TB indicates that co-infections could complicate treatment and care for both diseases in the future.
National response.
Wary of nearby Thailand’s growing epidemic in the late 1980s, the Philippines was quick to recognize its own sociocultural risks and vulnerabilities to HIV/AIDS. Early responses included the 1992 creation of the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC), the country’s highest HIV/AIDS policymaking body. Members of the Council represent 17 governmental agencies, including local governments and the two houses of the legislature; seven nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and an association of PLWHA.
The passing of the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act in 1998 was also a landmark in the country’s fight against HIV/AIDS. However, the Philippines is faced with the challenge of stimulating government leadership action in a low-HIV-prevalence country to advocate for a stronger and sustainable response to AIDS when faced with other competing priorities. One strategy has been to prevent STIs in general, which are highly prevalent in the country.
The PNAC developed the Philippines’ AIDS Medium Term Plan: 2005–2010 (AMTP IV). The AMTP IV serves as a national road map toward universal access to prevention, treatment, care, and support, outlining country-specific targets, opportunities, and obstacles along the way, as well as culturally appropriate strategies to address them. In 2006, the country established a national monitoring and evaluation system, which was tested in nine sites and is being expanded. Antiretroviral treatment is available free of charge, but only 10 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving it as of 2006, according to UNAIDS. This lack of distribution can be attributed to the focus of health spending towards disease specific programs instead of spending on public health which is more comprehensive and addresses multiple diseases. By spending on public health in general, the country would be able to strengthen the health system by creating effective health infrastructures that could carry out vertical programs without creating brain drain or hindering the economic development of the country. Without passable local infrastructure, health improvements would not be possible as distribution of medical care and medicines would be very limited; incidence and prevalence reports may not be accurate, and progress of health initiatives could not be tracked. 
The Government of the Philippines participates in international responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Most recently, in January 2007, the Philippines hosted the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit, which had a special session on HIV/AIDS.
The Philippines is a recipient of three grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2004 third round, 2006 fifth round, and 2007 sixth round) to scale up the national response to HIV/AIDS through the delivery of services and information to at-risk populations and PLHIV. These programs are executed by AIDS Society of the Philippines, Inc. for HIV prevention and control and Positive Action Foundation, Inc for treatment, care and support. Aid money should be used to scale-up the public health capacity instead of only providing treatment and education for HIV/AIDS as this spending could be used to benefit all the niches of health related issues. Additionally, aid money is detrimental to local manufacturing as well as the economic development of the Philippines, and could escalate the problems of malnutrition and homelessness.
Campaigns.
Photographer Niccolo Cosme launched the Red Whistle campaign in 2011, inspired by red disaster preparedness whistles, to raise awareness and understanding of HIV/AIDs in the Philippines.

Najran, Syria

Najran (, also spelled Nijran) is a village in southern Syria lying south of the Lejah plain, administratively part of the al-Suwayda Governorate, located northwest of al-Suwayda. Nearby localities include Harran to the northwest, Ariqah to the northeast, ad-Duweri and Qarrasa to the west, ad-Dour and Sami' to the southwest, al-Mazraa and al-Majdal to the south and Kafr al-Laha to the southwest. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Najran had a population of 2,995 in the 2004 census.
History.
Byzantine and Islamic era.
Najran takes its name from the South Arabian city of Najran, many of whose inhabitants, the Balharith, were expelled from the city in the 520s and settled the district of Trachonitis (the Lejah plain), then part of the Arabia Petraea province. They came under the protection of their ancient relatives, the Ghassanids.
In the Byzantine era, (late 4th–6th century), a church was built in Najran by Monophysite Arab Christians, likely from Najran in South Arabia. During the early Islamic era, the Christian community of Najran was expelled by Umar ibn al-Khattab, leading to some migrating to the Najran of Hauran.
In the early 13th century, the Byzantine-era church was visited by Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, who hailed the structure's beauty and noted its mosaics and marble columns. He also wrote that the church was a votive shrine.
Ottoman era.
In 1596, Najran appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the "nahiya" of Bani Miglad in the "Qada Hawran". It had a population of 65 households and 25 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and beehives.
Najran was settled by 200 Druze immigrant families from Mount Lebanon in 1685. The village had been previously abandoned by the Arab tribe Muqri al-Wahsh, although it still contained Christians. According to historians Hanna Abu Rashid and Bouron, Najran was the first place for the second wave of Mount Lebanon Druze to settle, while historian Sa'id Sghayar notes that two other villages in the Lejah plain were temporarily settled by this group of immigrants before Najran was chosen as a permanent residence. Historian Abu Shaqra described the Druze arrival at Najran: As was the custom in such cases, the sheikh of Najran ordered the lighting of bonfires on the summit of the village ... then bonfires were lit as a signal of war on the summit of every village in Jabel Hawran ... In the morning Druzes came to Najran from every village. The three thousand Lebanese were distributed over the different parts of Hawran. 
In 1711 Najran, which had a castle, became the center of the al-Hamdan clan, who controlled five other villages in the Hauran. 
In the early 19th century Christians were still the majority in Najran, with roughly 150 families. There were 50 Druze families. By the mid-19th century the Druze Abu Fakhr clan controlled Najran and two other villages. During this period, the Christian and Druze communities were roughly equal in population and the chief of the village was Qasem Abu Fakhr. Traveler Josias Leslie Porter visited in the 1850s and noted that Najran had "extensive ruins ... estimated at nearly two miles in circumference." The most significant of these was the Byzantine-era church, the remains of which consisted of two square-shaped towers with Greek inscriptions. One tower inscription contained the date 458 CE, while the other contained 564 CE. According to Porter, the ruins had functioned as a mosque in earlier times. By 1862 the Abu Fakhr chief chief was Ibrahim Abu Fakhr, who resided in Najran. 
In October 1895 the Ottoman army based in nearby al-Shaykh Maskin launched an offensive against the Druze, attacking Najran along with Qarrasa and Ahira. About 45 Ottoman soldiers were killed and 65 were wounded as a result of resistance by the three villages.

Dasornis

Dasornis is a genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Almost all known material of this bird is from some 50 million years ago (Ma) and has been recovered from the Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England). The exception are a few approximately 45 Ma-old remains from the Lutetian (Middle Eocene, MP11-13) of Etterbeek (Belgium) that are only tentatively included here, and some even more conjectural remains from outside Europe (see below).
Description.
Like those of its relatives, the thin-walled bones of "Dasornis" broke easily and thus very few fossils – though still far more than of the average pseudotooth bird genus – are in decent condition. Among these is a superbly preserved partial skull that has been of crucial importance in sorting out the convoluted synonymy of this genus. Apart from that and another not quite as well-preserved partial skull, however, a number of beak and cranium pieces as well as a few broken remains of wing and tarsometatarsus bones make up the known remains of "Dasornis". The most tell-tale characteristic of the present genus are the combination of Paleogene age and huge size. But given the fragmented state of these, it is not at all clear whether the genus was restricted to the North Atlantic (and perhaps the adjacent Paratethys) or occurred also in the Pacific and in the Southern Hemisphere, where fossils of a similar size were found (see below).
This genus belongs to the group of huge pseudotooth birds, with wingspans in excess of , and probably as much as . The complete head and bill probably measured almost in life, the eye socket had a diameter of and the humerus at its distal end was about wide. The well-preserved skull fossil shows deep grooves along the underside of the upper bill, with pits to accommodate the lower bill's "teeth". Thus, only the upper "teeth" were visible when the bird closed its bill. "Dasornis" resembles the much smaller "Odontopteryx" in having a jugal arch that is mid-sized, tapering and stout behind the orbital process of the prefrontal bone, unlike in the large Neogene "Osteodontornis". Also, its paroccipital process is much elongated back- and downwards, again like in "Odontopteryx" but unlike in "Pseudodontornis longirostris". Further traits in which "Dasornis" agreed with "Odontopteryx" – and differed from "Pelagornis" (a contemporary of "Osteodontornis") are a deep and long handward-pointing pneumatic foramen in the fossa pneumotricipitalis of the humerus, a latissimus dorsi muscle attachment site on the humerus that consists of two distinct segments instead of a single long, and a large knob that extends along the ulna where the ligamentum collateralis ventralis attached. As the traits as found in "Odontopteryx" and "Dasornis" are probably plesiomorphic, they cannot be used to argue for a closer relationship between the two Paleogene genera than either had with "Osteodontornis" and/or "Pelagornis".
Systematics and taxonomy.
Only a single species, Dasornis emuinus, is accepted today. However, it has a very convoluted synonymy, with its fossil remains assigned to no less than six genera (of which two were invalid junior homonyms) and divided between at least four species – excluding spelling errors and invalid "corrections" – that were variously moved between these genera for almost 150 years:
1854-1890: ""Lithornis" emuinus, "Megalornis"" of Seeley, "Dasornis" and "Argillornis"
The first fossil of "D. emuinus", a piece of right humerus shaft, was found in the Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England). It was misidentified as a tibiotarsus of the paleognath "Lithornis" and described as "L. emuinus" by James Scott Bowerbank in 1854. Harry Govier Seeley recognized this error in 1866 and established the genus "Megalornis", though he misspelled the specific name as "emuianus". However, the genus name he chose had already been used for some of the great herons ("Ardea"). Richard Owen established the genera "Dasornis" (in 1870) and "Argillornis" (in 1878) for, respectively, a broken skull and two humerus ends that were found in the same deposits. Some authors claim he erected the former genus in 1869 already, but in that year he only used the names informally in his brief initial report on the newly discovered skull. Misled by the skull's large size and perhaps overly eager to be the first to describe the remains of an "European moa" (Owen was the foremost authority on these New Zealand endemics at that time), he placed "Dasornis" in the Dinornithidae. "Argillornis", on the other hand, was recognized early on as some sort of aquatic bird, but its immense size puzzled paleontologists to no little extent.
1891-1985: spelling errors, ""Neptuniavis"" and "completely unrealistic" taxonomy
Subsequent authors, noting that it was quite obviously not a paleognath ratite, placed "Dasornis" in the Gastornithidae (diatrymas). Richard Lydekker in 1891 proposed to rename Owen's "D. londinensis" to "D. londiniensis", and later that year wanted to change "Dasornis" to "Dasyornis". But the altered specific name was not in accordance with the rules of zoological nomenclature, and neither was the genus name he chose – and which, moreover, had already been used earlier by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield for the bristlebirds. In 1921, Kálmán Lambrecht "corrected" Seeley's "Megalornis emuianus" to "emuinus" and in 1933 he misspelled Owen's "A. longipennis" as "longipes". Pierce Brodkorb resolved the "Megalornis" homonymy in 1963 by merging ""M." emuinus" with "A. longipennis", combining the older specific name "emuinus" and the then-valid genus name "Argillornis". However, he rather inexplicably allied "Argillornis" with the enigmatic Mesozoic "Elopteryx nopcsai" – a sort of "wastebin taxon" for Late Cretaceous maniraptoran theropod remains from Romania that might not even be of birds – and the mid-late Eocene "Eostega" (probably a primitive gannet). In 1976, Colin James Oliver Harrison and Cyril Alexander Walker finally determined all those remains to be of pseudotooth birds. They also proposed that part of the supposed "A. longipennis" remains was actually from a distinct and slightly smaller genus and species, which they described in a monotypic genus as "Macrodontopteryx oweni". In 1977, the same authors erected the genus "Neptuniavis" for supposed procellariiform tarsometatarsi also found on the Isle of Sheppey; they included two species there. Already however, eminent avian paleontologists such as Storrs L. Olson were voicing their reservation about this proliferation of taxa in no uncertain terms.
2008: just "Dasornis emuinus" after all
Almost 150 years after the description of ""L." emuinus", at the start of the 21st century, a rather well-preserved skull (lacking the beak) was discovered, once again in the Isle of Sheppey London Clay. This specimen – SMNK-PAL 4017 – was studied by Gerald Mayr at the Senckenberg Museum. He determined that all the large seabird bones from the London Clay bones belonged to a single species of pelagornithid. To this, the scientific name "Dasornis emuinus" applies, a novel combination of the oldest valid genus and species names ever used for these fossils. Indeed, the importance of this specimen can hardly be underestimated, for the holotype skull of "Dasornis "londinensis"" (which was used to establish the genus "Dasornis") is so badly preserved that its status as a pseudotooth bird was debated as recently as 1985. Only the fossils named ""Neptuniavis" minor" were not of "D. emuinus", but of the much smaller contemporary and sympatric pseudotooth bird "Odontopteryx toliapica".
"Dasornithidae"
The family Dasornithidae was established by Harrison and Walker in 1976 for "Dasornis" and its presumed relatives, which are however nowadays included in the former. As current scientists generally try to avoid monotypic taxa unless required by phylogeny, the Dasornithidae never were widely accepted; they are generally considered a junior synonym of the Pelagornithidae instead. And this seems to be quite correct indeed – as noted above, "Pelagornis", the type genus of the Pelagornithidae, probably belongs to the same pseudotooth bird lineage as "Dasornis" and may even be descended from it. Thus, even if several families were recognized in the Odontopterygiformes, "Pelagornis" and "Dasornis" would almost certainly remain in the Pelagornithidae.
Synonyms.
The junior synonyms of the genus "Dasornis" are thus:
The junior synonyms of the species "D. emuinus" are:
Other fossils perhaps belonging in "Dasornis".
""Pseudodontornis" longidentata", described from a beak piece and a damaged atlas vertebra of what appears to have been a single individual, is yet another supposed pseudotooth bird species from the Early Eocene London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey. It may well be synonymous with "D. emuinus" too, or with "Macrodontopteryx oweni" if that is indeed a distinct species. This also applies to the Lutetian (Middle Eocene) material from Etterbeek (Belgium) which was at first assigned to "Argillornis" (as was the holotype skull of "M. oweni"); at least part of the supposed "A. longipennis" remains – though not its syntype humerus pieces – does seem to be rather small for "D. emuinus". Perhaps "Gigantornis" which is only known from pieces of a sternum found in Middle Eocene rocks in Nigeria also belongs in "Dasornis"; the sternum of "D. emuinus" remains unknown, but its size would have been a close match of the Nigerian fossil. Analysis of the unidentified large pelagornithid fossils from the Middle Eocene of Kpogamé-Hahotoé (Togo) which are provisionally termed "Aequornis traversei" might shed light on this issue. The fairly large undescribed remains from the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of the Ouled Abdoun Basin (Morocco) which have been provisionally termed "Odontopteryx gigas" may in fact be from a small or juvenile "Dasornis". The same applies to "M. oweni" – nonwithstanding that it is sometimes placed in "Odontopteryx" –, considering it was for long included in "Argillornis".
Also provisionally assigned to "Argillornis" were some pelagornithid wing bone remains, specimens LACM 128462 and presumably also LACM 127875 from the Keasey and Pittsburg Bluff Formations of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary of Oregon. Whether this Pacific species was the same as the Atlantic "D. emuinus" is undetermined, but considering the age difference it is not all too likely and they may well belong to different genera. In that respect, the enigmatic "Cyphornis magnus" from the same region is most often assigned a Miocene age, but might actually be from around the Eo-Oligocene boundary as initially assumed; it or (if of Miocene age) an ancestor, or perhaps an ancestor of the Miocene genus "Osteodontornis", make a more plausible candidate for the Oregon fossils. Lack of sufficient well-preserved remains have prevented more detailed study however. Similar in size and age to the present genus are some pseudotooth bird remains from Antarctica, namely a jaw piece from the Middle/Late Eocene of the La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island near the Drake Passage, and a Middle Eocene piece of a humerus shaft from Mount Discovery on the continent's Pacific side. Separated from the North Atlantic by a wide distance and the equatorial currents, even in the case of the Seymour Island specimen it is doubtful whether they could be referred to "Dasornis", because the fossils are simply too fragmentary.

HIV/AIDS in East Timor

Prevalence.
Timor-Leste is a low HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.2 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. However, social factors such as massive social dislocation, cross-border migration, high unemployment, and a weak and limited health system could dramatically increase the spread of HIV infection. Many young people are not well-equipped with the knowledge and life skills to manage HIV risk in an increasingly challenging environment.
The first HIV/AIDS case in Timor-Leste was detected in 2001. Forty-three cases of the
disease were confirmed in 2007 and are now under treatment, according to the Ministry of Health. However, limited surveillance capabilities and inadequate testing could mean that more people are infected.
Although HIV prevalence among the general population appears to be quite low, there are signs of a low-level epidemic among Timor-Leste’s sex workers and men who have sex with men (MSM). According to data collected in mid-2003 by Family Health International (FHI), HIV-prevalence rates among sex workers and MSM were 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively. According to the same study, among female sex workers (FSWs), 14 percent tested positive for gonorrhea, 15 percent for chlamydia, 16 percent for trichomonas and 60 percent for herpes simplex virus-2. No comparable data have been collected since, and consequently, the current situation is unknown. Timor-Leste is also vulnerable due to its close proximity to nearby countries that are experiencing localized epidemics such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
General public health knowledge on primary health care, including reproductive health, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV/AIDS, is very limited especially in remote areas. Only 50.7 percent of the population 15 years old and over ever heard about HIV/AIDS; and among those in that same population group who think it can be avoided, only 41.8 percent know that it can be avoided by use of condoms, according to the 2007 Timor-Leste Living Standards Measurement Study. There are others factors that contribute to the risk and impact of HIV/AIDS among women; they include domestic violence, lower literacy and education levels, and cultural constraints in discussing issues of sex. Providing the general population with information to combat HIV/AIDS is complicated due to low prevalence and limited access to the communities. According to the National Statistic Directorate Census 2004, most people live in the rural areas, mainly around the northern coastal regions in small, dispersed villages. According to the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2003, more than 60 percent of women and 70 percent of men do not recognize any method of family planning, and only 10 percent of women are using any contraceptive method.
Timor-Leste can still be classified as a conflict country. The civil unrest that erupted in April/May 2006 continues to be unsettled and constitutes a risk for high rates of domestic violence and sexual assault, thereby leaving women more vulnerable to infection since they are unable to negotiate condom use. The country has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with 250 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization.
From the 43 cases under treatment, data from the Ministry of Health due to be released in early 2008, shows that at least three people have HIV-TB co-infections; two children under five received the infection from their mothers; and two pregnant women are under prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) HIV treatment.
National response.
HIV/AIDS has had a devastating impact on other countries in comparable circumstances to Timor-Leste. Among Timor-Leste’s nearest neighbors, Papua New Guinea appears to be in the early stages of a generalized HIV epidemic that threatens to not only halt, but also reverse the development achievements the nation has made in its relatively short history. Many of the circumstances that have led to the current HIV situation in Papua New Guinea are also present in Timor-Leste, including large-scale social dislocation and high levels of HIV-related risk.
In 2002 a National HIV/AIDS/STI Strategic Plan (2002–2005) was adopted. In the period since, Timor-Leste has adopted and implemented strategies, policies, programs, and projects to address HIV/AIDS. However, among key stakeholders, it is generally accepted that while many effective activities have been implemented, overall coordination is weak, and important gaps exist. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS across the general population remains low, the level of unsafe sex practices is high, and STI rates are also high.
In mid-2005, the Ministry of Health, with support from UN Agencies and key civil society organizations, initiated a process to review the National HIV/AIDS/STI Strategic Plan (2002–2005) and develop a new national strategic plan to cover the period 2006–2010. The new National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS/STIs 2006–2010 was approved by the Council of Ministers in August 2006. The goal is "to maintain Timor-Leste as a low prevalence HIV nation and minimize the adverse consequences for those infected with HIV". Four program components were identified:
A key part of the national strategy is the establishment of the National AIDS Commission, to provide independent advice to the Government of Timor-Leste on all matters related to HIV/AIDS and to monitor and advise on the progress in implementation of the National Strategic Program.
In 2006, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria approved a fifth-round grant for Timor-Leste to scale up the national response to HIV/AIDS through the delivery of services and information to at-risk populations and people living with HIV/AIDS. The grant was signed in December 2006 and now is on quarter three implementation. Assessment reports show good performance in relation to targets settled for quarter 1 and quarter 2.

Okanagan Basin Water Board

The Okanagan Basin Water Board is a water governance body designated to identify and resolve critical water issues for the Okanagan watershed in British Columbia, Canada. It was set up to implement the recommendations of the Okanagan Basin Study, and to take on a range of responsibilities for water management. The OBWB’s jurisdiction is defined by the geographic borders of the Okanagan Basin rather than political boundaries. 
Overview.
Water is one of the most precious and important natural assets in the Okanagan Basin. Even though the Basin is endowed with several large lakes, the supply of clean, reliable water is inherently limited by the semi-arid to arid climate, which brings minimal precipitation and high evaporation and evapotranspiration rates. In fact, according to Statistics Canada the Okanagan Basin has the lowest, per capita availability of fresh water in Canada. Water shortages have already occurred in some areas of the Basin, and are expected to occur more widely and frequently in the future.
Powers.
The OBWB does not have regulatory authority, but has taxation powers to support its activities, there is only one other example of this in the province- The Municipal Finance Authority. The OBWB operates primarily as regional service delivery body focusing on incentive-based programs, which provide support in different ways for projects promoting good water management. As the OBWB assesses funds from all Basin residents, initiatives are focused on activities that have valley-wide benefits. Nine of the twelve Directors are elected officials appointed by the three Okanagan regional districts, and (since 2006) the Okanagan Nation Alliance, the Water Supply Association of BC, and the Okanagan Water Stewardship Council each appoint an additional Director.
At the time of the OBWB’s inception, algal blooms and other signs of deteriorating lake water quality and the explosive invasion of Eurasian watermilfoil ("Myriophyllum spicatum") were the most serious water issues in the Basin. For many years the OBWB’s activities focused almost exclusively on these areas, bringing significant improvements to water quality and the aesthetics of Okanagan beaches. Several factors over the past thirty years, including rapid population growth, increased awareness of climate change, and the forest fires and drout, reinforced calls to refresh the OBWB’s mandate. In 2006, the OBWB took on a new Water Management Initiative and a more active leadership role in the valley.
The new Water Management Initiative brought the OBWB closer to its original mandate from 1969-1970. The OBWB’s purpose is now stated as: “Providing leadership to protect and enhance quality of life in the Okanagan Basin through sustainable water resource management”.
Functions.
Over the period of this initiative, OBWB has been increasingly effective at promoting best practices and improving communication between jurisdictions. The OBWB has also had great success partnering with provincial agencies – especially in support of regional water science and monitoring.

Manuel Reina Rodríguez

Manuel 'Manolo' Reina Rodríguez (born 1 April 1985 in Villanueva del Trabuco, Málaga) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Gimnàstic de Tarragona in Segunda División B, as a goalkeeper.
Football career.
Reina was a product of hometown Málaga CF's youth system, and appeared in one first-team game during the 2005–06 season, against Valencia CF in a 0–0 home draw, as the Andalusia side went on to rank last in La Liga.
In 2007 he joined Levante UD, but played mainly for the reserves during his early spell. However, the team's severe financial crisis led to Reina becoming first-choice after the departure of Marco Storari; in eight matches, he conceded 18 goals.
Reina appeared in 47 games in the following two campaigns combined, the last of them ending in top flight promotion. For 2010–11 he was initially deemed second-choice, to newly signed Gustavo Munúa. However, after the Uruguayan conceded ten goals in the first three matches, he was selected for the next two rounds, keeping clean sheets against UD Almería (0–1 away win) and Real Madrid (0–0, at home); he eventually lost his starting position again, finishing the campaign with 18 appearances as the Valencian eventually retained its top division status.

HIV/AIDS in Thailand

Since HIV/AIDS was first reported in Thailand in 1984, 1,115,415 adults had been infected as of 2008, with 585,830 having died since 1984. 532,522 Thais were living with HIV/AIDS in 2008. In 2009 the adult prevalence of HIV was 1.3%. CIA World Factbook has listed the 2009 statistics for HIV prevalence by country, and according to these, Thailand has the highest prevalence of HIV in Asia. According to the AVERT (formerly also known as the AIDS Education and Research Trust) organisation, the second-highest prevalence of HIV in Asia existed in Thailand in 2002, with a rate of 1.8 percent, while a 2011 report from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) identified Thailand among the eleven countries in the Asia-Pacific with a majority of the world's HIV-infected people.
Prevalence.
After Thailand’s first case of HIV/AIDS was reported in 1984, the incidence of infection increased steadily in the country. In 1991, the government adopted a strategy to combat the disease, and in recent years, the number of new infections has declined. However, HIV prevalence had remained the same from 2003 to 2005 (1.4 percent) with more people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Thailand’s early cases of HIV/AIDS occurred primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). The virus then spread rapidly to injecting drug users (IDUs), followed by prostitutes. Between 2003 and 2005, there were increases in HIV prevalence from 17 to 28 percent among MSM in Bangkok. In addition, prevalence among IDUs still ranges from 30 to 50 percent. In 2005, more than 40
percent of new infections were among women, the majority of whom were infected through intercourse with long-term lovers. Money and a low level of condom use due to women’s activity in the illegal sex trade are factors responsible for the spread of HIV among this group. Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Thailand has declined, the epidemic has moved to the general population and there is a greater need to match prevention efforts with recent changes in the epidemic.
As of 2011, IDUs in Thailand are the among the most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and number between 40,000-97,300.
Several factors put Thailand at risk of a resurgence of HIV/AIDS cases. Awareness of HIV status is low. For example, 80 percent of HIV-positive MSM had never been tested or thought they were HIV-negative, according to a 2006 study cited by UNAIDS. A large portion of IDUs – 35 percent according to one study – use nonsterile injecting equipment. Other research has noted an increased trend of erratic condom use by female prostitutes. In some cases, women selling sex reported using a condom in just over one half of commercial sex encounters. Finally, premarital sex, once taboo, is increasingly common among young Thais, only 20 to 30 percent of whom use condoms consistently, according to the United Nations Development Program.
According to the World Health Organization, Thailand has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with 63 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005. Approximately 7.6 percent of TB patients are co-infected with HIV; HIV-TB co-infections pose a challenge to treatment provision and care for both diseases.
National response.
Thailand’s initial response to the epidemic was weak. However, since the National AIDS Control Program was moved from the Ministry of Public Health to the Office of the Prime Minister in 1991, the country’s HIV/AIDS prevention efforts have been recognized as among the world’s most successful. The Ninth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2002–2006) emphasized the adoption of a human-centered approach to bring about reform through the public health system, especially the health care system. Thailand’s policy on AIDS has worked toward educating its citizens on HIV/AIDS and prevention measures; developing a system of medical, public health, social, and consultation services to improve the quality of life of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); developing medical biotechnology, medicine, and AIDS vaccination research; and working with all parties involved, such as the government and private sector, to prevent and alleviate the HIV/AIDS situation.
Thailand’s HIV/AIDS activities include conducting a public education campaign targeting the general public and most-at-risk populations (MARPs), improving sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment, discouraging men from visiting sex workers, promoting condom use, and requiring sex workers to receive monthly STI tests and carry records of the test results.
In 2004, Thailand received a third-round grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to prevent HIV/AIDS among IDUs and increase care and support for them. Objectives of the grant are to train peer leaders within IDU communities; create harm-reduction centers; educate health care providers, police, prison staff, and policymakers; and provide peer-based outreach, education, counseling, referral services, and HIV testing support. The U.S. Government provides one-third of the Global Fund’s contributions.
Since the change of government in 2006, Thailand has reinvigorated its HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. In 2007, Thailand adopted a three-year strategic plan that focuses on scaling up HIV prevention efforts, particularly for people most likely to be exposed to HIV and for difficult-to-reach populations. Early in 2007, the government announced that it was breaking patents on drugs to treat HIV. Thus, the government continues to strive for achieving universal access to treatment. As of the end of 2006, 88 percent of HIV-infected people were receiving ART, according to UNAIDS.
Despite the efforts put into anti-HIV strategies, it is estimated that condom use remains quite low: in 2010, the Department of Disease Control (DDC) estimated that 60% of sexually active teenagers, more than 50% of MSM and 40% of sex workers do not regularly use condoms.
Research.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a study in partnership with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to ascertain the effectiveness of providing people who inject drugs illicitly with daily doses of the anti-retroviral drug Tenofovir as a prevention measure. The results of the study were released in mid-June 2013 and revealed a 48.9% reduced incidence of the virus among the group of subjects who received the drug, in comparison to the control group who received a placebo. The Principal Investigator of the study stated in the "Lancet" medical journal: “We now know that pre-exposure prophylaxis can be a potentially vital option for HIV prevention in people at very high risk for infection, whether through sexual transmission or injecting drug use.”
Statistics.
Since HIV/AIDS was first reported in Thailand in 1984, 1,115,415 adults had been infected as of 2008, with 585,830 having died since 1984. 532,522 Thais were living with HIV/AIDS in 2008. For more info about reported cases worldwide, see List of HIV/AIDS cases and deaths registered by region.

Gigantornis

Gigantornis eaglesomei was a giant prehistoric bird, described from a fragmentary specimen from the Eocene of Nigeria. It was considered to be a representative of the albatross family (Diomedeidae), but was later referred to the bony-toothed birds, (Pelagornithidae). One of the largest pseudotooth birds, with an inferred wingspan of about 6 m (20 ft) it is among the largest birds ever.
Its identified remains consist of a broken sternum found in Middle Eocene Ameki Formation deposits at Ameki (Nigeria). The fossil bird was considered to belong the albatross family (Diomedeidae), as no sterna of pseudotooth birds were known until its discovery, and it remained the only such specimen for decades. Only in the 1970s its true affinities were realized, after it had become clear that although it must have been from a dynamic soarer with wings like an albatross, it resembled pelicans (order Ciconiiformes) rather than tubenoses (order Procellariiformes, to which albatrosses belong) in its details.
It is not known whether this bird belongs to a distinct genus; it might even be the very same species as the similar-sized "Dasornis emuinus", whose fossils are not uncommon in the Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England). Remains of a large pseudotooth bird were also found in the Middle Eocene of Kpogamé-Hahotoé (Togo) and have been provisionally termed "Aequornis traversei"; their analysis is likely to provide at least some insight on the taxonomic status of "G. eaglesomei".
The "Gigantornis" sternum is of the typical short and deep-crested shape found in dynamic soarers. Compared to LHNB (CCCP)-1, a Middle to Late Miocene pseudotooth bird sternum found in Portugal and tentatively assigned to "Pelagornis", its articular facet for the furcula consists of a flat section at the very tip of the sternal keel and a similar one set immediately above it at an outward angle, and the spina externa is shaped like an Old French shield in cross-section. The slightly smaller LHNB (CCCP)-1 has a less sharply protruding sternal keel, the articular facet for the furcula consists of a large knob at the forward margin, and the spina externa is narrow in cross-section.

Theo Lingen

Theo Lingen (10 June 1903 – 10 November 1978), born Franz Theodor Schmitz, was a German actor, film director and screenwriter. He appeared in more than 230 films between 1929 and 1978, and directed 21 films between 1936 and 1960.
Life and career.
Lingen was born the son of a lawyer in the city of Hanover, and grew up there. He attended the Royal Goethe Gymnasium – the predecessor of the Goethe School – in Hanover, but left before taking the Abitur (final exams). His theatrical talent was discovered during rehearsals for a school performance at the "Schauburg" boulevard theatre.
Beginning his professional stage career, the young actor adopted as a stage name his middle name together with that of the birthplace of his father, Lingen in the North German Emsland region. As "Theo Lingen" he performed at theatres at Hanover, Halberstadt, Münster and Frankfurt; in plays like "The Importance of Being Earnest" he very quickly earned a reputation as a superb character comedian, distinguished by his characteristic nasal speech. This distinction followed him when he began appearing in films in 1929, often together with the mumbling Viennese actor Hans Moser, since together they made a contrasting pair. In 1929 he was invited by Bertolt Brecht to the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin, where he performed as Macheath in "The Threepenny Opera". He starred in drama films like "M" and "The Testament of Dr. Mabuse" directed by Fritz Lang.
In February 1928, Lingen's daughter, Ursula, was born to Bertold Brecht's then wife Marianne Zoff (1893–1984). Brecht and Zoff divorced in September; Lingen and Zoff married later the same year, they also raised Zoff's elder daughter Hanne. Conditions worsened after the "Machtergreifung" of 30 January 1933: Because Zoff was of Jewish descent, which under the Nazi regime usually resulted in a professional disqualification ("Berufsverbot"), Lingen thought about going into exile. However because of his great popularity with the general public he was given a special permit by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to continue to perform and was able to protect his wife from persecution. In 1936 Gustaf Gründgens placed Lingen at the ensemble of the Berlin Prussian State Theatre. He also directed films like "Hauptsache glücklich" (1941) starring Heinz Rühmann.
In 1944 Lingen moved to Vienna, and in view of the approaching Red Army retired to his cottage at Strobl on the Wolfgangsee shortly afterwards. Here for a few days in May 1945, he acted as "de facto" mayor, when he managed to disempower the local Nazi authorities and surrendered to the US Army at St. Gilgen. Lingen's measures were followed by the liberation of King Leopold III of Belgium and his wife by the 106th Cavalry Regiment.
After the war he became a naturalised Austrian citizen, and from 1948 worked as a character actor at the Vienna Burgtheater and appeared frequently onstage in Germany, most notably in Carl Sternheim satires directed by Rudolf Noelte. Foremeost however he pursued his film career, performing in numerous comedies of varied quality, in his later days of the 1970s also on television.
Theo Lingen died of cancer in 1978 at the age of 75 in Vienna. The city of Vienna dedicated a grave to him at the Zentralfriedhof. The municipalities of Strobl and Lingen (in 2007) have named squares in his honor.

Uerdingen railbus

The Uerdingen railbus (German: "Uerdinger Schienenbus") is the common term for the multiple units which were developed by the German firm of Waggonfabrik Uerdingen for the Deutsche Bundesbahn and private railways after the Second World War. These vehicles were diesel-powered, twin-axle railbuses of light construction. The diesel motors were built into the chassis underneath the vehicle. The VT 95 (later DB Class 795) and VT 98 (later DB Class 798) of the former Deutsche Bundesbahn in particular, are associated with this concept. These vehicles were employed in passenger train duties on branch lines where steam or diesel train operations were less profitable. Including the units built under licence, a total of 1,492 power cars were built from 1950 to 1971; and the total number of units, including trailer and driving cars, was 3,306.
The majority of these vehicles were built by the Waggonfabrik Uerdingen. However, due to the large numbers ordered, vehicles were also made by other coach builders such as MAN, although these factories could offer their own classes of railbus like the MAN railbus, and in Spain they were built by CAF, Macosa, and Verdingen as FER-560/FRC-560 Ferrobús (railbus).
The railbus, much loved by passengers, was also nicknamed the "Rote Brummer" ("Red Buzzer") because of the loud noise it made when driving. In North Germany the railbus was also often known as the "Ferkeltaxe" ("Piglet Taxi"). Amongst railway fans it was also called the "Retter der Nebenbahnen" ("Branch Line Saviour").
Classes.
Prototypes.
In 1950 the Deutsche Bundesbahn placed twelve single-motored prototypes in a total of three different models; eleven units had a wheelbase of 4.50 m, the twelfth had a wheelbase of 6.0 m, which became the standard on the production vehicles. They were braked using a foot brake and had double doors. The prototypes were given operating numbers VT 95 901 to 911 and 912, the latter was soon renumbered to VT 95 9112 because of its longer wheelbase. Suitable trailer cars were also placed in service.
VT 95 series (Class 795, single motor).
The VT 95.9 was developed based on the experience gained with the prototypes and was delivered in 1952 by Waggonfabrik Uerdingen. 557 single-motored Class VT 95.9 units were built, as well as 564 Class VB 142 trailer cars and 60 two-wheeled railbus trailers for the transportation of luggage.
Its furnishings are very simple and resemble those in a bus (hence the name "Schienenbus" or "railbus"): one large open coach shared also by the engine driver, seats which can be folded two-ways depending on the direction of travel and simple lighting from bare light bulbs with no covers. The production vehicles were braked using a driver's brake valve.
The vehicles had a Büssing motor and six gears.
They had centre buffer couplings and "Stoßfederbügel" instead of buffers.
15 VT 95 railbuses and 15 VB 142 trailer cars were delivered to the railways in Saarland in 1956. They were painted in DB red livery with the inscription "SAAR". On the annexation of the Saarland into the Federal Republich of Germany these railbuses were taken over by the Bundesbahn.
In 1968 the vehicles were reclassified into Class 795 (power car) and Class 995 (trailer car).
Contrary to usual operating practice the VT 95 could also be coupled to two VB 142 trailers.
VT 98 series (Classes 798 and BR 796, two motors).
The VT 98.9 evolved from the VT 95.9 which, with its single motor, was too underpowered for many lines. The VT 98.9 was therefore fitted with two driving motors. Because this variant of the railbus was fitted with normal buffers and screw couplings, it could haul other types of wagon or be placed at the end of other trains hauled by other locomotives.
Büssing Type 10 underfloor motors were installed in all units, the same engine as those on the Büssing Type D2U double-decker buses used in Berlin. The six-way gearbox was suppliled by ZF Friedrichshafen.
In addition to the 329 power cars, 220 VB 98 trailer cars with luggage compartments, 100 VB 98s without luggage compartments and 321 VS 98 driving cars were produced. In the DB they were mainly used in a VT+VB+VS configuaration. However there were also two-unit VT+VS formations as well as longer rakes of up to six units: VT+VB+VS+VT+VB+VS. In 1968 they were reclassified into Class 798, the trailers became 998.0-3 and driving cars 998.6-9. On the latter the serial numbers were increased by 600 (e.g. VS 98 001 became 998 601-9).
A few VT were modernised and were given a special white and mint green livery. These railbuses worked in Chiemgau (Aschau–Prien), as did the vehicles of the "Ulmer Spatz". Otherwise the railbuses were painted in red, the typical DB colour for motive power units.
In 1988 47 power cars, 23 trailer cars and 43 driving cars were converted for one-man operation. They were given pneumatic door-closing equipment and a ticket counter for the engine driver. These railbuses were redesignated as Class 796.
Special class VT 97.9 (Class 797, rack railway vehicle).
Eight power cars were designed as rack railway engines and designated as Class VT 97.9; the six driving cars as VS 97 001 to 97 006. Their top speed climbing uphill was 15 km/h on the rack section, otherwise it was 90 km/h. The VTs were used on the Honau–Lichtenstein rack railway in the Swabian Jura and, from 1964 to 1965, VT 97 901 was even employed in goods duties on the Passau–Wegscheid line due to the lack of suitable locomotives. After the closure of rack railway routes the cogwheel drive was removed. The vehicles were once more designated as VT 97.9 or from 1968 as 797. Their area of operations included the branch line from Göppingen to Boll (the "Voralbbahn"), until this line was closed on 27 May 1989.
Operations with the Deutsche Bahn.
Passenger services.
These railbuses were used on almost every branch line and for feeder services on many main lines.
Its last regular work on passenger services with the Deutsche Bahn AG finished in 2000 at Bahnbetriebswerk Tübingen. These were twin-motored VT 98.9 versions, most of the single-motored VT 95.9 units had already been retired by 1980. In Köln-Nippes a 795 was still being used until 1983 for railway workers.
Departmental vehicles.
Many Uerdingen railbuses were converted into railway departmental vehicles. For example, the prototype VT 95 906 was converted into an Indusi measurement car (and redesignated as "DB Class 724"). It was operated out of the signalling workshop at Wuppertal.
Other converted Uerdingen railbuses are sometimes used today as cars for rail testing, track measurement and LZB measurement, and as tool vans or signalling maintenance vehicles.
Museum vehicles.
Many of these robust and well-loved railbuses were sold to railway societies and museums, and are still working today in museum duties.
For example, railbuses are still used by the Deutsche Bahn, even if the actual vehicles are provided by railway societies. One multiple is painted in Regionalbahn colours and runs on summer weekends for tourists on the "Schwäbische Albbahn" and the "Donautalbahn" between Ulm Hauptbahnhof and Kleinengstingen. These trains run in the timetable as an entirely normal Regionalbahn service; The first car has a plate on it with the notice "im Auftrag der DB" (under contract to the DB). To be consistent, all the normal DB local fares (and at times the NALDO and DING combined fares) apply. The former Chiemgaubahn railbuses, which were painted in white and mint green, are used for this, along with others. This formation is also called the "Ulmer Spatz".
Other vehicles are in service with the:
Uerdingen railbuses are also owned by the
German private railways.
Many private railways have bought second-hand Uerdingen railbuses from the Deutsche Bahn. The Hersfelder Kreisbahn procure new ones, though, including a three-unit set with rubber corridor connectors and gangways. Used cars of this type were employed, "inter alia" by the Elbe-Weser Railway and Transport Company and the AKN Railway for local services.
In 1993 the Düren Kreisbahn (DKB) bought ten VT 98, modernised them, painted them blue and white and placed them in service on the "Rurtalbahn" until their duties were subsumed by RegioSprinters in 1995.
The Vt 203 was sold by the Düren Kreisbahn to the Hümmlinger Kreisbahn museum railway. The museums is refurbishing the railbus to make it operational again, giving it the DB number 798 514, and will work it between Werlte and Lathen.
Other second-hand VT 98s were bought by the Prignitz Railway– both from Deutsche Bahn and the DKB – painted in a blue andred livery and used on lines in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. Since 2003 the railbuses have been replaced however by Regio-Shuttle RS1s; only one power car (T11) is still working and available for specials.
At present the Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn works the Düben-Heide Railway between Wittenberg and Bad Schmiedeberg with a railbus running scheduled services.

Palaeochenoides

Palaeochenoides is a genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds of somewhat doubtful validity. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Only a single species, Palaeochenoides mioceanus, is known to date. The first fossil assigned to it – a distal right femur piece – was found near the source of the Stono River in Charleston County, South Carolina (USA). At first it was believed to be from the Early Miocene Hawthorne Formation – its specific name, seemingly referring to the "Miocene ocean" as presumed habitat but actually a simple spelling error for "miocaenus", "from the Miocene", that was never corrected and hence became valid – alludes to this. But in fact no Hawthorne Formation rocks were known in the Charleston region when the fossil was found, and consequently modern authors consider a Chattian (Late Oligocene) age more likely and suggest the fossil came from the Cooper or Chandler Bridge Formation. Specimen MCZ 2514, a distal left tarsometatarsus fragment from the Ashley River, was more tentatively assigned to "P. mioceanus" later on; it was also erroneously believed to be from the Hawthorne Formation.
Description and systematics.
The holotype femur's classification mirrors the recently renewed uncertainties about the pseudotooth birds' placement. At the time of its description, when it was still much surrounded by matrix, it was believed to be from a giant goose or swan. This is referred to in the genus name, which means "ancient goose-like But only one year later, the bone had been prepared from the matrix and ws submitted to an improvised phenetic analysis of its details. It was compared to that of Anserinae and Dendrocygninae (other Anseriformes were either similar to these or too unlike "P. mioceanus"), as well as with Pelecanidae, Phaetontidae and Phalacrocoraciformes of the "higher waterbird" radiation, and found to resemble the former in one, the latter in 4 out of 5 traits. Some minor details of the femur were also unlike in the Anseriformes. The study proposed the fossil bird to have been "a large steganopod [... somewhat larger than "Pelecanus erythrorhynchos" or "P. onocrotalus"," and not securely assignable to a known family. But as cladistic analysis had not yet been developed, it was of course not studied whether the similarities between "P. mioceanus" and the "higher waterbirds" are apomorphies. It has been noted, however, that adaptation to oceanic habits, has induced in pseudotooth bird legs and feet features convergent to other seabirds. Still, the fossil is a rather good specimen, considering how little humerus material known from pseudotooth birds; a recent cladistic analysis (which did not include "P. mioceanus") did not put much emphasis on humerus traits, for example, as so few good fossils are known.
When Witmer Stone, then editor of "The Auk", commented on the taxonomic confusion that the bird caused during less than 25 months after its description, he noted:
"It would seem desirable that those who name fossil birds should not fashion their generic names on those of existing birds as it is embarrassing to find them shifted into other families or orders where the name becomes somewhat of a misnomer!"
Of the tarsometatarsus, only the end remains, but this is complete and even not very much abraded. Only on the edges of the outer trochleae does significant material seem to be lost. Altogether, the bone is very similar to that of the sympatric and probably contemporary "Tympanonesiotes wetmorei", only appearing a bit less albatross-like. The spread of the toes must have resembled that found in a fulmar quite a lot, by contrast. The thin-walled bone has a second toe trochlea that attaches notably kneewards from the others and is angled slightly outwards while the hallux was vestigial or missing, as is typical for the pseudotooth birds. The fossil is about one-quarter larger than that of "Tympanonesiotes", with a maximum end width of – probably a bit more in life, as the trochlea rims are eroded away. The shaft is wide at the point where it flares into the trochleae. It was thus more than twice as large as "Odontoptila inexpectata" from the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of the Ouled Abdoul Basin (Morocco), and – like "Osteodontornis orri" – thus belonged to the large pseudotooth birds, with a wingspan of more than 5, perhaps as much as 6 m (16–20 ft). Its bill was presumably long and massive as in its relatives, and in length the bird exceeded the largest pelicans.
The early systematic uncertainties have been noted again in recent times, in the scope of the debate whether the pseudotooth birds were Galloanseres closely related to waterfowl or Neoaves related to pelicans. Meanwhile, as a presumed pelican relative, "P. mioceanus" was allied with "Cyphornis" (another pseudotooth bird, known only from a proximal left tarsometatarsus) and placed in a family Cyphornithidae. This was subsequently assigned to a "pelecaniform" suborder Cladornithes. But the enigmatic Late Oligocene "Cladornis" – the type genus of that supposed suborder – from the Argentinian part of Patagonia is known from a distal right tarsometatarsus only, and thus was not directly comparable to "Palaeochenoides" and "Cyphornis". "Tympanonesiotes wetmorei", yet another pseudotooth bird, known from a distal right tarsometatarsus fragment, was initially presumed to be similar to "Cladornis" however, and also to "Cyphornis"; consequently, the three genera were allied simply because of their size and some similarities to the corresponding bones of pelicans. Today however, "Cladornis" is more generally held to be a terrestrial bird rather than a seabird.
As regards the supposed Cyphornithidae, most if not all pseudotooth birds placed there are probably closely related to the better-known "Pelagornis", type genus of the family Pelagornithidae. And even if "Cyphornis" is the senior synonym of "Palaeochenoides" and "Tympanoneisiotes" (which is not overly likely due to size differences), according to the rules of zoological nomenclature the family name Pelagornithidae would not be affected. Cyphornithidae would almost certainly be a junior synonym of Pelagornithidae even if the pseudotooth birds are (as some have proposed) divided into several families – rather than being all placed in the Pelagornithidae as is usual nowadays – as "Cyphornis", "Osteodontornis", "Palaeochenoides", "Pelagornis" and perhaps the smaller "Tympanoneisiotes" appear to be very closely related and are probably part of a monophyletic lineage of (usually) giant pseudotooth birds. As at the time of its description no adequarte comparaticve material was known, it was explicitly cautioned that "P. mioceanus" might include "Pseudodontornis" – which may actually be synonymous with "Pelagornis".

Barwałd Górny is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, within Wadowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It lies approximately west of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, east of Wadowice, and south-west of the regional capital Kraków.
The land was vested probably at the end of the thirteenth century with an owner named Barwałd. The first mention of the settlement comes from 1381, the property of Barvaltu Sulek, from the fifteenth century it was known as Barwałdzcy. 
In the sixteenth century, the division was into three villages of Barwałdu: Barwałd Top / Upper, Middle and Bottom. In 1540, the village was bought by King Sigismund the Old and incorporated into the Royal Zator. The Zatorscy governors used the local people to cut wood, the wood was sent to Zator. From the sixteenth century, the village belongs to Szaczowskich family, then Russockich, then the Porębscy in the seventeenth century, and the Gołuchowscy in the eighteenth / nineteenth century. On the outskirts of the forest in the village, the Wallachian population incarcerated at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth century Tartar captives, Cossack and Russian. Starosta barwałdzki Wierzbowski Hermione told the local population to pay the rent, instead of being in serfdom to the castle in Zator. In 1665, Janowski Bębnowski displaced the peasants of the villager from their land and assuming it as his own farm. 
The construction of the railway took place in 1888 with a route through the center of the village and a railway station was opened. On 24 November 1944 a passenger train from Zakopane to Kraków collided with a German freight train, at least 130 people killed. 
In 1945 the Blotnickich mansion was demolished. 
The Chapel hermitage of Saint. Rosalie in Upper Barwałdzie - this antique wooden hermitage, probably dating from the mid-eighteenth century. It consists of two chapels of St. Rosalie and St. Mary Magdalene and the cell-hermitage. Inside are a baroque altar of Our Lady and of St. Rosalie, there are two baroque paintings of 1747 of Christmas and the Adoration of the Magi, the is also a nineteenth-century votive images related to the Passion Mysteries showing pilgrims on their pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Calvary.

The wooden parish church of St. Erasmus was built in the second half of the 18th century. It was financed by the district landlord, Jan Biberstein-Starowieyski. The spire is a remnant of the previous 16th-century church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The layout, in which the spire is located to the east of the chancel, is unusual and rarely found. There is polychrome decoration dating from the end of the 18th century, which features figurative, vegetative and geometric motifs. On the chancel ceiling you can see a painting of The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, while in the nave there is The Transfiguration of Our Lord on Mount Tabor.

Pelagornis

Pelagornis is a widely known genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Description.
Three species have been formally described, but several other named taxa of pseudotooth birds might belong in "Pelagornis" too. The type species Pelagornis miocaenus is known from Aquitanian (Early Miocene) sediments – formerly believed to be of Middle Miocene age – of Armagnac (France). The original specimen on which "P. miocaenus" was founded was a left humerus almost the size of a human arm. The scientific name – "the most unimaginative name ever applied to a fossil" in the view of Storrs L. Olson – does in no way refer to the bird's startling and at that time unprecedented proportions, and merely means "Miocene pelagic bird". Like many pseudotooth birds, it was initially believed to be related to the albatrosses in the tube-nosed seabirds (Procellariiformes), but subsequently placed in the Pelecaniformes where it was either placed in the cormorant and gannet suborder (Sulae) or united with other pseudotooth birds in a suborder Odontopterygia.
While "P. miocaenus" was the first pseudotooth bird species to be described scientifically, its congener Pelagornis mauretanicus was only named in 2008. It was a slightly distinct and markedly younger species. Its remains have been found in 2.5 Ma Gelasian (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene, MN17) deposits at Ahl al Oughlam (Morocco).
Additional fossils are placed in "Pelagornis", usually without assignment to species, mainly due to their large size and Miocene age. From the USA, such specimens have been found in the Middle Miocene Calvert Formation of Maryland and Virginia, and in the contemporary Pungo River Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina (though at least one other pelagornithid is probably represented among this material too). USNM 244174 (a tarsometatarsus fragment) was found near Charleston, South Carolina and assigned to "P. miocaenus", and the slightly smaller left tarsometatarsal middle trochlea USNM 476044 might also belong here. A broken but fairly complete sternum probably of this genus, specimen LHNB (CCCP)-1, is known from the Serravallian-Tortonian boundary (Middle to Late Miocene) near Costa da Caparica in Portugal. Contemporary are certain specimens
The fossil specimens show that "P. miocaenus" was one of the large pseudotooth birds, hardly less in size than "Osteodontornis" or the older "Dasornis". Its head must have been about long in life, and its wingspan was probably more than , perhaps closer to 6 m (20 ft). Unlike in its contemporary "Osteodontornis" but like in the older "Pseudodontornis", between each two of "Pelagornis"'s large "teeth" was a single smaller one. "Pelagornis" differed from "Dasornis" and its smaller contemporary "Odontopteryx" in having no pneumatic foramen in the fossa pneumotricipitalis of the humerus, a single long latissimus dorsi muscle attachment site on the humerus instead of two distinct segments, and no prominent ligamentum collateralis ventralis attachment knob on the ulna. Further differences between "Odontopteryx" and "Pelagornis" are found in the tarsometatarsus: in the latter, it has a deep fossa of the hallux' first metatarsal bone, whereas its middle-toe trochlea is not conspicuously expanded forward. The salt glands inside the eye sockets were extremely large and well-developed in "Pelagornis". From the humerus pieces of specimen LACM 127875, found in the Eo-Oligocene Pittsburg Bluff Formation near Mist, Oregon (USA), "P. miocaenus" differs in an external tuberosity that is not as much extended shoulderwards and that is separated from the elbow end by a wider depression. Palmarly, the humerus head is turned more to the inward side and the large protuberance found there is not as far towards the end. The Waipara River humerus mentioned above agrees with "P. miocaenus" in that respect. If the Oregon fossils are related to "Cyphornis" and/or "Osteodontornis", and if the traits as found in "P. miocaenus" and the New Zealand specimen are apomorphic, the latter two may indeed be very close relatives.
Synonyms and relationships.
A humerus from the Muséum d'Histoire naturelle de Bordeaux was labelled "Pelagornis Delfortrii 1869". Though the name from the label had been listed in the synonymy of "P. miocaenus", neither does it seem to be a validly established taxon nor was the specimen compared with "P. miocaenus" remains. It seems to refer to one of the syntypes of the procellariiform "Plotornis delfortrii" – found at Léognan (France) and also of Aquitanian age – from which that species was described in the 1870s by Alphonse Milne-Edwards: when the "nomen nudum" "Pelagornis delfortrii" is listed in the synonymy of "P. miocaenus", the pseudotooth bird is claimed to be known from the Léognan deposits also, whereas it has not actually been found there. "Pseudodontornis", meanwhile, is a generally Paleogene genus of huge pseudotooth birds. All its species are not uncommonly considered synonymous with earlier-described taxa. The (probably) Eo-Oligocene type species "Pseudodontornis longirostris" might belong in "Pelagornis", though given its uncertain age and provenance a comparison with undisputed "Pelagornis" material – which is currently lacking – would seem to be necessary before such a step is taken. In that respect, "Palaeochenoides mioceanus" was also hypothesized to include "P. longirostris", and would need to be compared with "Pelagornis" to see whether it does not belong here too.
There has been little dedicated study of the relationships of "Pelagornis", for while quite a lot of remains are known from the present genus, those of most other pseudotooth birds are few and far between and direct comparisons are further hampered by the damaged state of most remains. The large "Gigantornis eaglesomei" from the Middle Eocene Atlantic was established based on a broken but not too incomplete sternum and might actually belong in "Dasornis". In "Gigantornis" the articular facet for the furcula consists of a flat section at the very tip of the sternal keel and a similar one set immediately above it at an outward angle, and the spina externa is shaped like an Old French shield in cross-section. The slightly smaller LHNB (CCCP)-1 has a less sharply protruding sternal keel, the articular facet for the furcula consists of a large knob at the forward margin, and the spina externa is narrow in cross-section. While these differences are quite conspicuous, the two fossils are clearly of closely related huge dynamically soaring seabirds, and considering the 30 million years or so that separate "Gigantornis" and LHNB (CCCP)-1, the Paleogene taxon may be very close to the Miocene bird's ancestor nonwithstanding their differences.
In any case, the family name of the pseudotooth birds, Pelagornithidae, as the senior synonym has widely replaced the once-commonly used Pseudodontornithidae. It may be that "Pseudodontornis" belongs to a distinct lineage of these birds, and then the family name would perhaps be revalidated. Also, the presumed similarity between "Dasornis" and the smaller "Odontopteryx" seems to be a symplesiomorphy that is not informative regarding their relationships to each other and with "Pelagornis". Rather, it is likely that the huge pseudotooth birds form a clade, and in this case, Pseudodontornithidae like Cyphornithidae and Dasornithidae is correctly placed in the synonymy of Pelagornithidae even if several families were accepted in the Odontopterygiformes.

Pseudodontornis

Pseudodontornis is a rather disputed genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds. The pseudotooth birds or pelagornithids were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty. Up to five species are commonly recognized in this genus.
But actually the genus "Pseudodontornis" is barely more than a "nomen nudum". And though it served as the namesake for a popular alternate common name of the pseudotooth birds – "pseudodontorns" or "pseudodontornids" – that was extensively used in the 20th century, current authors prefer "pelagornithids" because this is less fraught with taxonomic dispute. "Pelagornis", the type genus of the family Pelagornithidae, was long unrecognized as a pseudotooth bird as it was known mainly from arm bones. Thus, though the Pelagornithidae were long recognized as very distinct, they were allied with the cormorant and gannet in suborder Sulae (or superfamily Sulides in suborder Pelecanae) before it was recognized that they are actually pseudotooth birds. The presumed family "Pelagornithidae", deemed invalid nowadays, had been recognized as pseudotooth birds all along, as they were established based on skull fossils preserving parts of the "toothed" beak.
One of the species typically placed here – though in fact one that is rather unlikely to actually belong in "Pseudodontornis" – is the only smallish pseudotooth bird species known with certainty from the Neogene as of 2009. However, the enigmatic "Tympanonesiotes" was of similar size and may also be of Neogene age.
Type species and description.
The type species P. longirostris (initially placed in "Odontopteryx") is known from an incomplete but quite well preserved fossil skull of unknown age and origin; it was bought from a merchant who had acquired it from a sailor returning from Brazil, but the specimen is widely presumed to be actually from the North Sea region. It is tentatively assigned an Eocene age, if only due to the fact that suitable lagerstätten of different age were not known when the specimen was discovered. If not from Europe however, its age is truly undeterminable. A pseudotooth bird's lower right dentary piece (specimen YPM 4617) from near Charleston, South Carolina (USA) – apparently dredged up from near the source of the Stono River – was provisionally assigned to "P. longirostris" as it closely matches the holotype in size and appearance. At first the South Carolina fossil was believed to be from the Early Miocene Hawthorne Formation, but in fact no Hawthorne Formation sediments were known in the Charleston region when the fossil was found. Consequently, modern authors consider a Chattian (Late Oligocene) age more likely and suggest the fossil came from the Cooper or Chandler Bridge Formation. Some fossil remains from the Middle Miocene Bahía Inglesa Formation of Chile were prematurely affiliated with "P. longirostris" in error; they are, if anything, of "Pelagornis". 
The holotype skull seems to have been lost, but judging from the description the genus might actually be a junior synonym of the (probably) Late Oligocene "Palaeochenoides", or either or both might properly belong in the otherwise Miocene "Pelagornis". Like in that latter genus, between each two of "P. longirostris" large "teeth" was a single smaller one; whether there were even smaller points in addition as in "Pelagornis"' allopatric contemporary "Osteodontornis" cannot be ascertained. Its paroccipital process is not as markedly elongated back- and downwards as in the Ypresian (Early Eocene) "Dasornis" and "Odontopteryx" and seems to be in a more apomorphic condition, which would agree with a late Paleogene, possibly even (like "Pelagornis") Neogene age for the holotype. Its quadrate bone had a broad main shaft like in "Odontopteryx" which like in that genus bore a broad lateral ridge that was not, however, curved, but straight as in "Osteodontornis"; like in that genus, the forward center of the quadrate's ventral articulation ridge extended upwards. Unlike in either "Odontopteryx" or "Osteodontornis", the quadrate of "P. longirostris" had a socket for the quadratojugal that was displaced dorsally. However its relationships may be, there can be no doubt that the mysterious skull was from one of the large pelagornithids, and the living bird must have had a wingspan of more than 5, quite possibly as much as 6 m (16–20 ft).
Other species.
It is not entirely resolved whether the other four "Pseudodontornis" are indeed valid and distinct species. P. tenuirostris was proposed for a Late Paleocene-Early Eocene pseudotooth bird from Herne Bay, Kent (England), and P. tschulensis is an approximately contemporary species from Zhylga (Kazakhstan) that is sometimes placed in "Odontopteryx". P. longidentata was described from the Ypresian London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England); it is probably a junior synonym of "Macrodontopteryx oweni" (or "Odontopteryx oweni") or – more likely due to its size – "Dasornis emuinus".
"P." stirtoni is a supposed Neogene member of this lineage. It was described from a crushed skull and femur found on Motunau Beach on the eastern coast of the South Island, New Zealand. It, too, lacks crucial data; though there are suggestions that it is from the Greta Siltstone Formation or elsewhere in the Late Pliocene (Waitotaran) and dates back only 3.5 Ma (million years ago) – which would make it one of the very last of the pseudotooth birds –, its age can only be constrained to some time during the Miocene or Pliocene, i.e. a period of 20 million years. The Motunau Beach skull resembles the roughly contemporary "Osteodontornis" of the North Pacific in having a jugal arch that is short and very stout behind the orbital process of the prefrontal bone – apparently unlike in "P. longirostris". But the fossil femur measures – only half as large as that of "Osteodontornis" (or "P. longirostris", for that matter). ""P." stirtoni" was thus marginally larger than the Australian Pelican ("Pelecanus conspicillatus") of our time, or about the size of the small Paleogene pseudotooth bird "Odontopteryx toliapica". Also of this species might be a proximal right radius and a distal right humerus – McKee collection A080 183 and A111 182, respectively – from the Waipipian (around 3 Ma) Tangahoe Mudstone Formation at Hawera on New Zealand's North Island. They are a fairly good match in size for the ""P." stirtoni" holotype. Though the proposed separation of this species in a monotypic genus Neodontornis has been generally rejected, given the fossils' distinctness from "P. longirostris" in age, features, occurrence and size, it may just as well be appropriate.
Pseudotooth bird fossils from Early to Middle Miocene Astoria and perhaps also Nye Formations of Oregon have also been assigned to "Pseudodontornis". This is due to a writer's error, however, and should be "pseudodontornids". These remains are probably referrable to "Osteodontornis".

Untitled Korn album

The untitled eighth studio album by American rock band Korn was released on July 31, 2007, through Virgin Records and is the first album without longtime drummer David Silveria. The standard edition holds thirteen tracks, whereas the deluxe edition holds fourteen. The album was intentionally released without a title, as vocalist Jonathan Davis reasoned, "Why not just let our fans call it whatever they wanna call it?" The album was certified Gold in the US on October 30, 2007. As of January 4, 2013, it has sold 1,449,723 copies worldwide in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.
Background information.
This album was the first without former drummer David Silveria, instead, Korn enlisted the help of Terry Bozzio, Brooks Wackerman, as well as Jonathan Davis for drumming. Also, the band recruited Zac Baird as keyboardist on this album. An MTV article published on May 17, 2007 includes an interview with Munky as he details the process of the new studio album, while also revealing several song titles. On May 28, vocalist Jonathan Davis joined Dutch radio station 3FM immediately after his performance at the Pinkpop Festival. He commented on the band's upcoming album, stating it "will not be titled." He elaborated, "We had the world's greatest drummer Terry Bozzio in and Brooks Wackerman from Bad Religion in and I played drums on some songs too. I'm so proud of it, we just can't wait to show people what we've done." Davis went on to say "We didn't want to label this album. It has no boundaries. It has no limits and why not just let our fans call it whatever they wanna call it?" It is the first and only Korn album to ever be recorded by the band as a three piece.
Terry Bozzio's contributions.
After successfully recording six tracks with Bozzio, Zac Baird announced that Bozzio would not be touring with the band on the Family Values Tour 2007. Jonathan Davis claims "things just got weird Bozzio." Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion was brought in to record some tracks, and even Jonathan Davis himself contributed, something not done since 1999's "Issues". Munky stated in an interview that Bozzio had imposed himself on the band. He mentioned that among other things, Bozzio had demanded to be a full member of the band while receiving 25% interest; the band felt that this was "offensive", therefore, Korn decided not to tour with Bozzio. Joey Jordison of Slipknot would tour with Korn on the Family Values Tour, along with the Bitch We Have a Problem Tour.
The Matrix's departure.
When premiering the single "Evolution" on KROQ on May 16, 2007, guitarist Munky noted that the band re-recorded much of The Matrix's tracks with Atticus Ross because of the band being dissatisfied with how the material had turned out. This was later confirmed in a Reuters/Billboard article:
Musical style.
"We always wanted the atmospheres, and to really go deep," guitarist Munky told Billboard. "It wasn't until this record that we really felt comfortable to do that. As records progress, the urge to do that becomes greater. We feel like we've finally solidified ourselves in the rock world, and wanted to take this one a little deeper into that direction. It's less pop, and it's more experimental." Jonathan Davis said of the songs, "I don't want to say that it's heavy, because that pisses the other band members off. It's still the Korn sound, but it's also very atmospheric."
Release.
The album was released through EMI/Virgin in various territories, starting on July 27, 2007. The band ventured on the trio's Family Values Tour 2007 several days prior to the release and toured in support of the new record. The deluxe edition contains the bonus track "Sing Sorrow" (which precedes the thirteenth track, "I Will Protect You"), a bonus DVD containing behind-the-scenes footage, hundreds of never-before seen photos of the band. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, a personal best since "Untouchables". Though debuting at number two like "Untouchables", the untitled album sold less than one quarter of the units in its first week. It also fell off the charts within twelve weeks, accumulating twenty weeks altogether.
Critical reception.
Critical response to the album has been mixed, Metacritic scoring the album 51, while the user's average score is 7.4/10.<br>The most positive reviews coming from "IGN", "The Gauntlet", and "Billboard". "IGN" noted that "There's an overall cohesion from start to finish, and repeated listens continue to reveal new and intriguing elements at every turn, which bodes well for the future", while "The Gauntlet" wrote " 'Untitled' is the most articulate recording the band has delivered to date." "Entertainment Weekly" also praised the album as being the band's best release "since 1999's 'Issues' ".
On the contrary, Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the band is going through a "middle-age slump" and that the album "doesn't break them out of it." "Rolling Stone" asserted that Korn sounds "wounded and diminished", while PopMatters agreed, calling it "tired, bland and dated... merely going through the motions rather than creating honest music."

Taisto Mäki

Taisto Armas Mäki (2 December 1910 – 1 May 1979) was a Finnish long-distance runner - one of the so-called "Flying Finns". Like his coach and close friend, Paavo Nurmi, Mäki broke world records over two miles, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres - holding the records simultaneously between 1939 and 1942. Mäki was the first man to run 10,000 metres in less than 30 minutes, breaking his own world record in a time of 29:52.6 on 17 September 1939.
Mäki was born in Rekola in the municipality of Vantaa. He was a shepherd by trade, earning him the nickname "Rekolan paimenpoika" (the "Rekola herdboy"). At a time when Finland dominated men's long-distance running, Mäki did not come to prominence until 1938. In September of that year, in what proved to be his only appearance at a major championships, he won the 5000 metres at the European Championships in Paris, beating Swede Henry Jonsson and fellow Finn Kauko Pekuri into second and third place with a time of 14:26.8. On 29 September 1938, less than four weeks after winning in Paris, Mäki broke the 10,000 m world record for the first time, beating Ilmari Salminen's old record by more than three seconds in a time of 30:02.0. Mäki went on to break five world records during the following summer. On 7 June he took close to three seconds off Miklós Szabó's two mile world record, running a time of 8:53.2 in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. Nine days later, in the same stadium, he took over eight seconds off Lauri Lehtinen's world record over 5000 metres. He followed these performances by taking close to ten seconds off his own 10,000 m world record, running 29:52.6 on 17 September.
The Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union broke out on 30 November 1939. Like many of his fellow Flying Finns, including Gunnar Höckert and Lauri Lehtinen, Mäki was initially deployed on the Karelian Isthmus. However, along with Paavo Nurmi, he was sent on a tour of the United States in February 1940 in order to raise money for the Finnish Relief Fund. During the tour, which lasted for two months and culminated in an appearance in front of 14,000 people at Madison Square Garden, the two men raced against hand-picked American athletes. Mäki's times during the tour were well below those he had set the previous summer, the cause of which was a matter of much debate at the time. Mäki's career was cut short by service in World War II. The conflict had also caused the cancellation of the 1940 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, and with it ending Mäki's hopes of representing his country at the Olympic Games.

Raphael of Lesvos

St. Raphael the Newly Appeared Martyr of Lesvos (1410 – 9 April 1463) is an Eastern Orthodox saint martyred by Turkish soldiers with his companions Sts. Nicholas and Irene on Bright Tuesday (April 9) of 1463, a decade after the Fall of Constantinople.
Forgotten Martyrs.
For almost five centuries the inhabitants of Lesvos would visit the ruins of a monastery near the village of Thermi, northwest of the capital Mytilene, on Bright Tuesday. These people had forgotten the specific reason for the annual pilgrimage but remembered that Turkish soldiers had murdered monks in the old monastery there many years ago.
Discovery of Relics.
The devout Angelos Rallis chose to construct a chapel by the monastery ruins in 1959. That July 3, workers found the holy relics of St. Raphael as they cleared rubble, and shortly thereafter St. Raphael, along with Sts. Nicholas and Irene, started appearing to many Lesvos residents and told them the stories of their lives.
Youth.
The saint revealed that he was born to devout parents on the island of Ithaca ca. 1410. Though baptized with the name George, he was tonsured Raphael and became a hieromonk, and eventually became Archimandrite and Chancellor.
Later life.
The year Constantinople fell, St. Raphael lived in Macedonia with the deacon Nicholas, a Thessaloniki native. The two fled to Lesvos after the 1454 Turkish invasion of Thrace. They ended up in the Monastery of the Nativity of the Theotokos near Thermi, of which St. Raphael became the igumen, or abbot.
Martyrdom.
Turkish soldiers invaded Lesvos and raided the monastery, kidnapping St. Raphael and his fellow monks. The twelve-year-old Irene had been tortured, then burned alive in a large earthenware jar in the presence of her parents. The Turks tortured St. Raphael from Holy Thursday until Bright Tuesday, then tied him to a tree and sawed through his jaw, murdering him. Thus St. Raphael received the crown of martyrdom. Saint Nicholas (his deacon) died at the sight of this.
Apparitions and Other Miracles.
St. Raphael appeared alone and, on other occasions, with Sts. Nicholas and Irene of Lesvos, expressing to the inhabitants his desire for veneration, an icon painting, and the composition of a church service. Photios Kontoglou painted the icon of the saints based on witness descriptions and Father Gerasimos of the Little St. Anne Skete on Mt. Athos composed the church service for them.
There are numerous accounts of miracles worked by St. Raphael and his companions for people who show devotion to the saints. These miracles include supernatural healing of the sick and injured, and the strengthening of faith.

Tympanonesiotes

Tympanonesiotes is a somewhat doubtfully valid genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Species and taxonomy.
Only a single species, Tympanonesiotes wetmorei, is known to date. The only known specimen (USNM 16809), a distal right tarsometatarsus end, was found in the Cooper River near Drum Island at Charleston, South Carolina (USA). At first it was believed to be from the Early Miocene Hawthorne Formation, but as it seems its actual age cannot be precisely determined: For one thing, no Hawthorne Formation deposits were known in the region where the fossil was found. However, close to its type locality, fossils of Late Miocene animals have been found reworked from a now-eroded layer of rock into older deposits, such as the Chattian (Late Oligocene) sediments of the Cooper or Chandler Bridge Formation where the specimen of "T. wetmorei" was presumably found. The much-worn pseudotooth bird bone may also be such a reworked specimen.
The genus' scientific name references the type locality: it is derived from Ancient Greek "tympanon" (drum) + "nesiotes" (islander). The specific name honors the famous ornithologist Alexander Wetmore; thus the scientific name means roughly "Alexander Wetmore's Drum Island bird".
Description.
The bone is not very well preserved; for most of its length only the anterior surface remains. What remains of the trochleae is still preserved in good detail however. Altogether, the bone is very similar to that of the sympatric and probably contemporary "Palaeochenoides mioceanus", only appearing a bit more albatross-like. The spread of the toes must have resembled that found in a fulmar quite a lot, by contrast. The thin-walled bone has a second toe trochlea that attaches notably kneewards from the others and is angled slightly outwards while the hallux was vestigial or missing, as is typical for the pseudotooth birds. The fossil is about one-quarter smaller than that of "Palaeochenoides", with a maximum end width of (as far as the trochleae are preserved), and a shaft that is wide near the point where it flares into the trochleae. It was thus about half again as large as "Odontoptila inexpectata" from the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of the Ouled Abdoul Basin (Morocco), i.e. around the size of the Early Eocene "Odontopteryx toliapica" from England or slightly bigger, or about the size of a great albatross ("Diomedea") or our time. If the "Tympanonesiotes" fossil is indeed of Miocene age, it would be among the very few pseudotooth birds known from the Neogene that was not of immense size.
Systematics.
"T. wetmorei" was initially placed in the presumed pelecaniform family Cyphornithidae, which had been placed in the "pelecaniform" suborder Cladornithes, together with two other misidentified pseudotooth birds – "Palaeochenoides" and the family's type genus "Cyphornis". The type genus of that supposed suborder, the enigmatic Late Oligocene "Cladornis" from the Argentinian part of Patagonia, like the present species is only known from a distal right tarsometatarsus end. This was believed to be reminiscent of the (then still undescribed) "Tympanonesiotes", and thus it was argued that all four genera were closely related. But "Cladornis" is more generally held to be a terrestrial bird of unclear affiliations rather than a seabird nowadays, and the Cladornithes are not used anymore by recent authors.
As regards the supposed Cyphornithidae, most if not all all pseudotooth birds placed there are probably closely related to the better-known "Pelagornis", type genus of the family Pelagornithidae. And even if "Cyphornis" is the senior synonym of "Palaeochenoides" and "Tympanoneisiotes" (which is not overly likely), according to the rules of zoological nomenclature the family name Pelagornithidae would not be affected. Thus Cyphornithidae would almost certainly be a junior synonym of Pelagornithidae even if the pseudotooth birds are (as some have proposed) divided into several families – rather than being all placed in the Pelagornithidae as is usual nowadays – as "Cyphornis", "Osteodontornis", "Palaeochenoides", "Pelagornis" and perhaps "Tympanoneisiotes" appear to be very closely related and are probably part of a monophyletic lineage of (usually) giant pseudotooth birds.

Hearts Adrift is a 1914 silent short romance film directed by Edwin S. Porter. The film is now considered lost.
Production.
The film bears a great resemblance to the 1911 story "As the Sparks Fly Upward" by Cyrus Townsend Brady. The film didn't credit Brady, who sued the studio. The film's story also bears resemblance to the 1908 novel "The Blue Lagoon" by Henry De Vere Stacpoole, which was filmed in 1923 and several decades later with Jean Simmons in 1948 and Brooke Shields in 1980.
The film proved to be a huge success. Actress Mary Pickford eventually demanded a higher salary as her popularity rose because of this film.
Plot.
Nina (Mary Pickford) and Jack Graham (Harold Lockwood) are both marooned on a deserted island. They fall in love and eventually Nina gives birth to a child. Despite being stranded, they are very happy together. One day, Jack's wife comes to rescue him. Nina is crushed and throws herself in a volcano.

Peugeot 3008

The Peugeot 3008 is a compact crossover unveiled by French automaker Peugeot in May 2009 and presented for the first time to the public in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It was launched in April 2009.
Despite having had its styling criticized, the 3008 has been praised by automobile magazines. In January 2010, the British motoring magazine "What Car?" awarded it "Car of the Year" for 2010. It also was awarded 2010 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.
Overview.
Engines.
HDi FAP.
Introduced on the Peugeot 607 in 2000 in a world debut, the particles filter is a system that has become a worldwide standard. It has been gradually applied to most Peugeot HDi diesel engines. The HDi FAP engine provides the driver with many advantages. The HDi engine reduces fuel consumption.
HDi is more economical than previous diesel engines and facilitates more complete combustion. Thanks to the Common Rail system’s injection at very high pressure (up to 1,800 bar), the constant and well distributed, very fine atomisation of the diesel fuel facilitates a more even and complete combustion, thereby providing better performance.
Consumption comparison of an HDi engine and a classic diesel engine:
206 1.6 litre HDi 70 hp, manual 5-speed gearbox: mixed consumption: 4.3l / 113g
206 1.9 litre D 70 hp (previous generation), manual 5-speed gearbox: mixed consumption: 5.5l / 144g
Variation: 1.2l at 100 km, which is a stand-alone difference of over 200 km for a 50-litre tank.
Head Up Display.
The 3008 Exclusive & Allure models have a Head Up Display, which projects a reading onto a small perspex like screen just in front of the main windscreen area in front of the driver. It also contains a distance alert, which warns the driver if they are too close to the car in front. It also displays details for Cruise Control or the Speed Limiter.
Hybrid version.
The Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 was launched in February 2012 and is the world's first mass production diesel-electric hybrid.
The crossover hybrid has four different operating modes: Auto (the electronics automatically control the entire system), ZEV (all-electric), four-wheel drive mode (4WD) and sport (higher engine speeds than normal mode). A 200v nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery pack is located in the rear.

Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution

Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution (Surrealism in the service of the revolution) was a periodical issued by the Surrealist Group in Paris between 1930 and 1933. It was the successor of "La Révolution surréaliste" (published 1924-29) and proceeded the primarily surrealist publication "Minotaure" (1933 to 1939). 
After the writing of his "Second Manifesto of Surrealism" (1929), which announced the expulsions of several prior surrealists due to theoretical differences, André Breton and his supporters developed a new, more politically charged publication. The first issue of "Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution" was published in June 1930, and was followed by five more issues through 1933. Contributors included André Breton, Paul Éluard, René Crevel, Tristan Tzara, Salvador Dalí, René Char, Benjamin Péret, Louis Aragon, and Luis Buñuel, among others.
Selected issues.
Issue 1 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Tzara, Dalí, Char, Péret, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include stills from Buñuel's film "L'Âge d'or", paintings by Dalí, and a drawing of the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky with a skeleton.
Issue 2 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Char, Péret, Marcel Duchamp, Aragon, and Georges Sadoul, and others. Illustrations include paintings by Dalí and Yves Tanguy, and a photograph by Man Ray. The issue opens with an ad for Breton's First and Second "Manifeste du Surrealisme", and ads for two Paris art galleries.
Issue 3 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tanguy, Max Ernst, Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include photographs of surrealist objects by Breton, Gala Éluard, Valentine Hugo, Joan Miró, Alberto Giacometti, and Dalí. The issue opens with an ad for the books "L'Immaculee conception" by Breton & Eluard, "La Peinture au defi" by Aragon, and "La Femme Visible" by Dalí.
Issue 4 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tzara, Dalí, Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include a collage by Ernst, and paintings by Tanguy and Dalí. The issue opens with an ad for several books by Dalí.
Issue 5 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Duchamp, Dalí, Pierre Unik, Paul Nouge, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include works by Duchamp, Dalí, Hugo, Ernst, and Man Ray. The issue opens with ads for numerous surrealist books by Péret, Tzara, Breton, Dalí, and Crevel, as well as publications by Achim D'Arnim and Lautreamont. There is also promotion of a major exhibit of surrealist art.
Issue 6 features writings by Breton, Buñuel, Char, Tzara, and Péret, and others. Illustrations include works by Giacometti, René Magritte, Ernst, Breton, Hugo, Dalí, and Tanguy. The issue opens with an ad for the next surrealist periodical "Minotaure".

Niegowić was the place of the first appointment of Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II, as parish priest. He served there from July 1948 to August 1949, before the then-Cardinal Archbishop, Prince Adam Sapieha (who had ordained Wojtyla a priest in 1946 on an accelerated schedule, sending him to work on a doctorate in theology in Rome before beginning parish work), assigned him to work at St. Florian's Church in Kraków (where he began his work with university students as a chaplain to attendees of the Jagiellonian University and the Krakow Polytechnic Institute). While he was at the parish, the then-pastor celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his presbyteral ordination. It was Father Wojtyla who suggested that as a present, the parish arrange to build a new church, which was eventually done- the first built at his suggestion.

Blue Line – Library

The Blue Line – Library (formerly the 47L Library via Overbrook) is a line on the Pittsburgh Light Rail system that runs between Library and Downtown Pittsburgh via the Overbrook neighborhood.
Route.
The line begins in Library in South Park and runs north to Willow through Bethel Park, providing a transfer to the Red Line, which runs via Beechview. The Blue Line – Library continues north through Overbrook, Brookline, Carrick, Bon Air, and Beltzhoover. At South Hills Junction the Blue Line – Library rejoins the Beechview line and the Brown Line, which runs over Mount Washington through the Allentown neighborhood. The Blue Line – Library runs through the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel, stopping at Station Square before crossing the Monongahela River on the Panhandle Bridge. Reaching downtown at First Avenue, the Blue Line – Library proceeds underground to Steel Plaza, Wood Street and Gateway Center. Upon reaching Gateway, the route then proceeds under the Allegheny River and makes additional stops at North Side and Allegheny stations on the North Shore.
History.
The line from South Hills Junction to Castle Shannon (now called the Overbrook Line) was first constructed by the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad (P&CSRR) between 1872 and 1874. In 1905 Pittsburgh Railways leased the route and between 1909 and 1910 converted it from narrow gauge to dual gauge and installed overhead power for trolleys.
Mid-20th century PCC streetcars continued to run over the "Overbrook" line until 1993, when concerns about the safety of the line led PAT to suspend service there pending reconstruction. This former Pittsburgh Railways trolley line had never been updated to current light rail system requirements. After receiving federal funding for Stage Two of the light rail system development, the Overbrook line was reconstructed as a fully rebuilt double-tracked line served by modern light rail vehicles, making this line a considerably faster commute.
The line was reopened on June 2, 2004 following major work which included doubling of the track and elimination of 22 traditional street level trolley stops in favour of 8 new LRV style stations with platforms.
The Port Authority closed five stations along the Blue Line on June 25, 2012: Martin Villa, Mine 3, Lindermer, Center and Latimer.

Tillodontia

Tillodontia is an extinct suborder of eutherian mammals known from the Early Paleocene to Late Eocene of China, the Late Paleocene to Middle Eocene of North America where they display their maximum species diversity, the Middle Eocene of Pakistan, and the Early Eocene of Europe. Leaving no descendants, they are most closely related to the equally extinct pantodonts. The tillodonts were medium- to large-sized animals and probably feed on roots and tubers in temperate to subtropical habitats.
Description.
Tillodonts had rodentlike incisors, clawed feet and blunt, cusped teeth. They were mostly medium-sized animals, although the largest of them (such as Trogosus) could reach the size of a large bear.
The cranium ranged in length from and had a characteristic elongated rostrum, an elongated mandibular symphysis, and a shortened basicranial region. The second upper and lower incisors are large in most species, the first upper and lower premolars are small or absent, the fourth upper and lower premolar are molariform (molar-like).
When Marsh first named and described the tillodonts, he explained:
When naming his new "pachyderm" species "Trogosus castoridens" ("Beaver-toothed Gnawing-hog"), Leidy added that it was a fossil "which would appear to have pertained to the stock from which diverged the Rhinoceros and Mastodon, the Peccary, and perhaps the Beaver."
Classification.
"Franchaius" from the early Eocene of Europe, "Benaius", "Lofochaius", "Meiostylodon", and "Huananius" from the early Paleocene of China, and "Yuesthonyx" from the late Paleocene of China are primitive forms. "Interogale" from the late Paleocene of China, and "Anchilestes" probably from the middle Paleocene of China, were once assigned to Anagalida but may also be primitive tillodonts.
The monophyly of the subfamily Trogosinae is unchallenged, but Esthonychines most likely includes the ancestors of Trogosinae and therefore is probably paraphyletic. Tillodontia is mostly known from dentaries and teeth. The cranium is best known from Trogosinae and the postcranium from "Trogosus".
"Azygonyx" and "Esthonyx" from North America, "Franchaius" and "Plesiesthonyx" from Europe, and possibly "Basalina" from Pakistan (to the extent anything can be said about it) and an unassigned specimen from India are all morphologically closely related but obviously geographically quite widespread. In contrast, Asian tillodonts tend to be smaller and less derived. This possible link between specimens from the Indian subcontinent and those from Europe and America adds evidence to a faunal interchange between these continents during the early Eocene.

Samuel Hartt Pook

Samuel Hartt Pook (January 17, 1827 – March 30, 1901) was a Boston-based American naval architect noted for designing very fast clipper ships.
Clipper ships.
Pook designed several very fast clippers, including the "Surprise", "Witchcraft", "Herald of the Morning" and "Northern Light", all of which made passages, prior to 1861, from an American East Coast port to San Francisco, via Cape Horn in fewer than 100 days, a speedy passage for the period. He was involved in the design of the 1850 clipper barque Race Horse. Pook also designed the 1853 clipper "Challenger" and the "Red Jacket", a holder of the speed record for the New York-Liverpool and Liverpool-Melbourne passages.
Ironclad design for USS Galena.
Pook was less successful in his design for the Civil War-era ironclad "Galena", which was found, in combat conditions, to suffer from ineffective armoring. 
Pook's father was the naval architect Samuel Moore Pook, who designed the far more successful City-class Ironclads of the same period.

<doc id="19028952" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19028952" title="Macrodontopteryx">
Macrodontopteryx

Macrodontopteryx is a genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds of somewhat doubtful validity. These animals were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Description.
Only a single species, Macrodontopteryx oweni, is known to date. Its remains were found in the Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England), where they were deposited about 50 Ma (million years ago) in the Mammal Paleogene zone MP8-9. The fossils were at first assigned to "Argillornis longipennis", which is nowadays recognized as junior synonym of "Dasornis emuinus", a larger pseudotooth bird than "M. oweni". Due to the scarcity of their fossil remains, is not clear whether the pseudotooth bird species described as "Pseudodontornis longidentata" is not the same as "M. oweni", though its size suggests that it is more likely to be synonymous with "D. emuinus". In any case, "Macrodontopteryx" itself may well be no distinct genus but rather a large member of the contemporary and sympatric "Odontopteryx", or a young or small "Dasornis".
The only known specimen (BMNH A1) is an incomplete and rather crushed skull with much all of the beak missing. In the living animal it would have measured roughly 30–35 cm (one foot). The wingspan was probably around .
Other supposed remains.
If "Macrodontopteryx" is indeed a distinct genus, perhaps some pseudotooth bird fossils found in Lutetian (Middle Eocene, MP11-13, about 45 Ma) deposits at Etterbeek (Belgium) belong therein. Like the holotype BMNH A1, they have been assigned to "Argillornis longipennis" in the past; at least some of the material placed in that taxon at one time or another – but not its syntype humerus pieces – seems too small to be of an adult "Dasornis".
An Early Oligocene (Stampian, MP21-23, about 32 Ma) distal radius from Hamstead, Isle of Wight (England) was also assigned to "Macrodontopteryx". It is without doubt from a very large and flight-capable bird, but little else can be said about it. An equally old cervical vertebra fragment (specimen BMNH A-4413) and a toe phalanx from nearby Yarmouth were, mainly due to their size, believed to be related to the enigmatic large flightless bird (and presumed ratite) "Eleutherornis". They were described as "Proceriavis martini", but have never been compared in detail to pseudotooth bird fossils. It cannot be ruled out that "Proceriavis" belongs in the Pelagornithidae, but whether it would be a junior synonym of "Macrodontopteryx" is highly uncertain given the 20-million-year difference between the Isle of Sheppey and Isle of Wight material.

Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Denmark participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 held in Moscow on 16 May 2009. Denmark was represented by Brinck with the song "Believe Again". Two other Danish-born contestants also participated at the 2009 Eurovision contest: Susanne Georgi represented Andorra and Yohanna represented Iceland.
Background.
As in previous years, Danmarks Radio (DR) selected its entry through the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix (DMGP) contest. On 25 August 2008 (DR) announced that Denmark would compete in the 2009 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest and set a date of 31 January 2009 for the 2009 Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, the Danish national final. Unlike the 2007 and 2008 MGPs, there were no semifinals prior to the grand final, which was held on 31 January 2009.
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2009.
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2009 was held on 31 January at the MCH Messecenter Herning in Herning, Denmark. The show was hosted by previous Danish entrant Birthe Kjær, and TV and radio presenter Felix Smith.
Ten songs took part in the 2009 edition of DMGP, six of which were selected through an open call for entries, while the remaining four songs were by performers invited to take part by DR. The competing songs were revealed on 9 January 2009, after DR had narrowed down the best songs from the pool of submitted entries. A total of 684 songs were submitted to DR for 2009, an increase from the 443 songs that were submitted in the previous year.
During the DMGP, the ten selected songs competed in the first round of the contest where four songs selected by a 50/50 mix of jury and SMS voting progressed to a "knock-out" round in which the songs competed in pairs. A second round of SMS voting decided the two winning songs from each pair which went on to the final voting round where SMS voting selected the overall winner of the contest.
Controversy rose when the official album for the contest was released prematurely, due to a technical error. Set to be released the day before the contest, the album was released as a digital download due to a technical error made by the record label. 17 legal downloads were made before the album was taken off. One of the legal downloads, however, was uploaded onto YouTube as well as published as an illegal sharing file on the internet. My Way Music, the record company responsible for album, will take legal action against the person who illegally uploaded the songs onto the internet.
First round.
The first round consisted of all ten songs performing. Four acts were chosen to compete in the knock-out rounds. They were Sukkerchok, Hera Björk, Brinck and Johnny Deluxe.
Knock-out rounds.
In the second round of voting, the four qualifiers competed against each other in pairs, with only two progressing to the final round. Hera Björk and Brinck passed to the Super Final, beating Sukkerchok and Johnny Deluxe respectively.
In the Super Final, Hera Björk and Brinck sang their songs again, with SMS voting once deciding the overall winner.
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2009 was won by Brinck and the song "Believe Again"
At Eurovision.
Since Denmark was not one of the "Big Four" nor the host of the 2009 contest, it had to compete in the second semi-final of the contest on 14 May. Brinck performed ninth in the running order of the semi-final, following Slovakia and preceding Slovenia, where he qualified Denmark to final of the contest, placing 8th. In the final, Denmark finished in 13th place with 74 points.

George Merrill (songwriter)

George Merrill (born August 28, 1957) is an American songwriter whose work mostly dates from the mid to late 1980s.
He wrote "How Will I Know," which was a hit for Whitney Houston in 1986, as well as Houston's 1987 hit "I Wanna Dance With Somebody."
From the mid- to late-1980s to the present day, Merrill has been one half of vocal duo Boy Meets Girl, who are best remembered for the late 1988 hit "Waiting For a Star to Fall". He wrote the song and had initially offered it to Whitney Houston, but she rejected it and Merrill decided to sing it himself and feature it on the next Boy Meets Girl album.
Merrill was married to Shannon Rubicam (his partner in Boy Meets Girl) from the mid-1980s until they divorced in 2000. They have one daughter, Hilary; she can be seen as the little blond girl in her parents' video of "Waiting For a Star to Fall."

Seventh Zimbabwean Parliament

The Seventh Zimbabwean parliament refers to the currently-sitting Parliament of Zimbabwe as of 2008. The voted-in members from electoral constituencies were voted in during the parliamentary election that took place in March 2008.
Convening of Parliament.
On August 19, 2008, Robert Mugabe announced his intention to open Parliament in the subsequent week, five months after the parliamentary election was held. Due to the ongoing negotiations, the MDC-T deemed this move to convene Parliament unacceptable, with MDC-T Secretary-General Biti stating that it would "be a clear repudiation of the Memorandum of Understanding, and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of ZANU-PF's unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks. In short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue".
On the morning of August 25, Mugabe appointed 11 Senators. These appointments included eight of the ten Senate seats reserved for provincial Resident Ministers and Governors and three of the five special non-constituency Senate seats. Ephraim Masawi was appointed as Resident Minister and Governor for Mashonaland Central, Aeneas Chigwedere for Mashonaland East, Chris Mushohwe for Manicaland Province, and Faber Chidarikire for Mashonaland West. The remaining Resident Ministers and Governors—Angeline Masuku for Matabeleland South, Thokozile Mathuthu for Matabeleland North, Cain Mathema for Bulawayo, and Ishemunyoro David Karimanzira for Harare—were reappointed to their posts. (Mugabe did not appoint Resident Ministers and Governors for Midlands and Masvingo provinces at this time.) The three non-constituency senators appointed on this occasion were Vice-President Joseph Msika, Patrick Chinamasa, and John Nkomo, who was Speaker of Parliament during the preceding parliamentary term. Mugabe was believed to have left some of the posts vacant so that they could go to the MDC in the event of a power-sharing agreement.
Despite the MDC-T's objections, the members of Parliament were sworn in later on August 25. The MDC MPs sat on the government benches and told the ZANU-PF MPs to sit on the opposition benches.
Also on August 25, two MDC-T MPs—Shuwa Mudiwa and Eliah Jembere—were arrested. Mudiwa was released later in the day and sworn in as an MP. Wayne Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, said that the police questioned Mudiwa with regard to political violence, while Jembere was being held over rape charges. Five other MDC MPs were also wanted by the police. The MDC-T denounced the arrests as politically motivated and said that the police had entered Parliament and forcefully removed Mudiwa from the building. It also claimed that another of its MPs was targeted for arrest but that this arrest was prevented by other MDC MPs; however, according to the MDC, a third MP was arrested at his home the next day.
Mugabe opened Parliament on August 26, expressing an optimistic outlook on resolving the political dispute—"Landmark agreements have been concluded, with every expectation that everyone will sign up"—while denouncing the West's policies toward Zimbabwe. MDC MPs heckled him during his speech; although Mugabe continued with the speech and completed it, he was reportedly inaudible at times due to the volume of the heckling, "look annoyed", and spoke more loudly and quickly as a result. In a petition on the same day, the MDC condemned the convening of Parliament as a violation of the preliminary agreement between the parties regarding negotiations, described Mugabe as an "illegitimate usurper", and criticized the arrest of the MDC MPs. "The Herald" strongly criticized the heckling in an editorial, describing it as "disgraceful" and "infantile", while also asserting that the MDC-T had effectively acknowledged Mugabe's legitimacy by attending Parliament and remaining there during Mugabe's speech.
Election of speakers.
Parliament was convened on August 25, 2008, to elect the leaders of both houses.
House of Assembly.
The members were sworn into office starting at 10 a.m. by clerk of Parliament Austin Zvoma; however, Shuwa Mudiwa and Eliah Jembere of the House of Assembly were arrested and destined by police prior to the opening of the ceremony. Mudiwa was later released and sworn into office, but Jembere remained in custody. In addition, the MDC announced that 15 of its members would not appear because they are in hiding from intimidation and violence.
The secret-ballot election of the House speaker pitted Lovemore Moyo (MDC-T) against Paul Themba Nyathi (MDC-M); ZANU-PF declined fielding a candidate against the two, opting to back the MDC-M candidate instead. Moyo won the vote with 110 against Nyathi's 98. A deputy speaker, Nomalanga Khumalo (MDC-M, Umzingwane), was also elected. Moyo reportedly received 99 votes from MDC-T MPs, seven votes from MDC-M MPs, and four votes from ZANU-PF MPs, but the breakdown of results could not be known for certain because the vote was secret. Independent MP Jonathan Moyo also backed Nyathi.
ZANU-PF's Emmerson Mnangagwa described Moyo's election as "a truly historic event" and expressed his congratulations on behalf of Mugabe and ZANU-PF. Following his election as Speaker, Moyo predicted that Parliament would henceforth be a meaningful check on the executive, which would need to "find ways of negotiating with the legislature in order to put through programs". It was clear from the voting figures that many of the MDC-M MPs voted against their own party's candidate for Speaker, and this was considered a serious blow to Mugabe; it meant that he could not rely on the MDC-M MPs to vote with ZANU-PF and as a result might not be able to control a parliamentary majority even with the support of the MDC-M leadership.
Senate.
In the Senate, where ZANU-PF held a majority, ZANU-PF candidate Edna Madzongwe was elected as President of the Senate on August 25, receiving 58 votes. Gibson Sibanda, whose candidacy was supported by the MDC-T and the MDC-M, received 28 votes.
Temporary adjournment.
On October 24, it was announced that Parliament would be adjourned until November 11 because of lack of funds from the government.
Power-sharing agreement.
Parliament is planned to meet again in October, at which point it will consider proposed constitutional amendments resulting from the power-sharing agreement between ZANU-PF and the MDC, which was signed in September.As the terms of the deal are supported by all three parties, the amendments are expected to pass without difficulty. Elements of the agreement specifically relevant to Parliament include granting all three parties the right to appoint one minister who is not a Member of Parliament. These ministers would be allowed to participate in Parliament, but would not have voting rights. Additionally, the agreement provides for the appointment of nine more non-constituency senators, three from each party.

Reunited (Gloria Jones album)

Reunited is a studio album released by Gloria Jones in 1982.
Here is the description written on the back of the album:
"Back in 1964, Gloria Jones still in her mid-teens, was discovered by hit songwriter Ed Cobb. Signing with Cobb's Greengrass Productions, Gloria recorded her first hit record, "Heartbeat Pts 1 & 2," which Cobb wrote and produced. "Heartbeat" became a classic rhythm and blues tune which later was recorded by Dusty Springfield, Spencer Davis and many other artists who attempted to capture that phenomenal Gloria Jones sound.
By then, Gloria had gone on to record other memorable songs for Uptown records, a subsidiary of Capitol|EMI. Included among these tunes was another Cobb written song, "Tainted Love" (included on this album). In fact the group, SOFT CELL, whose version of "Tainted Love" reached #1 worldwide, originally heard Gloria sing this classic years before in Northern England. So strong was Gloria's following there that she was proclaimed the "Northern Queen of Soul."
Marc Bolan of T-Rex was so impressed by Gloria's talents that they joined forces. As early as 1974, their innovative fusion of new wave and soul generated a sound which is still a current musical trend. Gloria and all of T-Rex's fans lost Marc when he was killed in an auto accident in 1977. In his honor, Gloria wishes to dedicate the cut, "Sixty Minutes of Making Love" to Marc and all his fans worldwide."
This album has yet to be given an official CD release.

Oscar Ichazo

Oscar Ichazo (born 1931) is the Bolivian-born founder of the Arica School, which he established in 1968. 
Work.
Ichazo's Enneagram of Personality theories are part of a larger body of teaching that he terms Protoanalysis. In Ichazo's teachings the enneagram figure has usually been called an enneagon.
In an interview with Ichazo, he claims he achieved insight into mechanistic and repetitive thought and behavior patterns in 1954. These processes can be understood in connection with the enneagram figure, classical philosophy and what he calls "Trialectic" logic grounded in three laws of process.
According to Ichazo, he identified the nine ways in which a person's ego becomes fixated within the psyche at an early stage of life. For each person one of these 'ego fixations' then becomes the core of a self-image around which their psychological personality develops. Each fixation is also supported at the emotional level by a particular 'passion' or 'vice'. The principal psychological connections between the nine ego fixations can be 'mapped' using the points, lines and circle of the enneagram figure.
Ichazo's teachings are designed to help people transcend their identification with — and the suffering caused by — their own mechanistic thought and behavior patterns. (See Fourth Way) His theories about the fixations are founded on the premise that all life seeks to continue and perpetuate itself and that the human psyche must follow universal laws of reality. Using Trialectic logic, Ichazo indicated the three basic human instincts for survival: Conservation (the digestive system); Relation (the circulatory system) and Adaptation (the central nervous system); and two poles of attraction to self-perpetuation: Sexual (the sexual organs) and Spiritual (the spinal column).
Ichazo understands the fixations as aberrations from an essential state of unity. The primary difference between modern psychology and his theories is that he has proposed a model of the components of the human psyche, but modern psychology has preferred to focus on observed behavior instead of an essential model from which aberrations develop. 
In Ichazo's teachings, a person's fixation derives from childhood subjective experience (self-perception) of psychological trauma when expectations are not met in each of the instincts. Given that young children are considered to be self-centered in their expectations, they experience disappointment in their expectations due to one of three fundamental attitudes: attracted, unattracted, disinterested. From such experiences, mechanistic thought and behavior patterns arise as an attempted defense against recurrence of the trauma. By understanding the fixations — and practicing self-observation — it is believed that a person can reduce or even transcend suffering and the fixations' hold on the mind.
Although some modern Enneagram of Personality writers have claimed that Ichazo's teaching are derived, in part, from those of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way work, Ichazo has denied this claim in his "Letter to the Transpersonal Community". In 1992 intellectual copyright for the Enneagram of Personality was denied to Ichazo on the basis that Ichazo had published claims that his theories were factual and factual ideas cannot be copyrighted.

The family Pliopithecidae is the earliest known family of fossil apes. They originated in Africa, and subsequently spread to Europe, before becoming extinct about 10 million years ago. Like modern gibbons, they were adapted to living in the tree tops of dense forests. Their anatomy combined primitive features such as a small braincase, a long snout and a tail in some species. At the same time, they possessed more advanced features such as stereoscopic vision and ape-like teeth and jaws, clearly distinguishing them from monkeys.

Ulm Railway Society

The Ulm Railway Society (Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde or UEF) is a German society for encouraging the preservation of historically valuable railway stock. It is based in the vicinity of Ulm, a city in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. The society was founded in 1969, has about 600 members and around 12 steam locomotives as well as numerous historical wagons.
Groups.
The society is divided into four groups:
Narrow Gauge Group.
This group runs its own vehicles on the 5.7 kilometre long narrow gauge route from Amstetten to Oppingen, the so-called "Albbähnle". Motive power is provided by locomotive 99 7203 and, from time to time, the diesel locomotive D8.
Branch Line Group.
Historical branch line steam trains run on the society's own line from Amstetten to Gerstetten (Amstetten–Gerstetten branch line). Since mid-2006 they have been joined by the museum railbus, number T06. Occasionally goods trains are also worked. Steam locomotive 75 1118 hauls the historic steam trains. The Group ("UEF Lokalbahn Amstetten-Gerstetten e. V.") owns other diesel locomotives and railbuses and historic branch line passenger coaches.
Ettlingen Group.
The Albtal Transport Company ("Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft") runs a historic fast stopping train ("Eilzug") hauled by a DRG Class 58 (ex Baden G 12) steam engine on the Ettlingen–Bad Herrenalb and Karlsruhe - Baiersbronn lines. This historic engine was built in 1921 by the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe. Other steam locomotives also stationed with the Ettlingen Group, but not in working order, are a DRG Class 44, DRG Class 50 and DRG Class 86). The fast-stopping coaches were mainly built in the 1930s and modernised in the 1950s. The luggage vans homed at Ettlingen, which are usually used for the free transportation of bicycles, were used to carry the mortal remains of Frederick the Great from Hechingen to Potsdam.
Historical Steam Express Train Group.
This group maintains the most famous steam locomotives in the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde - 01 1066 and 01 509 - as well as historic, express train, 1st and 2nd class coaches. The vehicles were built between 1928 and 1954.
The historic steam express - reinforced by express train coaches from the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde - travels the length and breadth of Europe visiting, for example, Italy, France, Hungary, Sweden and Russia (Kaliningrad); albeit remaining mostly in south Germany.
The express train steam locomotives and a working heating wagon are stationed at Heilbronn, the coaches in Stuttgart.
The non-operational express train engine, number 01 1081, is being refurbished as a museum exhibit in the Augsburg Railway Park.
The services operated by the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde are regularly reported in the railway press and in TV programmes such as "Eisenbahn-Romantik" ('Railway Nostalgia').
Railway Operations.
All railway operations are carried out by volunteer members, from coach attendants to qualified engine drivers. This does not just involve running railway trips, but also the preparation and clearing up afterwards as well as restoration and repair wherever possible and permitted.

Sacred Heart Medical Center University District

Sacred Heart Medical Center University District is a hospital in Eugene, Oregon. Originally called Sacred Heart Medical Center, its new name reflects its location near the University of Oregon. It is one of two Sacred Heart facilities in the Eugene-Springfield area owned by PeaceHealth. The other facility, Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend, is in Springfield.
Sacred Heart in Eugene had been the largest hospital in the area until the newer facility at RiverBend opened in August 2008. Most general services moved to the larger hospital. This facility became a specialty services hospital but retains an emergency department. Other services that are still located here include the Oregon Rehabilitation Center, Behavioral Health Services, and the Gamma Knife Center.
History.
Sacred Heart in Eugene began as the Pacific Christian Hospital. By the 1930s, it was in bad shape structurally and financially. At the same time, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Newark, which later became Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, had a good reputation in the Pacific Northwest in hospital administration. Due to this reputation, local physicians went to them for help in saving the hospital. In 1936, the Sisters of St. Joseph bought it for $50,000 and changed its name to Sacred Heart General Hospital.

Dryolestida

Dryolestida is an extinct order of mammals; most of the members are known from the Jurassic to Paleogene, with one possible member, "Necrolestes", surviving as late as early Miocene. It has been suggested that these mammals are either the possible ancestors of therian mammals or an offshoot from the same evolutionary line. It is also believed that they developed a fully mammalian jaw and also had the three middle ear bones. Other than that, not much is known about them, this is because their fossils are made up mostly of jaw and tooth remains.
The Dryolestids were formerly considered part of Pantotheria and/or Eupantotheria. The clade Quirogatheria, erected by José Bonaparte in 1992, is often used as a synonym for Dryolestida. Originally, Quirogatheria was meant to include Brandoniidae, but this family is now included with the Dryolestids.
Classification.
Classification modified after Rougier & Gaetano, 2011.
A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rougier "et al." (2012) indicated that meridiolestidans might not be members of Dryolestida but instead slightly more closely related to the placental mammals, marsupials and amphitheriids. Paurodontids were also recovered as not belonging to Dryolestida, but instead as a sister group of Meridiolestida in this analysis. An analysis conducted by Averianov, Martin and Lopatin (2013) did not recover meridiolestidans as members of Dryolestida as well, but it found them to be the sister group of spalacotheriid "symmetrodonts" instead. However, paurodontids were recovered as members of Dryolestida in this analysis. On the other hand, an analysis conducted by Chimento, Agnolin and Novas (2012) did recover meridiolestidans as members of Dryolestida.

LG Rumor.
The LG Rumor is the first phone in the series. It was released first for Sprint in September 2007 followed by other carriers on later dates.
LG Rumor 2.
The LG Rumor 2 was released for Sprint in March 2009, it offered a new, updated version of the Rumor called the LG Rumor 2 with a 4 row QWERTY keyboard instead of a 3-row keyboard. Also, a new interface and IM-like text messaging interface debuted. However, the Rumor 2 does not include video recording capabilities that the original Rumor has. It is not currently offered on Sprint's online store because of the release of the LG Rumor Touch. The LG Rumor 2 was also later released for Virgin Mobile USA and Virgin Mobile Canada as well as Bell Mobility and its now-defunct Solo Mobile brand. The Rumor 2 was also released for Kajeet. Verizon Wireless received a version in Q1 2010 called the LG Cosmos.
LG Rumor Touch.
In early 2010 LG & Sprint offered a new, updated version of the Rumor 2 called the LG Rumor Touch with a 5 row QWERTY keyboard instead of 3 row rumor or 4 row Rumor2. Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile USA and Virgin Mobile Canada later announced that they would carry the LG Rumor Touch as well. It also includes a touch screen. The phone was discontinued when LG and Sprint introduced the LG Rumor Reflex in Q1 2012. The Rumor Touch reintroduces video recording capabilities. Like the Rumor 2, the Rumor Touch was released for Kajeet.
LG Rumor Reflex.
In December 2011, reports surfaced on the web that Sprint Nextel's prepaid subsidiary Boost Mobile was working with LG to offer an "LG Rumor 4" phone. On March 5, 2012, Sprint's Boost Mobile prepaid brand listed the LG Rumor Reflex on their online shopping page as "coming soon". The phone is now available for $279.99 unsubsidized or $0 with a two-year contract from Sprint, and at $79.99 outright with Boost Mobile. It has a 2 MP camera just like the Rumor Touch and includes video recording as well. Unlike the Rumor Touch and its resistive touchscreen, the Rumor Reflex has a capacitive sensing touchscreen common to smartphones.
LG Rumor Reflex S.
In July 2013, Sprint released an update to the Rumor Reflex S ecological friendly, the LG Rumor Reflex S which includes a 3" screen.
Celebrity endorsements.
The LG Rumor 2 for Virgin Mobile USA was endorsed by singers Lady Gaga and Beyoncé Knowles in their music video for collaboration song "Telephone".

Dry Bridge

Dry Bridge () is a bridge in Zrenjanin, Serbia. It currently does not span any physical obstacle, since the flow of the river under it was diverted.
History.
The bridge was built in 1962 by the project of engineer Rada Janjatov, as a suspension bridge. Its purpose was to connect Zrenjanin city center with Mala Amerika quarter. Two holding towers, one on the north side and the other on the south side, are made of steel and concrete. The northern tower is a 23-meter-high pylon, while the southern tower is A-shaped and 16 meters high. The suspension cable is made of 102 steel wires.
Without the river.
In 1985, city authorities decided to fill in the secondary bed of the Begej river. A dike between two lakes of the former Begej bed was built at the bridge site, and 23 years after being built, Dry Bridge lost its purpose.
Today.
, 23 years since the filling of the river, the bridge still stands, although rusty and in bad condition. City authorities plan to demolish Dry Bridge since it does not have any purpose and for safety reasons. Some residents claim that Dry Bridge has become an ironic symbol of Zrenjanin, and should not be demolished, on the basis that it is one of only a few bridges in the world that does not span any kind of physical obstacle; Trinity Bridge is another smaller, older example.

<doc id="19029406" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19029406" title="Process-centered design">
Process-centered design

Process-centered design (PCD) is a design methodology, which proposes a business centric approach for designing user interfaces. Because of the multi-stage business analysis steps involved right from the beginning of the PCD life cycle, it is believed to achieve the highest levels of business-IT alignment that is possible through UI.
Purpose.
This method is aimed at enterprise applications where there is a business process involved. Unlike content oriented systems such as websites or portals, enterprise applications are built to enable a company's business processes. Enterprise applications often have a clear business goal and a set of specific objectives like- improve employee productivity, increase business performance by a certain percent, etc.
Comparison between other popular UI design methods.
Although there are proven UI design methodologies (like the most popular "User-centered design", which helps design highly Usable Interfaces), PCD differentiates itself by precisely catering to business process intensive software which has not been the case with other UI design methodologies.
Process-UI alignment.
Process-UI alignment is a component of PCD, which ensures tight alignment between the business process and the enterprise application being developed. UI design activities are affected by PCD. 
For example: A call center software used by a customer support agent, if designed for high process-UI alignment will achieve tremendous agent productivity improvement and call center performance; which is not likely to be seen if it were designed only for user satisfaction, ease of use, etc.
PCD in practice.
Although PCD is not yet a wide spread methodology, papers and articles are beginning to be published, and some case studies are also showcased. The PCD community on LinkedIn (a professional networking tool) boasts a growing global membership.

<doc id="19029527" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19029527" title="SS Iowan">
SS Iowan

SS "Iowan" was a cargo ship built in 1914 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I she was taken over by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS "Iowan" (ID-3002). During World War II, the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union and renamed SS "Tashkent (or Ташкент" in Cyrillic).
"Iowan" was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. In October 1914, five months after she was delivered to American-Hawaiian, "Iowan" rammed and sank the United Fruit Company steamer "Metapan" near the entrance to New York Harbor. After repairs, "Iowan" resumed inter-coastal service via the Panama Canal. When the canal was temporarily closed by landslides in late 1915, "Iowan" sailed via the Straits of Magellan until the canal reopened in mid 1916. During World War I, USS "Iowan" carried cargo, animals, and a limited number of passengers to France, and returned nearly 10,000 American troops after the Armistice.
After her Navy service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners, who, at least once, chartered her to another shipping company. In May 1922, "Iowan" rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer "Welsh Prince" in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon, killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, "Iowan" ran aground on a reef near Point Conception, California, and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef. She was freed from the reef after two weeks, towed to Los Angeles, and repaired.
In 1942, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which transferred her to the Soviet Union under the terms of Lend-Lease in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SS "Tashkent", but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.
Design and construction.
In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships—"Iowan" and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Iowan", including financing costs, was $71.95 per deadweight ton, which came out to just over $732,000.
"Iowan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 132) was the first ship built under the contract. She was launched on 24 January 1914, and delivered to American-Hawaiian on 16 May. The ship was , and was in length (between perpendiculars) and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast—like fresh produce from Southern California farms—to the East Coast. "Iowan" had a single steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of .
Early career.
When "Iowan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.
At 15:20 on 15 October 1914, the outbound "Iowan" rammed the United Fruit Company passenger and cargo steamer "Metapan" at the entrance of Ambrose Channel outside of New York. "Metapan" had stopped in the dense fog, but "Iowan" was traveling at a rapid pace. When "Iowan" had appeared out of the fog some from "Metapan", the United Fruit ship sounded three blasts on the ship's whistle—warning "Iowan" of the impending collision. "Iowan"s captain did not alter the ship's course, but did drop her anchor to try and slow the fully laden ship. Nevertheless, "Iowan" gashed the bow of "Metapan" and traveled almost halfway through the passenger ship. When "Iowan" pulled out three minutes later, "Metapan" began to sink rapidly. "Metapan"s captain ordered his ship to sail at full speed for shoals some distant, on which the ship grounded in of water. A variety of craft—including the nearby British Royal Navy cruiser —responded to "Metapan"s SOS. Even though the ship was resting on the bottom and the passengers in no immediate danger, most of the 78 passengers and 90 crewmen evacuated the ship in lifeboats and were picked up by rescue craft. "Iowan", which suffered no casualties among her crew, attempted to return to her pier in Brooklyn, but was unable and instead anchored in Ambrose Channel. "Iowan"s damage was restricted to her bow, which was crushed above the waterline. Two days later, "The Wall Street Journal" reported that "Iowan" was anchored off Clifton, Staten Island, and awaiting inspection from surveyors.
After repairs and return to service, "Iowan" resumed her inter-coastal service. In May 1915, she was delayed by a large Pacific storm that was responsible for the sinking of the steamer "Victoria", and also damaged and . In mid-September the same year, "Iowan" sailed from Boston for the West Coast. She arrived at Cristóbal, the Atlantic terminus of the Panama Canal, to find the canal closed by a major landslide—more than of mud and dirt had collapsed into the Gaillard Cut. Initially, American-Hawaiian had "Iowan" wait in case the canal would soon reopen, but when it became apparent that the closure would last some time, perhaps as long as ten months, "Iowan" was sent around South America to her destinations, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that one portion of "Iowan"s delayed cargo consisted of Christmas toys for Los Angeles merchants. The newspaper went on to predict that the delay would be "very disastrous" for the holiday season.
The balance of "Iowan"s activities over the next two years are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.
World War I.
On 23 December 1917, some seven months after the United States declared war on Germany, the United States Navy acquired "Iowan" from American-Hawaiian. USS "Iowan" was commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander Frank L. Dow, USNRF, in command.
"Iowan" loaded a cargo of 800 horses, along with flour, iron, and machinery at Newport News, Virginia and sailed for New York on 9 February 1918. There she joined a convoy that sailed for France on 11 February and arrived at its destination on 28 February; "Iowan" discharged her equine passengers—less seven that died or were destroyed during the voyage—at Remount Depot No. 3 on 5 March. "Iowan" continued carrying livestock and food products to France through the rest of the war. On 9 November, "Iowan" took on 72 officers and men, and headed for France with cargo ship two days before the Armistice.
With the fighting at an end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. "Iowan" was selected for conversion to a troop transport and transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force, but before she could begin returning troops, "Iowan" had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications "Iowan" underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Similar modifications on "Iowan"s sister ship took three months, but it is not known how long "Iowan"s refit took. By the time "Iowan" had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 29 August 1919, "Iowan" had carried home 9,876 healthy and wounded men. USS "Iowan" was decommissioned on 22 September 1919, and returned to American-Hawaiian.
Interwar years.
"Iowan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Iowan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal. For a time in the early 1920s, "Iowan" was chartered to the United American Line. In May 1922, the Associated Press reported that "Iowan", sailing under the United American banner, was loading wheat, flour, and lumber at Tacoma, Washington, for England and European ports. Later that same month, on 29 May, "Iowan" rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line cargo ship "Welsh Prince" in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon. Seven men aboard "Welsh Prince" were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire.
On 11 June 1941, "Iowan" departed Los Angeles with a cargo of of steel and iron pipe destined for San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, on her last voyage before she was to be handed over to the United States Maritime Commission. At 04:20 on 12 June, "Iowan" ran aground on a reef a few hundred yards (meters) off shore from Government Point,— northwest of Los Angeles,—near Point Conception. Salvage operations took some two weeks, but the ship was towed back to Los Angeles and placed in drydock at the Bethlehem Shipyard on Terminal Island. Approximately of the ship's hull had been damaged while the ship was buffeted by waves on the reef, which had opened numerous holes in her hull. The ship's drive shaft had broken, and her boilers and engines had shifted. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that estimates for "Iowan"s repair ranged up to $500,000. In an inquiry held by the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, "Iowan"s captain, S. A. Gates, a Californian with 25 years of sailing experience along the coast, blamed unusual tides for the grounding.
World War II and later career.
In 1942, after "Iowan" was repaired and after the United States had entered World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA). On 6 December 1942, "Iowan" was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease, and renamed "Tashkent" ("Ташкент" ) after the capital of Uzbekistan. Near the end of World War II, the WSA offered a payment of $694,743 to American-Hawaiian for the former "Iowan" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven American-Hawaiian ships that had been requisitioned by the WSA.
"Tashkent" was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO), but sailed with the Pacific Fleet of the Soviet Navy throughout the war. "Tashkent" was photographed at San Francisco at some point during the war, but most of her other movements are not known. However, in August 1945, "Tashkent" delivered troops and cargo in support of the Soviet invasions of Japanese-held Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. After the war's end, "Tashkent" returned to merchant operation with FESCO through 1966, when she was transferred to North Korea for use as a fish processing facility. The former "Tashkent" was scrapped in 1969.

New Conservatory Theatre Center

The New Conservatory Theatre Center is a not-for-profit theatre company located in San Francisco, California. NCTC showcases an eight-show Pride Season, an In-Concert/Cabaret Series, Family Theatre performances, "YouthAware" Touring Educational Theatre, and an Emerging Artists program. NCTC also houses a comprehensive Conservatory for youth and adults. It is located in San Francisco at 25 Van Ness Avenue, near Market Street.
Organizational History.
Founded in 1981 as a small theatre arts conservatory for low-income youth by Ed Decker (a former director of the American Conservatory Theater’s Young Conservatory), NCTC has been in operation for 31 years. In 1986, as a response to the AIDS epidemic sweeping the nation and heavily concentrated in San Francisco, Decker created the landmark "YouthAware" Touring Educational Theatre program which has since expanded to address an array of health and wellness concerns, been translated into five languages, and achieved national and international recognition. To date, more than 4.5 million youth in the U.S., Germany, Australia, South Africa, Holland, and the U.K. have seen "YouthAware" Theatre-in-Education programs in their schools and communities. In 2004, Decker received the STOP AIDS Award for his work. 
In 1995, Decker premiered the first Pride Season, a series of LGBT-themed performances that has since caught the eye of many renowned gay and gay-allied playwrights and directors. Decker has developed and/or premiered plays for NCTC’s main stage with artists such as Norman Allen, Terrence McNally, Edmund White, Joe Mantello, Mark Cannistraro, Mart Crowley, Jack Heifner, Hal Corley, Felice Picano, Brad Fraser, David Marshall Grant, Jeff Baron, Kevin Elyot, Jonathan Harvey, Jewelle Gomez, and Lee Blessing.
Summary of Programs.
NCTC's current activities fall under four major categories: Theatre Performances, the New Play Commissions program, the Conservatory program, and the "YouthAware" Educational Theatre Program. 
NCTC's theatre performance program is anchored around their "Pride Season," an eleven-month season featuring eight plays and musicals. Plays are selected based on their examination of LGBT issues as they relate to our current world. NCTC also houses a Family Matinee program, featuring daytime performances designed for children 4-10 and their families. 
NCTC commissions, develops, and premiers one new play with LGBT themes every 24 months to be performed during the Pride Season and one new play for young audiences ever 36 months to tour as part of the "YouthAware" Educational Theatre Program. Since the inception of the New Plays Commissions Program in 2002, NCTC has commissioned three new plays, including "Crucifixion" by four-time Tony Award-winning playwright Terrence McNally.

Rubén Suárez

Rubén Suárez Estrada (; born 19 February 1979) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Skoda Xanthi F.C. in the Superleague Greece. Mainly an attacking midfielder, he can also operate as a second striker.
Club career.
Born in Gijón, and a product of local Sporting de Gijón's famed youth academy, "Mareo", Suárez played six seasons with the Asturians' first-team in Segunda División. Afterwards he stayed in the level, with four additional years at Elche CF.
In July 2008 Suárez joined Levante UD, also in that category. In his first year he finished as the club's top scorer at 12, mainly due to the serious fibula injury to Alexandre Geijo.
In the 2009–10 season Suárez repeated the feat (again scoring in double digits), as the Valencian Community side returned to La Liga after a two-year absence. On 28 August 2010, at the ripe age of 31 years, six months and nine days, he made his debut in the top division, opening the score at home against Sevilla FC, through a penalty kick, in an eventual 1–4 defeat.
In late June 2012, aged 33, Suárez had his first adventure abroad, signing with Chinese Super League side Guizhou Renhe F.C. and reuniting with former Levante teammates Rafa Jordà and Nano, after contributing with eight goals in less than 1,000 minutes of play to Levante's first-ever qualification to the UEFA Europa League after a sixth-place finish in the league.
On 3 January 2013 Suárez returned to his country, signing with second level's UD Almería for 18 months.
International career.
Suárez played in all the matches for Spain at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Nigeria, netting in a 3–1 group stage win against Honduras (the only game where he did not appear from the bench), as the national team won the tournament.
Later in that year, he gained one cap for the under-21s.
Personal.
Suárez's father, Secundino Suárez Vázquez, aka "Cundi", was also a footballer. A defender, he played 15 professional seasons – all in the top level – for Sporting Gijón.

He was the first French consul in Shanghai from January 23, 1848 to June 10, 1853. He founded the Shanghai French Concession in 1849. 
In 1856, de Montigny was sent as a French envoy to King Mongkut of Thailand. A treaty was signed on August 15, 1856 to facilitate trade, guarantee religious freedom, and allow the access of French warships to Bangkok.
From Thailand, de Montigny visited Vietnam in 1857 to demand the establishment of a consulate in Huế, freedom to trade and to preach, and an end to persecution against Catholics. However, the Vietnamese court rejected all of his demands. When Montigny's mission failed, Napoléon III decided to dispatch a military force of 3,000 to Vietnam, leading to the capture of Da Nang by Rigault de Genouilly on September 1, 1858.
Charles de Montigny served again as President of the Municipal Council in Shanghai from May 1, 1862. From 1863 to 1868, he was French Consul in Tientsin, where he died in 1868.

<doc id="19029669" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19029669" title="Masonic ritual and symbolism">
Masonic ritual and symbolism

Masonic ritual refers to the scripted words and actions that are spoken or performed during the degree work in a Masonic Lodge. Masonic symbolism is that which is used to illustrate the principles which Freemasonry espouses. Masonic ritual has appeared in a number of contexts within literature including in "The Man Who Would Be King", by Rudyard Kipling, and "War and Peace", by Leo Tolstoy.
The purpose of Masonic ritual.
Freemasonry is described in its own ritual as a "Beautiful" or "Peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols". The symbolism of freemasonry is found throughout the Masonic Lodge, and contains many of the working tools of a medieval or renaissance stonemason. The whole system is transmitted to initiates through the medium of Masonic ritual, which consists of lectures and allegorical plays.
Common to all of Freemasonry is the three grade system of "craft" or "blue lodge" freemasonry, whose allegory is centred on the building of the Temple of Solomon, and the story of the chief architect, Hiram Abiff. Further degrees have different underlying allegories, often linked to the transmission of the story of Hiram. Participation in these is optional, and usually entails joining a separate Masonic body. The type and availability of the "Higher Degrees" also depends on the Masonic Jurisdiction of the Craft Lodge that first initiated the mason.
Standardization.
There are a number of different Masonic rituals, including the initiation ritual. The rituals are often known for their secrecy.
Freemasons conduct their degree work, often from memory, following a preset script and ritualised format. There are a variety of different Masonic rites for Craft Freemasonry. Each Masonic jurisdiction is free to standardize (or not standardize) its own ritual. However, there are similarities that exist among jurisdictions. For example, all Masonic ritual for the first three degrees makes use of the architectural symbolism of the tools of the medieval "operative" stonemason. Freemasons, as "speculative" masons (meaning philosophical rather than actual building), use this symbolism to teach moral and ethical lessons, such as the four cardinal virtues of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice, and the principles of "Brotherly Love, Relief (or Morality), and Truth" (commonly found in English language rituals), or "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" (commonly found in French rituals).
Symbols in ritual.
The Volume of the Sacred Law is always displayed in an open Lodge. In many French Lodges, the Masonic Constitutions are used instead. A candidate will be given his choice of religious text for his Obligation, according to his beliefs. UGLE alludes to similarities to legal practice in the UK, and to a common source with other oath taking processes. In Lodges with a membership of mixed religions it is common to find more than one sacred text displayed.
In keeping with the geometrical and architectural theme of Freemasonry, the Supreme Being is referred to in Masonic ritual by the titles of the "Great Architect of the Universe", "Grand Geometrician" or similar, to make clear that the reference is generic, and not tied to a particular religion's conception of God.
Some lodges make use of tracing boards. These are painted or printed illustrations depicting the various symbolic emblems of Freemasonry. They can be used as teaching aids during the lectures that follow each of the three degrees, when an experienced member explains the various concepts of Freemasonry to new members.
Solomon's Temple is a central symbol of Freemasonry, which holds that the first three Grand Masters were King Solomon, King Hiram I of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff - the craftsman/architect who built the temple. Masonic initiation rites include the reenactment of a scene set on the Temple Mount while it was under construction. Every Masonic Lodge, therefore, is symbolically the Temple for the duration of the degree, and possesses ritual objects representing the architecture of the Temple. These may either be built into the hall or be portable. Among the most prominent are replicas of the pillars Boaz and Jachin through which every initiate has to pass.
Masonic handshake.
The Masonic handshake, or "token", was originally used as a way to gain admission to meetings and identify legitimate visitors.
Influence on Mormonism.
Mormon temple worship shares an extensive commonality of symbols, signs, vocabulary and clothing with Freemasonry, including robes, aprons, handshakes, ritualistic raising of the arms, etc. The interpretation of many of these symbols has been adapted to the Mormon narrative from their original meanings in Freemasonry. For example, whereas Masons exchange secret handshakes to identify fellow Freemasons, Mormonism teaches that these handshakes must be given to sentinel angels in order for Mormons to be admitted into the highest kingdom of heaven. Mormon temple garments also bear the Masonic symbols of the Square and Compass, although Mormons have imbued these symbols with religious meaning that exceeds the meaning of the symbols as intended by Freemasonry.
In the "Temple and Salvation for the Dead" part of Discourses of Brigham Young, Brigham Young gives a quote about the temple which directly relates to the story of Hiram Abiff from Masonic folklore. Although Young changed some of the key masonic aspects about Hiram to fit better with Mormonism's view of the temple, the story is the same.
Perceived secrecy of Masonic ritual.
The mysterious disappearance of William Morgan in 1826 was said to be due to his threat to publish a book detailing the secret rituals of Freemasonry. After an attempt was made to burn down the publishing house and arresting Morgan on charges of petty larceny, he was seized and taken to Fort Niagara, after which he disappeared. The suspicion behind this led to the creation of the Anti-Masonic Party, which enjoyed brief popularity but rapidly became defunct after they fielded a Freemason as their presidential candidate in 1832.

Leptolobium

Leptolobium is a small Neotropical genus of Leguminosae (Fabaceae), with ten species currently recognized. With the exception of "Leptolobium panamense" (Benth.) Sch. Rodr. & A.M.G. Azevedo, which occurs in tropical forests from northwestern South America to Mexico, all species of "Leptolobium" are restricted to South America and most diverse in Brazil. Most "Leptolobium" species have been traditionally included in "Acosmium" Schott (Fabaceae), but both genera have been recently distinguished based on several vegetative and reproductive traits.

Marsland Valley

Marsland Valley is a nature reserve situated in two large valleys which straddle the Devon-Cornwall border. It is a designated nature reserve jointly managed by the Devon Wildlife Trust and the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a Special Area of Conservation, as well as forming part of two Sites of Special Scientific Interest; Steeple Point to Marsland Mouth on the Cornish side and Marsland to Clovelly Coast in Devon.
The valley is situated near the villages of Gooseham and Morwenstow, approximately ten miles north of the Cornish Atlantic Coast resort of Bude. The land was donated by the late Christopher Cadbury (former President of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation 1962-1986) to the Trusts.
Roe Deer and Purple Hairstreak butterflies can both be seen here, as well as the extremely rare pearl-bordered fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary.
On the south-facing wooded slope towards Gooseham Mill the trees are coppiced to create clearings, and vegetation thinned to keep it low so that flowers and insects can flourish.
Westward on the coast, Marsland Mouth denotes the western end of the North Devon Coast AONB. It also includes part of the Hartland section of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

Iraq–Jordan relations

Relations between neighbours Iraq and Jordan have historically been close. Iraq and Jordan were created after the First World War from former Ottoman dominions by way of a secret bilateral agreement between Britain and France. Perpetual efforts to unify the two states have been pursued over the last century. Jordan has an embassy in Baghdad and Iraq has an embassy in Amman.
History.
As the two original Hashemite monarchies established in Western Asia by Britain following World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Jordan and Iraq had initially maintained close relations based on family ties. This ended when the Hashemite royal family in Iraq was overthrown and killed by dissident military officers in the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état. In the years that followed the two regimes became hostile to one another. But by the late 1970s, Jordan and Iraq built a bilateral alliance that lasted through the 1991 Gulf War.
In 1979 Iraq initiated contacts aimed at closer alignment at a time when the newly established President Saddam Hussein was seeking Arab allies, perhaps to provide for at least some level of transnational support and inter-Arab legitimacy for his regime. More important for the Jordanians, however, were the economic pay-offs of such an alliance, as Iraq could provide economic support and oil supplies that the kingdom desperately needed.
But as the new alliance began to solidify in 1980, Saddam Hussein's military forces invaded Iran and King Hussein immediately backed Iraq against the revolutionary Islamist regime in Iran. The Hashemite government viewed Iran as a potential threat not from military expansion, but as a supporter and living example of Islamist revolutionary militancy against conservative pro-Western monarchies. For King Hussein, Iran was a threat not just to his regime's security directly, but also indirectly in so far as it threatened the Persian Gulf Arab monarchies oil which Jordan was partially reliant for aid. Throughout the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Jordan supported Iraq politically and especially economically. Indeed, Jordan's port of Aqaba and its overland trucking routes became Iraq's main supply line throughout the eight years of that war. In return, Jordan received oil from Iraq at prices far below market value.
To expand on these political-economic linkages, Jordan helped create the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC) in 1989, in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war. The ACC alliance of Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and Yemen was meant to facilitate capital and labor flows between members while also allowing them to act as a fairly formidable lobbying bloc within inter-Arab politics in their mutual efforts to renegotiate their debt terms with the Persian Gulf Arab monarchies. Despite strenuous Jordanian efforts to prevent it, that alliance evaporated in the heat of the Gulf War.
The shift in Iraq–Jordan relations became apparent in August 1995, when Jordan granted political asylum to two Iraqi defectors. King Hussein of Jordan also openly criticized Iraqi policies on national television on 23 August 1995. However, majority of Jordanians supported Saddam Hussein. Western countries considered the change in Jordan's policy on Iran as a means to further isolate Hussein and eventually weaken his leadership.
Despite periodic crises of confidence and lingering Iraqi resentment over Jordan's close ties with Saddam Hussein, the two countries forged deep ties. In the face of repeated attacks and threats, Jordan has maintained a strong diplomatic presence in Baghdad.
The economic impact of the Iraq crisis in Jordan has been mixed. Jordan has benefited greatly from serving as a "gateway" to Iraq for governments, aid workers, contractors, and businesspeople, the real estate and banking sectors are booming, and it stands to reap more benefits from increased trade and transport should the situation in Iraq improve. However, with the fall of Saddam, Jordan lost the sizable oil subsidies and customary shipments it received from Iraq. One of Jordan's principal economic interests in the new Iraq is securing future energy assistance.
Current affairs.
Jordan can claim only modest influence over developments in Iraq. The kingdom does have notable intelligence capabilities vis-à-vis Iraq, and it reportedly helped the United States track down and kill Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Although some Jordanians highlight cross-border tribal and family connections with Iraqi Sunni Arabs, they pale in comparison to those of Iran, Turkey, and Syria. Jordan's most significant means of influence is its hosting of a large and ever-changing Iraqi expatriate community, mostly of Sunni Arab origin.
Jordanian leaders worry that Iraq is becoming a haven for terrorist groups, a fear dramatically heightened by the November 2005 suicide bombings in Amman. Jordan also has an interest in the development of Iraq and is anxious about the growing Iranian involvement in Iraqi politics, and more broadly increasing Iranian and Shiite influence in the region.
In 2005, the case of Raed Mansour al-Banna, a Jordanian suicide bomber who blew himself up in Hillah, Iraq strained relations between the two countries. After Ranna's family gave him a heroic funeral in Jordan, thousands of Iraqi Shia protested, and the two countries recalled their respective ambassadors.
In 24 December 2012, Iraq and Jordan agreed to extend an oil pipeline to the Red Sea city of Aqaba for the export of Iraqi crude. The new pipeline would be capable of pumping one million barrels per day. Jordanian Prime Minister Abdullah al-Nsur stated that Jordan is important for Iraq's trade and the export of its oil. Iraq also agreed to implement a 2009 agreement to establish a free trade zone between the two countries and increase the capacity of its gas pipeline to secure Jordan's Iraqi natural gas needs. Jordan relies on imports for 95 percent of its energy needs. A rise in fuel prices by up to 53 percent in November prompted violent protests in which three people were killed and more than 70 injured. Iraq, which sits on the region's third largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran at 115 billion barrels, hopes the move will increase and diversify its exports. Jordan imports 10,000 barrels of Iraqi oil per day at well below the global market value, and has agreed to increase that amount to 15,000 barrels. Iraq delivered oil to Jordan for preferential prices under the U.N. oil-for-food program during the rule of Saddam Hussein.
Iraq’s contribution to the world’s oil supply will significantly increase to more than 8 million barrels a day by 2035, outstripping its current output, according to the International Energy Agency. In its “Iraq Energy Outlook” report, the IEA said the country’s oil and gas reserves would be key to its own future, as well as playing an essential role in stabilizing the global energy markets. It is expected that Iraq will dominate oil supply over the coming decades and will become the world’s largest oil exporter after Russia by the 2030s.
In 2013, trade between Iraq and Jordan has been facilitated by Israel, which allows goods to be transported by truck via the Jordan River Crossing near Beit She'an. The goods are usually taken to Haifa Port and shipped from there to Turkey and other countries, as an alternative to Syria.

History of alien abduction claims

As noted below, the Antonio Vilas Boas case (1957) and the Hill abduction (1961) were the first cases of UFO abduction to earn widespread attention.
Though these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson notes this assertion is incorrect: the Hill and Boas abductions, he contends, were only the first "canonical" abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine, but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that "the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe." (The phrase "entirely unpredisposed" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Bullard's study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.) See "external links" for all four parts of Rogerson's article.
Paleo-abductions.
While "alien abduction" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, there were many similar stories circulating decades earlier. These early abduction-like accounts have been dubbed "paleo-abductions" by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. This same two-part article ( and ) makes note of many paleo-abductions, some of which were reported well before the 1957 Antonio Vilas Boas case earned much attention, or even before the UFO report claimed in 1947 by pilot Kenneth Arnold that first generated widespread interest in UFOs:
Contactees.
The UFO contactees of the 1950s claimed to have contacted aliens, and the substance of contactee narratives are often regarded as quite different from alien abduction accounts.
However, Rogerson contends that it is often difficult to determine the division between contactees and abductees, with classification sometimes seeming arbitrary.
Two landmark cases.
Allegedly genuine stories of kidnap by extraterrestrials goes back at least to the mid-1950s, with the Antonio Vilas Boas case (which didn't receive much attention until several years later). 
Widespread publicity was generated by the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 (again not widely known until several years afterwards), culminating in a made for television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case, and was perhaps the first where:
Neither the contactees nor these early abduction accounts, however, saw much attention from ufology, then still largely reluctant to consider close encounters of the third kind, where occupants of UFOs are allegedly interacted with.
Undoubtedly, the Barney and Betty Hill case is one of, if not the most famous case of purported abduction ever. Barney and Betty were driving home on a road free from other cars late one night. They both saw an odd light coming at them from above. They then blacked out and found themselves back on the road, driving. The only thing odd was it was two hours later than when they had seen the light. They both went to psychologists and hypnotists. They learned of the Grey on board the ship that had abducted them. See Barney and Betty Hill for more depth.
Later developments.
Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle (a University of Wyoming psychologist) became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. For some years, he was probably the only academic figure devoting any time to studying or researching abduction accounts. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989. (Bryan, 145fn)
Budd Hopkins — a painter and sculptor by profession — had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using hypnosis to extract details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture. (Schnabel 1994)
The 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Budd Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs and John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a genuine phenomenon. (Schnabel 1994)
Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. The mid and late 1980s saw the involvement of two esteemed academic figures: Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack and historian David M. Jacobs.
With Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, several shifts occurred in the nature of the abduction narratives. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings. (Schnabel 1994)
Furthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate scheme underway, that the aliens were attempting a program to create human–alien hybrids, though the motives for this scheme were unknown. There were anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders. Despite the relative paucity of corroborative evidence, Jacobs presents this scenario as not only plausible, but self-evident. Hopkins and Jacobs have also been criticized for selective citation of abductee interviews, favoring those that support their hypothesis of extraterrestrial intervention.
The involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject. Joe Montaldo
John E. Mack.
Matheson writes that "if Jacobs's credentials were impressive," then those of Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack might seem "impeccable" in comparison. (Matheson, 251) Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing dozens of people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.
Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than the earlier researchers. Matheson writes that "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." (Matheson, 251) Furthermore, Mack notes when alternative interpretations are viable; throughout "Abduction", his first book on the subject, he allows and even considers likely that alien abductions are a new type of visionary experience. 
Matheson notes that unlike earlier abduction researchers, Mack is generally quite cautious in his interpretations of physical evidence and corroborative testimony. He places little value in the scars and scratches often attributed to alien "medical" exams, and argues that trying to prove the actuality of alleged "implants" placed in abductees is largely a futile effort.
Mack argued that the abduction phenomenon might be the beginning of a major paradigm shift in human consciousness, or "a kind of fourth blow to our collective egoism, following those of Copernicus, Darwin and Freud." (Bryan, 270) Mack also noted that, after an initial period of terror and confusion (a phase he dubbed "ontological shock"), many abductees ultimately regard their experiences more positively, saying that their experiences broadened their consciousness.
In June 1992, Mack and physicist David E. Pritchard organized a five-day conference at MIT to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon. The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives. (In response to this conference, Mack and Jacobs were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 1993).
Writer C. D. B. Bryan attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for The New Yorker. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.
David Icke and the global conspiracy.
David Icke is a British writer who proposed these two hypothesis about the alien abduction phenomena: 
In "Tales From The Time Loop" and other works, Icke states that most organised religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are Illuminati creations designed to divide and conquer the human race through endless conflicts. In a similar vein, Icke believes racial and ethnic divisions are an illusion promoted by aliens, and that racism fuels the Illuminati agenda.
According to David Icke the Global Elite controls the world using what he calls a "pyramid of manipulation" consisting of sets of hierarchical structures involving banking, business, the military, education, the media, religion, drug companies, intelligence agencies, and organised crime. At the very top of the pyramid are what Icke calls the "Prison Warders," who are not human. He writes that: "A pyramidal structure of human beings has been created under the influence and design of the extraterrestrial Prison Warders and their overall master, the Luciferic Consciousness. They control the human clique at the top of the pyramid, which I have dubbed the Global Elite."
In 1999, Icke wrote and published "The Biggest Secret: The Book that Will Change the World", in which he suggested that Earth is a zoo prison created by alien beings and identified the extraterrestrial prison warders as reptilians from the constellation Draco. They walk erect and appear to be human, living not only on the planets they come from, but also in caverns and tunnels under the earth. They have cross-bred with humans, which has created "hybrids" who are "possessed" by the full-blooded reptilians. The reptiles' hybrid reptilian-human DNA allows them to change from reptilian to human form if they consume human blood. Icke has drawn parallels with the 1980s science-fiction series "V", in which the earth is taken over by reptiloid aliens disguised as humans.

HMS Cormorant (1877)

HMS "Cormorant" was an "Osprey"-class sloop launched at Chatham on 12 September 1877 and later the receiving ship at Gibraltar. She was renamed "Rooke" in 1946 and broken up in 1949. 
Design.
The "Osprey" class were of composite construction, with wooden hulls over an iron frame. They were designed by the Chief Constructor, William Henry White and five were ordered. Of 1,130 tons displacement and approximately 950 indicated horsepower, they were capable of approximately 11 knots and were armed with two 7" muzzle loading rifled guns on pivoting mounts, and four 64-pound guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). They had a crew complement of approximately 140 men.
Construction.
"Cormorant" was laid down at Chatham Royal Dockyard in 1875 and launched on 12 September 1877. She was commissioned on 2 July 1878. 
History.
The primary purpose of ships of the class was to maintain British naval dominance through trade protection, anti-slavery, and surveying. 
In 1879 she served on the Australia Station, and in April 1886 she was on the Pacific Station. On 20 July 1887 she became the first vessel to use the newly built graving dock at the Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard.
Fate.
"Cormorant" became a receiving ship at Gibraltar in 1889, was renamed HMS "Rooke" in 1946 and was scrapped in 1949, being broken up at Malaga.

Dick Jones (Wyoming politician)

Richard R. "Dick" Jones (September 5, 1910 – August 20, 2008) was a trucking executive from Cody and Powell in Park County, Wyoming, who served in his state's House of Representatives and Senate from 1955 to 1974. He was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee in the nationally Democratic year of 1974. A conservative, Jones was allied with the Ronald W. Reagan political faction in Wyoming. His family-owned Dick Jones Trucking Company still operates from Powell; at its peak, it reached into thirty-eight states.
Early years and business success.
Jones was the third of six children born to Swedish immigrants and naturalized citizens, Alfred and Elsa Jones. He spent his early years on the family homestead east of Billings, the largest city in Montana, on the Huntley Project, an irrigation showcase. In 1928, he graduated from Huntley Project High School. The area is now referred to as the unincorporated community of Huntley in Yellowstone County. Jones visited Sweden on several occasions and also took his five grandchildren to meet their European relatives.
As a young man, Jones worked for the railroad and delivered milk in Billings. He started the first trucking company in Casper in eastern Wyoming. In 1932, he married his high school sweetheart, the former Estes "Jackie" Clarke, and the couple had three children. Estes died in 1984, and two years later, Jones married the former Evelyn Nelson. In 1935, Jones purchased a one-truck freight company in Powell, the original Dick Jones Trucking. A son, grandson, and a granddaughter work in the business. For many years, the company was based in Cody, but it returned in 2001 to Powell, where Jones had been elected to the city council in 1940 and as mayor in 1950.
Legislative service and gubernatorial bid.
Jones was elected to the Wyoming House in 1954 and elevated by voters to the Senate in 1956, where he served until he resigned to run for governor in a bid to succeed retiring Republican Governor Stanley K. Hathaway. Jones was also the Wyoming Senate President from 1967 to 1968 and for a time was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. While he was a senator, Governor Hathaway named him to the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education.
Jones won the Republican nomination for governor by only 834 votes (1.4 percent) over his closest competitor, then state Senator Malcolm Wallop, a New York City-born rancher and businessman from Sheridan in northeastern Wyoming. Two years later, Wallop would unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Gale W. McGee. Jones received 15,502 (26.5 percent) of the primary ballots to Wallop's 14,688 (25.1 percent). Two other candidates were marginally behind, Roy Peck, a newspaper publisher from Riverton, with 14, 217 (24.7 percent), and Clarence Brimmer (born 1922), with 14,014 (24 percent). Brimmer was appointed in 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., to one of the Wyoming federal judgeships and has announced his retirement. There is no runoff election in Wyoming; so Jones' primary plurality was sufficient for the nomination.
Jones then faced Democrat Edgar Herschler of Kemmerer in Lincoln County. With 19,997 votes (46.6 percent), Herschler defeated two primary rivals, Harry E. Leimback and John J. Rooney, who polled 15,255 (35.5 percent) and 7,674 (17.9 percent), respectively. Rooney had been the unsuccessful 1970 Democratic nominee against Hathaway. Herschler prevailed, 71,741 (55.9 percent) to Jones' 56,645 (44.1 percent). The national political mood worked against Republicans in light of the Watergate scandal though nearly all of the Republican candidates nationally had nothing to do with the matter. The total Republican vote in the primary had been 58,421. So Jones failed to acquire 1,776 votes cast in the Republican primary and made no apparent gains among Democrats. Herschler, however, polled 28,815 more votes in the general election that the combined Democratic primary total. Herschler served three terms as governor from 1975 to 1987.
In 1978, former Republican State Senator John C. Ostlund (1927–2004) of Gillette, the seat of Campbell County in northeastern Wyoming, polled 67,595 votes (49.1 percent) in his unsuccessful effort to deny Herschler a second term. Ostlund's vote was hence 10,950 more than Jones' had been four years earlier.
Jones was thereafter a financial supporter of Reagan in 1976, 1980, and 1984 and contributed to various Republican candidates in Wyoming during that time as well as the state GOP and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In 1999, he became a contributor to the first presidential campaign of U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. He also donated to former primary rival Malcolm Wallop and former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Cody.
Death and legacy.
Jones died of complications from surgery in Powell Hospital some two weeks before his 98th birthday. In addition to his wife Evelyn, he was survived by daughter Nancy (husband Tom) Cook of Cody, and sons Alan C. Jones (born 1941) and wife Alayne of Powell, and Tom Jones and wife Barbara Costa Jones of Cheyenne; five grandchildren, Pam Ruehle, Rick Cook, Carol Zierk, LeAnne Kindred, and Mitch Jones; ten great-grandchildren; sister Ruby Snyder and sister-in-law Alma Jones, both of Huntley. He was preceded in death by his parents, brothers, Bill and Bob Jones, and sisters, Irene Hauf and Lois Weidinger. Services were held on August 25 at First United Methodist Church of Cody. Interment was in Riverside Cemetery, founded in Cody by "Buffalo Bill" Cody.
Jones was a mover and shaker behind the creation of Northwest Community College in Powell and served on the original board of trustees. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Community College Foundation and served on the board of directors. Wyoming has a collection of community colleges but only one four-year degree-granting institution, the University of Wyoming at Laramie.
Jones' lack of higher education proved no impediment to his success. When he was once quizzed about his "luck", he replied, "Yes, I am lucky, the harder I work, the luckier I am."

Crop wild relative

A crop wild relative (CWR) is a wild plant closely related to a domesticated plant, whose geographic origins can be traced to regions known as Vavilov Centers (named for the pioneering botanist Nikolai Vavilov). It may be a wild ancestor of the domesticated plant, or another closely related taxon.
Overview.
The wild relatives of crop plants constitute an increasingly important resource for improving agricultural production and for maintaining sustainable agro-ecosystems. With the advent of climate change and greater ecosystem instability CWRs are likely to prove a critical resource in ensuring food security for the new millennium. It was Nikolai Vavilov, the Russian botanist who first realized the importance of crop wild relatives in the early 20th century. Genetic material from CWRs has been utilized by humans for thousands of years to improve the quality and yield of crops. Farmers have used traditional breeding methods for millennia, wild maize ("Zea mexicana") is routinely grown alongside maize to promote natural crossing and improve yields. More recently, plant breeders have utilised CWR genes to improve a wide range of crops like rice ("Oryza sativa"), tomato ("Solanum lycopersicum") and grain legumes.
CWRs have contributed many useful genes to crop plants, and modern varieties of most major crops now contain genes from their wild relatives.Therefore CWRs are wild plants related to socio-economically important species including food, fodder and forage crops, medicinal plants, condiments, ornamental, and forestry species, as well as plants used for industrial purposes, such as oils and fibres, and to which they can contribute beneficial traits. A CWR can be defined as "... a wild plant taxon that has an indirect use derived from its relatively close genetic relationship to a crop...”
Conservation of crop wild relatives.
CWRs are essential components of natural and agricultural ecosystems and hence are indispensable for maintaining ecosystem health. Their conservation and sustainable use is very important for improving agricultural production, increasing food security, and maintaining a healthy environment.
The natural populations of many CWRs are increasingly at risk. They are threatened by habitat loss through the destruction and degradation of natural environment or their conversion to other uses. Deforestation is leading to the loss of many populations of important wild relatives of fruit, nut, and industrial crops. Populations of wild relatives of cereal crops that occur in arid or semi-arid lands are being severely reduced by over grazing and resulting desertification. The growing industrialization of agriculture is drastically reducing the occurrence of CWRs within the traditional agro-ecosystems. The wise conservation and use of CWRs are essential elements for increasing food security, eliminating poverty, and maintaining the environment.
Examples of wild relatives.
Vegetables.
Note: Many different vegetables share one common ancestor, particularly in the Brassica family and plants. Many vegetables are also hybrids of different species, again this is particularly true of Brassicas.

Tom Clapp

Tom Clapp (25 October 1858 - 15 October 1933) was an English-born international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Newport and Nantyglo RFC. He won 14 caps for Wales and captained the team on three occasions. Clapp was the first Newport player to captain Wales.
Rugby career.
Born in Portman Square, Marylebone, London in 1858, but raised in Somerset, Clapp's family moved to Nantyglo when he was still in his youth. Clapp would play his early rugby for Blaina before moving to Nantyglo RFC. In 1883 he moved to first class team Newport and Clapp made an impression on the club as in the 1884/85 and the 1885/86 seasons he was made team captain. In May 1888 Clapp left Welsh rugby behind and emigrated to the United States of America following his brother David who left a year earlier. In 1920 both brothers were citrus fruit farmers in California.
International career.
Clapp gained his first cap in 1882 against Ireland, a game in which he scored a try. The next two games, against England and Scotland, were his last for Nantyglo. Clapp would represent Wales in 14 matches and on 12 March 1887 he captained Wales at Birkenhead Park against Ireland. Wales won the game due to a try being worth a single point, as they were out scored 3 tries to one, but a drop goal from Arthur Gould gave the visitors the win. Clapp retained the captaincy for the next match against Scotland, and led his country in their first win against the Scottish team. His next game against Ireland, on March 3, 1888, would not only be his last as captain, but his last in the Welsh shirt.

People v. Beardsley

People v. Beardsley 150 Mich. 206, 113 N.W. 1128 (1907) is a well-known case that illustrates the parameters around the legal necessity of a duty to act, and the criminal liability of failure to act when there is an obligation to provide reasonable assistance. In "Jones v. United States" 308 F.2s 307 (D.C. Cir. 1962) the categories falling under this legal duty were set forth. They include duties based on statute, duties based on contract, duties based on the voluntary assuming of responsibility as for the care of a child, and duties based on legal relationships, such as between parent and child or husband and a wife.
Circumstances.
Beardsley, his wife being out of town, invited a woman, Blanche Burns, to spend the weekend with him in his living quarters. He had an ongoing relationship with Burns and had met with her previously. During this time together, the two of them drank fairly steadily. Without Beardsley's knowledge, Burns obtained some morphine tablets. Beardsley walked in while she was taking the morphine tablets. He slapped the box the tablets were in out of her hand and crushed several on the floor with his foot. Burns picked up and swallowed two of the tablets. Near the time of the expected return of his wife, Beardsley asked a friend to help him carry her to a room of a friend in the basement of Beardsley's house, even though she was in a stupor, and asked the friend to watch out for her and let her out the back way when she was ready, as he was too intoxicated to be of help. Burns died a few hours later. 
Beardsley was tried for manslaughter for failure in his duty to act to provide reasonable care to Burns. The prosecutor argued that Beardsley at the time was Burns' natural guardian and had a clear duty to protect her. The defense argued that no such legal duty is created by a moral obligation. None of the categories of legal duty fit the case. The fact that Burns was a woman does not create that same legal duty as a husband has toward a wife or a parent to a child, as the prosecutor sought to infer. Nevertheless, Beardsley was convicted of manslaughter.
Appeal.
Beardsley appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Michigan and his conviction was reversed. The court found it "repugnant to our moral sense" that a duty would be created because Burns was a woman, as no such moral or legal duty would be implied if she had been a man.

Derek Harland Ward

Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward, DFC & Bar, was a New Zealand flying ace during the Second World War. He was credited with six kills, one shared destroyed, one probable and four damaged against the "Luftwaffe". Ward was shot down and killed by the German ace Hans-Joachim Marseille on 17 June 1942. Among his notable victories was a Focke-Wulf 200 ""Condor"", destroyed on 1 May 1942.
Career.
A doctor's son, Ward was born in Whangarei on 31 July 1917. After obtaining his pilot’s licence in April 1937 he joined the RNZAF and after training sailed to Britain in April 1938 to serve with the RAF. On 1 June 1937 Ward was granted a short service commission as a Pilot Officer.
In mid-June 1938 he was posted to No. 151 Squadron, a unit which saw no action in the early part of the war. 
Followng the start of the German blitzkrieg in May 1940 Ward and five other pilots delivered new Hurricanes to No. 87 Squadron in France. Following high casualties Ward and the other pilots remained with 87 Squadron, flying on operations. On 18 May Ward destroyed a Henschel 126 and the next day damaged a Do 17. 
On 20 May any aircraft still serviceable with the Squadron were ordered back to the UK.Ward took a Hurricane with no gunsight and few working instruments. Attempting to land in northern France to refuel, he saw fires in the town nearby as two Dorniers were making a bombing attack on the aerodrome. Atttaking, he scoring hits on one and chased off the other. 
Ward was then attacked by Bf 109’s, and managed to land. After refuelling he took off and low over the Channel ran into more Bf 109’s. Ward dived to low level and reached Debden safely. 
During the Battle of Britain No. 87 Squadron was heavily engaged in the South West and on the Southern coast approaches. On 15 August 1940 Ward claimed a Bf 110 destroyed. In winter of 1940 the Squadron continued night patrols and intruder attacks against airfields in France. He was awarded the DFC in October 1941. 
Ward was posted overseas in September 1941 and took command of No. 73 Squadron in Egypt on night defence duties. Ward commanded a detached Flight operating in the Western Desert with ’Whitforce’. Flying bomber-escorts, offensive sweeps and attacks on enemy airfields, on 8 December 1941 he destroyed a Ju 88. 
By early 1942 Ward was often flying several sorties a day. He destroyed an He 111 on 9 February and probably a Bf 109 four days later. On 1 May 1942, while strafing Barce airfield at night, Ward saw a four-engined aircraft - probably a FW 200 Condor- and shot it down in flames. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC for this action. 
In early June 1942 the Squadron returned to day operations.
Last battle.
Around midday on 17 June 1942, Ward's Squadron was returning to base, very low on fuel,when they were attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109s from "Jagdgeschwader 27". Two Hawker Hurricanes were shot down and their pilots bailed out. Most of the Squadron had not noticed this and landed, but according to Allied reports, Ward returned to protect the pilots in their parachutes only to be shot down and killed.
According to the German report of the action:
Around midday four Bf 109s ran into ten Hurricanes and approximately 20 Curtiss planes in the air between Gambut and Ras Azeiz. "Oberleutnant" Marseille was the first to dive into a thick crowd of enemy fighters and shot one of them down on his first pass. As he was breaking to shake an enemy off his tail, another plane flitted across his gunsight. Marseille fired immediately and this opponent,too, fell burning. He then sighted four fighters flying in a defensive circle protecting their fellow pilot in the chute harness. Marseille shot down two more out of the Lufbery circle.
His fellow pilots encouraged Marseille to continue for another kill, to achieve his 100th kill.
"Jochen" pounced down upon an enemy aircraft just taking off from Gambut which had only reached an altitude of 100 metres. 
One of these last three kills was Ward.
Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward DFC RAF of No. 73 Squadron RAF is buried at Plot 1 C 10 at the Halfaya Sollum War Cemetery, Egypt

Italian Cultural Centre Vancouver

The Italian Cultural Centre is located at 3075 Slocan Street, in East Vancouver, Canada, on Slocan Street at Grandview Highway.
History.
The Italian Cultural Centre's beginnings are in 1974 when the Consul General of Italy, Giovanni Germano, met with the Premier of British Columbia, Dave Barret. In the Provincial Legislature the Premier represented the riding of Vancouver-Hastings, an area heavily inhabited by Canadians of Italian origin. The Premier was well aware of the wish of the Italian community and he therefore challenged Consul Germano to find the support and turn the dream into a reality. Premier Barret assured Consul Germano that a grant from the B.C. Government would be available. At Vancouver City Hall, Mayor Art Phillips, also well aware of the wish of the Italian community, indicated to Consul Germano the possibility of obtaining city land at a special price. The land had already been chosen: an city dump in the heart of Vancouver East. [http://www.savourychef.com/wedding-venue-event-venue/italian-cultural-centre/]
Both the Provincial Government and the City of Vancouver kept their promise. In order to draw a wider participation of members, a Federation of Italian Associations was formed on a Canadian legal basis: the Italian Folk Society, later to become the Italian Cultural Centre Society. The original societies pertaining to the Federation were the following: Associazione Nazionale Alpini, Circolo Abruzzese, Coro Italiano della British Columbia, Famee Furlane, Famiglia Bagnolese, Italian Canadian Rod & Gun Club, Italian Mutual Aid Society, Molisana Society, Selva del Montello, Sicilian Club, Società Culturale Vicentini, St. Jude Italian Society and Tuscany Cultural Society. These 13 were the founding societies. Today there are 37 societies affiliated to the Italian Cultural Centre.
On September 25, 1977, the Italian Cultural Centre officially opened its doors. The former city dump became an address in Vancouver where the Italian community could gather with the aim to preserve, develop and express Italian culture and language. [http://raymondculos.com/culture.html]
The centre's services are a restaurant, museum, library, banquet hall, daycare centre, television production centre and an indoor bocce court. Every summer in June the centre hosts a week-long Italian festival called Italian Week.[http://www.destinationvancouver.com/?campaign_id=1&tp=detail&type_id=18&advertiser_id=226&tab_id=1]
Bocce.
Adjoining the main building, the centre has an indoor bocce court.
According to Boccemon Tom McNutt "The Italian Cultural Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia has one of the finest bocce facilities on the continent. It is a great institution and every culture would be proud to have such a treasure."[http://www.joyofbocce.com/Vancouver.ivnu]

Standoff distance

Standoff distance is a security measure that focuses on preventing unscreened vehicles from approaching within a certain distance of a building. It is intended to deter car bombs by making it more difficult for them to cause catastrophic damage. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, many high-risk federal buildings began enforcing standoff distances. It is based on the concept that a blast shock load is essentially a high-pressure front that moves out radially and decays very quickly. Hydraulic roadblocks (sometimes wedge-shaped), or bollards can be raised to block approaching vehicles; these can be designed to prevent even a heavy, fast-moving truck from getting through. Jersey barriers and concrete planters have also been used to maintain separation between screened and unscreened traffic. Certain infrastructure at risk of terrorist attack, such as bridges, may not be well-suited to standoff distances since their purpose is for traffic to travel along them.

Cardiff United Synagogue

The Cardiff United Synagogue is an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Cardiff, Wales.
History.
A Jewish community existed in Cardiff by 1841, when the Marquess of Bute donated land at Highfield for a Jewish Cemetery. The congregation, which is the result of the merger of several historic congregations, traces its roots to the Old Hebrew Congregation, which erected a synagogue building on Trinity Street in 1853, and to the Bute Street synagogue of 1858. Bute Street was the center of the Jewish community in the nineteenth century.
Former locations and ancestral congregations in Cardiff include the following:
The most architecturally distinguished of the several historic synagogue buildings was the classical/eclectic synagogue in Windsor Place. One of the congregation's former buildings was purchased in 1979 and converted into a Hindu temple. With the diminution of the Cardiff Jewish community and a drift away from the older neighborhoods, these congregations consolidated in the present, modern building in Cyncoed Gardens, dedicated by Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks in 2003.
Choir.
The congregation has a notable choir.

Macchi M.5

The Macchi M.5 was an Italian single-seat fighter flying boat designed and built by Nieuport-Macchi at Varese. It was extremely manoeuvrable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight.
Development.
The first prototype of a single-seat sesquiplane fighter was the Type M which first flew in 1917. Developed by engineers Buzio and Calzavera it had a single-step hull and an open cockpit forward of the wings and was similar to the earlier Macchi M.3. It was followed by another prototype with a revised tail unit designated the Ma and further developed as the M bis and Ma bis. The production aircraft was designated the M.5 and like the prototypes were powered by a single Isotta Fraschini V.4B engine in pusher configuration. Deliveries soon commenced in the summer of 1917 to the "Aviazione per la Regia Marina" (Italian Navy Aviation). Late production aircraft had a more powerful Isotta Fraschini V.6 engine and redesigned wingtip floats, they were designated M.5 mod. Macchi produced 200 aircraft and another 44 were built by "Società Aeronautica Italiana".
Operational history.
The M.5 was operated by five Italian maritime patrol squadrons as a fighter and convoy escort, and some were embarked on the "Giuseppe Miraglia". Towards the end of World War I, the aircraft were flown by both United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. Ensign Charles Hammann won the first Medal of Honor awarded to a United States naval aviator in an M.5.
In 1923, when the "Regia Aeronautica" was formed, 65 M.5s were still in service, although they all had been scrapped within a few years.

De Scott Evans

De Scott Evans (March 28, 1847 – July 4, 1898) was an American painter known for working in a number of genres. Raised in Indiana, he spent much of his career in Ohio and then moved to New York City. His posthumous reputation is largely based on a number of "trompe l'oeil" still lifes that have been attributed to him.
Life.
David Scott Evans was born in Boston, Indiana to David S. and Nancy A. (Davenport) Evans. His father was a physician. He attended Miami University's preparatory school in the 1860s, studying with professor Adrian Beaugureau at Miami and later in Cincinnati. Evans married Alice Josephine Burk in 1872. They had two biological daughters, Mabel and Nancy, and an adopted daughter, Laura.
In 1873, he became head of the art department at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, and taught there until 1875. Evans then lived in Paris from 1877 to 1878, where he studied with Adolphe William Bouguereau. He then taught from 1882 to 1887 at the Cleveland Academy of Art, and then moved to New York City in 1887, at the age of forty.
Evans and his three daughters died in July 1898, when the Paris-bound steamer was rammed by a sailing ship; 500 other passengers and crew were also lost. His wife was not on board and later remarried. There is a cenotaph for Evans and his daughters in the Oxford Cemetery in Oxford, Ohio.
Work and legacy.
During his life, he was mainly known for his genre paintings and portraits of stylish young women in rich settings. His popularity faded after his death, until a number of "trompe l'oeil" still lifes were attributed to him. Evans is known to have signed his work as D. Scott Evans and later De Scott Evans, and some of the still lifes attributed to him bear the names David Scott, S. S. David, and Stanley S. David. The attributions are not without question, but are assumed based on the similarity of two paintings of pears, and scholars' inability to identify another artist named "David" who was active at the right time and place.

Blue River (Oregon)

Blue River is a tributary of the McKenzie River in Linn and Lane counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. From its source at the confluence of Mann and Wolf creeks in the Cascade Range, it flows generally southwest to join the McKenzie near the community of Blue River. Saddle Dam and Blue River Dam block the river about from its mouth to form Blue River Reservoir, a multipurpose impoundment built in 1968 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
The river's watershed lies almost entirely within the Willamette National Forest, dominated by western hemlock and Douglas-fir. Blue River was named for the striking blue color that apparently comes from its rocky bed. 
Course.
Blue River begins on the western slopes of the Cascade Range at the confluence of Mann and Wolf creeks in Linn County, slightly north of its border with Lane County. Descending from an elevation of about above sea level, the river flows generally southwest through the Willamette National Forest. Forest Road 15 follows the river along its right bank from its source to about river mile (RM) 9 or river kilometer (RK) 14. 
The upper river receives Quentin Creek from the right before crossing the border into Lane County. Just southwest of the border, the river receives Cook Creek, also from the right. Just beyond RM 9 (RK 14), the river passes under Forest Road 15 and receives Tidbits Creek from the right. At this point, the river turns sharply south, and Forest Road 15 runs along its left bank. Just before entering Blue River Reservoir, about from the mouth, the river receives Mona Creek from the right and passes under Forest Road 120, which leads to Mona Campground. 
A fraction of a mile beyond the mouth of Mona Creek, Lookout Creek enters from the left near the Lookout Campground and Boat Launch, and Mona Campground is on the right. Blue River and the reservoir curve to the southwest, and Scott Creek enters from the right at RM 5 (RK 8). On the opposite shore at this point is Saddle Dam and its boat launch, which lie outside the national forest. At this point, Forest Road 15 leaves the river and the reservoir and heads south to Oregon Route 126. 
As Blue River nears Blue River Dam, about from the mouth, Quartz Creek and North Fork Quartz Creek enter from the right. Below the dam, Forest Road 125 runs parallel to the river along its right bank. The river passes a United States Geological Survey stream gauge below the dam, and then Simmonds Creek enters from the right. Blue River joins the McKenzie River at the community of Blue River, from the McKenzie's confluence with the Willamette River.

Anna Morandi Manzolini

Anna Morandi Manzolini (21 January 1714 – 9 July 1774) was an internationally known anatomist and anatomical wax modeler, as lecturer of anatomical design at the University of Bologna.
Life.
Anna Morandi was born in 1714 in Bologna, Italy. She was raised in a traditional home where marriage, children, and a domestic lifestyle were natural choices for women. In 1736, she was married to her childhood sweetheart, Giovanni Manzolini, a professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna. She was 20, and he was 24 years old. After five years of marriage, she was the mother of six children. In 1755, her husband died, and she was left with very slender means of support. She received tempting offers from other universities, but she preferred to remain in her native city, Bologna. She closed a laborious and honored life in the city in 1774, at the age of 60 years.
Career.
When her husband became ill with tuberculosis, she received special permission to lecture in his place. She became professor of anatomy upon his death in 1755. Knowledge of her talent in molding anatomical models spread throughout Europe and she was invited to the court of Catherine II of Russia as well as other royal courts. It became her major turning point in her life. In order to learn anatomy, She had to dissect cadavers, which was extremely difficult for her, but she overcame her fears. Giovanni Manzolini was so encouraged by her and her accomplishments that he again returned to his work. They were recognized as a team by many artists, intellectuals, and anatomists in Europe. After her husband's death, She was appointed Lecturer in Anatomy in her own name by the Institute of Bologna. 
Contribution.
Anna aided her husband, and then surpassed him in skill, and particularly in that scientific knowledge upon which the success of their joint labours so largely depended. She lectured in a lot of different places. In her lectures, she imparted with peculiar talent the knowledge derived from her husband, and also communicated many discoveries made by herself. She clearly demonstrated, both theoretically and practically, the wonderful structure of the human body.
She also crafted two portrait busts in wax, both of which are currently on display at the Palazzo Poggi in Bologna. One is a self-portrait, in which she depicts herself at work dissecting a human brain; the other is of her husband, engaged in similar activity. Her wax models were highly prized while she was alive and long after her death. Some of her anatomical models were so skillfully molded that they were extremely difficult to distinguish from the actual body parts from which they were copied. Furthermore, her acute skill at dissection resulted in her discovery of several previously unknown anatomical parts, including the termination of the oblique muscle of the eye. She held the distinction of having been the first person to reproduce (in wax) body parts of minute portions, including capillary vessels and nerves.
Her collection of waz models was known throughout Europe as "Supellex Manzoliniana" and was eagerly sought after to aid in the study of anatomy. Her work became the archetype of such models as the Vassourie collection and the creations of Dr. Auzoux made from papier mache, which were the forerunners of those used in today's schools and colleges. After her death, a bust of her was placed in the Pantheon in Rome. Another portrait in was, which she modeled herself, was placed in the museum at the University of Bologna and became one of its most precious possessions.
Honors.
- The title of Professor of Anatomy by the Insitiute of Bologna, 1756 
- The added title of Modelatrice by the Institute of Bologna, 1760 
- Honored by numerous heads of state
- Emperor Joseph II of Austria bought one of her models and showed his appreciation of her skill and attainments
- Catherine II of Russia invited her to Moscow to lecture and made her a member of the Russian Royal Scientific Association 
- The British Royal Scoiety elected her a member and invited her to lecture in London 
- Honored in Italy as the inventor and perfecter of anatomical preparations in wax

USS Pawcatuck (AO-108)

USS "Pawcatuck" (AO-108) was an that served in the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1973, then transferred to the Military Sealift Command to continue in non-commissioned service with a civilian crew as United States Naval Ship USNS "Pawcatuck" (T-AO-108). She was the only United States Navy ship to bear the name "Pawcatuck".
Construction and commissioning.
USS "Pawcatuck" (AO–108) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract on 22 March 1945 as Maritime Commission hull 2704 by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 19 February 1946, sponsored by Miss Nancy Gatch, and commissioned on 10 May 1946, Captain Cecil G. McKinney, USNR, in command.
Service career.
1946–65.
After shakedown, "Pawcatuck" was assigned the task of transporting petroleum products between various United States Navy facilities and ports on the United States Gulf Coast, in the Caribbean and along the United States East Coast. In the summer of 1947, she joined the United States Sixth Fleet, operating in the Mediterranean Sea for her first overseas tour. From 1948 to 1961, "Pawcatuck" operated on a rotational schedule between the United States Atlantic Fleet and the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, participating in U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises, United States Naval Reserve and United States Naval Academy midshipman cruises, and courtesy visits to foreign ports, and serving as flagship of Commander Service Squadron 2. She supported American forces during the Lebanon Crisis of 1958.
In November 1961 she sailed for her first North Atlantic deployment and operated with Antisubmarine Warfare Carrier Task Group 83.3 until February 1962. In November 1962 she deployed to the Caribbean for support to U.S. Navy units involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade effort. She spent early 1963 in Boston, Massachusetts, for overhaul, but by June 1963 she had returned to the Mediterranean and Sixth Fleet operations.
During 1964 "Pawcatuck" operated with the Atlantic Fleet performing logistic services and conducting training exercises. In January 1965 she sailed to the Caribbean, where she made port calls and provided support and training services. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, for most of March and April 1965. In late April 1965 she was ordered south to the vicinity of the Dominican Republic to support U.S. Navy units during the crisis there and the intervention there by the U.S. Marine Corps in Operation Powerpack. On 12 June 1965 she sailed for Northern European waters and, with other units, engaged in joint amphibious exercises with the armed forces of Norway.
"Jumboization", 1965–66.
Upon returning to the United States on 23 July 1965, she prepared to enter the yards for an extensive "jumboization" conversion, with preliminary work conducted at Boston, Massachusetts. She then steamed up the St. Lawrence River and put into the yards of the American Shipbuilding Company at Lorain, Ohio, on 14 September 1965. "Pawcatuck" spent the rest of 1965 and all of 1966 undergoing conversion, during which her overall length was increased to 644 feet (196.3 m), her draft to 35 feet 9 inches (10.9 m), and her displacement to 35,000 tons.
1967–75.
After outfitting at Boston, Massachusetts, "Pawcatuck" sailed on 23 February 1967 to Craney Island, Virginia. where she received her first "jumbo" load of of aviation fuel and of fuel oil for surface vessels. This operation took five days and she then sailed to her home port at Mayport, Florida, to resume operations as a fleet oiler.
On 29 January 1968, "Pawcatuck" deployed to the Mediterranean and serviced over 300 ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and NATO allies while participating in exercises "Fairgame IV", "Dawn Patrol", and "Flapex" and in many smaller fleet exercises. She returned to Mayport on 6 August 1968 and spent the latter part of the year servicing units of the recovery force for the Apollo 7 space mission.
During January and February 1969 "Pawcatuck" made preparations for another Mediterranean deployment. 
"Pawcatuck" remained in active, commissioned U.S. Navy service until 1975, but the details of her career between 1969 and 1975 await further research.
As of May 1972 Pawcatuck was still home ported in Mayport Fl. Toward the end of 1972 She went on a North Atlantic Cruise going to Holy Loch Scotland, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Kristiansund Norway, Hamburg Germany and Back to Scotland.
Later career and disposition.
"Pawcatuck" was decommissioned on 15 July 1975 and transferred to the Military Sealift Command, in which she served in a non-commissioned status with a civilian crew as USNS "Pawcatuck" (T-AO-108) until 1991.
"Pawcatuck" was stricken from the Naval Register on 21 September 1991 and was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration as part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet on the James River at Fort Eustis in Newport News, Virginia. She was sold for scrapping to Bay Bridge Enterprises on 21 September 2005. On 19 October 2005, she was removed from the National Defense Reserve Fleet and towed to Chesapeake, Virginia, for scrapping.

Chinese Radio and TV (Netherlands)

Chinese Radio and Television (CRTV) is an organization created to bring Chinese language programming to the Netherlands and is operated by a group of enthusiastic volunteers. CRTV started with a biweekly one hour radio program and has developed into one of the biggest cross-media platforms in Europe. CRTV offers a wide range of programs and activities: radio, television, a website, events, and editorship. CRTV offers programming in three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin and Dutch.
The audiences of CRTV programs include Chinese immigrants from mainland China and Hong Kong, the next generation of Dutch-born Chinese, students from China, and Dutch people interested in Chinese culture.
History.
CRTV was founded by a group of young Chinese graduates in May 1996. They started initially with a one hour radio program called Chinese Radio Amsterdam (CRA) broadcast every other week through cable. The idea was to present a radio program in Chinese to inform the Chinese community about social, cultural and political issues. There was also a program where mia farquhar was being a "douchedick".
Development.
Today, the audience can listen to one hour radio programs on cable, on air and on the Internet every Sunday till Friday. The subjects of the programs include news (local, national and China), education (health, legislations, finance), discussions, entertainment (show business, films, quizzes, sports), interviews, language courses, and reports, interluded by modern and classic Chinese music.
CRTV offers also television programs in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague every last Sunday. CRTV issues its own magazine and organizes talk shows about Chinese culture and society. Chinese Radio and Television cooperates with Dutch and Chinese organizations to make programs and to get or to give support. Recent examples are co-organization of the Amsterdam China Festival, promotion of Chinese films, and interviews with Chinese performers.
Chinese Radio and Television has become a communication platform between the different generations of Chinese people and between the Chinese community and Dutch society.
Broadcasts.
Television.
CRTV started its own TV program in October 2007, with broadcasts in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague every Sunday. The program mainly reports events and interviews of Chinese related activities in The Netherlands and Belgium.

<doc id="19030768" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19030768" title="Rozumice">
Rozumice

Rozumice (German "Rösnitz") is a village in the community of Gmina Kietrz, within Głubczyce County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, close to the Czech border. It lies approximately south of Kietrz, south-east of Głubczyce, and south of the regional capital Opole. The village has a population of 332.
Early history.
Though as yet undocumented there is evidence from stone-age and bronze-age tools found locally of a settlement here from at least since the stone-age. The latest archaeological finds confirm that there has been a settlement in Rozumice since the latest palaeolithic phase. Oral history has it that a Slavic settlement of just two houses previously existed. Then King Ottokar II of Bohemia encouraged skilled German immigrants to settle in this region, overseen by the Prämostratenser of the Order of Canons Regular of Prémontré. It is probable that Rösnitz was settled around 1250, along with a neighbouring village of Pilszcz (Piltsch) that shares close physical characteristics. The first documented evidence of Rösnitz dates from 1335 (then called Resenitz), when a five-year rent free lease of farmland was granted. Comparisons of culture and dialect suggests that these first early settlers were from Franconia. Around 1432 Rösnitz came under Czech control, for a brief period, when the German language was replaced with Czech as the official language (though the villagers never gave up their German language) and the village renamed Rosumicz. John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg in a document signs over the village to Johan von Woustow, evidence that the village is then under the sovereign’s control and domain. The original German settler surnames of Kremser, Proske, Krömer, Alscher, Grittner, Lamche, Weicht, Kolbe, Heidrich, Schindler, Klose survive from before this time, despite being at times under Austrian, Czech, Polish or Prussian rule, and continued to dominate life in the village up until 1946.
Village history.
The significant step in the village history was in 1526 when, according to oral history, the village became Protestant, encouraged by connections with the austere founding monastery. In 1523 the principality of Jägerndorf, under the House of Hohenzollern, which includes the village, was bought by George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, also a zealous Lutheran. From 1557 onwards the community bought the title deeds for their houses, the land they farmed and finally freed themselves from serfdom and most tithes. A new replacement church was built. the ascension of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1617 and the resurgence of the Roman Catholic faith in the region, the village soon became embroiled in a long period of war, which was to rage with bitter disputes and retributions for 30 years. Being near an important old trade route and several state boundaries there were frequent wars in the area and as the many battle fortunes in the area waxed and waned, the villagers were forced to pay taxes to fund the war, billet the occupying or passing army and provide men to fight to which ever side was then in ascendancy at the time. This state of affairs went on right up to WWI. The Protestant church was locked in 1628. In the Leobschütz area during the succeeding period, only two villages, Rösnitz and Steuberwitz, were not converted back to Catholicism, at some considerable personal cost. The villagers were subjected to extreme pressures over a long period to convert back, but managed to withstand and remain Protestant. In 1671 the Catholic Church appointed a Jesuit missionary. The community still held out, holding their secret services in the woodland. with the church remaining locked to them. At the end of the Silesian Wars the village came under the rule of Prussia. In a document signed and sealed by Frederick II of Prussia the villagers’ freedoms were confirmed in 1743 and permission granted for a chapel. The chapel was built in 1747. Before the chapel was built, a lot of tension developed in the village from rival claims of the Bohemian Brethren (Moravian Church), who had many followers in the area. Their leader, Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf visited the village, a pious centre for the Brethren, in 1726 to bolster support. The Bohemian Brethren began building their own chapel alongside the church until a Royal Decree denied them a colony in the village. By 1751, they and some of their converts had left. In 1800 the village won a judgement confirming sole ownership of the church and its assets and their application to hold Protestant services was approved finally in 1801. In 1803 the old church was demolished and the new church opened in 1807 and the three old bells re-hung. 
The earliest documented record of a school in the village dates from 1575 with records of succeeding schoolmasters. From around 1700 to 1742 the Protestant school was closed. There are no known records of this period about the Catholic schoolmasters as none of the village children attended. In 1742 Protestant school tuition was once again permitted, the old school was pulled down and classes held in one of the houses until 1804, when it was transferred to the vacated house of the preacher, and various extensions were made in 1860. A second school building was erected in 1880, and a third teacher appointed.
The village began to prosper and become known as the richest village in the county. A great many improvements undertaken, post office 1891, telegraph 1892, slate replacing thatched roofs around the same time, roads cobbled 1896-99, piped water 1899, electricity 1923, fire hydrants and volunteer fire service 1932, motorised mills replacing the old water and two windmills, and even a swimming pool and cinema.
With border re-alignments following WWI the villagers were given a vote in 1921 whether to remain German or join Poland and the district decisively choose to remain with Germany. In 1939 there were 1060 inhabitants, and there were three shops, three bakeries, two butchers and a pub.
Architectural form.
The village was laid out in an elongated ring with a stream along its centre axis
The main farmhouse gable faced onto the main road and the run of main buildings formed one side of an enclosed courtyard that was accessed through a main gate onto the street (see sketch layout). The family rooms faced the street, then horse, then cow stabling. The animals were stalled all year, too dry in summer to graze and snow bound over winter. At the far end of the courtyard were the hay barns and the bake-house. Originally used for retting the flax but when the flax industry declined and there was a change over to barley production (much prized by the brewing industry) they became the family bakehouse. Bread and cake baking for special occasions still used the village bakery. These family bakehouses were impractical and uneconomic for a family, and by World War II only some 20 were left. On the opposite side to the main farmhouse was the dowager’s house with pig sty and poultry beyond. Contrary to local traditions elsewhere the Laimes (grain stores) were positioned outside of the courtyard on the opposite side of the main street, or sometimes in the orchard.
Unusually houses were known by their 17th-century (if not older) names and not, because of recurrences of the same surnames, by the current owner. Farms were passed down to the younger son, who then had to make proportionate payment or dowry to other siblings. Around 1877–82 the patchwork pattern of fields was re-divided and each farmer had his land close together. The smaller farmers were known as ‘cow-farmers’ and the small holdings as ‘gardeners’. 
Church bells.
About 1450 the 4-ton bell was cast; this became known later as the 'middle bell'. The casting date for the -ton 'small bell' is unknown, but it was thought to be very old. The earlier church was expanded in 1580 and the 'middle bell' was re-hung in it. In 1634 the 9-ton bell was cast and hung in the bell tower. At the time (and until 1800) the villagers were locked out of their church and could only gather around the bell tower. In 1807 the three bells were hung in the new church. During World War I, when metal had to be surrendered to help the war effort, the bells were spared due to their historic value, and in World War II the largest bell was left, as it was too heavy to move. The other bells were taken (to the Hamburg bell cemetery). The large bell fell and cracked during the bombing. It was later recovered, repaired and held by the village Steuberwitz, but it does not ring true. The middle bell was later discovered on loan to Murrhardt (Württemberg) and in 1978 was hung in Nikolaikirche, Vorhelm.
Century of refugees.
With the 1st Ukrainian Front advances on Upper Silesia under Marshal Ivan Konev getting ever closer, on 24 March 1945 at 10:00 pm the villagers left their village with their possessions piled on horse-drawn wagons. Over some six weeks they moved west until turned around and made to return. After they left, fierce fighting went on in and around Rösnitz for a while, the church was bombed and many of the houses were destroyed, possession of the village changed four times, leaving behind 50 disabled tanks when a general surrender was declared on 8 May. On their return the villagers were made to clear up the aftermath of the fighting. Two months later Poles from Eastern Galicia were re-settled in the village, and the villagers had to vacate their homes to make way for them, work and harvest the fields under their directions. Between 5 and 14 July 1946, under the Allied Forces directive, the original German villagers were deported to the west with no more than 50 kg of food and possessions apiece. Thus came the final end of a 420-year battle to remain true to the Protestant faith, to be supplanted by the new Roman Catholic occupants.
Present day.
Polish and Ukrainian expellees from the Kresy regions of interwar Poland which had been annexed by the Soviet Union were settled here and the village renamed to Rozumice. The present Polish villagers keep in close contact with the former German speaking residents, who have been visiting the village regularly since the late 1980s and the fall of communism in Poland. Although initially the former German residents were wary of visiting the village they were won over by the hospitality of the Poles.
The German community publishes a newsletter in Germany on the life of the village in its past and present. A cooperative effort by both the former and present inhabitants of the place has resulted in a joint proposal for a Polish-German Museum on the history of the village. The president of Poland Lech Kaczyński sent a letter supporting the proposal and congratulating them on their important role in furthering friendly Polish-German relationships.

Don Patterson (July 22, 1936, Columbus, Ohio - February 10, 1988, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was an American jazz organist.
Patterson played piano from childhood and was heavily influenced by Erroll Garner in his youth. In 1956, he switched to organ after hearing Jimmy Smith play the instrument. In the early 1960s, he began playing regularly with Sonny Stitt, and he began releasing material as a leader on Prestige Records from 1964 (with Pat Martino and Billy James as sidemen). His most commercially successful album was 1964's "Holiday Soul", which reached #85 on the Billboard 200 in 1967. Patterson's troubles with drug addiction hobbled his career in the 1970s, during which he occasionally recorded for Muse Records and lived in Gary, Indiana. In the 1980s he moved to Philadelphia and made a small comeback, but his health deteriorated over the course of the decade, and he died there in 1988.

Isaiah Oggins

Isaiah Oggins (also known as Ysai or Cy) (July 22, 1898 - 1947) was an American-born communist and spy for the Soviet secret police. After working in Europe and the Far East, Oggins was arrested, served eight years in the GULAG detention system, and was summarily executed on the orders of Joseph Stalin.
Early life.
The third of four children, Oggins was born 1898 in Willimantic, Connecticut, the son of Simon M. Oggins and his wife Rena, both Jewish immigrants from the David "Reuben" Abolnik shtetl near Kovno (Kaunas), Lithuania. Oggins's parents arrived in New York in 1888. 
He entered Columbia University in February 1917 under current Jewish quota policies. Classmates included publishers Bennet Cerf, Donald Klopfer, and Richard Simon; historian Matthew Josephson; novelist Louis Bromfield, critic Kenneth Burke, and author William Slater Brown. Professors included John Erskine, George Odell, Robert Livingston Schuyler, and Charles A. Beard. After receiving his B.A. in History, he began a doctorate in History while working at history reader there, then night school in the New York Public School system. 
In 1923, Oggins became a Communist by joining the Workers Party of America. The same year, he changed jobs to work for Yale University Press as a researcher. On April 23, 1924, he married Nerma Berman (1898-1995), a Rand School student and Communist activist originally born the Skapiskis shtetl (also near Kovno). She became secretary of the New York division of the National Defense Committee of the Rand School for Red Scare victims Scott Nearing and other professors.
Soviet underground espionage.
As of August 26, 1926, when he applied for his U.S. passport, Oggins had joined the Soviet underground and was readying for his first overseas assignment in probably Germany and France. In April 1928, Nerma applied for her first U.S. passport. The couple departed from New York on May 5, 1928, for a villa in the Zehlendorf district of Berlin, Germany. Their job was to maintain a low profile and inhabit their residence, so that other Soviet agents could periodically use it as a safe house for various espionage related activities. To accomplish this mission, Cy and Nerma had to avoid any appearance of being interested in Communist politics; they had to avoid even reading Communist newspapers. Friend Sidney Hook spotted Oggins in the Gendarmenmarkt, as described in his autobiography "Out of Step" (1984). Oggins had to resist the temptation to have meetings with his old friend, although he did not always resist this temptation fully. 
The Ogginses moved from Berlin to Paris in the Spring of 1930. In Neuilly-sur-Seine, they watched White Russians, Trotskyites including Trotsky's Paris-based son, Lev Sedov, and the family of Michael Feodorovich Romanov. After exposure "l'affaire Switz" (1933-1934, involving Robert Gordon Switz, Lydia Stahl, and Arvid Jacobson), the Ogginses left Paris (September 1934) and returned to the States with their young son Robin (b. 1931). After a brief stint in New York, they left for San Francisco. Leaving his wife and child behind, Cy Oggins set off for China in September 1935—never to return to the United States. 
In Shanghai, Oggins reported to Grace and Manny Granich (brother of Mike Gold). In 1936, he worked in Dairen during the Manchukuo and traveled to Harbin. He reported to Charles Emile Martin (AKA George Wilmer, Lorenz, Laurenz, Dubois—born Matus Steinberg of Belgorod-Dnestrovsky) and wife Elsa Marie Martin (AKA Joanna Wilmer, Lora, Laura). (Martin later served in the Red Orchestra, spying on Nazi Germany.) By October 1937, the Martins and Oggins fled separately after Chiang Kai-Shek attacked Manchuria in July. 
Oggins met his wife and son in Paris in February 1938, only to leave again in May. Nerma Berman Oggins left Paris with their son in September 1939 and returned to New York.
Detention, arrest, imprisonment, and death.
On February 20, 1939, the Soviet NKVD arrested Oggins at the Hotel Moskva and took him to the Lubyanka. His case received a hearing on January 5, 1940. Ten days later, he received a sentence of eight years. 
On the next day, Oggins shipped out to Norillag where fellow inmates included Jacques Rossi. He became known there as "The Professor." Nerma Berman Oggins requested the U.S. Department of State to investigate her husband's disappearance. On December 8, 1942, Oggins received visits from American diplomats at the Butyrka prison in Moscow. By May, 1943, the Soviets reneged his release. 
In the summer of 1947, Oggins was taken to Laboratory Number One (the "Kamera"), where Grigory Mairanovsky injected him with the poison curare, which takes 10–15 minutes to kill.
FBI investigation.
An FBI investigation into the Oggins affair commenced in March 1943. After the defection of Igor Gouzenko, the name "Oggins" arose again in 1945-1946.
On February 10, 1949, FBI investigators questioned Esther Shemitz Chambers, wife of Whittaker Chambers, about the Ogginses. Mrs. Chambers and Mrs. Oggins had both attended the Rand School and had worked at the ILGWU and "The World Tomorrow" magazine.
Joint Russian-American investigation.
In early 1992, the U.S. and Russia formed the U.S - Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs. Overseeing the investigation was Dmitri Volkogonov. On September 23, 1992, Boris Yeltsin handed an Oggins case dossier to American diplomat Malcolm Toon: Oggins had been liquidated on Stalin's orders.
Wife's later life and death.
Nerma Berman Oggins drifted from job to job and lived in the New York City area. She retired in 1965 and lived for a time in the Lower East Side at the Henry Street Settlement. She later moved to Vestal, New York to be near her son. She died in Vestal on January 27, 1995.

Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (Köthen, 1 August 1492 – Zerbst, 23 March 1566), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. He was one of the earliest Protestant rulers in the Holy Roman Empire.
He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of Waldemar VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, by his wife Margarete, daughter of Günther XX, Count of Schwarzburg and Lord of Arnstedt.
Life.
In 1500, at just eight years of age, Wolfgang was admitted to the University of Leipzig, and in 1508, at sixteen, he took over the government of his principality with residence in Köthen. Wolfgang had the opportunity to meet Martin Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1521. He later said that "He gained my heart" after hearing him speak. With Luther's help, Wolfgang introduced the Reformation in Anhalt-Köthen (1525) and Anhalt-Bernburg (1526), which made them the second and third countries in the world (after the Electorate of Saxony) to adopt Protestantism officially. In 1526 Wolfgang joined in a defensive alliance with other Evangelical states against the Emperor Charles V; this was a direct prelude to the later formantion of the Schmalkaldic League. Wolfgang was also one of the six princes who, on 19 April 1529, as representatives of the Protestant minority in the Imperial Diet, drew up the Protestation at Speyer and petitioned the Diet to remove the Imperial Ban (German: "Reichsacht") against Luther, as well as the proscription of his works and teachings, and called for the unhindered spread of Evangelical belief. In 1530 he signed the Augsburg Confession at the Diet of Augsburg. In 1534 Wolfgang ordered the first church inspections (German: "Kirchenvisitationen") in Anhalt-Köthen, expropriated Catholic church possessions, and handed them over to the municipalities.
In 1544 he resigned his rights over Anhalt-Dessau in favor of his cousins, but retained his rights over Anhalt-Bernburg, where he had enlarged the existing castle in 1538 by the Wolfgang wing which made it the largest Renaissance castle in North Germany. When the old "Burg" of Köthen was destroyed by a fire in 1547, he made his permanent residence in Bernburg. That year, he participated in the Battle of Mühlberg and was outlawed for it by the Emperor. Wolfgang took refuge in Saxony and was appointed Governor of Magdeburg in 1551 by the Elector Maurice. In 1552 he was released from outlawry under the terms of the Peace of Passau and was restored to his territories.
In 1562, however, he signed all of his territories over to his cousins, keeping only Coswig. By 1564 he moved to Zerbst, where he died two years later, unmarried and childless.

Saint Barbara Church in Coptic Cairo

The Coptic Orthodox Church of St. Barbara (or "Sitt" Barbara) is one of the many famous Coptic Orthodox parishes that can be found in the district of Coptic Cairo. The building is located on the eastern part of the Babylon Fortress and is one of the oldest buildings in Cairo, dating back to the 5th or 6th century AD. However, like many other buildings of Coptic architecture, it was rebuilt several times, most notably by the end of the 11th Century. 
History.
St. Barbara's Church stands north of the Coptic Museum and is east of the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Abu Serga), on the eastern side of Fort Babylon. It was originally dedicated to Abu Kir and Yohanna (or Ss. Cyrus and John). When the remains of St. Barbara were brought here, a separate sanctuary was built. Thus, there are now two separate churches that were built on this location. Athanasius, a wealthy scribe and a secretary of Abdel-Aziz Ibn Marwan (governor of Egypt between 685 and 705 AD), had built the Church. A door found during one of the church's many restorations could date as early as the 4th Century. Between 1072 and 1073, the Church was fully restored to house the relics of Saint Barbara. These relics remain to this day. The Church was damaged again by another fire during the 12th century. In fact, the church was renovated as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, when the khurus, a transverse room preceding the sanctuary, was sacrificed in order to allow more space. 
Architecture.
The Church of St. Barbara is known for its many precious items. These items were sent to the nearby Coptic Museum, which is only a two-minute walk from the church. The basilican structure and tripartite sanctuary of the church closely resembles the one of Abu Serga.
Nearby there is a convent which comprises several buildings, including a school built by the well known architect, Ramses Wissa Wassef.
While Saint Barbara's Church has been a long-lasting example of ancient Coptic architecture, it resembles the shape of ancient Basilicas. It comprises an entrance, a narthex, a long nave, several aisles and three sanctuaries.
Like most other Coptic Orthodox churches that have more than one Sanctuary, the middle sanctuary is the one of main importance, dedicated to St. Barbara. After entering, from the narthex's lobby, there are five marble columns that separate the nave from the two aisles. In front of the middle sanctuary there is a semi-circular choir, which consists of 7 large steps. 
There are several other icons on the southern aisle of the church, representing the Virgin Mary and Jesus when he was a child, Jesus entering Jerusalem and the baptism of Christ.

Leonard Slatter

Air Marshal Sir Leonard Horatio Slatter KBE, CB, DSC & Bar, DFC, RAF (8 December 1894 – 14 April 1961) was a naval aviator during World War I and a senior Royal Air Force commander during World War II. Slatter ended his career as the commander-in-chief of Coastal Command.
Early life and World War I.
Slatter was born in Durban, South Africa on 8 December 1894. He received his education at Dale College and Selborne College in South Africa and then at Battersea Polytechnic, training to be a civil engineer.
With the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Navy. He initially served as a dispatch rider in the Naval Armoured Car Division before transferring to the Royal Naval Air Service in 1915. After successfully completing his observer training, Slatter was posted in February 1916 to the Seaplane Squadron at Dunkirk.
In July 1916 Slatter started his training to be a naval pilot and later in that year he commenced flying duties at Royal Naval Air Station Dover. February 1917 saw Slatter posted to the Seaplane Defence Flight (later to become No. 13 (Naval) Squadron and then No. 213 Squadron RAF) as a pilot operating out of Dunkirk. During this time Slatter shot down six enemy aircraft and was advanced from pilot to flight commander.
In July 1918, Slatter was removed from front-line duties and sent to No. 4 Aeroplane Supply Depot as an instructor. Even though he was officially excluded from operations, Slatter succeeded in flying over the front and shot down his seventh and final enemy aircraft on 30 August 1918.
Between the wars.
After the war, Slatter opted to remain in the newly formed Royal Air Force. He saw further active service as a flight commander on No. 47 Squadron RAF flying DH9s and DH9As in southern Russia in the first half of 1919. Slatter received a permanent RAF commission in 1919 and was made a flight lieutenant.
After his return to Great Britain, Slatter took up duties as a flight commander on No. 205 Squadron at RAF Leuchars. In 1921, Slatter was posted to No. 203 Squadron, still based at Leuchars, flying "Nightjars". He later became the squadron's commander whilst the squadron was deployed in Turkey. 1922 saw Slatter transferred again, this time to No. 230 Squadron where he served as both a flight commander and as the officer commanding. In early 1924 Slatter was substantively promoted to squadron leader and posted to Malta where he served as the commander of the RAF base for over two years. On his return in 1926, Slatter spent a few months as a supernumerary at the RAF Depot.
In late 1926, Slatter was appointed Officer Commanding the RAF High Speed Flight at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment. Slatter was responsible for preparing his team to compete in the 1927 Schneider Trophy competition in Venice. He went on to be Officer Commanding No. 19 Squadron at RAF Duxford and then Officer Commanding No. 111 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch, where he was also Station Commander, before being appointed Officer Commanding No. 43 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in 1930. He was Officer responsible for flying on the aircraft carrier HMS "Courageous" from 1932 before returning as Station Commander at RAF Tangmere and then becoming Station Commander at RAF Feltwell and then RAF Bassingbourn.
World War II.
At the start of the War he was Senior Air Staff Officer at No. 1 Group although he moved on to be Air Officer Administration at Headquarters British Forces in Iraq in 1940. He went on to be Air Officer Commanding successively at No. 203 Group then No. 201 Group and then No. 9 Group. He was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 15 Group in February 1943, where is role was to ensure that vital materials were brought safely from the US to the UK, before becoming Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief at RAF Coastal Command in June 1945. He retired in 1949.

Valency interaction formula

The Valency Interaction Formula, or VIF provides a way of drawing or interpreting the molecular structural formula based on molecular orbital theory. Valency Points, VP, dots drawn on a page, represent valence orbitals. Valency Interactions, VI, that connect the dots, show interactions between these valence orbitals. Theory was developed by Turkish quantum chemist Oktay Sinanoğlu in early 1980s and first published in 1983. The theory was like a new language of quantum mechanics by the exact definition of Hilbert space. It was also the solution of the problem that Paul Dirac was dealing with to solve till the time he died in 1980s. (the problem was the hidden symmetries in Hilbert space which was responsible for the accidental degeneracies not causing from a spatial symmetry, that was about the higher symmetries of Hilbert space) Sinanoğlu showed that the solution was possible only when the topology tool was used. This VIF theory also connected both delocalized and localized molecular orbital schemes into a unified form in an elegant way.
Chemical deductions are made from a VIF picture with the application of two pictorial rules. These are linear transformations applied to the VIF structural formula as a quantum operator. Transformation by the two rules preserves invariants crucial to the characterization of the molecules electronic properties, the numbers of bonding, non-bonding, and anti-bonding orbitals and/or the numbers of doubly, singly, and unoccupied valence orbitals. The two pictorial rules relate all picture with the same electronic properties as characterized by these invariants.
A thorough presentation of VIF is available through the open access journal "symmetry".

Genetic heterogeneity

Genetic heterogeneity is a phenomenon in which a single phenotype or genetic disorder may be caused by any one of a multiple number of alleles or non-allele (locus) mutations. This is in contrast to pleiotropy, where a single gene may cause multiple phenotypic expressions or disorders. Genetic heterogeneity can be classified as either "allelic" or "locus". 
"Allelic heterogeneity" means that different mutations within a single gene locus (forming multiple alleles of that gene) cause the same phenotypic expression. For example, there are over 1000 known mutant alleles of the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis.
"Locus heterogeneity" means that variations in completely unrelated gene loci cause a single disorder. For example, retinitis pigmentosa has autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked origins. However, only one mutant locus is needed for the phenotype to manifest.

Confederate colonies

Confederate colonies were made up of emigrants from the Confederate States of America who fled the United States after the Union won the American Civil War (1861–1865). They settled in many Latin American countries like Brazil and Mexico. 
Background.
Many Southerners had lost their land during the war and were unwilling to live under the government of the United States of America. They did not expect an improvement in the South's economic position. Most of the emigrants were from the states of Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and South Carolina. 
No one has determined how many American southerners emigrated to Latin America. As noted in unpublished research, Betty Antunes de Oliveira found in port records of Rio de Janeiro that some 20,000 Americans entered Brazil from 1865 to 1885. Other researchers have estimated the number at 10,000. An unknown number returned to the United States after the end of Reconstruction. Most immigrants adopted Brazilian citizenship.

Port Kennedy was an industrial village located where U.S. Route 422 (Pottstown Expressway) now crosses the Schuylkill River in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. 
Built along the Schuylkill Canal and, after 1849, the Reading Railroad, the village was a center for the lime industry in the 19th century. It was named for Alexander Kennedy, the owner of the quarries and kilns. 
Beginning in 1871, a number of important fossils were unearthed at Port Kennedy. The location of the find was forgotten until 2006, when the Port Kennedy Bone Cave was rediscovered.
Planning for U.S. Route 422 between the Schuylkill Expressway (Interstate 76) and Trooper Road began in 1964. Most of the village was demolished for construction of the superhighway and Betzwood Bridge, which opened to traffic in 1967. 
In 1978, the National Park Service seized the land west of the superhighway through eminent domain to expand Valley Forge National Historical Park. 
Today, U.S. Route 422 separates the First Presbyterian Church of Port Kennedy (1845) from the Kennedy Mansion (1852). They, along with the Reading Railroad station, the hotel beside it, and one house, are the only surviving buildings from the village.

Duke of Marmalade

Duke of Marmalade (foaled 12 March 2004) is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. He is best known for winning five consecutive Group One races in 2008, for which he was named European Champion Older Horse. He currently stands as a stallion for Coolmore Stud, being moved between stud farms in Ireland and Australia (a practice known as shuttling).
Duke of Marmalade won his first two races as a two-year-old in June 2006. He did not win again until the spring of his four-year-old season, almost twenty-two months later. During this winless period he was sometimes regarded as little more than a pacemaker for more celebrated stable companions such as Dylan Thomas. In his final year of racing he recorded wins in the Prix Ganay, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes. He was retired in October 2008 after running in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
Background.
Duke of Marmalade, a bay horse who stands 16 hands high and weighed 540 kg during his racing career, is from the last crop of foals sired by Danehill and is out of the American-bred mare Love Me True. He was bred in Ireland by Southern Bloodstock, a division of his owners' Coolmore Stud organisation. Duke of Marmalade was trained throughout his career by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle.
Duke of Marmalade's sire Danehill (who died in 2003) was one of the most successful stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a grand-daughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid.
The name "Duke of Marmalade" is derived from a title created by Henri Christophe for a member of the new Haitian nobility following the Haitian Revolution. The name had previously been used for an Italian thoroughbred racehorse which won the Premio Roma in 1975 and 1976.
Racing career.
2006: two-year-old season.
Duke of Marmalade began his career with three races in the summer of 2006. In June he made his debut in a six furlong maiden race at Leopardstown. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan and starting at odds of 11/4 (2.75-1) favourite, he was towards the back of the field in the early stages before making progress in the last two furlongs to finish second to Chanting. Nine days later he reappeared in a maiden race over seven furlongs at The Curragh for which he was made 4/6 favourite (approximately 0.67-1). He "stayed on well" to record his first win, beating Supposition by a neck (approximately a quarter of a length), under Kieren Fallon.
Duke of Marmalade was then moved directly into Group Two class; he was sent to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of Marmalade had been supported in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.
2007: three-year-old season.
In 2007 Duke of Marmalade did not record a victory in six starts. However, he was never further back than fourth and ran exclusively in Group One races. He was often part of a multiple entry by the Ballydoyle team. Instead of running in a trial race, Duke of Marmalade was sent straight to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas. The field of twenty-four runners split into two groups, one on either side of the wide Newmarket course. Duke of Marmalade tracked the leaders of the stands side group before staying on to finish fourth to Cockney Rebel. Having returned from an absence of more than nine months, the colt was expected to improve for the run, but later in the same month he finished fourth again to Cockney Rebel in the Irish 2000 Guineas.
At Royal Ascot, Duke of Marmalade showed improved form in the St. James's Palace Stakes. Michael Kinane tried to lead all the way on the colt-and was still in front inside the final furlong-before being caught and beaten a neck by Jamie Spencer on his stable companion Excellent Art, with another O'Brien-trained runner, Astronomer Royal in third, and Cockney Rebel in fifth. Two months later, Duke of Marmalade was moved up in distance and took on older horses for the first time in the International Stakes at York. He ran up to his best form in a highly competitive race to finish fourth behind the Derby winner Authorized, Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato.
Duke of Marmalade raced against his stable companion Dylan Thomas again in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien was pleased with the run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving. On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.
During the winter it was discovered that a metal pin used to repair his previous injury had been causing the horse discomfort and was restricting his movement. The pin was removed, allowing Duke of Marmalade to run free of pain as a four-year-old.
2008: four-year-old season.
Spring.
As a four-year-old Duke of Marmalade had a notable run of success, winning his first five races. In all these races he was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and was usually accompanied by his pacemaker Red Rock Canyon. In April he was sent to Longchamp for the Group One Prix Ganay. He raced behind Spirit One before making his challenge in the straight and running on strongly under pressure to beat Saddex by half a length. It was his first major win, and his first win of any kind for more than twenty-one months. After the race, O'Brien called Duke of Marmalade "a horse to look forward to". At the Curragh a month later, he justified odds of 1/3 (0.33-1) in the Tattersalls Gold Cup, being driven out by Murtagh to beat the filly Finsceal Beo by one and a quarter lengths.
Summer.
In the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot he produced what his trainer considered his best performance to date, taking over from Red Rock Canyon in the straight where he "stormed clear" to win by four lengths from Phoenix Tower. "The Guardian" called it a "brilliant victory" while Murtagh described the colt as among the best he had ridden.
He then stepped up to twelve furlongs for Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, for which he was made 4/6 (0.67-1) favourite. With no three-year-old in the field, the race did not appear to be up to its usual standard, and his main opponent was expected to be Youmzain who had finished second in the Ascot race and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2007 and had more recently won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Duke of Marmalade was settled by Murtagh in the middle of the field before being switched to the outside in the straight and overtaking Red Rock Canyon entering the final furlong. He was immediately challenged and headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Papal Bull but "rallied gamely" to regain the lead close to the finish and win by a half a length. Murtagh was keen to praise the horse's speed and attitude, saying "mine has all that makes a real champion. He looked the other horse in the eye and ate ground. He has that will to win."
Duke of Marmalade was then brought back in distance from twelve furlongs to ten and a half furlongs for the International Stakes. The race also attracted the Epsom Derby winner New Approach, and the meeting of the two champions was much anticipated by the press as a "clash of the titans". Bad ground conditions forced the race to be abandoned, and it was rescheduled for Newmarket four days later. Duke of Marmalade took the lead three furlongs out and was driven out by Murtagh to beat Phoenix Tower by three-quarters of a length, with New Approach, who had pulled hard and failed to settle in the early stages, two and a half lengths further back in third. The colt's toughness and strong constitution were singled out for praise, with the press referring to him as the "Iron Duke".
O'Brien and his jockeys were later found guilty of using unfair tactics in the race and were punished by the British Horseracing Authority. While pacemakers are allowed, it is considered unfair to provide additional assistance, for instance manoeuvring a horse to ensure a clear run for a stable companion. O'Brien defended himself "fervently", calling the charges "fantasy...a load of nonsense."
Autumn.
It was expected that Duke of Marmalade would meet New Approach again in the Irish Champion Stakes in September, but following heavy rain in the build-up to the race O'Brien withdrew the colt, saying "we don't want to subject him to soft ground now, with the rest of the year in mind."
Duke of Marmalade did not appear again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, for which he was made 4/1 second favourite despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground. He was settled on the outside, but when Murtagh attempted to have him move forward in the straight, he made no progress and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind Zarkava.
On his final start, he was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita. Racing on a synthetic track for the first time, he ran in third place for much of the distance and briefly headed the field turning into the straight, but faded in the closing stages to finish ninth of the twelve runners behind Raven's Pass. Murtagh and O'Brien characterised the performance as typifiying "the end of a long, hard season" and Duke of Marmalade's retirement was announced immediately.
Assessment, honours and awards.
In November 2008, Duke of Marmalade was named European Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards.
In the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings for 2007, Duke of Marmalade was assessed on a mark of 120, placing him just outside the world's top thirty horses. In the 2008 Rankings, he was rated the fifth best horse in the world with a mark of 127 Duke of Marmalade was given an end of year rating of 132 by Timeform in 2008. A rating of 130 or above is regarded as the mark of a real "top-notcher."
Stud career.
He was retired from racing at the end of 2008 and as of 2011 stands as a stallion for Coolmore Stud. He shuttles between their main base in County Tipperary, Ireland during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and Coolmore's Australian stud farm in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, during the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. His first foals were born in 2010.
