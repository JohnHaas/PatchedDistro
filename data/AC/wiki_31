Koroška Bela

Koroška Bela (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Jesenice in northwestern Slovenia. The village has long been a center of iron mining and processing; until recently a majority of its inhabitants were employed in the steel industry.
Geography.
Koroška Bela is the first part of the Municipality of Jesenice that one encounters when approaching from the southeast, from the Ljubljana direction. The village is located in a valley between four hills: Malnež and Obesenk (to the east), and Alnica and Strana (northwest). The valley is closed off to the north by Mount Belščica, part of the Karawanks; to the south it opens into Bela Field (), which borders the Sava River.
On the east side of the village runs Bela Creek, the source of which is below the peak of Belščica, between Potoki Pasture () and Olip Pasture (). In the lower western part of the village, the border with the neighboring settlement of Javornik runs parallel to bridges over Javornik Creek, although there is a friendly, long-running quarrel with Javornik over the exact boundary line.
Name.
The name "Koroška Bela" literally means 'Carinthian white'; the second part is derived from White Creek () and was originally a hydronym transferred to the settlement along the creek. The first part of the name indicates that the settlement was colonized by arrivals from Carinthia in the Middle Ages. Carinthian dialect features can still be found in the local dialect. See also Koroška Vas and Koroška Vas na Pohorju for similar names outside Carinthia.
History.
The oldest settlement in the area of the modern Municipality of Jesenice, Koroška Bela was founded by the Bishopric of Brixen around the year 1000, at approximately the same time as nearby Bled. Slovenes had settled the surrounding area by the late 10th century, as attested both by archaeological and documentary evidence, notably the land deeds of peasants donating their lands to clergy or nobility, which record Slavic placenames by this date. During the 11th century, settlements in the Bled region included Grad, Zagorice, Želeče, Mlino, Koritno, Bodešče, Selo, Kupljenik, Rečica, Radovna, Podhom, Poljšica, Blejska Dobrava, Sebenje, and others.
Some local peasants remained free until after 1100, but gradually all farms in the area came under feudal control. The principal landlord was the see of Brixen, which in the 13th century began converting some of their serfs into semi-freemen, living on so-called "census" farms. During the 13th century, Koroška Bela was among the larger settlements of the Bled lordship; a 1253 "urbar" (survey-book) lists 15 such farms.
In the second half of the 14th century, the peasants' level of feudal obligation began to grow, with the introductions of the tithe and of mandatory servitude. High levels of debt began to lead to evictions. In 1515, the peasants of Radovljica, Bled, and Bohinj staged an unsuccessful revolt. The leaders of the insurgency were killed, and all participating households were taxed the "rebels' pfennig" in perpetuity, the financial pressure leading to additional revolts; around 100 minor and four major ones are recorded, as well as civil petitions to the Habsburg authorities for relief. In 1557, records show that three farmers (Luka Ambrožič, Ambrož Vidič, and Jurij Pretnar) and the village assembly filed a complaint due to harsh duties imposed on them.
The historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor briefly mentions Koroška Bela in his 1689 "The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola" (under its German name of "Karner Velach") as a hamlet below snowy mountains, inhabited by miners and iron ore-teamsters. By this period, local peasants owed the gentry 18 days of servitude a year, including the performance of such tasks as preparing firewood, shoveling snow, cleaning produce, and clearing pastures. One could buy out one's service obligations at a rate of three crowns a day. Circumstances began to improve during the late 18th century, with the reforms of Maria Theresia and Joseph II, by the reign of the former of which iron ore was being mined above the village, on the slopes of Belščica and on Ajdna.
On 27 June 1761, the entire village of 60 houses burned down, including the church. In 1789, torrential rains led to a major landslide; Cikla Hill slid into the village along the course of Bela Creek, burying 47 houses and many unfortunate residents.
During the late 18th century Franco-Austrian wars, Habsburg authorities had difficulties drafting soldiers in the area. Many young unmarried men had instead gone into hiding in the woods; the Austrian governor Indermauer awarded the local peasant Janez Čop a letter of manumission for successfully apprehending draft dodgers.
While the front lines with Italy during the First World War ran well to the south, Koroška Bela did not escape the war, being badly damaged in an Italian air raid on August 14, 1917.
The village's more recent history has been closely interrelated with that of Jesenice, with which it has gradually become increasingly connected. The newest (early 1980s-vintage) facilities of the Acroni steelmill complex were built outside the center of Jesenice at Belsko Field, directly below the village. A smaller facility (now closed) was located in the southwestern part of the village, adjacent to the railroad and the Javornik train station.
The village supports the Možnar cultural society, ("Mortar"), whose members fire mortars on special occasions. In 2004, at the ceremony marking the 1000th anniversary of Bled and concurrent opening of the Črni Kal Viaduct its members joined the RTV Slovenia symphony orchestra for a mortar-assisted performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.
Church of St. Ingenuin and St. Albuin.
"Main article:" Church of St. Ingenuin and St. Albuin"
The village church is dedicated to St. Ingenuin and St. Albuin, bishops of Säben Abbey from the 6th and 10th centuries, respectively. The chapel of nearby Bled Castle is also dedicated to the saints.
An original Gothic church dated to 1361, but was rebuilt and expanded in 1754, and again after a fire in 1761, the work being completed in 1771. It was made a parish church in 1875, and contains frescoes by Matej Sternen.

ADAPT – Able Disable All People Together

ADAPT - Able Disable All People Together (formerly known as The Spastics Society of India) is India’s most noted non-profit and a Non-governmental organization (NGO), working for Neuro-Muscular and Developmental Disabilities. It was started on 2 October 1972 by Mithu Alur, to provide education and treatment services for the spastics (children suffering from cerebral palsy). 
Today it has broadened its scope to include programs on teacher training, vocational training of young adults with Cerebral Palsy, Autism, Mental Retardation, Multiple Disabilities and Learning Disabilities. It also works in the field of advocacy and awareness and offers support to parents and other professionals. It has led to the formation of independent Spastic societies in 16 states in India. In 1999, it established the ‘National Resource Centre for Inclusion (NRCI), in Mumbai, to include disabled children from special schools into normal schools. The Spastics Society of India has since changed names and is currently called ADAPT (Able Disable All People Together). Many of the state level spastics societies under the aegis of The Spastics Society of India have also changed names since.
History.
In 1966, when daughter Malini Chib, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Mithu Alur found no proper schools for children with disabilities existed in India. So in 1968, she got trained as a teacher in the field of Special Education at the Institute of Education (IOE), University of London. Back home, she wanted to open a school in Mumbai, and she contacted the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi asked her to get in touch with actress, Nargis Dutt. Nargis Dutt became the first patron of ‘The Spastics Society of India’ (SSI), which formally started on October 2, 1972
Later the first ever special school in India for children with cerebral palsy, “Centre for Special education” was set up at Colaba on October 2, 1973, providing education and treatment facilities under one roof. It commenced with just three children — Malini (Mithu Alur’s daughter), Farhan Contractor and Imtiaz. Nargis Dutt, remained its lifelong patron. After her death in 1981, her mantle was taken up by her husband, Sunil Dutt. 
Today, SSI Mumbai, in its new name ADAPT, runs centres in Colaba, Dharavi, Bandra and Chembur. SSI has spread its services in 16 states, and in cities like, Kolkata, Delhi (1978), Bangalore, Chennai, Allahabad, Dayalpur, Pune and Cochin, where it runs special schools for children with disabilities, and offers vocational training and help for finding suitable jobs to the students, through rehabilitation, communication and speech therapy, counseling, parent training and support programs. Certificate and diploma courses are conducted for special educators, basic developmental therapists and community rehabilitators. 
In 1987, the SSI received the National Award for the “Best Voluntary Agency” from the Government of India, and later in 1989, Mithu Alur was herself awarded the Padma Shri.

The Pink Side of Miss Daisy

The Pink Side of Miss Daisy is an instrumental guitar Top 10 hit, written and played by French award-winning guitarist Jean-Pierre Danel.
The tune is a tribute to the Pink Floyd and to Danel's scarce and famous 1954 preproduction Fender Stratocaster, Miss Daisy, on which the song is played. The name of the tune is a mix between the words "Pink Floyd", "The Dark Side of the Moon", one of their most famous albums, and the name of the guitar.
This 5 minutes and more track is also a tribute to the lyrical solos style of David Gilmour, and in the introduction, to Hank Marvin, both Gilmour's and Danel's guitar hero.
Recorded in Paris on April 16, 2008, the tune is an improvisation, only recorded once, that was filmed for the cd/DVD Top 20 hit "Guitar Connection 3". The DVD got Platinum in France.
The Pink Side of Miss Daisy single reached the #9 spot of the French single charts in August 2008 and the #29 spot of the European charts. Five years after its original release, "The Pink Side of Miss Daisy" finds its way in the Billboard U.S. charts at #86.

Tapere

A Tapere or Sub-District is a low level of traditional land subdivision on five of the Lower Cook Islands (Rarotonga, Mangaia, Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mauke), comparable to the ahupua'a of the main Hawaiian Islands. Among the populated raised islands, only Mitiaro is not subdivided into tapere. The remaining southern Cook Islands, Manuae, Palmerston and Takutea are atolls and/or uninhabited, and therefore not subject to this type of traditional subdivision. The atolls of the northern Cook Islands are subdivided into "motu" (populated atoll islets), instead.
A tapere is a subdivision of a district (the major island subdivision) or "puna", which is headed by a district chiefs or "Pava" (in the case of the Island of Mangaia). A tapere is normally headed by a "mataiapo" (a chief of a major lineage) or "ariki" (a High Chief, the titular head of a tribe). It is occupied by the "matakeinanga", the local group composed of the residential core of a major lineage, plus affines and other permissive members.
Most of the tapere lands are subdivided among the minor lineages, each of which was headed by a "rangatira" or "kōmono", or by the mataiapo himself.
Below that level, there is the "uanga", the extended family, the residential core of which occupied a household.
Historically, taperes were almost always wedge-shaped - the boundaries beginning at defined points on the outer reef and running inland to enclose an ever narrowing strip of land until converging at a point in or near the center of the island. By this type of delineation, any one tapere included every category of soil type and land surface of the island, from the typically mountainous interior, where forest products were collected, through fertile valleys where the major food crops were grown, across the rocky coastal strip of elevated fossil coral (makatea), out to the lagoon and fringing reef.
List of Tapere.
Aitutaki.
Aitutaki is subdivided into eight districts with 19 tapere according to the constitution. The 16 minor islands, 12 of the motu, are outside of this subdivision scheme:
Atiu.
In the case of Atiu, the six villages correspond to the six tapere:
Mangaia.
Mangaia is subdivided into six Districts (puna), which are further subdivided into 38 tapere.
In the Cook Islands Constitution however, the six districts are called tapere.
Mauke.
Mauke is subdivided into four districts. Vaimutu and Makatea are not further subdivided and correspond to one tapere each. Ngatiarua and Areora districts are subdivided into 6 and 3 tapere, respectively, totalling 11 tapere for the whole island:
Rarotonga.
Rarotonga is subdivided into five Survey Land Districts (not to be confused with the three traditional "Vaka" districts that served as local government units with Councils and Mayors from 1997 to February 2008), with a total of 54 Tapere (or sub-districts), more than any other Island of the Cooks Islands:

Atsutsè Kokouvi Agbobli

Atsutsè Kokouvi Agbobli (April 23, 1941 – August 15, 2008) was a Togolese politician. He served in the government under President Gnassingbé Eyadéma and was the President of the Movement for National Development (MODENA), an opposition party.
Following the February 1994 parliamentary election, Agbobli was appointed as Minister of Communication and Culture on May 25, 1994; he was moved to the post of Minister in charge of Relations with Parliament on November 29, 1995. Subsequently, he announced in March 2007 the creation of a new opposition party, MODENA, to be launched on April 21, 2007. According to Agbobli, Togolese politics was excessively dominated by two large parties, the ruling Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) and the main opposition Union of Forces for Change (UFC), and he criticized both of them.
Agbobli was found dead on a beach in Lomé on August 15, 2008. The Ministry of Security stated on August 16 that Agbobli had attempted suicide on August 13 by ingesting a toxic substance and was admitted to a clinic, but subsequently left the clinic in the early hours of August 14 and was found dead the next day. In order to determine the cause of death, an autopsy was ordered on August 17; on the same day, the National Commission on Human Rights called for a commission of inquiry to investigate his death, and the UFC made a similar call on August 18.
On August 18, state prosecutor Robert Baoubadi Bakaï announced on television that the autopsy results showed that Agbobli died due to "drug poisoning". According to Bakaï, the autopsy did not reveal the specific drug responsible, but he said that it "systematically ruled out the possibility of a drowning". Although Agbobli was found with marks on his forehead, this was said to have been caused by his collapse. He was buried in his native village of Adéta in southwestern Togo on September 13.
Agbobli's children disputed the claim that he committed suicide, arguing that he was not depressed and had no serious problems in his life that might have led him to attempt suicide. He had been on medication for hypertension and diabetes. Agbobli was married to the Angolan Ambassador to Poland and had travelled to Warsaw not long before his death.

Wiener Lokalbahnen

The Aktiengesellschaft der Wiener Lokalbahnen (also called "WLB") is an Austrian transportation company in Greater Vienna and is, through the Wiener Linien Gesmbh, a subsidiary of the Wiener Stadtwerke Holding AG.
The "Wiener Lokalbahnen" operate a double tracked (except a single tracked segment in Baden) and completely electrified railway from Vienna to Baden, the so-called "Badner Bahn", as well as some bus lines. The whole passenger transportation division is integrated with the Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region (VOR).
The company also offers freight transportation.
The company also holds various other subsidiaries:
Division: Rail passenger traffic.
The 30.4 km long railway operates between the Vienna State Opera and Baden Josefsplatz. WLB handles around 30,000 people every day, bringing them to work, school, Shopping City Süd or various events along the line. Between the stations "Baden Viadukt" and "Baden Leesdorf" and "Wien Schedifkaplatz" and "Wien Oper", the train operates on tram tracks and therefore must travel slowly. On the remaining route, the train operates as a heavy rail train. All together there are 34 train stations and small stops, at which the station "Karlsplatz" only gets served when the train travels in the direction Vienna Opera.
Division: Bus passenger traffic.
The WLB operates the buslines 357, 358, 359, 360 und 361 in the "Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region" (VOR). These bus lines only drive in and around Baden. The lines 357, 358 and 359 are the three city bus lines in Baden. The bus line 360, the so-called "Casinobus Baden", operates the round-trip Wien Oper – Baden – Bad Vöslau – Gainfarn and is included in the night bus network of the Wiener Linien. The line 361 operates between Baden, Oeynhausen, Möllersdorf, Bad Vöslau and the "Industriezentrum Niederösterreich Süd".
The WLB is also the operator of the Ikea-bus at the SCS in Vösendorf. For this, one bus of the type MAN NL 263/283 obtained a special foil with the Ikea logo. However, this line has been suspended as of September 29. 2012. Customers can use the other two Ikea busses leaving from the Siebenhirten U6 metro station (Mo-Sa) or from the Reumannplatz U1 metro station (Fr-Sa), or alternatively travel on the "Badner Bahn". The trip segment from Vösendorf Siebenhirten to Vösendorf SCS is free of charge for holders of the Family Card. 
Subsidiaries.
Wiener Lokalbahnen Cargo GesmbH (WLC).
The Wiener Lokalbahnen Cargo Gesmbh owns the license to travel on tracks in Austria and the EU. The WLC partly uses its own infrastructure (with its own trains), and third party tracks (also with its own trains) for cargo services. The WLC also owns several cargo rail cars.
The following trains are used by the WLC:
The WLC also rented 11 Eurosprinter ES64 U2 engines from Siemens-Dispolok.
Three electric locomotives (1116 series) are described as "Bosporus-sprinters", because they are equipped with railway supervision systems currently used in trains in Hungary (EVM 120), Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. These trains are currently used in the daily "East Line Shuttle" (Duisburg – Enns/Krems/Wien – Budapest) and in trains going to Hungary.
There are another 8 electric locomotives from the 1116 series, which are mostly used in north-south routes (North sea docks – Austria). These locomotives all wear the colors of the WLC, except the locomotive no. 83, which is red. The WLC colors are blue and creme white.
The cargo division was separated from the main company in late 2007 and is a 100% subsidiary of WLB, run under the name Wiener Lokalbahnen Cargo GmbH (WLC). In 2006 the total revenue was 26,1 Mio. EUR. The goal for 2008 is to increase the cargo volume, especially in the combined freight transport.
Wiener Lokalbahnen Verkehrsdienste GmbH (WLV).
The main assignment of this company is to transport severely handicapped people. The travel bus division of the WLB was also reassigned to the WLV, and so all travel buses had to be re-registered to the WLV. The fleet for disabled consists of 98 Mercedes vans, which are all handicapped accessible. The travel bus fleet mostly consists of buses of the companies Setra, Volvo and Neoplan.
Wiener Lokalbahnen Busbetrieb GmbH (WLBB).
The WLBB was established in 2004, and is operative since early 2005. The first two bus lines of the WLBB were the 27A (since 2 June 2005) and 37A (since 9 October 2005), which were operated on behalf of the Wiener Linien. On 1 February, the bus lines 16A and 60A were transferred from the WLB to the WLBB. Therefore only the bus lines in the region of Baden are operated by the WLB themselves.
Since 6 August 2006 the WLBB operate the Viennese bus line 80A instead of the ÖBB-Postbus GmbH on behalf of the Wiener Linien.

<doc id="18930434" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18930434" title="Fuel (video game)">
Fuel (video game)

Fuel is a racing video game developed by Asobo Studio and published by Codemasters, released on June 2, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and June 5, for Microsoft Windows.
Gameplay.
"Fuel" is an open world racing game set in a "Mad Max"-like post-apocalyptic world ravaged by extreme weather fueled by global warming, with players experiencing varying weather effects such as occasional tornadoes and sandstorms, as well as an accelerated day-night cycle. The world of the game is over 5,560 square miles (14,400 km²) in size, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut, and completely free to roam. In the free roaming mode, the game features the ability to drive anywhere in the game world without incurring loading times, however crashing a vehicle - or invoking the reset function to return to the road - does invoke a loading screen.
Vehicles.
The player starts at one of 19 camps, with a few vehicles at the start of the single-player campaign, which is called "career" mode. When the career is fully completed, the player can use seventy different vehicles across six different classes, including bikes, ATVs, muscle cars, SUVs, buggies, and trucks as well as a hovercraft. The currency used in the game is Fuel and it serves as money to pay with for new vehicles. In the game the player can customize vehicles and the driver up to certain limits.
Exploration.
Driving around the parts of the open game world will lead to the discovery of new "challenges" (i.e. races out in the wilderness), new liveries for vehicles, and "Vista points", which offer picturesque views of the environment and are collected by driving through the flagpole. Once a vista is activated properly, a "FUEL-flag" will spawn on the pole and the player is notified they have collected a Vista point. Also to be found in the wilderness are numerous caches of fuel barrels, which the player must knock over to collect.
Challenges are found by driving through the environment and finding their start grids. Challenges vary from A-to-B races against opponents or within a time limit, up to long distance racing, helicopter chases, and "Seek 'N' Destroy" races. In "Chopper Chase", the player needs to stay close to a helicopter flying ahead of the player, and eventually the player must get ahead of the chopper and reach its landing site before the chopper gets there. In Seek 'N' Destroy challenges, the player must eliminate a specified amount of opponents by touching them, before the time runs out. Challenges are awarded with fuel only. Just like career races, challenges can only be done in certain vehicles.
Races.
To advance through the game, the player must earn stars and fuel. Stars are earned with Career races, the locations of which are shown on the map as a 5-point star in a circle indicating a camp. Each race has 3 difficulty levels. For completing a race, the player earns one star for each difficulty level and an amount of fuel. This can only be done once; completing the same race for the second time on the same level will not be rewarded. With enough stars the player can unlock new areas of the open world map, with a total of 216 stars to be collected in the game. To get all stars, all races must be won on all 3 difficulty levels, although winning on the lowest level gives most rewards. Next to earning a star and fuel, the player will also unlock new clothing items, new vehicles (which still need to be bought), and Doppler Trucks will appear in the specific area.
Once the player has completed a race, the star-icon will get a ring around it, matching the color of the difficulty level with which the race was completed. Career races can only be completed in certain vehicles, usually the player gets restricted to choose out of maximum a dozen vehicles. Career races are restricted to one class of vehicles.
Maverick Vehicles and Doppler Trucks.
Completing races will, alongside rewards, also bring Doppler Trucks and Maverick vehicles in the specific map area in which the race took place. Doppler trucks are shown with either a red, blue, or green arrow. These are linked to what they unlock: hitting a red Doppler truck will give all locations to challenges, a blue truck will give all locations of liveries, and a green truck will give all Vista point locations. Maverick vehicles are shown by a purple arrow. These are bonus vehicles which can be unlocked just as Doppler trucks can be defeated: by hitting them. These vehicles will be available to the player instantly (without having to buy them) after hitting them, unlike vehicles which are unlocked by winning career races, these will only appear in the vehicle list.
Fuel supplies.
In the game the player pays with fuel. Fuel can be earned in 3 ways: by winning career races, by winning challenges, or by hitting the white fuel barrels scattered on the whole game map. They can be found in 2 amounts: one barrel, or a pyramid of 4 barrels. One barrel earns the player 100 fuel, 4 barrel pyramids earn 400, not depending on how many barrels fell on the ground. Fuel barrels are found both on land as on top of building ruins, where a jump usually leads to the roof on which the barrels are.
Character and vehicle customization.
The driver can be customized with skin colors, helmets, upper clothing items, and lower clothing items. Every clothing item and helmet also has several liveries to choose from, these are instantly available when the items themselves are unlocked.
Vehicles can be customized with liveries and base colors. Liveries have to be found, however. They appear as blue spheres on the game map and as blue spheres with spray cans on the compass in the top of the screen. Like vista points, which appear as green spheres and triangles, liveries are usually positioned offroad, forcing the player to sometimes go to the edge of a cliff to get liveries or vista points. This usually comes down to the right combination of vehicle and approach route.
Multiplayer.
"Fuel" has a competitive online multiplayer mode for 2 to 16 players and a co-operative online multiplayer mode supporting 2 to 4 players. There is no offline multiplayer mode (LAN) available.
Development.
"Fuel" evolved from a game Asobo Studio announced in 2005, called "Grand Raid Offroad".
The award for largest playable area in a console game was awarded to "Fuel" developer Asobo Studios. Guinness World Records presented the developer with a certificate to commemorate the achievement.
Reception.
"Fuel" has been met with mixed reviews. Many of the rewards available to be unlocked were seen as not worth the effort and the racing mechanics have been noted as sloppy, with the AI opponents leading for most of the race only to slow down towards the end to allow the player to win.

Halfdan Egedius

Halfdan Egedius (May 5, 1877 – February 2, 1899) was a Norwegian painter and illustrator.
Biography.
Halfdan Johnsen Egedius was born in Drammen in Buskerud county and grew up in Christiania. His interest in painting and illustration began at the age of 5 and he showed exceptional artistic abilities early. He attended art school from the age of 9 at the school of art of Knud Bergslien, where he was a pupil from 1886 to 1889. In 1891 he was a pupil of Erik Werenskiold, and from 1891 to 1892 he studied at the Arts and Crafts School in Christiania. In 1894 he attended the Harriet Backer art school. During spring 1896, he was a student of Kristian Zahrtmann in Copenhagen. From the age of 15 he began painting the landscape of Telemark.
Professionally known as Halfdan Johnsen Egedius, he was active from the age of 16 until his premature death at the age of 21. In his short life he managed to create several Norwegian masterpieces in a variety of styles. He is best known for his illustrations of the "Heimskringla" in a style inspired by Werenskiold.
Halfdan Egedius became ill during a summer stay in Telemark in 1898, and after relapsing before Christmas, was hospitalized in Christiania, where he died in February 1899, not yet 22 years old. The cause of death was actinomycosis, a bacterial infection that attacked the internal organs. He was buried in the churchyard at Vestre Aker. Fifty years after his death, a memorial stone was erected.

Alison Des Forges

Alison Des Forges (née Liebhafsky) (August 20, 1942 – February 12, 2009) was an American historian and human rights activist who specialized in the African Great Lakes region, particularly the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. At the time of her death, she was a senior advisor for the African continent at Human Rights Watch.
Life.
Des Forges was born Alison B. Liebhafsky on August 20, 1942, to Sybil Small and Herman A. Liebhafsky. She married Roger Des Forges, a historian at the State University of New York at Buffalo who specialized in China, in 1964. Des Forges earned her B.A. in history from Radcliffe College in 1964, and her M.A. and a PhD in the same discipline from Yale University in 1966 and 1972. Her master's thesis and doctoral dissertation both addressed the impact of European colonialism on Rwanda. "Defeat Is the Only Bad News: Rwanda under Musinga, 1896–1931", her dissertation, was published posthumously in 2011. Describing the politics of the court during the reign of Yuhi Musinga, it shows how divisions among different groups in Rwanda shaped their responses to colonial governments, missionaries and traders.
She specialized in the African Great Lakes region and studied the Rwandan Genocide. She was also an authority on human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Burundi.
Des Forges left academia in 1994 in response to the Rwandan Genocide, to work full-time on human rights. She was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1999, and became the senior advisor at Human Rights Watch for the African continent.
She died on February 12, 2009, in the air crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407, en route from Newark, New Jersey, to her home in Buffalo, New York.
Witness to Rwandan Genocide.
In April 1994, she was one of the first outsiders to observe that a full-blown genocide was under way in Rwanda, and afterwards led a team of researchers to establish the facts. She testified 11 times before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and gave evidence about the Rwandan Genocide to panels of the French National Assembly, the Belgian Senate, the US Congress, the Organisation of African Unity, and the United Nations.
She wrote the 1999 book "Leave None to Tell the Story", which "The Economist" and "The New York Times" both describe as the definitive account of the Rwandan genocide. In the book, she argued that the genocide was organized by the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government at the time, rather than being a spontaneous outbreak of tribal conflicts. Africanist René Lemarchand states, "That the story of Rwanda is at all known in the United States today owes much to the work of Philip Gourevitch and Alison Des Forges."

Timothaus Mar Shallita

Timothaus Mar Shallita Youwala (*1936) is Archbishop of the Ancient Holy Apostolic Catholic Church of the East for Germany and all Europe. He currently resides in Mainz-Kastel, Germany.
Life.
Shallita and his supporters did not accept this decision as Andreos was younger than Shallita. They requested episcopal ordination for Shallita from the Syrian Orthodox Church. Consequently, Timothaus Mar Shallita was consecrated Archbishop in the church St. Petrus and Paulus in Beirut, Lebanon, by Patriarch Ignatius Ya`qub III on October 23, 1958. Participants to the ceremony were Archbishop Mar Paulus from Iraq, Archbishop Bahnnan from Lebanon, Bishop Paulus from Jerusalem and the current Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church Zakka I Iwas, a former secretary and monk. Over 2000 guests attended the consecration, Camille Chamoun, the president of Lebanon, being one of them. Timotheus Mar Shallita was welcomed into communion, but did not join the Holy Synod of the church.
Timothaus Mar Shallita returned from Lebanon to Iraq in 1958. At that time, King Faissal II had been murdered by General Kassim and the former monarchy called itself a republic. He met with General Kassim, who had taken over power and had also murdered the Prime Minister Nuri-Es-Said, to demand freedom of speech and press. Furthermore, the archbishop gave a speech in Assyrian and Arabic language on Radio and Television in Baghdad.
From Baghdad he returned to Barwari-Bala, a district in northern Iraq which is heavily inhabited by Assyrians. Three years later, the conflict between the Kurds and the Iraqi government began, which caused Mar Shallita to temporarily leave to Mosul in 1963, later relocating to the Syrian Orthodox Patriarchate in Damascus. There he met Patriarch Ignatius Ya`qub III, who contacted the World Council of Churches in Geneva on his behalf. Almost immediately, representatives of the Evangelical Church in Germany invited the Archbishop to come to Darmstadt. There he arrived in 1967 and attended evening school to learn German. Shallita later left the Syrian Orthodox Church.
In 1969 he entered communion with the Ancient Church of the East based in Baghdad, however did not join the Holy Synod until 1995 and was officially recognised as Metropolitan of Germany and Europe. 
This entailed the foundation of new Assyrian communities in Europe. An example is the opening of the St. Georges church in Joenkopings, Sweden, where Timothaus Mar Shallita attended the opening ceremony. Furthermore, he has consecrated an Archpriest, Khoshaba M. Georges, in London and a priest, Jacob Warda, in Denmark, a priest, Oz Sabri, in Marseilles along with eleven deacons all over Europe. On June 8, 1997 the cornerstone ceremony for the church Mar Shallita in Los Angeles took place. President Emanuel Bet Maleck, Sarkis Mikkael Fard, Mr. David S. Younan and the whole community of Los Angeles were attending this joyful ceremony.
At the time when Archbishop Timothaus Mar Shallita was consecrated, there was only a small division. But today, a huge split has emerged, caused by the fact that two patriarchs claim to lead one Assyrian church and people. Nevertheless, Timothaus Mar Shallita, who disapproves of the division into two parts, has tried to unite the church and the people by negotiating with both Patriarchs. Obviously, this is a difficult undertaking.
Timothaus Mar Shallita speaks Assyrian, Arabic, Kurdish, German and English.
Refugee Aid.
For many years Assyrian refugees have been writing to Timothaus Mar Shallita in search for help from persecution. In 1978, the archbishop lived in the monastery of Pandely in Greece for a few months where he supported about 8000 Assyrians who had fled to Greece with the help of the United Nations and the Red Cross. He had talked to the Greek government beforehand in order to arrange possible housing and working places for the refugees, who not only fled from Iraq but also from Iran, Lebanon and Syria.
In 1983 he headed to Italy, again to support the approximately 2000 refugees and to improve their situation. Thereafter, he went to France to continue his mission. In 1991 he arrived in Turkey to visit the ten Assyrian refugees camps accompanied by staff members of the UNHCR. Silopi was one of these camps. Before his arrival, Timothaus Mar Shallita had received a list with the name of over 40000 refugees, asking him for help. While visiting all of the camps, he informed himself about their situation. Afterwards, he talked to the Turkish administration and succeeded in gathering the Assyrian refugees into two camps instead of ten and also insisting on accommodation in houses and no longer in tents for he worried about the health and the lives of the weaker and older refugees as the harsh East Anatolian winter was not far away.
After this problem was addressed, he started negotiations with the ambassadors of many nations. Months before his travel to Turkey, Timothaus Mar Shallita had already informed them about the situation of the Assyrians including the Chaldeans by introducing for the first time this ethnic minority, for most countries did not know that the Assyrians still existed. In these negotiations, he achieved that many embassies admitted the Assyrians as refugees to their countries.

Christian Bautista (album)

Christian Bautista is the self-titled debut album by Filipino singer Christian Bautista, released in the Philippines on September 28, 2004 by Warner Music Philippines. Its singles include "The Way You Look at Me", "Hands to Heaven", "Colour Everywhere", "Kailan Pa Ma'y Ikaw" and "Kelan Kaya". To date, the album has reached 4× Platinum status by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry, selling over 120,000 units in the country. It has also been certified in other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand.
The album was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com on September 25, 2004. It has sold more than 400,000 copies all over Asia.
Background.
After his stint as a contestant on ABS-CBN's "Star In A Million" talent contest where he became the fourth runner-up, Bautista signed an album contract with Warner Music Philippines. He, then, released his self-titled debut album, with "The Way You Look at Me" as its first single, written by Andrew Fromm and Keith Follese.
The album had significant radio airplay in other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.
Reception.
The album sold overwhelmingly huge. It was 4× Platinum in the Philippines, and 2× Platinum in Indonesia. Furthermore, it became popular in other parts of Southeast Asia, namely Thailand and Malaysia. Despite from over-performing commercially, the album received mixed reviews from OPM critics. Ginnie Faustino-Galgana of "Titik Pilipino" gave the album three out of five stars, stating "He is a face with a voice. It's easy to imagine girls swooning over Christian. If he could act, he can do a Piolo Pascual". However, she felt the lack of heart on Bautista's deliverance, saying "He can hit the notes and his delivery is pretty clear, but more emotion is needed [...] He may want to croon, rather than just sing the words". She ended the review unsatisfied, saying "A little more practice will get him that "oomph"".
Re-release.
A limited edition of the album was released, consisting of a two-CD set package. The first disc consists of the original tracks from the original edition of the album plus four additional songs—"You and Me (We Wanted It All)" with Rachelle Ann Go, "So It's You", "Say That You Love Me", and "I Will Be What I Believe". The second disc is in VCD format, consisting of six music videos.
Critical response.
"Titik Pilipino" gave another review for the re-release of "Christian Bautista". Resty Odon gave the album a perfect rating (five out of five stars), stating "The good news is, the addition of these four numbers gives Christian the chance to further prove that he can hold his own in the ballads department". He compared Bautista as better than Josh Groban, when it comes to pop numbers. He also praised the vocal performance of Bautista on the four new songs, saying "Fans of Christian Bautista [...] will be thrilled just the same to find Christian belting it out in four new songs in his own unique style, including a duet with the golden-voiced Rachelle Ann Go.

Opened in 1953 or 1954, and one of the original "folk cafés" of the 1950s/1960s, Bunjies Coffee House & Folk Cellar was situated at 27 Litchfield Street (just off Charing Cross Road), London WC2. Below the café, in a 400 years old wine cellar, was an influential music venue which changed little until its closure (and conversion of the premises into a restaurant) in 1999. Allegedly named after the first owner's pet hamster, the venue featured, early in their careers,(Tom Paxton) John Renbourn, Bert Jansch, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Al Stewart secured a residency at the Folk Cellar in 1965, at the age of 19, which was a significant factor in his later success.
During the 1960s the venue was run by two brothers, Leo and Theo Johnson and, at this time, a range of artists more associated with mainstream pop music than folk happily performed to tiny audiences in the confines of the cellar; Phil Collins, Sandie Shaw, Cat Stevens, Art Garfunkel, Rod Stewart, Long John Baldry and David Bowie being amongst them.
Bunjies was a haunt of many writers, comedians, singers and artists. Regulars have included Jarvis Cocker of Pulp.
Other London "folk cafés" of the 1950s and 1960s included Les Cousins and The Troubadour.

Slovenski Javornik

Slovenski Javornik () is a settlement in the Municipality of Jesenice in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. Commonly known simply as "Javornik", the place name is derived from the Slovene word "javor" 'maple'.
Primarily a residential community, it also contains the bulk of the remaining steel mill facilities in the Municipality of Jesenice. The settlement is located directly southeast of the core of Jesenice, on the north bank of the Sava River. Its neighbor to the northwest is the village of Koroška Bela.
History.
Javornik was founded in 1403 when Ulrich, the bishop of Brixen, granted Herman Esel the rights to mine iron ore below Koroška Bela. After an ore discovery, blast furnaces were established on the right bank of Javornik Creek, below Kres Hill. Javornik was the third iron-working settlement in the modern Jesenice area, after Sava and Plavž, although all were predated by the agricultural villages of Koroška Bela and Murova.
The industrial facilities passed through the hands of several owners, including the Pasarelli family, who built a manorhouse at Trebež in the 17th century. Now lost, it was one of four "ironworks castles" built in the area during the 16th and early 17th centuries; the Kos Manor in Murova and the Bucelleni-Ruard Manor in Sava survive. In 1752, the Javornik furnaces were among other facilities in the area purchased by the Tarvisio merchant and investor Michel Angel Zois de Edelstein, the father of the Slovene Enlightenment patron Baron Sigismund Zois.
After the Ljubljana-Tarvisio railroad was laid through Jesenice in 1870, the KID company—by then the sole operator of the steel mill—began relocating its plants, up to then scattered throughout the region, to Sava and Javornik. In 1904, the sheet-metal rolling plant was transferred from Jesenice to Javornik; a decade later, during World War I, the plant and its workers were moved to Trieste and Pula to work on the Austro-Hungarian Navy.
In 1929, the Javornik facilities were purchased by the Westen brothers, August (1877–1952) and Adolf (1878–1960), who built a new light sheet-metal rolling plant, coming online in 1933. After the war, Yugoslav authorities oversaw a substantial expansion of the steel facilities; the settlement was incorporated into Jesenice in 1945.
Places of note in Javornik include the sprawling Acroni steel mill complexes, and a large bridge over the Sava leading to Blejska Dobrava, a small train station on the Ljubljana line.

Cedric Allingham

Cedric Allingham (born June 27, 1922) was a British contactee of the 1950s, whose claims to have encountered the pilot of a Martian spacecraft were published in 1954 as "Flying Saucer from Mars". Later writers have speculated that not only were Allingham's experiences fabricated, but that Allingham himself never existed and was part of a hoax perpetrated by a well-known media figure.
Autobiography.
Allingham's book stated that he had been born in 1922 in Bombay, and educated in England and South Africa. He had taken up amateur astronomy while posted to the Middle East with the RAOC, and subsequently travelled around Britain indulging his hobbies of bird-watching and caravan holidays while making a living as a writer of thrillers.
Claims.
Allingham recounted that on 18 February 1954, while on holiday near Lossiemouth, he encountered a flying saucer and communicated with its pilot by means of hand gestures and telepathy. The spaceman had indicated that he came from Mars, and that he had also visited Venus and the Moon. As supporting evidence, Allingham took a number of blurry photographs of the saucer and one of its occupant, pictured from the rear. He also claimed that a fisherman named James Duncan had witnessed the event from a nearby hill, providing a signed statement which was reproduced in the book.
Coming soon after the dramatic claims of the contactee George Adamski, Allingham's book attracted a fair amount of popular and media attention. TIME devoted a short piece to it early in 1955. Commenting that Allingham's photograph of a Martian looked "very like a crofter with galluses flapping", the writer added:
Evasion.
Members of the flying saucer clubs popular at the time made attempts to interview Allingham, but both he and James Duncan proved remarkably elusive. Allingham was said to have delivered a lecture to a UFO group in Tunbridge Wells, at which Lord Dowding (former Air Chief Marshal of the RAF during World War II and a prominent UFO believer) stated he was present: "We got Mr. Cedric Allingham [...] to lecture to our local Flying Saucer Club, and we were all strongly impressed that he was telling the truth about his actual experiences, although we felt that he might have been mistaken in some of the conclusions which he drew from his interview". The writer Robert Chapman made several attempts to trace Duncan, and to contact Allingham through his publishers, who stated firstly that Allingham was undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland, and then that he had died there. Chapman was only able to confirm that Allingham had given the previously mentioned lecture in Sussex, at which the well-known broadcaster, astronomer and noted UFO skeptic Patrick Moore claimed to have met him. Unable to locate either Duncan or Allingham, and therefore suspecting some form of hoax, Chapman regretfully concluded that "if there was no James Duncan and no visitor from Mars, perhaps there was no Cedric Allingham either".
A hoax?
Progress on unravelling the mystery came in 1986 as a result of research by Christopher Allan and Steuart Campbell which they revealed in the skeptical Fortean journal "Magonia". In "Flying Saucer from Moore's?", they argued that the prose of Allingham's book showed significant similarities to the writing of the famous astronomer Patrick Moore. Thanks to further enquiries to Allingham's publisher, they were able to trace a friend of Moore's named Peter Davies who admitted that he had written the book with another individual who he declined to name. Davies also claimed that the talk at the UFO club given by "Allingham" had in fact been given by himself while wearing a false moustache. Moore has admitted to being invited by Lord Dowding to be a guest at this meeting. These and other clues led Allan and Campbell to identify Patrick Moore as the main culprit in a hoax intended to expose the gullibility and uncritical research methods of British ufologists. Specifically "Flying Saucer from Mars" seems to parody of "Flying Saucers Have Landed", the 1953 book written by the aforementioned George Adamski in collaboration with Desmond Leslie.
Further articles on Moore's involvement appeared in "The Star", July 28, 1986 and the 'Feedback' page of "New Scientist" Aug 14, 1986. 
Moore, however, immediately denied being responsible for Allingham's book, and threatened to take legal action against anyone suggesting otherwise, although he took no such action on any of the three articles mentioned above. Moore, who died in 2012, never confirmed his involvement in the affair, even though the telescope shown in the book's frontispiece bears a remarkable resemblance to his own 12½-inch reflectior [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAsuCYLtHUg].

George Ponsonby (Junior Lord of the Treasury)

George Ponsonby (1773 – 5 June 1863), styled The Honourable from 1806, was an Irish politician, who served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury in the governments under Earl Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1832 to 1834.
He was the fourth son of William Brabazon Ponsonby and Louisa daughter of Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth. Ponsonby represented Lismore in the Irish House of Commons between 1796 and 1798. He was then elected as a Member of Parliament at a by-election for Kilkenny County in 1806 on his father, previously the sitting member, being elevated to the peerage as 1st Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly, but a general election quickly followed when he was replaced in this seat by his younger brother Hon. Frederick Ponsonby.
He subsequently served as for Cork County from 1806 to 1812; for Youghal in County Cork from 1826 to 1832; and was evidently also a member of the following Parliament. 
He lived at Woodbeding in Sussex. He married twice, having two sons (both of whom predeceased him) and a daughter.

Completely is the second studio album of Filipino singer Christian Bautista, released on December 22, 2005 in the Philippines by Warner Music Philippines. Its singles include "Everything You Do", "Invincible", "She Could Be", and "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own". Bautista wrote two songs for the album (a first time for the singer) —"Now That You Are Here" and "Please Don't Go". On January 30, 2006, he went to Indonesia to stage a concert, attend TV and radio guestings, and shoot music videos for "Since I Found You" and "For Everything I Am". In 2006, the album was certified Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry.
The album was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com on January 16, 2007. American actor-singer Corbin Bleu covered the single "She Could Be" on his 2007 album, "Another Side". To date, it has sold over 150,000 copies in Asia.
Critical reception.
"Completely" received positive reviews from critics. Resty Odon of "Titik Pilipino" gave the album four out of five stars, explaining "This album starts off with the regular ballads [...] It then shifts to an experimentation with more upbeat tunes". He added "This album boasts of having employed international songwriters [...] Christian also proves he can write a song or two ("Now That You Are Here", "Please Don’t Go") – another plus point". He praised the last number, "Nais Ko", stressing out the new side of Bautista that he called "louder, bolder, zippy". However, he disliked the upbeat numbers, saying "I think Christian’s almost one-dimensional pitch should stick to the ballads".

Archdiocese of Nidaros

The Archdiocese of Nidaros was the metropolitan see covering Norway in the later Middle Ages. The see was the Nidaros Cathedral, in the city of Nidaros (now Trondheim). The archdiocese existed from the middle of the twelfth century until the Protestant Reformation.
History.
In Norway it was the kings who introduced Christianity, which first became known to the people during their martial expeditions. The work of Christianization begun by Haakon the Good (d. 981) was carried on by Olaf Tryggvason (d. 1002) and Olaf Haraldsson (St. Olaf, d. 1030). Both were converted Vikings, the former having been baptized at Andover, England, by Aelfeah, Bishop of Winchester, and the latter at Rouen by Archbishop Robert.
In 997 Olaf Tryggvason founded at the mouth of the river Nidelva the city of Nidaros (now Trondheim) where he built a royal palace and a church; he laboured to spread Christianity in Norway, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. King Olaf Haraldsson created an episcopal see at Nidaros, installing the monk Grimkill as bishop. Moreover, many English and German bishops and priests came to Norway. The Norwegian bishops were at first dependent on the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, and afterwards on the Archbishop of Lund, Primate of Scandinavia. As the Norwegians wanted an archbishop of their own, Pope Eugene III, resolving to create a metropolitan see at Nidaors, sent thither as legate (1151) Cardinal Nicholas of Albano (Nicholas Breakspeare), afterwards Adrian IV. The legate installed Jon Birgerson, previously Bishop of Stavanger, as Archbishop of Nidaros. The bishops of Bergen (bishop about 1060), Faroe Diocese (1047), Garðar, Greenland (1126), Hamar (1151), Hólar, Iceland (1105), Orkney (1070; suffragan till 1472), Oslo (1073), Skálholt, Iceland (1056), and Stavanger (1130) became suffragans.
Archbishop Birgerson was succeeded by Eysteinn Erlendsson (Beatus Augustinus, 1158–88), previously royal secretary and treasurer, a man of intellect, strong will, and piety. King Sverre wished to make the Church a tool of the temporal power, and the archbishop was compelled to flee from Norway to England. He was able to return, and a reconciliation took place later between him and the king, but on Eystein's death King Sverre renewed his attacks, and Archbishop Eric had to leave the country and take refuge with Absalon, Archbishop of Lund. At last, when King Sverre attacked the papal legate, Pope Innocent III laid the king and his partisans under interdict.
King Haakon III (1202), son and successor of King Sverre, hastened to make peace with the Church. To regulate ecclesiastical affairs, which had suffered during the struggles with Sverre, Pope Innocent IV in 1247 sent Cardinal William of Sabina as legate to Norway. He intervened against encroachments on the part of the bishops, reformed various abuses, and abolished the ordeal by hot iron. Owing in great measure to the papal legates, Norway became more closely linked with the supreme head of Christendom at Rome. Secular priests, Benedictines, Cistercians, Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans worked together for the prosperity of the Church. Archbishops Eilif Kortin (d. 1332), Paul Baardson (d. 1346), and Arne Vade (d. 1349) were zealous churchmen. Provincial councils were held, at which serious efforts were made to eliminate abuses and to encourage Christian education and morality.
In 1277, the Tønsberg Concord ("Sættargjerden in Tønsberg") was signed between King Magnus VI of Norway and Jon Raude, the Archbishop of Nidaros confirming certain privileges of the clergy, the freedom of episcopal elections and similar matters. Nidaros (Trondheim), the metropolis of the ecclesiastical province, was also the capital of Norway. The residence of the kings until 1217, it remained until the Reformation the heart and centre of the spiritual life of the country. There was situated the tomb of St. Olaf, and around the patron of Norway, "Rex perpetuus Norvegiae", the national and ecclesiastical life of the country was centred. The feast of St. Olaf on 29 July was a day or reunion for "all the nations of the Northern seas, Norwegians, Swedes, Goths, Cimbrians, Danes, and Slavs", to quote an old chronicler, in the cathedral of Nidaros, where the reliquary of St. Olaf rested near the altar. Built in Roman style by King Olaf Kyrre (d. 1093), the cathedral had been enlarged by Archbishop Eystein in Gothic style. It was finished only in 1248 by Archbishop Sigurd Sim. Although several times destroyed by fire, the ancient cathedral was restored each time until the Reformation in Norway. Then Archbishop Eric Walkendorf was exiled (1521), and his successor, Olaf Engelbertsen, who had been the instrument of the royal will in the introduction of Lutheranism, had also, as a partisan of Christian II, to fly from Christian III (1537). The reliquaries of St. Olaf and St. Augustine (Eystein) were taken away, sent to Copenhagen, and melted. The bones of St. Olaf were buried in the cathedral, and the place forgotten.
The Use of Nidaros.
The texts of the Mass as it was celebrated in Norway and the other lands of the Metropolitan Province of Nidaros before the Protestant Reformation survives in a copy of the printed Missal of 1519 and in three manuscript texts, B (c. 1300), C (13th century) and D (c. 1200). Helge Fæhn in his analysis of each of these texts sums up the character of these texts as follows:
The Missal of 1519: Manuscript A seems to have been influenced mainly from Normandy and England and shows several parallels to late medieval Sarum Use. There is nothing which decisively indicates Dominican influence. Belonging to the 16th century A may be characterized as rather conservative. The most peculiar detail we find in the canon in Communicantes, where Xystus is replaced by Silvester—possibly by a misinterpretation of Innocens III.
Manuscript B: B is especially influenced from France—in parts particularly from the leading Seez group. Some tails in B—mostly in the rubrics—are obviously dependent on the explanation of the mass in Micrologus, but most remarkable in perhaps that B seems to imply that the congregation is taking an active part in the offertory. We may perhaps say that B taken as a whole belongs to the second part of the 12th century.
Manuscript C: C is without doubt dependent on French and Italian tradition. The canon is evidently influenced by the specific Roman missal of the 11th—13th century, and on the whole C may be ascribed to the beginning of the 13th century.
Manuscript D: In D everything before the canon is lacking, but in return this part exhibits close relationship to Irish and especially old Roman tradition: the last is undoubtedly because D evidently is influenced by the order of the mass in Micrologus. D is the oldest of the four "ordines misse" and must be assigned to the 12th century.
If we make a comparison of these four orders of the mass, A and B seem to have most in common. If this can be taken as a further indication that B gives the substance of the rite of Nidaros in the 13th century, then we have got a basis from which to determine the most important alterations in the rite of this see in the last 250 years before the Reformation.
Nidaros ecclesiastical province.
The Archdiocese of Nidaros headed an ecclesiastical province which included the following suffragan dioceses.

Michael Howe (psychologist)

Michael Howe (19402 January 2002) was a British cognitive psychologist. He was well known as a defender of environmental influences on intelligence, and as an opponent of IQ, and he was regularly involved in the controversies surrounding that area of research (see, e.g., Howe, 1997b). As a widely cited example of this work, with colleagues Davidson & Sloboda he argued against the existence of innate talent, a position welcomed by some, but characterised as “Absurd environmentalism” by researchers such as Douglas Detterman.
Early life and education.
Howe took BSc and PhD degrees at the University of Sheffield and worked at North American universities (Dalhousie, Tufts and Alberta) before taking a post as lecturer at the University of Exeter in England, where he worked for the rest of his career, eventually becoming the University's first Professor of Cognitive Psychology.
Career.
Howe pioneered the use of biography as a means of investigation within modern cognitive psychology (e.g. Howe, 1997a). He particularly applied it to the study of musical genius and other exceptional abilities, a subject that he investigated extensively (e.g. Howe, 1990, 1999), including the abilities of idiot savants (e.g. Howe, 1989). He wrote over 20 books, including university text books (e.g. Howe, 1977, 1998) and more popular works (e.g. Howe & Griffey, 1995). His books were widely translated and many are still in print.
Later life and death.
Howe formally retired in 2001 but continued his academic work without interruption; however he died suddenly on 2 January 2002 following a stroke.

Glory lost all three matches, but the tour was successful for trialling many new players in the lineup.
Local Friendlies.
In June, the Perth Glory squad took on Football West State League side Rockingham City in Port Kennedy, defeating the side 8–0 in front of a crowd of around 1,500. Glory also played the WA State Team, losing 2–3, with David Tarka making a successful return to competitive football in the match, after being out of the game through a hamstring injury for the past ten months.
Indonesia Tour.
Finally in July, Perth Glory embarked on a short pre-season tour of Indonesia, playing and defeating Indonesian Super League sides, Persik Kediri and Deltras Sidoarjo, 2–1 and 1–0 respectively. Mitchell was able to give new recruits, like Eugene Dadi, Adrian Trinidad and Amaral a good run as well as a competitive hit out for younger State League recruits to impress, like Josip Magdic who scored the winner against Deltras Sidoarjo.
Pre-Season Cup.
Unlike last season, Perth were not as successful in this season's Pre-Season Cup, though also unlike last season, Glory had some pre-season cup games scheduled at home this time.

Superclass (book)

Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making is a controversial book about global governance by American author David Rothkopf, released in March 2008 by publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book claims that the world population of 6 billion people is subject to the immense influence of an elite (i.e. The Superclass) of six thousand individuals.
Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout — fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication — rules. Further, the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status. Leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He proposes that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.

Tianjing Incident

The Tianjing Incident (天京事變) occurred during the late Qing Dynasty from September 2 to October 1856. This was a major internal conflict within the Taiping Rebellion which took place in its capital city Tianjing. A few key leaders of the Taiping Rebellion were killed; the East King Yang Xiuqing, the North King Wei Changhui and the Yan King Qin Rigang. More than 27,000 other civilians and troops perished in the conflict as well. The Tianjing Incident was said to be one of the factors which led to the eventual failure of the Taiping Rebellion, as well as the turning point in its fate.
Historical background.
In 1851, the Taiping Rebellion's leader Hong Xiuquan conferred the title of 'King' on five of his most loyal followers and placed them under the jurisdiction of the East King Yang Xiuqing. After the deaths of the South King Feng Yunshan and the West King Xiao Chaogui, most of the power of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fell into the hands of Yang Xiuqing.
In the early years of the Taiping Rebellion, the real power of the military was in the hands of the Military Advisor (軍師) and the leader Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan did not actually wield any power in his hands and was merely a puppet leader. The real power of the military was actually in the hands of the East King Yang Xiuqing, who gained more power following the deaths of the South and West Kings. Hong Xiuquan declared in 1848 that the spirit of the 'Holy Father' (天父) would possess Yang Xiuqing and give him orders through Yang. This had allowed Yang to become even more influential and placed him in a position higher than Hong, as Yang often gave orders to Hong, who was supposed to be his superior, in the name of the 'Holy Father'. When this happened, Hong had no choice but to follow the orders of the 'Holy Father', which were actually Yang's orders.
After the Taiping Army captured Nanjing and established its capital city there, renaming it to Tianjing, Yang Xiuqing's relationships with the other Kings gradually worsened. The North King Wei Changhui was flogged on Yang Xiuqing's orders once, as his subordinate had offended Yang. Later, Wei's relative had a dispute over property with Yang's relative, which angered Yang. Yang Xiuqing called Wei Changhui to decide the punishment for Wei's relative together, and Wei replied that his relative should be torn into five parts. Once, the Yi King Shi Dakai's father-in-law Huang Yukun offended Yang Xiuqing and was ordered to be flogged 300 times, and his nobility title removed and demoted. In the same incident, the Yan Prince Qin Rigang and another high-ranking official Chen Chengrong were also flogged on Yang Xiuqing's orders. Even the Heavenly King was not spared from being flogged, as Yang often pretended that the 'Holy Father' had possessed him and used the name of the 'Holy Father' to punish Hong Xiuquan. Yang Xiuqing monopolised the power of the kingdom and became increasingly influential, making him feared and hated by the others, but none dared to oppose him.
Events.
On 20 June 1856, the Taiping Army defeated the Qing army led by Xiang Rong and lifted the three-year-long siege on Tianjing. Xiang Rong died on 9 August and news of his death reached Tianjing. The East King Yang Xiuqing saw that the Kingdom was functioning well and began to make his plans to seize power.
Shortly afterwards, Yang Xiuqing pretended to be possessed by the 'Holy Father' and summoned the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan to his residence. Yang said to Hong, "You and the East King are both my sons. The East King has made significant contributions, so why is he still being hailed as *'Long Live for Nine Thousand Years' instead of 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years'?" Hong Xiuquan replied, "The East King has indeed made significant contributions by conquering an empire, so he should be hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years'." The 'Holy Father'-possessed Yang Xiuqing asked again, "Should the East King's son be hailed as 'Long Live for a Thousand Years'?" Hong Xiuquan replied, "Since the East King is hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years', his son and his descendants should also be hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years' as well." The 'Holy Father'-possessed Yang Xiuqing said happily, "I'm returning to heaven."
At that time, the North King Wei Changhui requested for Hong Xiuquan to punish Yang Xiuqing by having Yang executed but Hong refused to do so. Yang Xiuqing ordered Wei Changhui and the Yi King Shi Dakai to leave the capital to reinforce the armies on the western frontier. As such, among all the Kings, only Yang Xiuqing and Hong Xiuquan were left in the capital city.
Chen Chengrong met Hong Xiuquan secretly, claiming that Yang Xiuqing had the intention of committing regicide and usurping the throne. Hong Xiuquan issued a secret edict to Wei Changhui, Shi Dakai and Qin Rigang, ordering them to get rid of Yang Xiuqing. Wei Changhui led 3000 troops from the western frontier back to Tianjing and on the night of 1 September, Wei Changhui and Qin Rigang's armies met outside the city. Chen Chengrong received them by opening the gates of the city, and the armies charged into the residence of Yang Xiuqing in the wee hours of the morning. Yang Xiuqing was killed, along with everyone else in his residence, including his 54 wives and concubines. Later, Wei Changhui started a purge to remove all of his potential rivals in the name of eliminating the remnant followers of Yang Xiuqing. Several of Yang Xiuqing's supporters and followers were killed in the massacre, along with several innocent civilians as well. The total number of casualties amounted to more than 27,000 people.
On 26 September, Shi Dakai returned to Tianjing. He met with Wei Changhui and he reprimanded the latter severely for the massacre of several innocent civilians before storming off in anger. Later, Shi Dakai fled Tianjing as he realised that Wei Changhui would not let him off. As expected, Wei Changhui did send troops to arrest Shi Dakai, but Shi had already fled, so Wei had Shi Dakai's family and subordinates killed as well. Shi Dakai started a rebellion outside Tianjing, calling for all to rise up against Wei Changhui and requested for Hong Xiuquan to have Wei Changhui executed to appease the anger of the common people. As most of the military outside Tianjing supported Shi Dakai, Wei Changhui started to panic and he ordered an attack on Hong Xiuquan's residence, attempting to seize power. The coup was crushed by Hong Xiuquan's loyal subordinates and the former followers of Yang Xiuqing. Wei Changhui was killed on 2 November and his severed head was sent to Shi Dakai to appease Shi Dakai's anger. Wei Changhui's partners-in-crime Qin Rigang and Chen Chengrong were subsequently executed as well after the death of Wei Changhui. This marked the end of the Tianjing Incident.
Later, Hong Xiuquan granted the deceased Yang Xiuqing amnesty and acquitted Yang of his crimes of harbouring the intention of usurping the throne. Yang Xiuqing's death was later marked as 'The East King ascends to Heaven'.
Impacts.
After the Tianjing Incident, the leaders of the rebellion gradually lost popular support from the people and started to decline. The military's morale was greatly shakened and they started to fight losing battles against the Qing armies. The turn of tide caused the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's territories to become gradually reduced and it fell towards the losing end.
After the deaths of the East King Yang Xiuqing and the North King Wei Changhui, the Yi King Shi Dakai was put in command of the Taiping Army and wielded the entire power of the military in his hands. Hong Xiuquan was irate over Shi Dakai's popularity and feared that he might attempt to seize power again as Yang and Wei did, hence he appointed his brothers as Kings as well to weaken Shi Dakai's influence and prevent Shi from consolidating too much power. As Hong Xiuquan worked to undermine him, Shi Dakai realized that Hong's suspicions will not be dispelled, and that if he stayed he will face either murder or risk another civil war, Shi Dakai left Tianjing in 1857 with his army, which caused the Kingdom to be in greater peril.
In the early years of the Taiping Rebellion, the power of the military was in the hands of the Military Advisor (軍師), but after the Tianjing Incident and Shi Dakai's departure, the position of Military Advisor was not succeeded by anyone and only existed in name. Also, the government of the Kingdom gradually became more and more corrupt, which accounted for its decline and eventual collapse.

<doc id="18931065" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18931065" title="Seeding trial">
Seeding trial

A seeding trial or marketing trial is a form of marketing, conducted in the name of research, designed to target product sampling towards selected consumers. In the marketing research field, seeding is the process of allocating marketing to specific customers, or groups of customers, in order to stimulate the internal dynamics of the market, and enhance the diffusion process. In medicine, seeding trials are clinical trials or research studies in which the primary objective is to introduce the concept of a particular medical intervention—such as a pharmaceutical drug or medical device—to physicians, rather than to test a scientific hypothesis. In software development, beta-testing may also be referred to as conducting seeding trials.
To create loyalty and advocacy towards a brand, seeding trials take advantage of opinion leadership to enhance sales, capitalizing on the Hawthorne Effect. In a seeding trial, the brand provides potential opinion leaders with the product for free, aiming to gain valuable pre-market feedback and also to build support among the testers, creating influential word-of-mouth advocates for the product. By involving the opinion leaders as testers, effectively inviting them to be an extension of the marketing department, companies can create "a powerful sense of ownership among the clients, customers or consumers that count" by offering engaging the testers in a research dialogue. Seeding trials in medicine are not illegal but are considered unethical because they "deceive investigators, clinicians, and patients, subverting the scientific process".
In medicine.
Seeding trials to promote a medical intervention were described as "trials of approved drugs appear to serve little or no scientific purpose" and "thinly veiled attempts to entice doctors to prescribe a new drug being marketed by the company" in a special article in the "New England Journal of Medicine". The article, whose authors included U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Aaron Kessler, also described a number of characteristics common to seeding trials:
In a seeding trial, doctors and their patients are given free access to a drug and exclusive information and services to use the drug effectively. Additionally, participating physicians are often given financial remuneration and a chance to be a co-author on a resulting scientific publication. By triggering the Hawthorne effect, physicians become "opinion-leading word-of-mouth advocates". This practice has been shown to be effective.
Seeding trials are not illegal, but such practices are considered unethical. The obfuscation of true trial objectives (primarily marketing) prevents the proper establishment of informed consent for patient decisions. Additionally, trial physicians are not informed of the hidden trial objectives, which may include the physicians themselves being intended study subjects (such as in undisclosed evaluations of prescription practices). Seeding trials may also utilize inappropriate promotional rewards, which may exert undue influence or coerce desirable outcomes.
Examples.
Documents released during a court case indicate that the Assessment of Differences between Vioxx and Naproxen To Ascertain Gastrointestinal Tolerability and Effectiveness (ADVANTAGE) trial of Vioxx conducted by Merck may have been a seeding trial, with the intention being to introduce the drug to physicians rather than test its efficacy. It appears Merck knew about the potential criticism they would face; an internal email suggested: "It may be a seeding study, but let's not call it that in our internal documents". The 2003 study was originally published in the "Annals of Internal Medicine" but was strongly criticized for its deception by the journal's editors in a 2008 editorial, calling for greater responsibility in academia to end the practice of "marketing in the guise of science".
In another example, the Study of Neurontin: Titrate to Efficacy, Profile of Safety (STEPS) trial performed by Parke-Davis to evaluate the anticonvulsant Neurontin may have been a seeding trial. Detailed documents were released due to litigation against Parke-Davis and reviewed by several researchers in a 2011 "Annals of Internal Medicine" article. The STEPS trial was presented as a phase IV clinical trial with the stated objective to "study efficacy, safety, tolerability, and quality of life among gabapentin users", however the trial was actually completely uncontrolled and unblinded and the scientific validity of the trial was considered dubious by independent external sources. Documents also revealed that the trial recruited 772 physician investigators, many with very limited research experience, provided inadequate training for investigators, and that company sales representatives were "directly involved in collecting and recording individual subject trial data".
In marketing.
In the marketing field, seeding is considered the process of allocating marketing to specific customers, or groups of customers, in order to stimulate the internal dynamics of the market, enhance the diffusion process and encourage faster adoption of the product throughout the entire population. In a marketing seeding program, a company offers some sort of promotion (free product, discounts, service trials, etc.) to a niche group of people with the intention that this would stimulate WOM. An early example of a seeding trial was during the development of Post-it notes, produced by 3M. In 1977, secretaries to senior management staff throughout the United States were sent packs of Post-its and invited to suggest possible uses for them. They soon found them to be extremely useful and became "brand champions" for the product, an early example of viral marketing. Companies that have used seeding trials include Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Hasbro, Google, Unilever, Pepsi, Coke, Ford, DreamWorks SKG, EMI, Sony, and Siemens.
Two of the main managerial decisions revolving around seeding focus on seeding of advertising in a multinational market and the process of seeding the product itself. Determining how many and which consumers within a particular social network should be seeded to maximize adoption is a challenging task for a firm.
Seeding Strategies (how to seed?).
In 2005, a team of marketing researchers, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres, found that, contrary to managerial intuition and common assumptions in marketing research, strategies that disperse marketing efforts are generally better strategies. These include 'support the weak', in which the firm focuses its marketing efforts on the remaining market potential, and 'uniform', in which the firm distributes the marketing efforts evenly among its regions. This conclusion is congruent with the work of Japanese business strategist Kenichi Ohmae, which suggests that the sprinkler business model is superior and recommended to companies wishing to start a seeding program.
Researchers Jeonghye Choi of Yonsei University, Sam Hui of Stern School of Business at New York University and David Bell of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, explored two imitation effects of the demand at an Internet retailer, geographic proximity and demographic similarity and concluded that firms can influence the space–time demand path through seeding. The researchers conceived a new seeding strategy called “Proximity-and-similarity-based strategy”, in which the firm seeds the new product by choosing new zip codes that are the most responsive while adjusting the impact of proximity and similarity effects over time, and compare it to the three strategies presented in Libai, Muller and Peres's research,“support the strong”, “support the weak” and “uniform”.  They argue that with time, the “proximity-and similarity-based strategy” performs best because the similarity effect begins to affect new and distant areas. Namely, serving many small pools of similar buyers demographically, who are geographically distant from one another, is crucial for an Internet retailer because then sales increase over time.
Yogesh Joshi of University of Maryland, David Reibsteinand and John Zhang of Wharton Business School found that when the question of optimal entry timing arises, firms shouldn’t necessarily enter a new market based on a strong leverage effect, a situation where a firm's presence in an existing market has a positive influence on product adoption in a new market. Also, a backlash effect shouldn’t prevent the firm from entering a new market, a situation where social influence on the existing market is negative. Researchers show that the optimal strategy is a trade-off between the three factors of leverage, backlash, and patienc.
Seeding Objectives.
One of the key questions surrounding seeding programs over the last decade has been whether or not it’s more effective for companies to seed via influencers or random people through customers networks.
Many authors and scholars addressed this issue. Malcolm gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point. He suggests that highly connected and rare people have the ability to shape the world. This handful of very unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. The notion that a small group of people can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.
From a more academic point of view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a research in the subject which is among the first to shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting opinion leaders creates more value than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the purchase process of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create social value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is willing to invest in discovering their influencers.
German researchers Oliver Hinz of Universität Darmstadt, Bernd Skiera of University of Frankfurt, and Christian Barrot and Jan U. Becker of Kühne Logistics University, argue that seeding strategies have strong influence on the success of viral marketing campaigns. The results propose that seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. Well-connected people also actively use their greater reach but do not have more influence on their peers than do less connected people.
On the other side of the debate, some argue that influencers have no such effect and therefore companies shouldn’t target their seeding efforts on a specific group of people. Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds examined the phenomenon through a computer network simulation under the assumption that influential people are more difficult to influence, therefore social hubs have a lower tendency to adopt new products. Their work suggests that highly connected individuals do not play a crucial role in influencing others and that a random individual is just as likely to start a trend as connected people.

Magdiel

Magdiel (), founded in 1924 in the "Yishuv" of Mandate Palestine, is one of the four original communities of Jewish agriculturalists that combined in 1964 to form Hod Hasharon, Israel.
Magdiel was established as a "moshava", starting on 4,000 dunams of land purchased near the Arab village of Biyar 'Adas. The initial population included Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and Lithuania, later joined by a group from the Netherlands. In 1964, four villages - Magdiel, Ramatayim, Hadar, and Ramat Hadar - merged to become Hod Hasharon.
The place "name is symbolic Meged El (= the oil of God)" and appears in the Tanach/Old Testament. Magdiel was the name of an Edomite clan (possibly the name of an eponymous chieftain) mentioned in Genesis 36:43. Its invocation of El may show that that deity was worshipped in Edom, along with Kaus and others.
Magdiel is the location of a Youth Aliyah boarding school of that name that took in young survivors of the Holocaust. Other schools there include a comprehensive secondary school and a technical vocational boarding school of the ORT educational network.

2002–03 Arsenal F.C. season

The 2002–03 season was Arsenal's eleventh season in the Premier League and 83rd consecutive season in the top division of English football. The club retained the FA Cup – the first team to do so since Tottenham Hotspur in 1982, but lost out in the Premier League to Manchester United, having started March with an eight-point lead. In the UEFA Champions League, defeat to Valencia in the second group stage meant Arsenal exited the competition at the same round for the second successive year.
Arsenal began the new campaign as league and cup double winners, and manager Arsène Wenger sought improvement in the Champions League, a competition the club failed in. The retirement of defender Tony Adams meant French midfielder Patrick Vieira was appointed as captain; Pascal Cygan was signed as a replacement in defence. Other recruitments included defensive midfielders Gilberto Silva and Kolo Touré, with goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Richard Wright departing to join Espanyol and Everton respectively.
In the league, a 4–1 win against Leeds United in September meant the club broke the record for scoring in consecutive games (47), and away league games without defeat (22). The club began 2003 in first position, but a draw to Aston Villa in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top. A further draw at Bolton Wanderers meant the league championship was, mathematically, out of Arsenal's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after meant the team finished in second position. Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup; a solitary goal scored by midfielder Robert Pirès was enough to beat Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup Final.
Background.
Arsenal began the 2001–02 season in good form and a win against Liverpool in December 2001 – having gone down to ten men in the first half, helped them move second in the table. A draw against Southampton on 2 February 2002 started a run of 13 consecutive league wins – a new record, beginning against Everton. Arsenal won the league away to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 8 May 2002; the winning goal was scored by Sylvain Wiltord in the second half. The result meant the team were unbeaten away from home all season, and in scoring four goals against Everton on the final day, became the first team to score in every league match they played. Arsenal completed the double, having beaten Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final.
Wenger hoped his team's success would begin an era of dominating English football for years to come, citing a "shift of power". He moreover aimed for significant improvement in the Champions League, a competition where the club failed to reach higher than the quarter-finals. Such was Arsenal's impressive form in late summer, Wenger commented that his team could go the entire season undefeated.
Arsenal's kit sponsorship with O2 came into action in the 2002–03 season, replacing SEGA Dreamcast.
Transfers.
Wenger appointed midfielder Patrick Vieira as captain after Tony Adams announced his retirement from football. Defender Lee Dixon left the club after 14 years, retiring at the age of 38. Arsenal did not spend big in the transfer market unlike their rivals and only made subtle additions to the squad: World Cup winner Gilberto Silva and defender Pascal Cygan. English duo Martin Keown and goalkeeper David Seaman extended their stay at the club for two and one more years respectively.
In the January transfer window, defender Matthew Upson was sold to Birmingham City and midfielder Steve Sidwell joined Reading on an undisclosed fee. Goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz signed a short-term contract with Arsenal, as cover for Seaman, Stuart Taylor and Rami Shaaban.
FA Community Shield.
As Premier League and FA Cup winners, Arsenal contested the 2002 FA Community Shield against league runners-up Liverpool. Gilberto Silva, making his debut for Arsenal in the second half as a substitute, scored the winning goal, in a match where the team missed numerous chances.
Premier League.
August–October.
Arsenal began the season with a 2–0 home victory against promoted Birmingham City; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top-flight record. A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point, having trailed 2–0 in the first half. Three days later, a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal to the top of the league table. Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having lost captain Vieira through a sending-off, a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position. A 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger, who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose: "We know we can win the league. We know we can be stronger. At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now." Striker Kanu scored a stoppage time winner against Bolton Wanderers to win their eleventh successive home game.
At Elland Road, Leeds United hosted Arsenal on 28 September 2002. Goals from Kolo Touré and Henry and a brace from Kanu ensured Arsenal eclipsed Nottingham Forest's record of 22 away league games without defeat and scored in 47 consecutive league matches, breaking Chesterfield Town's achievement. Wenger hailed the performance as "edging nearer to perfection", adding it evoked memories of the Ajax team in the 1970s: "We are playing great, 'Total Football'. Danger comes from everywhere." Leeds manager Terry Venables agreed: "Manchester United have been exceptional for 10 years – but I've not seen anything as good as that." Arsenal began October with a 3–1 win against Sunderland, breaking Manchester United's Premier League record of 30 matches unbeaten. They however suffered their first defeat of the season, against Everton; teenager Wayne Rooney scored from long range in the last minute of the match. Wenger used his post-match press conference to praise the striker: "At that age, Rooney is already a complete footballer. The guy can play. He's the best English under-20 I've seen since I came here 1996." In spite of dominating their next match against Blackburn Rovers – "27 goal attempts, 14 on target," Arsenal were beaten 2–1; the winning goal was scored by Dwight Yorke in the second half. It was the team's third consecutive defeat in all competitions, their worst run since November 2000, and moved league leaders Liverpool four points clear at the top of the table.
November–February.
A Steve Marlet own goal gave Arsenal a 1–0 win against Fulham, helping to end their run of four defeats on 3 November 2002. Another 1–0 win, this time against Newcastle United moved Arsenal one point behind leaders Liverpool. Vieira's performance in particular was plauded in "The Guardian" as a "demonstration of tackling, control, awareness and movement that was exceptional even by his standards." In the North London derby on 16 November 2002, Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotpsur 3–0 to go back at the top of the league table. The opening goal, scored by Henry was later voted the Goal of the Season by viewers of ITV's "The Premiership", having picked up the ball from Arsenal's side of the pitch and running past the opposition defence to shoot past goalkeeper Kasey Keller. At St Mary's Stadium, Arsenal lost 3–2 to Southampton; striker James Beattie scored twice against an Arsenal defence, who conceded three goals in total for the first time since May 2001. Defender Sol Campbell had been sent off in the match, and was suspended for a further game, against Manchester United. Arsenal ended the month with a 3–1 victory over visitors Aston Villa; midfielder Robert Pirès scoring for the second successive league match and Henry adding a further two goals.
Arsenal faced Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002; the home team had beaten title challengers Liverpool the previous weekend. Manchester United opened the scoring in the 21st minute – a poor clearance from Cygan allowed Juan Sebastián Verón to score. Arsenal goalkeeper Rami Shaaban was substituted before the start of the second half, having pulled a thigh muscle. He was replaced by Stuart Taylor, who was helpless to prevent Paul Scholes from adding a second goal, 15 minutes before the final whistle. A 1–1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur was followed by a win against Middlesbrough; a goal apiece from Campbell and Pirès meant Arsenal were top of the table on Christmas. On Boxing Day, Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Brom 2–1; in doing so, they extended their lead at the top to four points. Three days later, Arsenal's lead was increased to five points, having drawn with Liverpool.
In spite of conceding two late goals against Chelsea, Arsenal won by three goals on New Year's Day to maintain their lead. Two goals from Henry against Birmingham City took his total for the club to 100 goals in all competitions; Wenger declared the display – a 4–0 win, as his team's best since beating Leeds United in September. Henry scored a hat-trick for Arsenal against West Ham United on 19 January 2003 but the team drew at Liverpool in spite of a polished performance; Emile Heskey headered the ball into the net, scoring for the home team after 90 minutes. On 1 February 2003, Pirès scored a late goal against Fulham, extending Arsenal's lead to six points at the top. This was followed by a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United; manager Sir Bobby Robson after the game criticised referee Neale Barry for his decision to send off midfielder Laurent Robert and Dennis Bergkamp's role in the dismissal, suggesting he "wasn't trying to play the ball to anybody. He kicked the ball against Laurent – I've seen other players do that and I don't like it." Arsenal beat Manchester City 5–1 in their final trip to Maine Road on 22 February 2003. The first four goals, all scored before the half-hour, came at a time when " ordered the radio to be switched before they reached Old Trafford, presumably in ghastly silence."
March–May.
On 2 March 2003, Arsenal opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the table, winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result was enough for Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal retaining the lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced at the top of the table by Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.
An own goal scored by Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg's opener against Aston Villa was cancelled out and the match ended in a draw, albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference. Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: "We want to be a team who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. We are just concentrating on expressing our togetherness, our mental strength and our qualities. We have enough players who can win this game." Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arsenal overturned Manchester United's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team. The match ended 2–2; Campbell was sent off for Arsenal, having elbowed Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned the rest of the season, whereas Vieira limped off with an injury. Although the result helped Manchester United move back top, they had played one game more than Arsenal. Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough, but squandered a two-goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes. The result, "a big blow" for Arsenal's title hopes, meant the championship was now in Manchester United's favour.
With Manchester United beating Charlton Athletic 4–1 on 3 May 2003, Arsenal, a day later, needed a win against Leeds United to restore any hope of finishing top of the league. In a five-goal match, an 88th minute goal by Mark Viduka ensured Leeds United's survival in the top division, thus ensuring Manchester United regained the league championship. Wenger revoked suggestion that the league campaign was a "failure", arguing his team were consistent:
Arsenal won their final two matches of the league season, against Southampton – where Pirès and Jermaine Pennant both scored a hat-trick – and Sunderland, ending the season with 78 points.
FA Cup.
Arsenal entered the competition in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a 2–0 home win against Oxford United on 4 January 2003. Bergkamp scored his 100th goal for the club and an own goal by defender Scott McNiven ensured progression to the next round. Arsenal faced non-league side Farnborough Town but the match switched from Farnborough's ground at Cherrywood Road to Highbury due to concerns over safety. Farnborough as the home team began the match in disastrous fashion, conceding a goal scored by Campbell in the 19th minute, and going down to ten men after Christian Lee was sent off for a professional foul. Francis Jeffers scored twice before Rocky Baptiste added a consolation, beating Cygan for pace and despite having his first shot saved by goalkeeper Taylor, he managed to lift the ball over him and into the net. Lauren and Bergkamp each scored in the final 15 minutes to give Arsenal a 5–1 victory.
Arsenal's fifth round match was away to league rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford on 16 February 2003. After Giggs missed the chance to score past an open goal, midfielder Edu gave Arsenal the lead through a free kick which took a deflection off David Beckham's shoulder. Wiltord scored the second goal of the match in the 52nd minute, running onto a pass from Edu and side-footing the ball past goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Vieira said of the performance: "We knew when we lost here in the league that we had lost the battle in midfield. We had to put that right, and we did." In the sixth round, Arsenal were drawn at home to Chelsea in a repeat of the previous season's final. Chelsea defender John Terry put his team ahead with a header from a set piece before Arsenal responded through Jeffers and Henry. Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser for the visiting team meaning the match was replayed at Stamford Bridge. An own goal by Terry and a strike by Wiltord in the space of seven minutes during the replay gave Arsenal an early lead against Chelsea. Despite going down to ten men after Cygan was sent off and Terry scoring from a header, the away team scored a third goal through Lauren to ensure progression into the semi-finals. In the semi-final against Sheffield United on 13 April 2003 at Old Trafford, Ljungberg scored the winning goal to help Arsenal reach their third successive FA Cup final appearance. The match was remembered for Seaman, who on his 1,000th appearance in senior football produced a late save to deny Sheffield United from equalising.
In the 2003 FA Cup Final against Southampton, a goal from Pirès, scored in the first half was enough to ensure Arsenal won their ninth FA Cup, becoming the first team to retain the trophy in over 20 years. Wenger commented after the game that his team "got the trophy we wanted" while defender Martin Keown said the FA Cup win was "the best ever". Winning captain David Seaman felt the disappointment of losing out to Manchester United in the league spurred the team on.
League Cup.
Together, with the other clubs playing in European football, Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round, where they were drawn at home to Premier League club Sunderland. Although Arsenal went two goals ahead in the first half, Sunderland responded, scoring three times in 15 minutes. The result was Wenger's fifth defeat in six matches.
UEFA Champions League.
Group stage.
Arsenal were drawn in Group A, along with German club Borussia Dortmund, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and French side Auxerre. A deflected goal by Bergkamp and a counterattack, finished off by Ljungberg on his comeback from injury gave Arsenal the perfect start in the group stages, at home to Borussia Dortmund. At the Philips Stadion, Arsenal produced an impressive display against PSV, winning 4–0. It was their first win in European football away from home in 19 months and the match set a new club record, as Gilberto scored the fastest goal in the competition at 20.07 seconds. Gilberto Silva scored for the second successive matchday, against Auxerre to reach nine points, but goals from Olivier Kapo and Khalilou Fadiga in the return game inflicted Arsenal's first defeat in the Champions League. In spite of taking the lead against Borussia Dortmund on Matchday 5, Arsenal conceded two goals to lose 2–1. A fourth straight defeat represented the club's worst run in 19 years but with PSV beating Auxerre, Arsenal qualified for the second group stage with a game to spare – that match ending in a 0–0 draw against PSV.
Second group stage.
Henry scored his first hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; "It's wonderful to score a hat-trick but it's even more important that I did so in a game we've won." The result was followed with four consecutive draws – three at home against Roma, Valencia and Ajax. Arsenal only needed a draw to progress into the knockout stages, but lost 2–1 to Valencia at the Mestalla on 19 March 2003. Reflecting later on the Champions League campaign, Wenger commented that "we lost our qualification at home".
Player statistics.
Arsenal used a total of 30 players during the 2002–03 season and there were 17 different goalscorers. There were also two squad members who did not make a first-team appearance in the campaign. Henry featured in 55 matches, three of which he came on as a substitute.
The team scored a total of 112 goals in all competitions. The highest goalscorer was Henry, with 32 goals, followed by Pirès who scored 16 goals. Four Arsenal players were sent off during the season: Vieira, Cygan, Campbell (twice) and Touré.

A382 road

The A382 is a road in South West England, connecting Newton Abbot to the A38, then to Bovey Tracey and on through Moretonhampstead to the A30.
Route.
The road starts in Newton Abbot at the junction with the A381, continuing out through the town, past the connection to the A383 which links to the A38 southbound.
It continues past Stover School, Stover Country Park and the Newton Abbot branch of Trago Mills before arriving at the junction with the A38, known as Drumbridges. From the A38 roundabout, the road continues in a straight line for 2 km, known locally as the "Bovey Straight" across Bovey Heath, with Heathfield on the east and Great Plantation on the west towards Bovey Tracey.
The road used to go through the centre of Bovey Tracey, but since 1987 it has bypassed the town, following part of the route of the old Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway line, from where that line crossed the road near the former Bovey Tracey Pottery to just north of the junction with the B3387 road to Widecombe-in-the-Moor and Haytor. The former Bovey railway station was retained at the side of the road and is now a heritage centre.
The bypass continues on a northerly route west of the town until it joins the original winding road which follows the valley of the Wray Brook. It passes the former Hawkmoor County Sanatorium and the village of Lustleigh before arriving in the town of Moretonhampstead where the B3212 heads towards Postbridge and Princetown in one direction and towards Exeter in the other.
From here, the A382 continues north-west, through the small settlements of Easton and Sandypark, eventually arriving at Whiddon Down, where there is a bypass around the village, before the road joins up with the trunk A30 road.
Accidents and deaths.
The A382 saw five fatal accidents between 1999 and 2010, two resulting in the death of a car driver, and three in the death of a motorcyclist. The road carries warning signs specifically related to motorcycle accidents, indicating 13 accidents over 3 years between Bovey Tracey and Moretonhampstead.

Balthazar Martinot

Balthazar Martinot (1636–1714) was a French clockmaker, and valet de chambre of the queen and of the King.
His daughter Anne Martinot married the king's goldsmith Philippe Van Dievoet.
He was considered in his time to be one of the most famous clockmakers in Europe.
'He was born in Rouen, the son of Balthazar Martinot I (1610–1697), Gouverneur du Gros Horloge at Rouen. His brothers, Claude (1637-after 1697), Etienne (1639–1702) and Gilles (1658–1726) were also clockmakers of repute and in turn Martinot II sired Balthazar-Louis Martinot, who became Ecuyer, Valet de la Garde-Robe du Roi. Unlike his father, Balthazar Martinot worked in Paris from circa 1660, where he was established at rue Galande in 1683 and Quai des Orfèvres in 1697. He retired to Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1710, where he died a few years later. His talent aroused important patronage and gained great prestige. In 1665 he succeeded his father-in-law, Pierre Belon, as Valet de Chambre-Horloger Ordinaire de la Reine, Anne of Austria. He was later appointed Horloger Ordinaire du Conseil du Roi. Garde-Visiteur, 1678–79 and 1693-95. He was patronized by the most influential members of society including Louis XIV, the Grand Dauphin, the Ducs d’Aumont and de La Trémoille, the Prince de Rohan, the Marquis d’Argenson, the Comtesse de Polignac, the Cardinal de Gesvres, the Présidents du Harlay, de Lamoignon, de Maison and many others. He also sold several clocks to the King of Siam in 1685 and supplied a number to Constantinople. An inventory of 1700 revealed that he held the largest stock of clocks in Paris, while five years previously he had organized a significant lottery in association with his colleague, Nicholas Gribelin.
His clocks were not only of the very finest quality but were also housed in exceptionally beautiful cases; notably those made by Jean-Michel Ziegler and André-Charles Boulle. His works are now installed in some of the world’s finest collections including the Musée du Louvre, Musée de Cluny and Musée National des Techniques, Paris; the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Lyons; Musée de Saint-Pierre; Musée de Pau and Château de Champs; the Museum der Zeitmessung Beyer, Zurich; Musée d’Horlogerie de La Chaux-de-Fonds; the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon, Dresden; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio.'

Indigenous peoples of Sikkim

Indigenous people of Sikkim include the Lepchas and Bhutias in contrast to the dominant heterogeneous Nepali population of Sikkim.
History.
The Lepcha is the earliest ethnic group settled Sikkim. The Sikkim was named by Limboo/Subba.The believe they are the autochthones while others considered that they were settled by the thirteenth century, coming from the Assam hills before the arrival of the Tibetan Bhutias. The Bhutia who immigrated to Sikkim claimed descent from a common ancestor, a Khampa prince or chief named Khye-bum-sar, and were divided into fourteen main families. Relations between the Lepcha and Tibetan peoples began in the thirteenth century with the signing of a blood brotherhood by the Lepcha Chief Thekong Tek and the Tibetan Prince Khye Bumsa at Kabi Lungchok in north Sikkim. The Bhutias introduced Buddhism to the region.
In 1642, the Bhutia established a monarchy headed by the Chogyal (; divine king), and opened relations with Tibet. By the founding of the Bhutia monarchy, Tibetan sources considered Tibetans (Bhutia), Lepchas, and Limbus to be the "original races of the kingdom."
Around 1819, the Lepchas were still the most numerous population, comprising roughly half of all Sikkimese, followed by Bhutias (30%) and Limbus (20%); sources disagree on whether the Bhutias outnumbered the Limbu or vice-versa, but in any event, the Limbu frequently intermarried with the Lepcha. At this time there was apparently no appreciable Nepali population present.
Throughout the nineteenth century, further groups of Tibetans known as "Rui-chhung" ("little families") migrated to Sikkim under British rule. 
Between the 1890s and the early 1900s, the large scale immigration of Nepalis began, encouraged by colonial landlords in order to raise rents in otherwise densely forested Sikkim. Indigenous groups pressed the British Empire to stop such settlement on Lepcha and Bhutia lands, however by the turn of the century, the Nepalese population constituted a majority, and indigenous populations amalgamated into a composite Lepcha-Bhutia socio-ethnic group. Discrimination between the heterogeneous Nepalese and other groups became a pressing social issue, however the government of the Chogyal in its later years strove to treat all subjects equally as citizens, and allowed democratic changes to move forward. These democratic and demographic changes culminated in a plebiscite in 1974, resulting in union with India as a State. Since joining India, indigenous groups have expressed anxiety over losing land, resources and power to those they view as non-Sikkimese "far above in terms of political consciousness, resource position, education and manipulative qualities."
Indigenous cultures.
The indigenous Sikkimese show wide cultural variation. 
The Lepcha speak Lepcha and use Lepcha script. Both the Lepcha and Limbu scripts are descended from the Tibetan script. Traditionally, Lepcha men wear "gadas" and tie a "patang," a kind of weapon, on their waist and don a bamboo cap; women wear distinctive dresses and ornaments. Among Lepchas, there is a tradition of nuclear family structure and of monogamous marriage; though divorce is relatively rare, widowed persons customarily remarry.
Traditionally, the Lepcha practice a religion centered around shamans called mun, who officiate ceremonies and festivals, and bóngthíng, who are healers and are often female. The Lepcha converted to Buddhism in the eighteenth century, though their beliefs are largely syncretic.
Bhutias speak Sikkimese, which is also referred to as Dranjongke, written in the Tibetan script, proper. Men and women wear "bakhus", while for women only this is accompanied by a "hongu" (blouse) around which they tie a woolen cloth around their waist called "pangden" if they are married. On special occasions they wear a scarf called a "khada," which has become common feature in the Sikkimese society and culture even among the Nepalese of Sikkim. Historically, the Bhutia practiced polyandry before the nineteenth century; during the nineteenth century, wife-sharing among male siblings was also practiced, however neither tradition survives today. Marriage rituals are traditionally elaborate and festive, officiated by a village chief as opposed to a Buddhist lamas; late marriage and divorce are not uncommon practices among the Bhutia.
Most Lepcha, and Bhutia today practice local forms of Buddhism, incorporating aspects of Bön religion and animism, in contrast to the Hindu Nepalese majority. Followers of Buddhism in Sikkim are largely either Karmapa or Nyingma, though a small section of Bhutias claim to adhere to Bön in particular. Since the arrival of the Nepalese and Western missionaries, few Lepchas have converted to Christianity.
Contemporary issues.
Lepchas are suffering from a feeling of inferiority, some denying they are Lepchas, while Nepalis who seek to integrate them label Lepchas as Bhutias. The Lepcha language is hardly spoken except by older generations. The Lepcha reservation in Dzongu valley of north Sikkim is threatened by dam construction.

Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) is an elite, internationally recognized, independent ship classification society, founded in India in 1975. It is a Non-Profit organisation, Public undertaking and a member of the prestigious 13 member International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). It was inducted into IACS along with Croatian Register of Shipping (CRS) and Polish Register of Shipping (PRS).
Today, IRS acts on behalf of the Maritime Administration of the Indian government as the sole and supreme authority for final assignment of Load Lines in Indian flag vessels and also as the security organisation that determines compliance under the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) code for Indian flag ships and port facilities.
IRS provides professionally competent, completely independent and highly efficient third party technical inspection and certification services for all types of ships, marine craft and structures. These services have also been expanded to cover a range of offshore and industrial projects.
The services are designed to meet ISO 9001 specifications (the International Standard on Quality Management Systems), and thereby help achieve high levels of quality and reliability, while maintaining project schedules and integrity. Further, they are proven to be cost-effective and meet timelines efficiently.
History.
Indian Register of Shipping was founded in 1975 to act as a catalyst of self-regulation by Indian Shipping Industries and to serve as a forum for research and development.
Here are some important milestones in its history
Organization & Management.
IRS is a non-profit making organization. All funds generated from fees for classification services are used solely for the performance of such services. A surplus of receipts in any one year is used for the extension and improvement of the services, including research and development. It has a Committee of Management with representatives from the Ministry and from each industry segment that uses its services. IRS has 15 offices located all over India. It has overseas offices at China, Sri Lanka, Dubai, South Korea, Bangkok, Piraeus, Houston and UK
Services.
Statutory Services.
IRS carries out statutory design appraisal, surveys and certification work on behalf of Flag States, when so authorized by the governments of such states via the International Maritime Organization Conventions and Codes . The four major IMO conventions are:
Non-Classification Services.
Specification Services.
The experience and knowledge accumulated through classification work enables IRS to provide technical advisory and supervisory services for ship owners. IRS surveyors who are seconded in to the owners for such services operate independently. Though distinct from classification services these services are nonetheless in harmony with them. The aim of IRS is to provide independent technical support and impartial cost effective advice to owners. Owners get value for money, coupled with highest standards of quality during construction, conversion or refit. IRS specification services have been used extensively by various ship owners including national administrations, port authorities, oil companies etc. Specification services are provided for pre-contract as well as post-contract stages.
Pre-contract services include:
Post-contract services.
Design appraisal is done at the early stages to ensure that proposed arrangement conforms to the agreed specification. The design appraisal could cover model-testing program for power estimation, sea keeping and maneuvering.
Generally the following plans are verified for ensuring compliance with specification:
Supervision during all stages of construction.
At the shipyard, comprehensive supervision is provided during all stages of constructions including tests and trials. Owners are appraised at monthly or agreed intervals about progress, deviations, from specifications and other pertinent facts of owners interest. Visits are arranged to the sub-contractor's work sites to inspect major items of machinery and equipment to ensure compliance with specifications and agreed standards of workmanship.
Supervision during major modification and repair.
This includes a broad range of focus areas like:
Damage Surveys.
Damage surveys on hull, machinery, equipment and permanent fittings on classed or nonclassed ships are done at the request of ship owners or any other interested parties such as underwriters, and factual reports are issued to the parties.
This service includes survey of damage:

On and On (Agnes song)

"On and On" is a song by the Swedish singer Agnes and the first single from "Dance Love Pop". The song was released to radio stations and as a digital download in Sweden on August 11, 2008. The song is written by Anders Hansson and is released by Roxy Recordings.
Just like "Release Me" a French version of the song was recorded for the francophone market called "On se Donne". "On and On" was released in the UK in May, 2010. The song was re-released in the Netherlands on May 24, 2010 as the UK edit.
Background.
"On and On" was first heard at the Swedish televisionshow "Sommarkrysset" at TV4 August 16, 2008. It was the song that announced her comeback after leaving Sony Music and being signed to independent label Roxy Recordings, the song was released as a single the same week and after spending a massive 26 weeks on the Swedish Top 60 Singles Chart it was surely considered one of the smash-hits of Sweden the summer of 2008. Since its international release the song has been remade and remixed numerous times, the first remix was the Danish DK Radio Edit which was released as the second single in Denmark. Though it failed to chart, the original edit from the album managed to peak at 16 at the Danish Singles Chart. When to be released all over Europe another edit was made called the "Moonwalker Version". Also this edit managed to enter many charts all over the continent and in France a French version was recorded, "On se Donne".
After "I Need You Now" did not meet the expectations in the UK "On and On" was chosen as the third single. The UK edit was first heard on Friday March 26 on BBC Radio 1's Floorfillers with Scott Mills.
Critical reception.
Leanne Durr of "ClickLiverpool" called "On and On" too euro-pop and that it would fit as Sweden’s Eurovision entry, despight this he says that the song have one major good point, Agnes's voice, which is ""mature beyond its years"". She also said that ""if Agnes is looking for any credibility within the dance genre, she should steer clear of this euro-pop sound as it is nowhere near as edgy or as sleek as previous single Release Me.""
In contrast, Jessica Pinkett of "Daily Music Guide" stated that with "On and On" Agnes was ""back on top form"" after ""the disappointingly bland 'I Need You Now'"". She described On and On as ""a catchy, upbeat number which is made all the more anthemic by Agnes' belting diva vocals"" and suggested that it could become one of 2010's major summer dance hits.
A similar opinion was brought by "Entertainment-focus.com" who said that ""On and On is in a similar vein to Agnes’ previous singles. With Europop beats and dance rhythms the song is aimed squarely at the clubs. A better offering than I Need You Now, the song could catch on in the pre-Summer charts as people get ready for their holidays in the sun or nights out on the town. Agnes’ strong vocals sets the song aside from others in the same genre and we really hope she can find another smash-hit with this track." Though they say that "On and On" probably won't enter the top-ten chart, it is better than other dance pop, such as Cascada.
Music videos.
Since the song premiered for the first time in Sweden 2008, three music videos has been filmed.
Original Video.
The first one was produced for the Swedish and Dutch market and had premier on MSN Video one week ahead of the singles official release in Sweden. It was directed by Anders Rune, who also directed the video for Agnes first international single "Release Me". The video was the most shown music video on MSN Video ever. The video was recorded in a suburb to Stockholm during the summer of 2008.
International Edition.
When it was decided that "On and On" was to be released in numerous countries as the follow-up to major summer hit "Release Me" a new video was to be filmed. The video was shot in Göteborg, Sweden for two days on July 12 and July 13, 2009. The job was handed to STARK production with Swedish director Torbjörn Martin and producer Björn Fävremark. The musicvideo premiered on STARK's homepage on September 21, 2009. The video features Agnes alone in numerous different outfits and settings. Most of the video is computer-animated and shows Agnes dancing in front of a light-blue background while confetti or moving white lines surrounds her. Other scenes shows Agnes under water or in front of two giant spotlights.
UK Remake.
In January 2010 Agnes's official website confirmed that a third video was to be made for the UK market. Also this one was filmed in Göteborg and produced by ""STARK"". The video premiered on March 1, 2010 on AllAroundTheWorld's official YouTube-channel, though it was supposed to be released two weeks earlier. The delay has made AATW to postpone the single to late April/Early May following the album release on April 26.
The UK video is mostly a remake of the international edition, but with some major changes. The, in the second video, common white lines and light-blue background is missing, instead a new look is adopted with close-ups of Agnes in a pony-tail and another one dancing in front of a red screen.
Live performances.
"On and On" was the single that announced the comeback of Agnes, after two years of silence. Her first performance with "On and On" was at "Sommarkrysset" in the Swedish TV-channel TV4 on August 16, 2008. And it was also during the show that the comeback was officially announced. Other performances in Sweden are in popular kidsshows "Lilla Melodifestivalen" and "Bobster". She has also performed the song on numerous concerts all around Europe during the summer of 2009.
Before releasing the song in the UK, Agnes started doing promotion in May 2010, performing on the morning show "This Morning" on May 6 and later on Nightingales in Birmingham.

Chart performance and sales.
The single was released as a digital download and to Swedish radio on August 11 and entered the chart the same week on place 47. Six weeks later it advanced up to its peak position, 8, where it stayed four 4 weeks. On and on was never released as a physical single in Sweden, only as a digital download. Despite that fact, the single managed to sell in 10,000 copies which resulted in a Gold certification.
In January 2009 Roxy Recordings announced that Agnes would receive an international release in 35 countries all over the world. The first single to be broadcast out to the European market was "Release Me" in Denmark. But on February 10, "On and On" was released as the lead single in the Netherlands and later in Poland. It peaked at place fourteen on the Dutch single chart and at thirteen on the Polish single chart. In June "On and On" was released as the second single in Denmark where it entered the chart at thirty-two and peaked one week later at sixteen. In November the song was released in France as the follow-up to "Release Me".
In late October, "On and On" started to climb the charts in the francophone areas of Europe though it had not yet been released. This was only due to download sales from the album released earlier in 2009. It debuted at 27 in the Belgian-Wallonia Singles Chart and at 37 in the French Download Chart.
"On and On" was released in the United Kingdom with a different sound to the original track, and with a new video. However, due to little support from music TV and radio stations, the single became Agnes' lowest charting song in the UK, peaking at #82 on the Singles Chart; although it managed to score a Top 10 hit on the Dance Chart.

Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park

The Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, with an area of 1,605 square kilometers, is the largest national park in Burma (Myanmar). The park consists of the Patolon Reserved Forest and the adjoining Taungdwin Reserved Forest.
History.
The Patolon Forest Reserve was originally established on 21 July 1893 and was enlarged in 1917. The Taungdwin Reserved Forest was established effective 1 December 1893. In 1941, Taungdwin was made into a wildlife sanctuary by the British colonial government, and it was upgraded to a national park in 1984 by the Burmese government.
Etymology.
The National Park was named after a shrine to one of Buddha’s saintly disciples, Maha Kathapa (Maha Kassapa). This shrine dedicated to Alaungdaw Kathapa (literally, the embryo-Kathapa) is located inside the park boundaries. The shrine has a reclining figure called Kathapa and it is believed that his remains are kept under the shrine.
Topography.
The National Park includes the upper catchment basins of the Petpa, Patolon and Taungdwin rivers. The Petpa River is a tributary of the Patolon. The Patolon and Taungdwin rivers drain the eastern and western parts of the park, respectively. These rivers are north flowing in steep sided valleys separated from each other and from adjoining valleys to the west and east by long north-south ridges that rise to elevations from 2000 to over 4000 feet. These parallel ridges are a series of cuestas, characterized by fairly steep escarpments on the eastern face with a moderate slope on the west. 
The prominent ridge known as Mahudaung is the easternmost ridge in the park, and it forms the watershed between the broad settled valley of the Chindwin and the Patolon and the Petpa drainages to the west. Further west beyond the Taungdwin River, another high ridge, the Ponnyadaung, reaches a height of 4263 feet at Hlaingma Taung, and forms the western boundary of the park.
In the rainy season, numerous small waterfalls appear above the valleys, especially along the upper reaches of the Patolon and Petpa rivers. In the dry season, March through May, many of the smaller streams dry up. There are a number of perennial springs that keep the major rivers flowing.
Flora.
Sagaing Division lies at the north of Myanmar's temperate dry zone. The Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park comprises two biomes : Temperate broadleaf and mixed and temperate coniferous forests.
The forests which exist in the national park are specialized as - 
Fauna.
The park is home to large populations of wild elephants and other rare wildlife species. The most notable inhabitants are the large herds of Asian Elephants.
Other inhabitants include Thamin, Wild Pig, Gaur, Sambar, Banteng, Muntjak, Clouded Leopard, civets, Jungle Cats, Himalayan Brown Bear, Sun Bear, Oriental giant squirrel, Indian Giant Squirrel, Hog Badger, monitor lizards, macaques, Barking Deer and many types of birds. The elephants roam in groups of up to a dozen; 150-200 live in the area. 
Wildlife monitoring by park rangers has shown the park to have a rich abundance of wildlife. Camera traps, visual sightings and animal tracks have revealed the existence of leopard, sun bear, banteng, gaur, wild dog and barking deer populations in the park. Villagers recently reported seeing a tiger in the park, which, if confirmed, would be the first sighting in over two decades when it was assumed that they had been hunted out to supply the illegal wildlife trade.
There also exists a wide variety of wild birds and fowls, including owls, hornbills, pheasants, parrots and eagles.
Conservation Work.
The Ministry of Forestry, the National Commission of Environmental Affairs, a local NGO - FREDA (Forest Resource and Environmental Development and Conservation Association) and Wildlife Alliance carry out much of the conservation work. The Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park faced many daunting challenges to combat poaching, especially of the local deer and wild game population. The park is also one of the last safe havens of Myanmar's wild orchids, and thus, orchid hunters are also sometimes sighted.
The Alaungdaw Kathapa National Parki has a significant number of armed forest rangers, from the Ministry of Forestry. They have recently been able to turn the tide against poachers and the orchid hunters, although growing demand from China is putting greater burden on them.
Public.
The Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park is one of the most famous parks with the Burmese populace. It is more of a religious site than a national park, drawing at least 30,000 pilgrims a year paying homage to wild pigs and tigers. The area itself is extremely isolated, elephants being the only means of transport to enter the park and forest.
A small group of monks care for the shrine of Alaungdaw Kathapa, and along with authorities from the Forestry Department and Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division coordinate to educate visitors about conservation and wildlife.

Viola Wills

Viola Wills (December 30, 1939—May 6, 2009) was an American pop singer, best known for the 1979 UK Singles Chart #8 and U.S. Hot Dance Club Play #52 hit, "Gonna Get Along Without You Now". Other hits included further covers of the songs, "Both Sides Now" (#35 UK) (1986), and "If You Could Read My Mind" (#2 U.S. Hot Dance Club Play) (1980).
Early career.
Born Viola Mae Wilkerson in the Watts district of South Los Angeles, Wills was already married from her teens and was the mother of six children before the age of 21 when, in 1965, she was discovered by Barry White who signed her to Bronco Records and renamed her with the shorter stage surname of Wills. She started her career at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and, over the following years, in addition to working with White, also performed with Joe Cocker, Smokey Robinson and many other established recording artists of the era. It was while working in London as one of Cocker's backing vocalists (dubbed the "Sanctified Sisters") that she worked on and released her solo debut album of self-penned originals titled "Soft Centres", backed by Cocker's session players.
Later career.
Wills' first major break into the mainstream came in 1979 with her cover version of "Gonna Get Along Without You Now" (the song's release date was May 14, 1979) which started a string of dance hits. All three of the songs would land Wills in the "Guinness Book of Records". In 1982 her cover of "Stormy Weather" hit #4 in the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. Also, by this time she had divorced her first husband and, around 1982, married Robert Ashmun with whom, in 1983, she formed the record label RVA (Robert Viola Ashmun) and used it to release a number of songs, including "Wall", "Space" and "If These Walls Could Speak".
A demand for 1980s music brought Wills back to Europe. Some of the UK venues Wills has appeared on, or at, were "Top of The Pops" (October 11, 1979), "Pebble Mill", "Soul Train" (October 30, 1971 1, Episode 5 where she performed the song "Sweetback"), "Later... with Jools Holland", Ronnie Scott's, "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" (February 17, 2003 12, Episode 7) and a residency at Joogleberry Playhouse in Brighton.
Although Wills did not have a mainstream U.S. hit, she was popular among the nation's gay community and her singles are popular in dance clubs and a number of her recordings are found in various compilations, including "No News Is News", "A House Is Not a Home", "If You Could Read My Mind", "Up On The Roof", "Somebody's Eyes", "Love Pains", "Let's Love Now", "Take One Step Forward" (by Wills and Noel McCalla), and "Always Something There to Remind Me". Her vocals also featured on My Friend Sam's 1992 house track "It's My Pleasure" which later appeared on the seminal "" album.
Wills died of cancer on May 6, 2009 in Phoenix, Arizona. Her funeral was held at the Macedonia Abbey Baptist Church in Los Angeles on May 15, 2009.

Yatsugatake Mountains

The are a volcanic mountain range on the border between Nagano Prefecture and Yamanashi Prefecture on the island of Honshū in Japan.
Description.
The mountain range consists of two volcanic groups, Northern Yatsugatake Volcanic Group and Southern Yatsugatake Volcanic Group. The two volcanic groups of Yatsugatake, North and South, have different characteristics. The South Yatugatake mountains are steep and are more alpine in nature. The mountains belonging to North Yatsugatake mountains are gentler and lower than the South Yatsugatake mountains.
The southern group ranges from the Natsuzawa Pass to the end of the mountain range. The northern range includes Mount Kitayoko to the other end of the range. Mount Tateshina is also included.
These mountains form a major part of the Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen Quasi-National Park.
Geology.
These mountains consist of older eroded complex volcanoes, which were made by repeated volcanic eruptions over many thousands years. The last eruption was estimated from 600 to 800 years ago at Mount Kitayoko of North Yatsugatake Mountains. This is the only remaining active volcano. The other volcanoes are extinct.
The volcanoes consist mostly of pyroxene andesite. Yatsugatake also lies nearby to the Fossa Magna.
Local legend.
According to legend, Yatsugatake was once higher than Mount Fuji, but Konohana-Sakuyahime, the goddess of Mount Fuji, tore it down out of jealousy,leaving the collection of peaks we have today. Paul Hunt muses that this might not be far from the truth considering that Yatsugatake is older than Fuji and as Fuji rose in prominence Yatsugatake wore away.
Ecology.
Deciduous forests reach up 800-1700m above sea level. Above this zone is the subalpine zone reaching up to 2500m. Siberian dwarf pine inhabits this subalpine zone. On one part of Mount Nishi under 1700m grows a rare form of spruce, Picea koyamae. Rock Ptarmigan ("Lagopus muta") are also native to these mountains, but are under threat due to loss of the Siberian dwarf pine habitat and also due to expansion of the range of the red fox. Humans have enabled the expansion of the red fox by leaving trash behind in the mountains. Also growing in the subalpine zone are Abies veitchii and Abies mariesii.

FK Kvik

Fotballklubben Kvik (FK Kvik) is a Norwegian association football club from Trondheim. To avoid confusion with the other Norwegian football club named Kvik, which was also known as FK Kvik until 1997, FK Kvik is sometimes referred to as Kvik Trondheim. The club was founded in 1900, and is the oldest football club in Trondheim.
History.
Kvik was founded in 1900. For its first fifteen years of existence, Kvik dominated regional football. In 1915, the team reached the semifinal in the Norwegian Football Cup, where it lost 0-3 to Kvik Halden. FK Kvik considers the 1920s to be its golden age. During the 1920s, Kvik played three cup quarter finals, in 1922, 1923, and 1925.
In 1947-48, Kvik participated in the first post-war season of the League of Norway (a predecessor of the Norwegian Premier League). After this season, the league system was changed, and the number of teams at the highest level of Norwegian football decreased from 74 to 16. In this new league system, Kvik played two seasons in the Main League, 1951-52 and 1954-55.
After the 1955-56 season, Kvik found itself playing at the second highest level of Norwegian football. At this time, it competed with several other teams, including Rosenborg BK, over the status of the best football team in Trondheim. Bjørn Hansen, who would later become a professional football manager, played for Kvik during this era.
In 1968, Kvik was relegated to the third highest level. After this, Kvik has not reached its former heights. It currently plays in the Norwegian Third Division, the fourth highest level of Norwegian football.
Kvik had a women's football team from 1979 to 1998. Since 1981, Kvik has hosted an indoor football cup, Kvik Cup.
In the first round of the 2006 Norwegian Cup, Kvik played against its former rivals Rosenborg BK, by then one of the best football clubs in Norway. Rosenborg won the match 8-1. After the match, Rosenborg player Per Ciljan Skjelbred commented that Kvik "kept at it like heroes".

Durga Malla

Major Durga Malla was the first Gorkha soldier of Nepalese origin in Indian National Army (INA) to sacrifice his life for the cause of the nation.
Major Malla was born in July 1913 at Doiwala near Dehradun. He was the eldest son of Nb Sub Ganga Malla. In 1930, when Mahatma Gandhi was leading the countrymen for Independence through Dandi March, Malla was in class nine. Though he was young, he caught everybody’s attention by his outbursts in public against the Britishers. In 1931, when he was 18 years-old, he moved to Dharamsala and got enrolled in 2/1 Gorkha Rifles. His patriotism brought him close to INA.
In 1942, Malla joined INA. His devotion to duty and valour coupled with other skills elevated him to the rank of a Major in INA and was asked to work in the intelligence wing of the INA. When he was collecting information about the enemy camps, he was caught in action at Kohima on March 27, 1944. He was given death sentence by the Court of Trial at Red Fort, New Delhi. However, before the death sentence was finally executed, the authorities tried to coerce Major Durga Malla into confessing sedition. His wife was brought at the prison cell but Malla did not succumb to the pressure. “The sacrifice I am offering shall not go in vain. India will be free. I am confident. This is only a matter of time, Sharda! Don’t worry, crores of Hindustanis are with you”, said Malla to his wife. Those were his last words to his wife.
Malla was married to Sharda Malla of Shyam Nagar, Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh in 1941. Only three days after marriage, Malla was recalled at his headquarters and was directed to go abroad. He could meet his wife only before his hanging at Delhi District Jail. In 1944, Major Durga Malla was sent to the gallows.
To honour this great hero, a statue was unveiled at the Parliament House Complex by Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh in 2004. Vice President Mr Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Lok Sabha Speaker Mr Som Nath Chatterjee and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. The statue was presented to Parliament by the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh, the national organisation of Gorkhas.

Coffee production in India

Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of Karnataka accounting 53% followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. Indian coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct sunlight anywhere in the world. There are approximately 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% of them are small growers. As of 2009, the production of coffee in India was only 4.5% of the total production in the world. Almost 80% of the country's coffee production is exported. Of that which is exported, 70% is bound for Germany, Russian federation, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, United States, Japan, Greece, Netherlands and France, and Italy accounts for 29% of the exports. Most of the export is shipped through the Suez Canal.
Coffee is grown in three regions of India with Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu forming the traditional coffee growing region of South India, followed by the new areas developed in the non-traditional areas of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in the eastern coast of the country and with a third region comprising the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh of Northeastern India, popularly known as “Seven Sister States of India".
Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as “Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavour is defined as: "The best Indian coffee reaches the flavour characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst it is simply bland and uninspiring”. The two well known varieties of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. The first variety that was introduced in the Baba Budan Giri hill ranges of Karnataka in the 17th century was marketed over the years under the brand names of Kent and S.795.
History.
Coffee growing has a long history that is attributed first to Ethiopia and then to Arabia, mostly to Yemen. However, the earliest history is traced to 875 AD according to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The original source is also traced to Abyssinia from where it was brought to Arabia in the 15th century. The Indian context started with an Indian Muslim saint, Baba Budan, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, smuggled seven coffee beans (by tying it around his waist) from Yemen to Mysore in India and planted them on the Chandragiri Hills (), now named after the saint as Baba Budan Giri (‘Giri’ means “hill”) in Chikkamagaluru district. It was considered an illegal act to take out green coffee seed out of Arabia. As number seven is a sacrosanct number in Islamic religion, the saint’s act of carrying seven coffee beans was considered a religious act. This was the beginning of coffee industry in India, and in particular, in the then state of Mysore, now part of the Karnataka State. This was an achievement of considerable bravery of Baba Budan considering the fact that Arabs had exercised strict control over its export to other countries by not permitting coffee beans to be exported in any form other than as in a roasted or boiled form to prevent germination.
Systematic cultivation soon followed Baba Budan’s first planting of the seeds, in 1670, mostly by private owners and the first plantation was established in 1840 around Baba Budan Giri and its surrounding hills in Karnataka. It spread to other areas of Wynad (now part of Kerala), the Shevaroys and Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu. With British colonial presence taking strong roots in India in the mid 19th century, coffee plantations flourished for export. The culture of coffee thus spread to South India rapidly.
Initially, Arabica was popular. However, as result of serious infestation caused to this variety by coffee rust, an alternative robust variety of coffee, appropriately named as robusta and another hybrid between liberica and Arabica, a rust-tolerant hybrid variety of Arabica tree became popular. This is the most common variety of coffee that is grown in the country with Karnataka alone accounting for 70% of production of this variety.
In 1942, the government decided to regulate the export of coffee and protect the small and marginal farmers by passing the Coffee VII Act of 1942, under which the Coffee Board of India got established, operated by the Ministry of Commerceand Industry. The government dramatically increased their control of coffee exports in India and pooled the coffees of its growers. In doing so, they reduced the incentives for farmers to produce high-quality coffee, so quality became stagnant.
Over the last 50 years, coffee production in India has grown by over 15 percent. From 1991, economic liberalisation took place in India, and the industry took full advantage of this and cheaper labour costs of production. In 1993, a monumental Internal Sales Quota (ISQ) made the first step in liberalising the coffee industry by entitling coffee farmers to sell 30% of their production within India. This was further amended in 1994 when the Free Sale Quota (FSQ) permitted large and small scale growers to sell between 70% and 100% of their coffee either domestically or internationally. A final amendment in September 1996 saw the liberalisation of coffee for all growers in the country and a freedom to sell their produce wherever they wished.
Production.
Background.
Like in Ceylon, coffee production in India declined rapidly from the 1870s and was massively outgrown by the emerging tea industry. The devastating coffee rust affected the output of coffee to the point that the costs of production saw coffee plantations in many parts replaced with tea plantations. However, the coffee industry was not as affected by this disease as in Ceylon, and although overshadowed in scale by the tea industry, India was still one of the strongholds of coffee production in the British Empire along with British Guiana. In the period 1910–12, the area under coffee plantation was reported to be in the southern states, and was mostly exported to England.
In the 1940s, Indian filter coffee, a sweet milky coffee made from dark roasted coffee beans (70%–80%) and chicory (20%–30%) became a commercial success. It was especially popular in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The most commonly used coffee beans are Arabica and Robusta grown in the hills of Karnataka (Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Hassan), Kerala (Malabar region) and Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris District, Yercaud and Kodaikanal).
Coffee production in India grew rapidly in the 1970s, increasing from 68,948 tonnes in 1971–72 to 120,000 tonnes in 1979–80 and grew by 4.6 percent in the 1980s. It grew by more than 30 percent in the 1990s, rivalled only by Uganda in the growth of production. By 2007, organic coffee was grown in about with an estimated production of about 1700 tonnes. According to the 2008 statistics published by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the area of coffee green harvested in India was , with yield estimates of 7,660 hectogram/ha, forming a total production estimate of 262,000 tonnes.
There are approximately 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% of them are small growers. Over 90 percent of them are small farms consisting of or fewer. According to published statistics for 2001–2002, the total area under coffee in India was with small holdings of 175,475 accounting for 71.2%. The area under large holding of more than was (only 9.1% of all holdings) only under 167 holdings. The area under less than holdings was (33% of the total area) among 138,209 holders.
The most important areas of production are in the southern Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu which accounted for over 92 percent of India's coffee production in the 2005–2006 growing season. In this same season, India exported over of coffee, with over 25 percent destined for Italy. Traditionally, India has been a noted producer of "Arabica" coffee but in the last decade "robusta" beans are growing substantially due to high yields, which now account for over 60 percent of coffee produced in India. The domestic consumption of coffee increased from 50,000 tonnes in 1995 to 94,400 tonnes in 2008.
According to the statistics provided by the Coffee Board of India, the estimated production of Robusta and Arabica coffee for the "Post Monsoon Estimation 2009–10" and "Post Blossom Estimation 2010–11" in different states accounted for a total of 308,000 tonnes and 289,600 tonnes, respectively. As of 2010, between 70% and 80% of Indian grown coffee is exported overseas.
Growing conditions.
All coffees grown in India are grown in shade and commonly with two tiers of shade. Often inter-cropped with spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, the coffees gain aromatics from the inter-cropping, storage, and handling functions. Growing altitudes range between to above sea level for "Arabica" (premier coffee), and to for "Robusta" (though of lower quality, it is robust to environment conditions). Ideally, both "Arabica" and "Robusta" are planted in well drained soil conditions that favour rich organic matter that is slightly acidic (pH 6.0–6.5). However, India's coffees tend to be moderately acidic which can lead to either a balanced and sweet taste, or a listless and inert one. Slopes of "Arabica" tend to be gentle to moderate, while "Robusta" slopes are gentle to fairly level.
Blooming is the time when coffee plants bloom with white flowers which last for about 3–4 days (termed "evanescent" period) before they mature into seeds. When coffee plantations are in full bloom it is a delightful sight to watch. The time period between blooming and maturing of the fruit varies appreciably with the variety and the climate; for the "Arabica", it is about seven months, and for the "Robusta", about nine months. The fruit is gathered by hand when it is fully ripe and red-purple in colour.
Ideal climatic conditions to grow coffee are related to temperature and rainfall; temperatures in the range of and with rainfall incidence in the range of followed by a dry spell of 2–3 months suit the "Arabica" variety. Cold temperatures closer to freezing conditions are not suitable to grow coffee. Where the rainfall is less than , providing irrigation facilities is essential. In the tropical region of the south Indian hills, these conditions prevail leading to coffee plantations flourishing in large numbers. Relative humidity for "Arabica" ranges 70–80% while for "Robusta" it ranges 80–90%.
The common disease to which the coffee plants are subjected to in India is on account of fungus growth. This fungus is called the "Hemileia vastatrix," an endophytous that grows within the matter of the leaf; effective cure has not been discovered to eliminate this. The second type of disease is known as the coffee rot, which has caused severe damages during the rainy season, particularly to plantations in Karnataka. "Pellicularia kole-rota" is the name given to this rot or rust, which turns the leaves into black colour due to the coverage by a slimy gelatinous film. This causes the coffee leaves and the cluster of coffee berries to drop off to the ground. Snakes such as cobras can also cause a nuisance to coffee plantations in India.
Processing.
Processing of coffee in India is accomplished using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fomented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.
Varieties.
The four main botanical cultivars of India's coffee include Kent, S.795, Cauvery, and Selection 9. In the 1920s, the earliest variety of Arabica grown in India was named Kent(s) after the Englishman L.P. Kent, a planter of the Doddengudda Estate in Mysore. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795, known for its balanced cup and subtle flavour notes of mocca. Released during the 1940s, it is a cross between the Kents and S.288 varieties. Cauvery, commonly known as Catimor, is a derivative of a cross between Caturra with Hybrido-de-Timor, while the award-winning Selection 9 is a derivative from the crossing between Tafarikela and Hybrido-de-Timor. The dwarf and semi-dwarf hybrids of San Ramon and Caturra were developed to meet the demands for high density plantings. The Devamachy hybrid ("C. arabica" and "C. canephora") was first discovered around 1930 in India.
The Indian Coffee Association's weekly auction includes such varieties as Arabica Cherry, Robusta Cherry, Arabica Plantation, and Robusta Parchment.
Regional logos and brands include: Anamalais, Araku valley, Bababudangiris, Biligiris, Brahmaputra, Chikmagalur, Coorg, Manjarabad, Nilgiris, Pulneys, Sheveroys, Travancore, and Wayanad. There are also several specialty brands such as Monsooned Malabar AA, Mysore Nuggets Extra Bold, and Robusta Kaapi Royale.
Organic coffee is produced without synthetic agro-chemicals and plant protection methods. A certification is essential by the accrediting agency for such coffee to market it (popular forms are of regular, decaffeinated, flavoured and instant coffee variety) as such since they are popular in Europe, United States and Japan. The Indian terrain and climatic conditions provide the advantages required for the growth of such coffee in deep and fertile forest soils under the two tier mixed shade using cattle manure, composting and manual weeding coupled with the horticultural operations practised in its various coffee plantations; small holdings is another advantage for such a variety of coffee. In spite of all these advantages, the certified organic coffee holdings in India, as of 2008, (there are 20 accredited certification agencies in India) was only in an area of with production estimated at 1700 tonnes. In order to promote growth of such coffee, the Coffee Board, based on field experiments, surveys and case studies has evolved many packages for adoption, supplemented with information guidelines and technical documents.
Research and development.
Coffee research and development efforts are well organised in India through its Coffee Research Institute, which is considered the premier research station in South East Asia. It is under the control of the Coffee Board of India, an autonomous body, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, which was set up under an Act of the Parliament with the objective of promoting “research, development, extension, quality up gradation, market information, and the domestic and external promotion of Indian coffee.” It was established near Balehonnur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, in the heartland of coffee plantations. Prior to establishing this institute, a temporary research unit was established in 1915 at Koppa primarily to evolve solutions to crop infestation by leaf diseases. This was followed by the field research station established by the then Government of Mysore, titled "Mysore Coffee Experimental Station," in 1925. This was handed over to the Coffee Board which was formed in 1942, and regular research started at this station from 1944. Dr L. C. Coleman is credited as the founder of coffee research in India. The Coffee Board of India is an autonomous body, functioning under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The Board serves as a friend, philosopher and guide of the coffee industry in India. Set up under an Act of the Parliament of India in the year 1942, the Board focuses on research, development, extension, quality up gradation, market information, and the domestic and external promotion of Indian coffee.
The research activities covered by the Institute constitute research in seven disciplines such as Agronomy, Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Botany, Entomology/Nematology, Plant Physiology, Biotechnology and Post Harvest Technology with the basic aim of increasing productivity and quality of coffee grown in India. The institute has 60 scientific and technical personnel involved in research activities. The institute has a well established farm land of for carrying out crop research, out of which are dedicated to coffee research ( of arabica and of robusta), are used for growing CXR, are apportioned for nurseries, roads and buildings, and the balance area of is a reserve area for future expansion. The research farm has a well established network of check dams that provides a regulated water source to the plantations which offer a wide range of shade tree species under which coffee is grown, and germplasm and exotic material from all the coffee growing countries including Ethiopia which is known as the home land of Arabica. In addition, crop diversification with crops such as pepper and areca are also part of income generating programmes of the institute.
Part of the institute includes a research laboratory to carry out research in identified disciplines, as well as a stocked library with books and periodicals, not only on coffee but also on other crops. Training of personnel is an important activity of the institute. The training unit of the institute conducts regular training programs for estate managers and supervisory personnel of the coffee plantations and also for the extension officers of the Coffee Board. Recognised by UNDP and USDA, the training unit of the institute is providing training to foreign nationals on coffee cultivation in which personnel from Ethiopia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Nestle Singapore have been trained.
In addition, a Plant Tissue Culture & Biotechnology division, established in Mysore, is carrying out exclusive research in bio-technology and molecular biology to supplement/complement the conventional breeding programs in developing high yielding, pest and disease resistant varieties. The Coffee Board of India maintains a Quality Control Division in its head office in Bangalore which plays an active role in collaborating with other research disciplines in upgrading the “quality of coffee in the cup.”
Regional research stations.
To cover research specific to each coffee growing region covering different agro-climatic conditions, the following five research stations are fully functional under the overall control of the Central Coffee Research Institute.
Popularity.
The India Coffee House chain was first started by the Coffee Board in early 1940s, during British rule. In the mid-1950s, the Board closed down the Coffee Houses, due to a policy change. However, the discharged employees then took over the branches, under the leadership of the then communist leader A. K. Gopalan and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. The first Indian Coffee Workers Co-Operative Society was established in Bangalore on 19 August 1957. The first Indian Coffee House was opened in New Delhi on 27 October 1957. Gradually, the Indian Coffee House chain expanded across the country, with branches in Pondicherry, Thrissur, Lucknow, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Mumbai, Kolkata, Tellicherry and Pune by the end of 1958. These coffee houses in the country are run by 13 cooperative societies, which are governed by managing committees elected from the employees. A federation of the co-operative societies is the national umbrella organisation to lead these societies.
However, now Coffee bars have gained in popularity with other chains such as Barista; Café Coffee Day is the country's largest coffee bar chain. In the Indian home, coffee consumption is greater in south India than elsewhere.
Indian coffee has a good reputation in Europe for its less acidic and sweetness of character and thus widely used in Espresso Coffee, though Americans prefer African and South American coffee, which is a more acidic and brighter variety.
Selection 9 was the winner of the Fine Cup Award for best Arabica at the 2002 Flavour of India – Cupping Competition. In 2004, Indian Coffee with the brand name "Tata Coffee" had the distinction of winning three gold medals at the Grand Cus De Café Competition held in Paris.
Coffee Board of India.
The Coffee Board of India is an organisation managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the government of India to promote coffee production in India. The board was set up by an act of parliament in 1942. Until 1995 the Coffee Board marketed the coffee of many growers from a pooled supply, but after that time coffee marketing became a private-sector activity due to the economic liberalisation in India.
The Coffee Board's traditional duties include the promotion, sale and consumption of coffee in India and abroad; conducting coffee research; financial assistance to establish small coffee growers; safeguarding working conditions for labourers, and managing the surplus pool of unsold coffee.

Lacunarity

[[File:Rotational Invariance Example.gif|thumb|right| Figure 1. Basic fractal patterns increasing in lacunarity from left to right.
Lacunarity, from the Latin lacuna meaning "gap" or "lake", is a specialized term in geometry referring to a measure of how patterns, especially fractals, fill space, where patterns having more or larger gaps generally have higher lacunarity. Beyond being an intuitive measure of gappiness, lacunarity can quantify additional features of patterns such as "rotational invariance" and more generally, heterogeneity. This is illustrated in Figure 1 showing three fractal patterns. When rotated 90°, the first two fairly homogeneous patterns do not appear to change, but the third more heterogeneous figure does change and has correspondingly higher lacunarity. The earliest reference to the term in geometry is usually attributed to Mandelbrot, who, in 1983 or perhaps as early as 1977, introduced it as, in essence, an adjunct to fractal analysis. Lacunarity analysis is now used to characterize patterns in a wide variety of fields and has application in multifractal analysis in particular (See "Applications").
Measuring Lacunarity.
In many patterns or data sets, lacunarity is not readily perceivable or quantifiable, so computer-aided methods have been developed to calculate it. As a measurable quantity, lacunarity is often denoted in scientific literature by the Greek letters formula_1 or formula_2 but it is important to note that there is no single standard and several different methods exist to assess and interpret lacunarity.
Box Counting Lacunarity.
[[File:Fixedstack.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2a. Boxes laid over an image as a fixed grid.
One well-known method of determining lacunarity for patterns extracted from digital images uses box counting, the same essential algorithm typically used for some types of fractal analysis. Similar to looking at a slide through a microscope with changing levels of magnification, box counting algorithms look at a digital image from many levels of resolution to examine how certain features change with the size of the element used to inspect the image. Basically, the arrangement of pixels is measured using traditionally square (i.e., box-shaped) elements from an arbitrary set of formula_3 sizes, conventionally denoted formula_4s. For each formula_4, the box is placed successively over the entire image, and each time it is laid down, the number of pixels that fall within the box is recorded. In standard box counting, the box for each formula_4 in formula_3 is placed as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image so that the box does not overlap itself, but in sliding box algorithms the box is slid over the image so that it overlaps itself and the "Sliding Box Lacunarity" or SLac is calculated. Figure 2 illustrates both types of box counting.
Calculations from Box Counting.
The data gathered for each formula_4 are manipulated to calculate lacunarity. One measure, denoted here as formula_9, is found from the coefficient of variation (formula_10), calculated as the standard deviation (formula_11) divided by the mean (formula_12), for pixels per box. Because the way an image is sampled will depend on the arbitrary starting location, for any image sampled at any formula_4 there will be some number (formula_14) of possible orientations, each denoted here by formula_15, that the data can be gathered over, which can have varying effects on the measured distribution of pixels. Equation shows the basic method of calculating formula_16:
Probability Distributions.
Alternatively, some methods sort the numbers of pixels counted into a probability distribution having formula_17 bins, and use the bin sizes (masses, formula_18) and their corresponding probabilities (formula_19) to calculate formula_16 according to Equations through : 
Interpreting formula_2.
Lacunarity based on formula_16 has been assessed in several ways including by using the variation in or the average value of formula_16 for each formula_4 (see Equation ) and by using the variation in or average over all grids (see Equation ).
Relationship to the Fractal Dimension.
Lacunarity analyses using the types of values discussed above have shown that data sets extracted from dense fractals, from patterns that change little when rotated, or from patterns that are homogeneous, have low lacunarity, but as these features increase, so generally does lacunarity. In some instances, it has been demonstrated that fractal dimensions and values of lacunarity were correlated, but more recent research has shown that this relationship does not hold for all types of patterns and measures of lacunarity. Indeed, as Mandelbrot originally proposed, lacunarity has been shown to be useful in discerning amongst patterns (e.g., fractals, textures, etc.) that share or have similar fractal dimensions in a variety of scientific fields including neuroscience.
Graphical Lacunarity.
Other methods of assessing lacunarity from box counting data use the relationship between values of lacunarity (e.g., formula_16) and formula_4 in different ways from the ones noted above. One such method looks at the formula_27 vs formula_27 plot of these values. According to this method, the curve itself can be analyzed visually, or the slope at formula_15 can be calculated from the formula_27 vs formula_27 regression line. Because they tend to behave in certain ways for respectively mono-, multi-, and non-fractal patterns, formula_27 vs formula_27 lacunarity plots have been used to supplement methods of classifying such patterns.
To make the plots for this type of analysis, the data from box counting first have to be transformed as in Equation :
This transformation avoids undefined values, which is important because homogeneous images will have formula_11 at some formula_4 equal to 0 so that the slope of the formula_27 vs formula_27 regression line would be impossible to find. With formula_38, homogeneous images have a slope of 0, corresponding intuitively to the idea of no rotational or translational invariance and no gaps. 
One box counting technique using a "gliding" box calculates lacunarity according to: 
formula_39 is the number of filled data points in the box and formula_40 the normalized frequency distribution of formula_39 for different box sizes.
Prefactor Lacunarity.
Another proposed way of assessing lacunarity using box counting, the "Prefactor" method, is based on the value obtained from box counting for the fractal dimension (formula_42). This statistic uses the variable formula_43 from the scaling rule formula_44, where formula_43 is calculated from the y-intercept (formula_46) of the ln-ln regression line for formula_4 and either the count (formula_48) of boxes that had any pixels at all in them or else formula_18 at formula_50. formula_43 is particularly affected by image size and the way data are gathered, especially by the lower limit of formula_4s used. The final measure is calculated as shown in Equations through :
Applications.
Below is a list of some fields where lacunarity plays an important role, along with links to relevant research illustrating practical uses of lacunarity.

Airtecture

Airtecture is a term registered by the company FESTO AG & CO, an international company that makes pneumatic components. The term stands for any portable and prefabricated non-metal buildings and the component parts required to construct them, chiefly non-metal stabilizing pillars, columns, supports, bars and braces stabilized by gas or air, roofs, walls and floors.
The term, formed by combining "Air" and the ending part of "Architecture" is used to define air-construction-based structures and any other building-like facility or structure that is supported by air or any other gas.
First official airtecture project.
Festo's is a project in this field was the "Airtecture Exhibition Hall" (1996 - Esslingen, Germany). The design of this structure, presumably the very first air-supported building with a cubic interior and with a supporting structure, consisted primarily of air-inflated elements.
Construction.
The appearance, construction and design of this structure was deliberately made to reflect the technological background and purpose of the hall while differentiating it from any other previous pneumatic or air construction at the time. The hall has a floor area of 375 m2 and a height of 6 m, resulting in a total volume of 2250 m3. The covered exterior dimensions are 800m2 with an external height of 7.2 m. With a total dead weight of 7.5 kg/m2, the structure is considered to be light. The hall was erected on the company ground; other applications are intended. The two end walls of the hall consist of two L-shaped elements each leaving a free space between them measuring 3m x 6m. These two wall openings are used as entrances; above one of them the ducts for supply and exhaust air enter the hall. A 4 m high transparent PVC membrane serving as a roll-up gate is connected to a steel frame independent of the air structure.
Structure.
The hall consists of approximately 330 individual air-inflated elements, most of which come under the six categories of wall components, transparent window cushions, Y-shaped columns, roof beams with translucent, intermediate membranes and pneumatic tension elements (so-called 'muscles'). They all have different volumes and internal pressures.The load-bearing structure of the exhibition hall includes 40 Y-shaped columns and 36 wall components with parallel faces along both longitudinal sides. 72,000 distance threads per square meter hold the double-layer walls in place at an operating pressure of 0.5 bar. The slits between the opaque wall components are filled with transparent cushions made of Hostaflon ET as window elements; slide locks allow easily installation. The load-bearing structure has many new features. These include among others the use of double-wall-fabric as a load-bearing element, flame-inhibiting elastomer coatings, a new translucent levaprene coating (EVA = ethylene-vinyl acetate coating), and computer-controlled pneumatic tension elements ('muscles') and the concept of a building actively responding to environmental forces. The building was designed for a snow load of 50 kg/m3 and a simultaneous wind speed of 80 km/h.
Current Situation.
Today, many companies worldwide are developing air-inflated structures for various fields. Buildair S.A. is a Spanish company located in Barcelona that currently dedicates all its investigation efforts and technology to the development of such structures. The inflatable buildings and pavilions made today do not necessarily rely on "muscle" support structures; in fact most companies now build the whole building in inflatable membranes well designed to resist many adverse weather conditions. The main use today for such structures is to hold events of all kinds, mainly high impact outdoor events, but they are also used for private temporary or permanent locations or as marketing or advertising tools.

Matt Kalil

Matt Kalil (born July 6, 1989) is an American football offensive tackle for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). Kalil played college football for the University of Southern California, and was selected fourth overall in the 2012 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He was chosen for the Pro Bowl following the 2012 NFL season.
High school career.
Kalil attended Servite High School in Anaheim, California, where he played for the Servite Friars high school football team. Considered a five-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Kalil was listed as the No. 3 offensive tackle in the class of 2008. He played in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl on a West squad that featured fellow USC offensive lineman Tyron Smith.
College career.
After redshirting his initial year at USC, Kalil served as backup to Tyron Smith at right tackle. He started against Boston College and performed well, and saw limited action in 11 other games (all but Arizona State) and played primarily on special teams. In his sophomore year, Kalil beat Smith to replace Charles Brown at left tackle, where he started all 13 games. He also played on the defensive line for special teams and blocked a point after touchdown against Notre Dame.
As a junior, Kalil retained his starting left tackle spot, helping the Trojans average 456.8 yards of total offense. The Trojans' offensive line only allowed an FBS-low eight sacks of quarterback Matt Barkley, none of which were allowed by Kalil. For his effort, Kalil was named to several All-American teams, while also becoming the 12th Trojan offensive lineman to win the Morris Trophy. Kalil was also semifinalist for the 2011 Lombardi Award.
Professional career.
2012 NFL Draft.
Already after his sophomore year, Kalil was regarded as the best offensive tackle prospect for the 2012 NFL Draft. He declared for the draft on December 16. After a strong performance at the NFL Combine, Kalil was projected to be the No. 3 draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings eventually selected Kalil, but not until trading down to the No. 4 spot. They had not selected an offensive lineman in the first round since Bryant McKinnie in 2002.
Kalil was USC's fifth offensive lineman selected in the top-5 of an NFL Draft, after Ron Yary in 1968, Marvin Powell in 1977, Anthony Muñoz in 1980, and Tony Boselli in 1995. With Tyron Smith having been selected ninth overall in 2011, it also made USC the first school with consecutive top-10 selected offensive lineman since Texas' Leonard Davis (2001) and Mike Williams (2002).
Minnesota Vikings.
Kalil was signed to a four-year contract by the Minnesota Vikings on July 26, 2012. He was selected to attend the Pro Bowl after Washington Redskins offensive tackle Trent Williams was injured during a night club fight.
Personal.
His father, Frank, was a center at Arkansas and Arizona, and was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 1982, before playing for the USFL's Arizona Wranglers in 1983 and Houston Gamblers in 1984. His brother Ryan was an All-American at Southern California, and plays with the Carolina Panthers.

James Macklin

Sir James Macklin, DL, JP (23 September 1864 – 17 April 1944) was an English jeweller and farmer, active in public life in Wiltshire.
Early life and business career.
Macklin was born in West Harnham on 23 September 1864, the son of James Macklin (senior) and his wife, Sarah.
When the national census of England was taken in April 1871, James Macklin (senior) was described as a jeweller's shopman, living in West Harnham with his wife, four daughters and three sons. He later went into business as a cutler at No. 7, Catharine Street in Salisbury and the business became well known as James Macklin & Son, watchmakers and jewellers, silversmiths and cutlers.
When the census was taken again, in April 1881, Macklin was described as an assistant in his father's business, living and working at No. 7, Catharine Street with his father (now described as a cutler, employing one man and one boy), mother, three sisters, two brothers and nephew.
Eventually Macklin took over the running of the business: When the census was taken again, in April 1891, he was described as a jeweller, living and working at No. 7, Catharine Street with his wife and a domestic servant.
When the census was taken again, in April 1911, however, he described himself as a retired jeweller, living at "Watersmeet" in Harnham with his wife, two daughters, son and domestic servant.
Macklin demonstrated significant business acumen. "Succeeding to an old-established business, which represents the last of the old cutlery trade, for which Salisbury at one time had a considerable reputation, he considerably extended its scope, and retired very early in life to a beautiful home he created for himself at East Harnham. ... Acquiring considerable property in the old village, which was incorporated into the borough Salisbury in 1904, Mr. Macklin readily gave up land to improve the roads, and generally devoted himself to the interests of the parish. He has lately given considerable attention to agricultural pursuits, in conjunction with his son, and is in occupation of a large farm at Tytherley."
In the years that followed he concentrated on his farming interests.
Mayor of Salisbury.
Macklin served six successive terms as Mayor of Salisbury, commencing in November 1913, and coming to an end in 1919. His incumbency of the office coincided with the First World War.
On 16 September 1918 Macklin "was presented to His Majesty George V by Lieut.-General Sir Henry Sclater. The King said to him, 'I understand, Mr. Mayor, that you have been Mayor of the city for five years. I am very grateful to you for the unselfish way in which you have devoted yourself to the services of the city and to myself.' The Mayor, acknowledging this gracious remark, said, with becoming modesty: 'I have to thank my colleagues for any success I have had Your Majesty,' and the King rejoined: 'Will you also express my thanks to your colleagues.' His Majesty, continuing, said he understood that his troops on Plain had been well treated in the way of entertainments and hospitality at Salisbury. The Mayor assured His Majesty that the citizens had been pleased to do everything they could for the troops, and the King graciously added: 'I wish you to thank the citizens for all they have done for the soldiers.' His Majesty then expressed good wishes for the Mayor's health and said he wished the Mayor to convey his message to the citizens."
As mayor of the city he was appointed as a magistrate for the Salisbury petty sessional division. He served as deputy mayor during 1919-1920, was made an alderman in 1919, and was given the freedom of the city of Salisbury in 1921.
Honours.
In January 1919 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Wiltshire.
He was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his public and local services, receiving the accolade at the hands of King George V at Buckingham Palace on 4 March 1920.
Last years.
During his last years Macklin lived at "Harnham Lodge" in Salisbury. He continued to serve as an alderman on the Salisbury City Council, at least until November 1943, and was chairman of the Salisbury Gas Company.
He died in "The Nursing Home", Salisbury, on 17 April 1944.
Family.
Macklin was married in 1890 to Barbara Emily Main, the daughter of George John Masters Main and his wife, Emily Mariah (née Hayter). She was born in 1870. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1919 for work among Colonial and British troops during the First World War and was awarded the Golden Palms of the Order of the Crown, by the King of the Belgians in 1921 for work among Belgian refugees during the same conflict. She died in Salisbury on 19 November 1960.
Sir James and Lady Macklin had four children: Bernard James Macklin, born on 18 January 1893; Dulcie Emella Macklin, born on 15 February 1894; Harold George (Main) Macklin, born on 12 August 1898, and Phyllis Frances M. Macklin, born on 13 February 1904.

Henry Cejudo

Henry Carlos Cejudo (born February 9, 1987 in San Jose, California) is a freestyle wrestler, Olympic gold medalist, mixed martial artist and author. Henry became an Olympic gold medalist at just 21 years old, the youngest American wrestler to win a gold medal.
Wrestling career.
Henry captured four high school wrestling state championships (two in Colorado, two in Arizona). He was awarded (the title) ASICS National High School Wrestler of the Year (2006).
He participated in two Junior World Championships, placing fifth in 2005 and second in 2006. That same year, Henry became the first high schooler to win U.S. Nationals since USA Wrestling's formation as the sport's national body in 1983. Cejudo decided to skip wrestling at the college level and instead accepted an offer from USA wrestling to train at their main facilities in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Henry won the Pan American Championships in March 2008.
Henry Cejudo is the youngest of seven siblings including Angel Cejudo four time state champ at Maryvale High School (Phoenix, Arizona).
2008 Beijing Olympics.
Henry qualified for the Olympics in the 55 kg, (121 pound) weight class. He entered the competition in the Round of 16. In his first round match, against Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov, Henry lost the first period, 2-1, and was forced to win both of the remaining periods to win the match.
In the quarterfinals, Henry faced Georgian wrestler Besarion Gochashvilli and again lost the first period, but bounced back to win the last two periods to advance.
In the semifinals, Henry again was forced to win the last two periods but did so for the third time in the tournament, defeating Azerbaijani wrestler Namig Sevdimov to advance to the gold medal match.
For the gold medal match, Cejudo faced Japanese wrestler Tomohiro Matsunaga and, for the first time in the tournament, was able to win the first two periods which secured the gold medal.
2012 Olympic Trials.
After losing in the 2012 Olympic Trials, Henry Cejudo removed his shoes on the mat and threw them out into the crowd, officially retiring from wrestling. Immediately at the end of the match he lost, the crowd of fans in the arena rose in a standing ovation to recognize his achievements. As he removed his shoes, the roar of applause grew and continued to rise as he left the mat.

Mixed martial arts career.
On Jan. 30, 2013, Cejudo announced on his Twitter page that he plans to begin training for a career in MMA. Despite wrestling at 121 pounds during his wrestling career, Cejudo plans to fight at 135 pounds in his MMA debut planned for late March or early April. He defeated Michael Poe by submission due to punches in his MMA debut at a World Fighting Federation event on March 2, 2013. Cejudo has fought 3 more times since his debut, winning each fight via 1st round TKO. Cejudo is listed as the #1 ranked Bantamweight prospect in the MMA Prospects Report 2013. 
Personal life.
Cejudo, the youngest of six children, was born on February 9, 1987, in South Central Los Angeles, California, to Mexican parents. Cejudo’s father, who was frequently in and out of the California penal system, was absent from Henry’s life starting at a young age. In 1991, Henry’s mother made the decision to move to Las Cruces, New Mexico, to raise her six young children on her own. She frequently had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. As a result, Henry’s early childhood was spent moving from state to state, until his family finally settled in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The Cejudo children were raised in some of the poorest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Las Cruces, and Phoenix. All six children slept on the floor and often did not know where their next meal would come from. Motivated by the hardships of his childhood, Henry immersed himself in school and athletics. Although the odds were stacked against him, he used wrestling to keep him out of trouble. Henry’s brother, Angel, introduced him to the sport of wrestling. From the beginning he was determined to prove himself to the world and to the father that he never really knew. Driven by desire, Henry was focused on winning the World and Olympic championships. 
Henry and his brother dominated the competition while attending high school. Impressed by their accomplishments, the national developmental freestyle coach for USA Wrestling invited both Angel and Henry to attend the resident freestyle program at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Henry completed his education while attending the program. Upon graduation, he took the bold and highly unusual road to the Olympic gold, foregoing the customary route of a collegiate wrestling program. Henry began training full-time at the Olympic Training Center to prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics. He then went on to represent the U.S.A. in the Beijing Olympics and brought home the gold. Henry not only achieved his dream of becoming an Olympic champion, but also made history by becoming the youngest American wrestler to ever win an Olympic gold medal.
Henry also has a nephew named Adrian Cordova that was a 2 time Colorado state champion in wrestling, he is currently committed to Iowa State.
Other appearances.
The compelling story of Henry Cejudo’s triumphant journey to Olympic gold quickly captivated the nation and turned Henry into an instant celebrity. He immediately began to use his newfound celebrity as a platform to inspire millions of young athletes through in-depth interviews and high profile television appearances.
While in Beijing, Henry appeared on numerous national television programs including NBC’s Today, CBS’ Early Morning Show and ABC’s Nightly News. 
Other appearances include "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno", ESPN’s "SportsCenter", "Access Hollywood", "The Oprah Winfrey Show", "", Japan’s popular "Ninja Warrior" television show, in which Cejudo was one of the 100 contestants in the 21st SASUKE tournament, along with Tomohiro Matsunaga, the 2008 Olympic Silver medalist that Henry defeated, and various local news programs across the nation. Henry also had the distinct honor of presenting one of three scholarships to a deserving Hispanic student during Univision’s “6th Annual Premios Juventud Youth Awards”. Henry was also recognized during Univision’s Tecate Premios Deportes 2008 broadcast as one of 2008’s outstanding Hispanic athletes.
Henry was named one of Arizona’s ten most fascinating people by The Arizona Republic in 2008 and continues to be featured in numerous publications such as Latino Perspectives Magazine and Sports Illustrated. On April 1, 2010, he was featured in the Los Angeles Times article, “Athletes Without Borders”.
Henry also lit the torch at the opening ceremonies of the 2009 State Games of America in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on July 30, 2009.

Henry Caldwell

Lt.-Col. Henry Caldwell, (c. 1735 – 1810) was a Canadian army and militia officer, a successful businessman and a member of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada.
Early life.
The youngest son of Sir John Caldwell (d. 1744) 3rd Bt., of Castle Caldwell & Wellsborough, High Sheriff of Fermanagh; by his wife Anne (d. 1769), daughter of the Very Rev. John Trench (d. 1725) of Moate, Co. Galway; Dean of Raphoe.
Capture of Louisbourg.
Henry Caldwell fought with distinction at the capture of Louisbourg, Cape Breton, afterward promoted to captain by James Wolfe (who included him in his will) and assistant quartermaster to General Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester during the Siege of Quebec.
Post-military career.
Caldwell retired from the British army with the rank of major in 1774, remaining in Quebec. He leased land that had belonged to Governor George Murray (British Army officer) and built Caldwell Manor. The following year he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel with the militia during the defence of Sainte-Foy and was chosen to carry the dispatches reporting the victory to London. His military service earned him the King's praise, financial reward and a seat in the Canadian parliament. In 1787 he was promoted to colonel of the Quebec Battalion of British Militia, a rank he held until June 1794. Described as 'a handsome soldier', Caldwell was supposed to be the inspiration for the character Colonel Ed Rivers in the novel "The History of Emily Montague", by Frances Brooke.
Caldwell was a founder of the Agriculture Society (1791), serving as its chairman, to improve the breeding of livestock and the production of hemp in Quebec. In 1801 he purchased all the property that had belonged to Governor Murray, establishing himself as an important landowner, and he bought further considerable tracts of land throughout Quebec. From the mills he built he supplied the troops stationed in North America and bought boats, wharves and warehouses to produce, store and export his goods. In 1810 alone he sold more than 1,775,000 pounds of flour to the government for just under £22,000.
In 1804, as a result of the Napoleon's European blockade, Caldwell persuaded Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, the Lord of the Admiralty, to instead develop Canadian timber for the Royal Navy. His sawmills became the best known in Quebec and the Etchemin mills at the mouth of the Etchemin River were among the largest.
As a politician he was 'a man of rather tempestuous nature and strong personality (and) he naturally found himself in conflict with the governors of the time.' In 1784 he was appointed deputy receiver general. Under Governor Carleton he focused on improving the militia, highways, communications and later education. Ten years later, in 1794, he was sworn in as Receiver-General of Lower Canada with an annual salary of £400. He retained this position until 1808 when his son, John Caldwell (seigneur), took over. Long after his death, in 1823, it was discovered that he had embezzled nearly £40,000 during the exercise of his duties, including almost £8,000 from the Jesuit estates, which he had managed as treasurer of the commission set up to administer them.
Death.
Henry Caldwell died May 28, 1810 at his home, Belmont, near Quebec. His wife, Ann, died six years earlier. She was a daughter of Alexander Hamilton (d.1808) M.P., K.C., of Hampton Hall, Co. Dublin & Newtonhamilton, Co. Armagh. Her father represented Belfast in Parliament. Ann was the great aunt of Chief Justice Edward Bowen who came to Quebec with the Caldwells. Henry left all his personal goods and property to his only son, except for the seigneury of Lauson, which he bequeathed to his grandson Henry John Caldwell, and what was left of Sans Bruit, which went to his granddaughter Ann Caldwell; he also left various gifts to relatives and friends.

Brahmeswara Temple

Brahmeswara Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Siva located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, erected at the end of the 9th century CE, is richly carved inside and out. This Hindu temple can be dated with fair accuracy by the use of inscriptions that were originally on the temple. They are now unfortunately lost, but records of them preserve the information of around 1058 CE. The temple is built in the 18th regnal year of the Somavamsi king Udyotakesari by his mother Kolavati Devi, which corresponds to 1058 CE.
The Temple.
The temple is built with traditional architectural methods of wood carving, but applied on stone building. The buildings were built in a shape of full volume pyramid, and then the would be carved inside and outside.
The Brahmeswara shows quite a bit of affinity with the much earlier Mukteswar Temple, including the carved interior of the "Jagmohana", and in the sculptural iconography such as the lion head motif, which appeared for the first time in the "Mukteswara", and is here evident in profusion. There are quite a number of innovations, however, including the introduction of a great number of musicians and dancers, some holding lutes, on the exterior walls. For the first time in temple architectural history iron beams find their first use.
On sandstone walls there are symbolic decorations and the notion of godlike figures that helps the believer in his meditation. The carvings over the door frame contain beautiful flower designs as well as flying figures. Like the Rajarani, there are images of the eight directional Guardian Deities. There are also quite a number of tantric-related images, and even "Chamunda" appears on the western facade, holding a trident and a human head, standing on a corpse. Shiva and other deities are also depicted in their horrific aspects.
One of the lost inscriptions stated that a Queen "Kolavati" presented 'many beautiful women' to the temple, and it has been suggested that this is an evidence of the 'Devadasi' tradition, which assumed such importance in later Orissan temple architecture and temple life.

Waldemar von Baußnern

Waldemar Edler von Baußnern (also "Baussnern" or "Bausznern", November 29, 1866August 20, 1931) was a German composer and music teacher.
Life.
Born in Berlin, Germany, and descended from Transylvanian Saxons, Baußnern was the son of a financial official. He grew up in both Transylvania (in the then Rumania) and Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in present-day Hungary). Between 1882-1886 he was a student of Friedrich Kiel and Woldemar Bargiel at the Berlin Musical Academy (Berliner Musikhochschule). He then conducted various choirs; after 1909 he became director of the Großherzoglichen Musikschule in Weimar. From 1916 to 1923 he served as director of the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main. In 1923 he became undersecretary of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. He died in Potsdam.
Music.
Baußnern's extensive catalogue of compositions includes almost all musical genres, yet it displays an emphasis on both choral symphonic and orchestral composition. As a composer, Baußnern found stimulation from poetry, for not only his vocal music, but also his instrumental music; the poetry of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe emerged as an especial source of inspiration. This compositional impetus is reflected in numerous titles of his works, yet his oeuvre lacks any programmatic design. Stylistically, Baußnern stands out as a maverick to his contemporaries, remaining a composer who defies classification. Generally, however, his music is rooted in the 19th century, yet exhibits independence of form, ranging from extremes of conventional tonality to frequently polyphonic chromaticism, nonetheless never metamorphosizing into atonality.
Baußnern completed Peter Cornelius's fragmentary opera "Gunlöd" in 1906 and served as editor of the operatic section of a comprehensive edition of Cornelius' works.
Sustained success eluded Baußnern during his life, and many of his compositions (for example, all of his symphonies) were never published. Research into Baußnern work remains in its infancy, but a Baußnern Society (Baußnern-Gesellschaft), founded by German composer Dietrich von Bausznern (1920–1980), Baußnern's grandson, seeks to promote awareness of his life's work. Current chair of the society is Angela Gehann-Dernbach.

O' Horten

"O' Horten" is a 2007 Norwegian film directed by Bent Hamer. The film's title character Odd Horten is a habit-bound train driver, who is about to retire. On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by Hamer, the themes are loneliness and old age, and the courage to take chances. "O' Horten" has been described as a film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.
The film's main cast consists of mostly senior Danish/Norwegian actors, including Bård Owe, Espen Skjønberg, and Ghita Nørby. There are also several cameos from various well-known Norwegians, such as ski jumper Anette Sagen in her first film role. The music was composed by John Erik Kaada. Generally well received by critics, it was chosen for "Un Certain Regard" at the Cannes Film Festival. Skjønberg was awarded an Amanda Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
Plot.
Odd Horten is an overly cautious 67-year-old man about to retire after forty years as a train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving the train to Bergen. When he gets there, he makes small talk with Svea, who owns the boarding house where he stays when there and whom he now may never see again.
Back in Oslo, his colleagues throw him a farewell party, but Odda timid manis uncomfortable with the attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, trying to reach the apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.
A number of scenes then follow whose exact sequence is unclear. Odd goes to visit his mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.
By chance he then runs into another man his age, the far more spontaneous Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never had the courage to try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.
In the early morning Sissener suggests the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes his way up to the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.
Production.
The film contains several cameos from well-known actors and other celebrities, made possible by Hamer's high standing as a director. His previous film was the international production "Factotum", based on the novel by Charles Bukowski, starring Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, and Marisa Tomei. Some of the appearances are relatively brief; Nørby, for instance, is on screen for less than three minutes, while the well-known Norwegian entertainer Trond Viggo Torgersen appears for only 59 seconds. Before the film's première on Boxing Day 2007, a pre-screening was held for journalists on 22 December. This was followed by dinner, attended by all the protagonists, at the restaurant "Valkyrien" in Oslo, where Odd Horten is also a regular customer in the film.
Among the more original castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, in her first film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film has been described as a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.
The two lonely old men make part of a recurring theme in Hamer's films, as seen also in "Eggs" (1995) and "Kitchen Stories" (2003). However, Hamer himself has described the film as equally much about women; "the women who once gave birth to these men." He also cites a great fascination with trains as an inspiration for the film's setting, and claims that he had long wanted to make a film with this theme.
Reception.
Norwegian newspapers "Verdens Gang" and "Dagbladet" both gave the film five out of six points. "Verdens Gang"'s Jon Selås called it "a little film about living" and praised it for its "applied existential philosophy". "Dagbladet"'s Vegard Larsen had certain objections to a few unnecessary scenes, but nevertheless found that the film had met the high expectations created by Hamer's previous films. "Aftenposten"'s Ingunn Økland, on the other hand, felt "O' Horten" failed to live up to the director's best work, and gave it only four points. She nevertheless pointed out the good qualities in the film, in particular the filming and the soundtrack by John Erik Kaada.
Foreign reviewers also gave the film generally positive reviews; Duane Byrge of "The Hollywood Reporter" called it a "Warm story from frigid Norway". "Variety"'s Alissa Simon wrote that it "lacks the fully developed characters and tightly constructed narrative of his more poignant and substantial "Kitchen Stories"", but that it "nevertheless provides a warm and gently humorous divertissement". She also found the production and score excellent. James Rocchi, writing for Cinematical, chose to highlight Bård Owe's performance, and his "warm demeanor" and meticulous "capacity for double-takes". "Entertainment Weekly"'s Lisa Schwarzbaum compared Owe to Jack Nicholson's Warren Schmidt in the film "About Schmidt". Like others, she also used Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki as a reference to describe Hamer's particular cinematic style.
"O' Horten" was picked for the "Un Certain Regard"-section of the Cannes Film Festival. Here it was praised by one reviewer as "deliciously funny" in a festival that contained few happy stories. This marked the fourth time that Hamer was represented at Cannes, which makes him one of only two Norwegians to accomplish this feat. This instance, however, marked a step up for Hamer, as his previous appearances had been in the slightly less prestigious "Directors' Fortnight"-category. At the festival, the film was picked for international distribution by the distribution company Sony Pictures Classics. Hamer also won the Norwegian Film Critics' Award in 2008, thereby becoming the first director to win this award three times. At the Amanda Awards that year, "O' Horten" was nominated for a number of awardsincluding "Best Film" and "Best Direction"but won only two: "Best Sound" and "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" for Espen Skjønberg.
In spite of good critical reception, the film did not perform very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by more people in the United States than in Norway.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film was released in 2008, under the name "Music from the Motion Picture O' Horten". It was fully composed by Norwegian pop / experimental singer Kaada.

Stray sod

In contemporary fantasy literature, a stray sod is a clump of grass enchanted by faeries. If a person steps on one, they will become disorientated and lost, even in familiar surroundings. Wearing an item of clothing inside-out breaks the enchantment, allowing the person to find their way again. The concept and phrase appear to originate in ancient Celtic mythology, specifically Irish folklore. In more modern Christianized interpretations, the source of the enchantment may not be faeries.
In other writing and in speech, the phrase "stepped on a stray sod" can be used metaphorically to denote sudden, unexpected or inexplicable disorientation.
Stray sods appear in the series "The Spiderwick Chronicles", disorienting travelers. The companion guide to the series notes that in order to reverse the effects, one must either have bread in his or her pocket or turn their clothes inside out.

Tomatin distillery

Tomatin distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery in the village of Tomatin. Its whisky is of the Highland region. 
Although it is thought that whisky has been distilled on the site since the 16th century, when cattle drivers would buy from a local still, the distillery was not established until 1897, under the name of Tomatin Spey Distillery Co Ltd. The company went bankrupt in 1906, and reopened under new ownership in 1909. After the liquidation of its owners in 1986, it was taken over by Japanese conglomerate Takara Shuzo and was renamed Tomatin Distillery Co Ltd.
The distillery operated with only two stills until 1958. Starting at that time, they began to add stills to increase production capacity, eventually reaching production of twelve million liters of whisky per year during the 1970s. Although in 1987 Tomatin was referred to as the largest malt distillery in Scotland, stills have been dismantled since the mid-1980s, bringing their total capacity to just over five million liters, though as of 2007, they were only producing 2.5 million liters. 
Around eighty percent of Tomatin's whisky goes into blended whisky, including its own brands of Antiquary and Talisman. The distillery, as of late, has been making an effort to bolster its name as a producer of single malt whisky, and is expanding its core range. In 2003, Tomatin's basic 10-year-old malt was replaced by the 12 Year Old. In 2009, a 15 Year was added to the lineup, which also includes an 18 Year and a 25-year. Other limited releases are often made, including a 30-year, a 40-year and single-cask offerings.

West Port Book Festival

The West Port Book Festival is a book festival which is held in Edinburgh. It was run during the busy Edinburgh Festival season for its first years, but it now takes place at different times every year.
The festival was first run in 2008 for a four day stretch from 14–17 August. The 2009 festival took place between 13–16 August. It is of note due to its use of many working second-hand book shop venues in the West Port for most of the events, and its insistence on free tickets for entry. Although the West Port Book Festival has received some coverage claiming it was a formal rival to the much larger Edinburgh International Book Festival, the organisers stated that it was designed to complement rather than to challenge its much more famous cousin.
Programme.
2008.
The first festival included some well known Scottish writers, as well as up and coming authors from around the world, including Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, Douglas Dunn, A. L. Kennedy, Kapka Kassabova, Ronan Sheehan, Rajorshi Chakraborti, Dilys Rose, Dean Parkin, Robert Alan Jamieson, Owen Dudley Edwards, and many others.
2009.
As well as featuring poets John Hegley, Tim Turnbull, Jack Underwood, Douglas Dunn and 2009 Forward Poetry Prize nominee J. O.

Manu Tuilagi

Manu Samoa Tuilagi (born 18 May 1991) is a Samoan-born English professional rugby union player who currently plays for Aviva Premiership side Leicester Tigers and . He plays as a centre or on the wing. He is well known for his big hits, sheer force and surprising speed for a man of nearly 18 stone. He is considered to be one of the brightest prospects and best outside centres in world rugby.
He was selected to play for the British and Irish Lions on their 2013 tour to Australia.
Family.
Manu is the younger brother of Henry Tuilagi, Freddie Tuilagi, Alesana Tuilagi, Anitelea Tuilagi and Sanele Vavae Tuilagi, all of whom are Samoan internationals. Manu is the only one of the six brothers to have played for England internationally; their brother Olotuli is the only one not to have represented Leicester Tigers.
Club career.
Tuilagi played junior rugby at Hinckley RFC from U14's to U16's; winning the Leicestershire county cup at U16's. He was a student at John Cleveland College and Mount Grace High school where he was part of the team that won the Leicestershire schools county cup three years running; he played in the U15's Daily Mail Vase, losing to Langley Park Boys School in the Final at Twickenham Stadium. Tuilagi played in the Daily Mail Vase final again in U18's where, after collecting a crossfield kick, he scored a try in the victory over Hampton School.
Tuilagi represented Leicester in the Middlesex Sevens at Twickenham in 2009. The team only made it out of the first round, having beaten London Wasps: in this game, Tuilagi made a big hit on Wasps sevens captain Chris Bishay.
Tuilagi played for the victorious Leicester Tigers side against at Welford Road on 6 November 2009.
He began his first season (2010–11) with the senior Tigers side with plenty of promise. Tigers Director of Rugby Richard Cockerill said that he expected Tuilagi to be a first-team regular and to play for before long. During this season he started the majority of games for Tigers' and was called up for England Saxons duty. In Leicester's Premiership semi-final against Northampton Saints on 14 May 2011, Tuilagi received a yellow card for punching Chris Ashton. Tuilagi was later cited for this offence, and given a 10-week ban, later reduced to five weeks.
International career.
Tuilagi said he would prefer to play internationally for , where he had grown up. He was selected to start the England Saxons game against Italy 'A' in January 2011, scoring a second-half try in a match which England won 45-17. In June 2011 he was named in England's training squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and has since been a regular in the starting line-up.
In addition Tuilagi has been involved with the England Sevens squad. In May 2010 he represented an "England VII" in the London Floodlit Sevens, playing under the 'Dig Deep England' banner. In helping England retain their title, UR7s said that he had "made the biggest impact against Saracens (in the final) combining brutal power with subtle offloads".
On 4 August 2011, Tuilagi's England début was confirmed for the World Cup warm-up match against Wales at Twickenham on 6 August 2011.
He duly started and scored a try in the 44th minute underneath the post, after an inside pass from Jonny Wilkinson.
He then played in the third warm-up game, a victory over Ireland, and scored again. He was a regular starter during the World Cup where he was largely recognised as one of the players of the tournament and a shining light in the underachieving England team.
Since his debut Tuilagi has often featured in the England starting line-up and is considered one of their key players from both an attacking and defensive perspective. One of his most outstanding international performances came at the final match of the 2012 Autumn Internationals, where England faced the World Champion All Blacks at Twickenham. England scored 3 tries in this match, beating the All Blacks 38-21 - their largest ever winning margin over the New Zealand team. Tuilagi featured in all 3 tries, providing the scoring pass to fellow centre Brad Barritt in the first instance, powering through several All Black players to deliver the try-scoring pass to Chris Ashton for the second, and then taking the final try himself after intercepting a pass from Kieran Read.
Tuilagi was named as part of the Lions squad for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. Tuilagi played 3 non-test matches (against Western Force, Queensland Reds and Melbourne Rebels) and also played in the 3rd and final test match against the Wallabies, when he came on as a substitute in the 69th minute. He did not score any points for the Lions.
Playing Style.
Tuilagi's favoured position is outside centre. From here, he is able to play his favoured game of running hard at the opposition defence and breaking the line.
A big part of Tuilagi's game is strength, either being able to tackle heavily or breaking through opposition lines and gaining ground.
When on the break, Tuiliagi will use his speed to cause problems for the opposition and has scored several tries internationally and at club level in this manner.
Personal life.
In June 2010, Tuilagi faced deportation from the United Kingdom after it emerged that he had entered the country on a holiday visa six years earlier and had stayed on illegally. After an appeal, he was later granted indefinite leave to remain.
In the aftermath of England's 2011 World Cup exit to France, Tuilagi was detained by New Zealand police and subsequently fined £3000 by the England team for jumping into Auckland harbour from a ferry.
Tuilagi has a tattoo on his right arm which represents his Samoan heritage.
In September 2013 he issued an apology to Prime Minister David Cameron after making a “bunny ears” sign behind his back during a visit by the British and Irish Lions squad to Downing Street.

<doc id="18932097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932097" title="Heterotopic pregnancy">
Heterotopic pregnancy

A heterotopic pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy in which both extra-uterine (ectopic pregnancy) and intrauterine pregnancy occur simultaneously. It may also be referred to as a combined ectopic pregnancy, multiple‑sited pregnancy, or coincident pregnancy.
Prevalence.
The prevalence of heterotopic pregnancy is estimated at 0.6‑2.5:10,000 pregnancies. There is a significant increase in the incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in women undergoing ovulation induction. An even greater incidence of heterotopic pregnancy is reported in pregnancies following assisted reproduction techniques such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), with an estimated incidence at between 1 and 3 in 100 pregnancies. If there is embryo transfer of more than 4 embryos, the risk has been quoted as 1 in 45. In natural conceptions, the incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has been estimated to be 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.
Etiology.
In a heterotopic pregnancy there is one fertilized ovum which implants normally in the uterus, and one fertilized ovum which implants abnormally, outside of the uterus.
Pathogenesis.
In the general population, the major risk factors for heterotopic pregnancy are the same as those for ectopic pregnancy. For women in an assisted reproductive program, there are additional factors: a higher incidence of multiple ovulation, a higher incidence of tubal malformation and/or tubal damage, and technical factors in embryo transfer which may increase the risk for ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy.
Differential diagnosis.
A possible pregnancy must be considered in any woman who has abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. A heterotopic pregnancy may have similar signs and symptoms as a normal intrauterine pregnancy, a normal intrauterine pregnancy and a ruptured ovarian cyst, a corpus luteum, or appendicitis. Blood tests and ultrasound can be used to differentiate these conditions.
Prognosis.
Extrauterine pregnancies are non-viable and can be fatal to the mother if left untreated. The mortality rate for the intrauterine pregnancy is approximately 35%.
Management.
Heterotopic pregnancy is treated with surgical removal of the ectopic gestation by salpingectomy or salpingostomy. Expectant management has been successfully applied in select cases. Successful salpingocentesis has also been reported.

Crocoideae

Crocoideae is one of the major subfamilies in the Iridaceae family.
It contains plants which are wildly distributed in the Old world, mainly in Africa, but there are species like some members of the genera "Romulea" and "Gladiolus" which are native to Europe and Asia. Some examples are "Romulea bulbocodium", "Romulea columnae", "Gladiolus italicus" and others.
Like the whole Iridaceae family, the members of the subfamily has the typical sword-shaped leaves. The rootstock is usually a corm. The blooms which sometimes has scent are collected in inflorescence. They contain six tepals. The nectar is produced mostly in the base of the bloom from glands of the ovary. This is the place where the flower forms tube-like end. In some species there is no such end and the plant provides pollen to its pollinator.
The ovary is 3-locular. It contains many seeds with different vision in the different members. Sometimes the seed has fine, delicate coat like in "Gladiolus" and in other cases It's black and with hard coat like in "Babiana". It's often pellet-like, sometimes circular or semi-circular.
Many species of this group are among the best-known ornamental plants in the gardens or in pots. Some good examples are "Freesia", "Ixia", "Crocosmia", "Gladiolus" and others popular flowers.

Deep River Marina

Deep River Marina is located on the Connecticut River in Deep River, Connecticut. The marina is on a calm stretch of tidal fresh water off the main channel and is well protected from passing wakes and foul weather. Deep River is well sited, above popular Essex and below Hartford. Its only neighbor is the Essex Valley Railroad, which makes several tourist runs a day along the marina's property line. Within are 5 other marinas and boatyards, with a combined boat population just under 1,000. The boating season runs from mid-April to mid-November. The original boatyard was built in 1955.
Deep River Marina has become a full-service marina and a very attractive home port to boating families from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Canada.
The marina has 200 slips and mooring capacity for 35 boats. Boat sizes range from 16 to with the average boat at LOA; 90% are powerboats. All but 23 slips were leased for the summer, with the remaining used for transient visitors. The VanDyke's four full-time and two part-time summer staff manage the docks, moorings, pumpout, fuel dock, and ship's store. Four staff remain year-round to store 150 boats on land.
Management measures.
Deep River Marina complies with the marina management measures for storm water runoff control, sewage facility, sewage facility maintenance, and solid waste, as well as water quality assessment, shoreline stabilization, fueling station design, liquid materials, petroleum control, boat cleaning, and public education.
Environmental improvements.
Deep River Marina won NMMA's first Boating Facilities Environmental Responsibility Award for its clean marina in 1993. It is just one of several national and regional awards earned by Doug and Karen VanDyke for their environmental consciousness.
Storm water runoff from the parking lot is controlled with grass buffers. With picnic tables, shrubs, trees and flowers, the marina looks more like a park than a boatyard. All parking areas and driveways are covered with crushed stone. A special drain traps silt and skims oil from the work yard and parking area before it can reach the water. A portable oil-changing unit that uses a vacuum tank to suck oil out of engines through the dip-stick tube makes oil changing easy and spillproof. It is available for rent at the marina store.
Color-coded trash containers reduce the volume of waste going to the landfill by collecting bottles, cans, cardboard, and plastic for recycling. Waste oil is also collected in an aboveground 400-gallon tank, contained inside the lower half of a cement septic tank, for recycling at no cost to the marina. At the fuel dock, more than of oil containment boom is stored in a locker for emergency use during spills. Boaters are encouraged to use bilge oil absorption pads, which are also sold in the marina store.

The Annual Meeting of the Association is held in a different European city each year. It attracts 17.000 - 18.000 participants from over 100 countries worldwide. Abstracts are invited from members and non-members. All abstracts are anonymously reviewed by a Programme Committee, chaired by the Honorary Secretary. The EASD was one of the first international Associations to introduce the anonymous review of abstracts. The scientific programme of the Meeting, providing titles of the lectures and symposia, is made available online at an early stage, and, once confirmed, the speakers' names are made available about 6–8 weeks before the start of the Meeting. All abstracts accepted for presentation can be accessed online via the online programme. A search function assists the visitor in finding abstracts in their field of interest. Since 2012 the EASD Virtual Meeting presents posters and talks from the conference online free of charge. 
To assist the participation of young presenting authors, the Association has established a Travel Fund from which over 100 awards are made available for each Annual Meeting. 
The Association awards four major prizes annually: the Camillo Golgi Prize, the Claude Bernard Medal, the Minkowski Prize and the Albert Renold Prize Lecture. The recipients of these prizes deliver a lecture at the Annual Meeting.
Postgraduate Education.
The Association holds annually an EASD Scientists Training Course and a Robert Turner Clinical Research Course to attract new talent to diabetes research in different centres throughout the world. Nominations are invited from EASD members. Together with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) EASD organises a yearly workshop in Oxford, United Kingdom where 20 seniors and fellows come together. 
The Association organises both European and Extra-European Post Graduate Courses.
To date EASD has held Postgraduate Education Courses in Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Nepal, Oman, Palestine, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Srin Lanka, Tanzania, Turkey, UAE, UK, Ukraine and Vietnam.
The EASD Post Graduate Education Committee (PGEC) is active in organising workshops and courses for clinicians and educators.
Web Based CME and webcasts of the EASD Annual Meeting are available on the EASD website.
Study Groups.
The Association has the following Study Groups:
Artificial Insulin Delivery System (AIDPIT); Diabetes and Cancer Study Group; Diabetes Education Study Group (DESG); Diabetic Pregnancy Study Group (DPSG); Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); Diabetes Neuropathy Study Group (NEURODIAB); EASD Eye Complication Study Group (EASDEC); European Diabetic Nephropathy Study Group (EDNSG); Incretin Study Group; EASD Islet Study Group; European Diabetes Epidemiology Group (EDEG); Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG); Psychosocial Aspects of Diabetes (PSAD); Diabetic Foot Study Group (DFSG); EASD Study Group on Primary Care Research in Diabetology (PCCD); Genetics of Diabetes Study Group; Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Study Group (D&CVD).
European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes.
In 1999, the EASD increased its commitment to stimulate diabetes research in Europe by creating the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes (EFSD). The Foundation is closely related to the EASD; it is governed exclusively by the Executive Committee of the EASD, which itself is under the close supervision of the EASD Council and the General Assembly of the EASD. EFSD operates on a strictly non-profit basis under the control of the relevant authorities for charity and taxation.
The EASD, as an academic non-profit association, benefits from the possibilities offered by the legal status of its Foundation to advance diabetes research by various methods.Since its inception, EFSD has committed an amount approaching Euro 100 million to diabetes research in Europe by various funding means. In the last five years, the Foundation has become a significant European funding agency for diabetes research, and is continually striving to enhance awareness in Europe of the severity and magnitude of this devastating disease.
Most programmes offer funding for researchers working in Europe and associated countries, but some are open to scientists from all over the world. All applications are subject to peer review by a panel of leading experts in the field.

João Maria de Sousa

General João Maria de Sousa is the Attorney General of Angola and "the top magistrate of the Prosecuting Council". In a December 2007 ceremony reconfirming his post (which has been held since at least 2004) and attended by members of the press, de Sousa was photographed being sworn into office by José Eduardo dos Santos, President, Head of Government, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola.
Military background.
General de Sousa is, along with fellow "top generals" Francisco Higino Carneiro, Hélder Vieira Dias, Roberto Leal Monteiro, and Kundi Paihama, one of the military leaders holding top ministerial posts for the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, the political party that has ruled Angola since it gained its independence from Portugal in 1975.
Name.
General de Sousa should not be confused with João Maria de Sousa e Almeida, Baron de Agua-Izé, a Portuguese nobleman credited with bringing the seeds of the breadfruit tree to São Tomé in 1858.

Sylva Striker

The Sylva Striker is the most enduring of the Sylva models and was a radical evolution of the Star and Leader, dropping the Viva donor car in favour of purpose-built suspension and lighter bodywork. The car was aimed at two markets, the home car builder that required an economical kit that could be built using readily available mechanics tools and the more demanding race car builder who favoured good handling and simple design.
The Striker has proved popular and successful on UK race tracks, most notably in the kit-car race series run by the 750 Motor Club.
The Striker was available in kit form, and could be built with a variety of engines, for example a Ford Crossflow, Ford Zetec, Toyota Twin-cam or even a motorcycle engine. These cars have high power-to-weight ratios and are best enjoyed in the summer due to minimal weather protection. In the UK all kit-cars are now put though the SVA (Single Vehicle Approval) to obtain a road vehicle licence. The Mk 4 version of this car, known as the Phoenix, was also manufactured in New Zealand from 1989.
The front suspension initially had outboard springs and shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper suspension arm. There were two types of rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent rear suspension.
In 2002, Raw Engineering acquired the rights to the Striker and have made a number of modifications and variations since.

Anglesey

Anglesey or Ynys Môn (; , ) is an island off the north west coast of Wales. Two bridges span the Menai Strait, connecting it to the mainland: the Menai Suspension Bridge designed by Thomas Telford in 1826 and the Britannia Bridge. Formerly part of Gwynedd, Anglesey, Holy Island and other smaller islands now make up the Isle of Anglesey County.
Almost three quarters of the inhabitants are Welsh speakers and Ynys Môn, the Welsh name for the island, is used for the UK Parliament and National Assembly constituencies. With an area of , Anglesey is the largest Welsh island, the fifth largest surrounding Great Britain and the largest in the Irish Sea.
Etymology.
"Anglesey" is derived from Old Norse, originally meaning either "ǫngullsey" ("Hook Island") or "Ǫnglisey" ("Ǫngli's Island"). No record of any such Ǫngli survives, but the place name was used by Viking raiders as early as the 10th century and was later adopted by the Normans during their invasions of Gwynedd. The traditional folk etymology reading the name as the "Island of the English" may account for its Norman use but is without merit, although the Angles' name itself is probably a cognate reference to the shape of the Angeln peninsula. All of these ultimately derive from the proposed Proto-Indo-European root "*ank-" ("to flex, bend, angle").
"Ynys Môn", the island's Welsh name, was first recorded as Latin "Mona" by various Roman sources. It was likewise known to the Saxons as "Monez". The Brittonic original was in the past taken to have meant "Island of the Cow". This view is linguistically untenable however according to modern scientific philology and so the etymology must remain a mystery.
Poetic names for Anglesey include the Old Welsh "Ynys Dywyll" ("Shady" or "Dark Isle") for its former groves and "Ynys y Cedairn" ("Isle of the Brave") for its royal courts; Gerald of Wales's "Môn Mam Cymru" ("Môn, Mother of Wales") for its productivity; and "Y fêl Ynys" ("Honey Isle").
History.
Numerous megalithic monuments and menhirs are present on Anglesey, testifying to the presence of humans in prehistory. Plas Newydd is near one of 28 cromlechs that remain on uplands overlooking the sea. The Welsh Triads claim that Anglesey was once part of the mainland.
Historically, Anglesey has long been associated with druids. In AD 60 the Roman general Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, determined to break the power of the Celtic druids, attacked the island utilizing his amphibious Batavian contingent as a surprise vanguard assault and then destroying the shrine and the sacred groves. News of Boudica's revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the Roman Governor of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of copper. The foundations of Caer Gybi, a fort at Holyhead, are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to Llanfairpwllgwyngyll may originally have been a Roman road.
British Iron Age and Roman sites have been excavated, and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th century antiquarian, William Owen Stanley. Following the Roman departure from Britain in the early 5th century, pirates from Ireland colonised Anglesey and the nearby Llŷn Peninsula. In response to this, Cunedda ap Edern, a Gododdin warlord from Scotland, came to the area and began the process of driving the Irish out. This process was continued by his son Einion Yrth ap Cunedda and grandson Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion, the last Irish invaders finally being defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position and, because of this, Aberffraw became the site of the court, or "Llys", of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Apart from a devastating Danish raid in 853 it was to remain the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the English navy made the location indefensible.
After the Irish, the island was invaded by Vikings, some of these raids being noted in famous sagas (see Menai Strait History), as well as Saxons, and Normans, before falling to Edward I of England in the 13th century.
Geography.
Anglesey is a relatively low-lying island with 'mountains' spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are: Holyhead Mountain (); Mynydd Bodafon (); Mynydd Eilian (); Mynydd y Garn (); Mynydd Llwydiarth () and Parys Mountain (). To the south/south-east the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the Menai Strait, which at its narrowest point is about wide. To all other directions the island is surrounded by the Irish Sea.
Anglesey has several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated.
The largest towns are Holyhead, Llangefni, Benllech, Menai Bridge, and Amlwch. Beaumaris (Welsh: "Biwmares"), in the east of the island, features Beaumaris Castle, built by Edward I as part of his Bastide Town campaign in North Wales. Beaumaris acts as a yachting centre for the region, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of Newborough (Welsh: "Niwbwrch"), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of Llys Rhosyr, another of the courts of the mediaeval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. Llangefni is located in the centre of the island and is also the island's administrative centre. The town of Menai Bridge (Welsh: "Porthaethwy") (in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, in order to accommodate workers and construction. Up until that time Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies Bryn Celli Ddu, a Stone Age burial mound. Also nearby is the village with the longest official place name in the United Kingdom, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Near it is Plas Newydd, ancestral home of the Marquesses of Anglesey. The town of Amlwch is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century supporting the copper mining industry at Parys Mountain.
Other villages and settlements include Cemaes, Pentraeth, Gaerwen, Dwyran, Bodedern, Malltraeth, and Rhosneigr. The Anglesey Sea Zoo is a local tourist attraction, providing a look at and descriptions of local marine wildlife from lobsters to conger eels. All the fish and crustaceans on display are caught around the island and are placed in reconstructions of their natural habitat. They also make salt (evaporated from the local sea water) and breed commercially lobsters, for food, and oysters, for pearls, both from local stocks.
The island's entire rural coastline has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and features many sandy beaches, especially along its eastern coast between the towns of Beaumaris and Amlwch and along the western coast from Ynys Llanddwyn through Rhosneigr to the little bays around Carmel Head. The northern coastline is characterised by dramatic cliffs interspersed with small bays. The Anglesey Coastal Path is a path which follows nearly the entire coastline. Tourism is now the most significant economic activity on the island. Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the island's economy, with the local dairies being amongst the most productive in the region.
Major industries are restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi) which, until 30 September 2009, supported an aluminium smelter, and the Amlwch area, where the Wylfa nuclear power station is located close to a former bromine extraction plant. The nuclear power station is scheduled to operate until at least 2012, whilst the aluminium smelting operation closed down in September 2009, reducing its workforce from 450 to 80; this has been a major blow to the Island's economy, especially to the town of Holyhead. However, the local county council supports extending the closure deadline and building a new nuclear power station at Wylfa.
The Royal Air Force station RAF Valley (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and also 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment for approximately 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now home to the Headquarters of 22 Sqn Search and Rescue.
There is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly located in industrial and business parks especially at Llangefni and Gaerwen. These industries include an abattoir and fine chemicals manufacture as well as factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.
There is a nuclear power station, at Wylfa Head on the north coast. Wind power is developing on Anglesey, with more than 20 commercial wind turbines established near the north coast. The strong sea currents around the island are also attracting the interest of electricity generation companies interested in exploiting tidal power. Developing such low carbon energy assets to their full potential forms part of the Anglesey Energy Island project.
The island is also on one of the major routes from Britain to Ireland, via ferries from Holyhead, off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, to Dún Laoghaire and Dublin Port.
There are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as Llyn Llywenan, the largest natural lake on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. These are Llyn Alaw to the north of the island and Llyn Cefni in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the Afon Cefni.
The climate is humid (much less so than neighbouring mountainous Gwynedd) but generally equable under the effects of the Gulf Stream bathing the island. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost olive grove in Europe and presumably in the world.

Ecology and conservation.
Much of Anglesey is covered with relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming aided by modern agro-chemicals. In these areas the native vegetation and wildlife have essentially been destroyed. However there are a number of important wetland sites which have protected status. In addition the several lakes all have significant ecological interest including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the Malltraeth Marshes are believed to be supporting an occasional visiting bittern and the nearby estuary of the Afon Cefni supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of Charles Tunnicliffe, who lived for many years – and died at - Malltraeth on the Cefni estuary. The RAF airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for skylarks. The sheer cliff faces at South Stack near Holyhead provide nesting sites for huge numbers of auks including puffins, razorbills and guillemots together with choughs and peregrine falcons. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns – see Anglesey tern colonies. There are significant occurrences of the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow plant association, a habitat characterised by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the Roseate Tern.
Anglesey is home to two of the UK's small number of remaining colonies of red squirrels, at Pentraeth and Newborough.
Almost the entire coastline of Anglesey is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and was confirmed as such in 1967. It was so designated in order to protect the aesthetic appeal and variety of the island’s coastal landscape and habitats from inappropriate development.
The AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey’s coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The approximate coverage of the Anglesey AONB is 221 km², and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering as it does one third of the island.
A number of the habitats found on Anglesey are afforded even greater protection both through UK and European designations because of their nature conservation value, these include:
6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)
4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)
1 National Nature Reserve
26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)
These protected habitats support a variety of wildlife such as Harbour Porpoises and Marsh Fritillary.
The AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline which have been designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:
A living and working landscape.
Employment on Anglesey is mainly based on agriculture and tourism and in some cases a combination of both. The range of local produce found on the island is quite varied, from cheese and chocolate to wine. In a number of instances the local produce is also organic.
About two million people visit the island each year. In terms of recreation the island offers a number of opportunities to both residents and visitors alike, the majority enjoying the fine sandy beaches and the coastal landscape.
The most popular forms of recreation include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing. These all place pressures and demands on the AONB. At the same time, the AONBs popularity for such activities clearly provides a contribution to the local economy.

Geology.
The geology of Anglesey is notably complex and is frequently used for geology field trips by schools and colleges. Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old Precambrian rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:
These Precambrian rocks are schists and phyllites, often much contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west. A belt of granitic rocks lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from Llanfaelog near the coast to the vicinity of Llanerchymedd. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of Ordovician slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between Dulas Bay and Carmel Point. A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses Carboniferous rocks are found. The Carboniferous Limestone occupies a broad area south of Lligwy Bay and Pentraeth, and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by Llangefni to Malltraeth Sands. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow sandstone (sometimes considered to be of Old Red Sandstone age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast about Llanfihangel and Llangoed; and in the south-west round Llanidan on the border of the Menai Strait. Puffin Island is made of Carboniferous Limestone. Malltraeth marsh is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the Menai Strait. A patch of rhyolitic/felsitic rocks form Parys Mountain, where copper and iron ochre have been worked. Serpentine (Mona Marble) is found near Llanfair-yn-neubwll and upon the opposite shore in Holyhead. There is abundant evidence of glaciation, and much boulder clay and drift sand covers the older rocks. Patches of blown sand occur on the south-west coast forming a spectacular dune landscape.
Under the name "GeoMôn", and in recognition of its extraordinary geological heritage, the island gained membership of the European Geoparks Network in spring 2009. and the Global Geoparks Network in September 2010.
There are Google Earth files: Anglesey.kmz and Anglesey.kml, which show important geological locations on Anglesey, and include a number of geological map overlays, they can be downloaded from: Google Earth Geology, whereas a historiography of geological research on Anglesey is available at: Historiography of Geological Research.
Government.
Anglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, "Môn" often had periods of temporary independence as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub kingdom of Gwynedd. The last times this occurred were for a few years after 1171 following the death of Owain Gwynedd when the island was inherited by Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd and again between 1246 - c.1255 when it was given to Owain Goch as his share of the kingdom. Following the conquest of Wales by Edward I it was created a county under the terms of the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the "cantrefi" of:
In 1974 it formed a district of the new large county of Gwynedd, until in the 1996 reform of local government it was restored as a local government county. The county council is a unitary authority and is named "Isle of Anglesey County Council" (). In 2011, the Welsh Government appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members are not presently in control. The commissioners remained in control until an election was held in May 2013, restoring one again an elected Council. Prior to the direct administration, there were a majority of independent councillors, though members did not generally divide along party lines organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged after the election although the Labour party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.
Schools.
Secondary schools:
There are also 50 primary schools in Anglesey, all of which are co-educational day schools.
Transport.
By road, Anglesey is linked from Holyhead to the mainland by the A55 which leads to Chester. Also the A5 runs from the east of the island (Llanfairpwllgwyngyll) to Bangor and as far as St Albans via the Menai Bridge. The A5025, which runs around the northern edge of Anglesey, and the A4080, running around the southern edge form a ring around the island.
There are six railway stations in Anglesey: Holyhead, Valley, Rhosneigr, Ty Croes, Bodorgan and Llanfairpwll. All are on the North Wales Coast Line and services are operated by Virgin Trains to London Euston, and by Arriva Trains Wales to Chester, Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham New Street and Cardiff Central. Historically the island was also served by the Anglesey Central Railway which ran from Gaerwen to Amlwch and the Red Wharf Bay branch line between the Holland Arms railway station and Red Wharf Bay.
By air, Anglesey Airport has a twice daily scheduled service to Cardiff International Airport where connections worldwide can be made.
Holyhead Port is a busy ferry port handling more than 2 million passengers each year. Stena Line and Irish Ferries sail to Dublin and Dún Laoghaire in Ireland, forming the principal link for surface transport from central and northern England and Wales to Ireland.
Sport.
Anglesey is independently represented in the Island Games (under its Welsh name "Ynys Môn"). The team finished joint 17th in the 2009 Games hosted by Åland, winning medals in gymnastics, sailing and shooting.
Anglesey made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2009 games, led by Ynys Môn MP Albert Owen. The island expected to benefit from more than £3m of spending if it had hosted the event. However, Anglesey currently lacks two facilities necessary for a successful bid, a six-lane competition swimming pool and an athletics track.
Anglesey Hunt.
The Anglesey Hunt, formed in 1757, was the second oldest fox hunting association in Wales (the oldest being the Tivyside Hunt in Cardiganshire).
Cricket.
The Beaumaris Cricket Club was formed in 1858. Clubs at Holyhead, Amlwch, and Llangefni were formed within the following decade, but it wasn't until the 1880s that the sport became popular outside of the upper classes.
Football.
Several precursors to association football were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, at the turn of the 18th century, described a game in Llandrygan as ending with "[n]umbers of players […] left here and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured.". William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting "as good friends as they came, after they had spend half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale […] having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily".
Association football arrived on the island in the 1870s. It was initially met with resistance, given its perceived (by the islanders) associations with drunkenness and rowdiness, and the lower classes. One critic dismissed it as "unchristian practice". The Anglesey League, comprising teams from Amlwch, Beaumaris, Holyhead, Menai Bridge, Llandegfan, and Llangefni, was, however, formed in the 1895–1896 football season.
The Ynys Môn football team represents the island of Anglesey at the biannual Island Games, winning Gold in 1999.
Llangefni Town are reigning Cymru Alliance champions, only failing promotion due to the restructuring of the Welsh Premier League. Similarly, Holyhead Hotspur and Llanfairpwll were relegated despite finishing outside the usual relegation zone at the end of the 2009-10 season.
Athletics.
Every September the Anglesey Festival of Running takes place. There is a marathon, half-marathon, 10 km and 5 km race, as well as children's contests. Their slogan is "Run the Island".
Climbing.
Anglesey has some of Britain's most challenging cliff and crag climbs.
Motorsport.
The Anglesey Circuit (Welsh: Trac Môn) is a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit, it opened in 1997.
Rugby.
Llangefni RFC is the island's highest competing team in the WRU Division One North.
Llangoed hosts an annual rugby sevens contest. Touring sides have included Manhattan RFC.
Sailing.
The Royal Anglesey Yacht Club hosts the Menai Strait Regatta yearly.
Swimming.
Anglesey is Wales's largest island, separated from the mainland by the Menai Strait. The Straits host two annual open-water swimming contests; the Menai Strait Swim from Foel to Caernarfon (1 mile), and the Pier to Pier Open Water Swim, between Beaumaris and Garth Pier, Bangor.

Kesatuan Gurita

Kesatuan Gurita (Octopus Squad) is an Indonesian Naval Special Forces unit based in Jakarta. Their primary role is off-shore counter-terrorism against shipping and oil installations. The units draws its troops from Indonesian Marine Corp soldiers.
Kesatuan Gurita is made up of eight regiments, each with 50 Marines. The 400 specialists live in almost total isolation, secluded from family members and outside media during their four year tour with the unit. The specialists are forbidden, under threat of forcible removal of finger and toe nails, from speaking of their work even after they finish their tour of duty. The Indonesian Navy implants sensors in the neck of the soldiers, allowing monitoring of speech from the beginning of their tour to the time of the specialist's death.
The unit is made up entirely of men, after a change in policy in 1988, which excluded women from serving in Kesatuan Gurita. Prior to the policy change women and men served side by side. The change in policy, which was controversial at the time and continues to spark controversy in Indonesia from time to time, stemmed from a pregnancy that occurred in 1986 in one of the women serving in the unit. While there was no formal policy forbidding frateranization between soldiers, leadership in the Indonesian Navy felt that the temptation was too great to have men and women serving together, bunking side by side, and in total seclusion. The leadership also felt that the risk of fetal harm was too great and indicated in an official statement that "the value of a non-terrorist human life, especially one that has yet to sin, is too great to compromise in the world of explosives, bio-chemical terror agents, and elements that we may not even know yet." There was a significant outcry from the 132 women who were in the unit and not pregnant, as they had to be reassigned to different areas within the military. One female soldier, who appeared on television without releasing her identity, said, "We are trained couter-terrorism agents. We take precautions everywhere we go, in every activity. I wear three weapons when I go to the grocery store. The fact that this (expletive deleted) couldn't take the simple and obvious precation to prevent pregnancy when she was just scratching an itch is disappointing. That I have to give up a position I have trained my entire life for because two people were thinking with parts other than their brains is infuriating."

Moshe Shahal (, born 20 May 1934) is a former Israeli politician.
Biography.
Born in Baghdad in Iraq, Shahal made aliyah in 1950. He studied economics and Political Science at the University of Haifa, before graduating with a law degree from Tel Aviv University.
He began his political career when elected to the Haifa Labor Council in 1964, a position he retained until 1971. Between 1964 and 1969, he was also a member of Haifa City Council. For the 1969 Knesset elections he was placed 57th on the Alignment's list, but missed out when the alliance won only 56 seats. Nevertheless, Shahal entered the Knesset on 1 September 1971 as a replacement for the deceased Mordechai Ofer. 
He was re-elected in 1974, 1977, 1981, and between 1981 and 1984, served as a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset. After a fourth re-election in 1984, he was appointed Minister of Energy & Infrastructure. He was re-appointed to the post following the 1988 elections, serving until the Alignment pulled out of the coalition government in 1990. 
Following Labour's victory in the 1992 elections, Shahal was appointed to two posts in the cabinet; Minister of Communications and Minister of Police. He held the Communications portfolio until 7 June 1993, when he was replaced by Shulamit Aloni. However, he regained the Energy and Construction post at the same time, though he gave it up in January 1995, when Gonen Segev (a new addition to Yitzhak Rabin's government) replaced him. Shahal retained the Police Ministry following Rabin's assassination, when it was renamed the Ministry of Public Security.
Although he retained his seat in the 1996 elections and Labour remained the largest party, Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud formed the government, and Shahal lost his place in the cabinet. He resigned from the Knesset on 20 March 1998 and was replaced by Rafik Haj Yahia.
Whilst serving as an MK, Shahal was a permanent observer to the Council of Europe (1974–76) and a permanent representative to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (1976–84). Outside the Knesset, he also served as a chairman of the Israel Consumer's Council.

Sveriges Riksbank

Sveriges Riksbank, or simply Riksbanken, is the central bank of Sweden. It is the world's oldest central bank and the world's 4th oldest bank still in operation. It is sometimes called the Swedish National Bank or the Bank of Sweden (not to be confused with Swedbank, a retail bank).
History.
The Riksbank began its operations in 1668, its antecedent being "Stockholms Banco" (also known as the "Bank of Palmstruch"), which was founded by Johan Palmstruch in 1656. Although the bank was private, it was the king who chose its management: in a letter to Palmstruch, he gave permission to its operations according to stated regulations. 
However, Stockholms Banco, the world's oldest note-issuing bank, collapsed as a result of the issuing of too many notes without the necessary collateral. Palmstruch, who was considered responsible for the bank's losses, was condemned to death, but later received clemency. On 17 September 1668, the privilege of Palmstruch to operate a bank was transferred to the "Riksens Ständers Bank" (translation: Bank of the Estates of the Realm) and was run under the auspices of the parliament of the day. Due to the failure of Stockholm Banco, the new bank was managed under the direct control of the Riksdag of the Estates to prevent the interference of the king. When a new Riksdag was instituted in 1866, the name of the bank was changed to Sveriges Riksbank. 
Having learnt the lesson of the Stockholms Banco experience, the Riksbank was not permitted to issue bank-notes. Nevertheless, in 1701, permission was granted to issue so called "credit-notes". Some time in the middle of the 18th century, counterfeit notes began appearing, which caused serious problems. To prevent forgeries, it was decided that the Riksbank should produce its own paper for bank-notes and a paper-mill, Tumba Bruk, was founded in Tumba, on the outskirts of Stockholm.
A few years later, the first commercial banks were founded and these were also allowed to issue bank-notes. The bank-notes represented a claim to the bank without interest paid, and thus became a considerable source of income to the banks. Nonetheless, security in the form of a deposit at the Riksbank was required to cover the value of all notes issued. 
During the 19th century, the Riksbank maintained a dominant position as a credit institution and issuer of bank-notes. The bank also managed national trade transactions as well as continuing to provide credit to the general public. The first branch-office was opened in 1824, later followed with subsidiary branches opening in each county ("län"). The present operational activities as a central bank differ from those during the 19th century. For example, no interest-rate related activities were conducted. 
The position of the Riksbank as a central bank dates back to 1897, when the first "Riksbank Act" was accepted concurrently with a law giving the Riksbank the exclusive right of issuing bank-notes. This copyright concluded its role and importance regarding monetary policy in a modern sense, as the exclusive right to issue notes is a condition when conducting monetary policy and defending the value of a currency. Behind the decision were repeated demands that the private banks should cease to issue notes as it was considered that the ensuing profits should befall the general public.
The Swedish currency was backed by gold and the paper-certificates could be exchanged for gold coins until 1931, when a specialized temporary law was written to free the bank from this obligation. This law was renewed every year until the new constitution was ratified in 1975 which split the bank from the government into a stand-alone organization not obligated to exchange notes for gold.
In November 1992, the fixed exchange rate regime of the Swedish Krona collapsed. A few months later, in January 1993, the Governing Board of the Riksbank developed a new monetary policy regime based on a floating exchange rate and an inflation target. These policies were extensively influenced by assistance from the Bank of Canada, which had extensive previous experience controlling inflation, while similarly being a small open economy, heavily subject to foreign exchange rate swings.
From 1991–93, Sweden experienced the most severe recession since the 1930s. The recession in the early 1990s forced inflation down to around 2%. The rate of inflation continued to be low during the subsequent years of strong growth in the late 1990s.
During the 2000s, the operations and administrative departments were down-sized on behalf of the policy departments Financial Stability Department and Monetary Policy Department. A direct consequence of the changing times was that the Riksbank closed down all its branches in Sweden and outsourced the handling of coins and bills to a private company. Today the policy departments are the core of the central bank and they employ about half of the bank's 350 full-time posts.
Motto.
The motto of the Bank is "Hinc robur et securitas", which is latin for "Herefore strength and safety".
Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.
Following its third centennial in 1968, the Bank instituted the annual Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which is awarded with the Nobel Prizes at the Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm, on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
Negative Interest Rate.
In July 2009 Sweden's Riksbank was the first central bank to use a negative interest rate, lowering its deposit rate to −0.25%, a policy advocated by deputy governor Lars E. O. Svensson. to counter economic slowdown due to the financial crises of 2008. The deposit rate is the interest (or in this case, "penalty") commercial banks get for depositing capital at the Riksbank overnight. The lending rate, i.e. the interest commercial banks have to pay for "borrowing" money, was still positive, at 0.75 percent.

Marie Heim-Vögtlin

Marie Heim-Vögtlin (7 October 1845, Bözen – 7 November 1916, Zürich) was the first female Swiss physician, a writer and a co-founder of the first Swiss gynaecological hospital.
Education.
Born as the daughter of the pastor of Bözen, Marie Vögtlin benefited from a private education in the Romandie and in Zürich. In 1867, her fiancé, a student of medicine, broke off the engagement. He married Nadezhda Suslova, Europe's first female physician, instead. In response and with the reluctant support of her father, Vögtlin applied for admission herself to the study of medicine at the University of Zürich, which had been the first medical faculty in Europe to admit women. This caused a national scandal, as previously only a few "impudent" foreign women such as Suslova had been matriculated there. 
At the university, Vögtlin and her few fellow women students benefited from particular support by the faculty, even as many conservatives decried the medical education of women as shameful and as a waste of time. After Vögtlin passed the examinations with honours, she studied gynaecology in Leipzig and worked in a Dresden maternity ward. On 11 July 1874 she attained her doctorate in Zürich with a dissertation on the topic of the state of the female genitalia in labour. It required the intervention of her father for her to obtain an official permission to practice medicine in Zürich.
Professional and family life.
Although her practice had few clients at first, Vögtlin soon acquired a reputation as a capable and well-liked physician, and was particularly noted for her generosity towards poor women. 
In 1875, she married the noted geologist Albert Heim after he had given his permission (as required by law at that time) for her to continue working after marriage. The couple had two children, Arnold and Helene, and also cared for a foster child. In 1916, Marie Heim-Vögtlin died of a lung disease.
Social activism.
Marie Heim-Vögtlin was a co-founder of the "Schweizerische Pflegerinnenschule mit Spital," Switzerland's first gynaecological hospital, which also featured a maternity ward and nurses' school. After the school opened in 1901, she served as its bursar. She was an active participant in the women's suffrage and temperance movements and published several works, mostly popular writings for women and children.
Honours.
The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) has named a women's scholarship in Marie Heim-Vögtlin's honour. In 1995, a lane near the Zürich women's hospital was named after her.

<doc id="18932365" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932365" title="Copyright Term Extension Act">
Copyright Term Extension Act

The Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) of 1998 extended copyright terms in the United States. Since the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright would last for the life of the author plus 50 years, or 75 years for a work of corporate authorship. The Act extended these terms to life of the author plus 70 years and for works of corporate authorship to 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever endpoint is earlier. Copyright protection for works published prior to January 1, 1978, was increased by 20 years to a total of 95 years from their publication date.
This law, also known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Sonny Bono Act, or (derisively) the Mickey Mouse Protection Act, effectively "froze" the advancement date of the public domain in the United States for works covered by the older fixed term copyright rules. Under this Act, additional works made in 1923 or afterwards that were still protected by copyright in 1998 will not enter the public domain until 2019 or afterward (depending on the date of the product) unless the owner of the copyright releases them into the public domain prior to that. Unlike copyright extension legislation in the European Union, the Sonny Bono Act did not revive copyrights that had already expired. The Act did extend the terms of protection set for works that were already copyrighted, and is retroactive in that sense. However, works created before January 1, 1978, but not published or registered for copyright until recently, are addressed in a special section () and may remain protected until the end of 2047. The Act became on October 27, 1998.
Background.
Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the signatory states are required to provide copyright protection for a minimum term of the life of the author plus fifty years, but they are permitted to provide for a longer term of protection. Following the 1993 Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection, member states of the European Union implemented protection for a term of the author's life plus seventy years. The United States did not become a Berne signatory until 1988, but had previously provided for the minimum copyright term the convention required in the Copyright Act of 1976.
After the United States' accession to the Berne convention, a number of copyright owners successfully lobbied the U.S. Congress for another extension of the term of copyright, to provide for the same term of protection that exists in Europe. The act was named in memory of the late Congressman Sonny Bono, who died nine months before the act became law: he had previously been one of twelve sponsors of a similar bill.
The United States legislators ignored the spirit of the European legislation, which added 15 years to the term to account for the two world wars. America's war experience was substantially different than Europe's. This 15 years was intended to be temporary in Europe, but became permanent in the United States.
House members sympathetic to restaurant and bar owners, who were upset over ASCAP and BMI licensing practices, almost derailed the Act. As a result, the bill was amended to include the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, which exempted smaller establishments from needing a public performance license to play music.
Both houses of the United States Congress passed the act as Public Law 105-298 with a voice vote. President Bill Clinton signed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 on October 27, 1998.
Political climate.
Senate Report 104-315.
The Senate Report gave the official reasons for passing copyright extension laws and was originally written in the context of the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995, .
The authors of the report believed that extending copyright protection would help the United States by providing more protection for their works in foreign countries and by giving more incentive to digitize and preserve works since there was an exclusive right in them. The report also included minority opinions by Herb Kohl and Hank Brown, who believed that the term extensions were a financial windfall to current owners of copyrighted material at the expense of the public's use of the material.
Support.
The Walt Disney Company lobbied extensively on behalf of the Act, which delayed the entry into the public domain of the earliest Mickey Mouse movies, leading to the nickname "The Mickey Mouse Protection Act". In addition to Disney, California congresswoman Mary Bono (Sonny Bono's widow and Congressional successor), and the estate of composer George Gershwin supported the act. Mary Bono, speaking on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, said:
Proponents of the Bono Act argue that it is necessary given that the life expectancy of humans has risen dramatically since Congress passed the original Copyright Act of 1790, that a difference in copyright terms between the United States and Europe would negatively affect the international operations of the entertainment industry, and that some works would be created under a longer copyright that would never be created under the existing copyright. They also claim that copyrighted works are an important source of income to the US and that media such as VHS, DVD, Cable and Satellite have increased the value and commercial life of movies and television series.
Proponents contend that Congress has the power to pass whatever copyright term it wants because the language "To promote the progress of science and useful arts" in the United States Constitution is not a substantive limitation on the powers of Congress, leaving the sole restriction that copyrights must only last for "limited times." However, in what respect the granted time must be limited has never been determined, thus arguably even an absurdly long, yet finite, duration would still be a valid "limited time" according to the letter of the Constitution as long as Congress was ostensibly setting this limit to promote the progress of science and useful arts. This was one of the arguments that prevailed in the "Eldred v. Ashcroft" case, when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the CTEA. It is also pointed out by proponents that the extension did not prevent all works from going in the public domain. They note that the 1976 Copyright Act established that unpublished works created before 1978 would still begin entering the public domain January 1, 2003 (Known author: life of the author plus 70 years; anonymous/pseudoanonymous/unknown author/works-for-hire: 120 years from creation), and that the provision remained unaffected by the 1998 extension. They also claim that Congress has actually increased the scope of the public domain since, for the first time, unpublished works will enter the public domain.
Proponents believe that copyright encourages progress in the arts. With an extension of copyright, future artists have to create something original, rather than reuse old work, however, had the act been in place in the 1960s, it is unlikely that Andy Warhol would have been able to sell or even exhibit any of his work, since it all incorporated previously copyrighted material. Proponents contend that it is more important to encourage all creators to make new works instead of just copyright holders.
Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows. One example given is the case of the classic film "It's a Wonderful Life". Before Republic Pictures and Spelling Entertainment (who owned the motion picture rights to the short story and the music even after the film itself became public domain) began to assert their rights to the film, various local TV stations and cable networks broadcast the film endlessly. As New York Times reporter Bill Carter put it: "the film's currency was being devalued."
Many different versions of the film were made and most if not all were in horrible condition. After underlying rights to the film were enforced, it was given a high quality restoration that was hailed by critics. In addition, proponents note that once a work falls into the public domain there is no guarantee that the work will be more widely available or cheaper. Suggesting that quality copies of public domain works are not widely available, they argue that one reason for a lack of availability may be due to publishers' reluctance to publish a work that is in the public domain for fear that they will not be able to recoup their investment or earn enough profit.
Proponents reject the idea that only works in the public domain can provide artistic inspiration. They note that opponents fail to take into account that copyright applies only to expressions of ideas and not the ideas themselves. Thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works as long as they don't infringe. Borrowing ideas and such are common in film, TV and music even with copyrighted works (see Scènes à faire, Idea-expression divide and stock character). Works such as parody benefit from fair use.
Proponents also question the idea that extended copyright is "corporate welfare." They state that many opponents also have a stake in the case, claiming that those arguing against copyright term extension are mostly businesses that depend on distributing films and videos that have lost their copyright.
Opposition.
Dennis S. Karjala, a law professor, led an effort to try to prevent the CTEA from being passed. He testified before the Committees on the Judiciary arguing "that extending the term of copyright protection would impose substantial costs on the United States general public without supplying any public benefit. The extension bills represent a fundamental departure from the United States philosophy that intellectual property legislation serve a public purpose." An Editorial in "The New York Times" argued against the copyright extension on February 21, 1998. The article stated "When Senator Hatch laments that George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" will soon 'fall into the public domain,' he makes the public domain sound like a dark abyss where songs go, never to be heard again. In fact, when a work enters the public domain it means the public can afford to use it freely, to give it new currency."
Opponents of the "Bono Act" consider the legislation to be corporate welfare and have tried (but failed) to have it declared unconstitutional, claiming that such an act is not "necessary and proper" to accomplishing the Constitution's stated purpose of "promot the progress of science and useful arts". They argue that most works bring most of the profits during the first few years and are pushed off the market by the publishers thereafter. Thus there is little economic incentive in extending the terms of copyrights except for the few owners of franchises that are wildly successful, such as Disney. They also point out that the Tenth Amendment can be construed as placing limits on the powers that Congress can gain from a treaty. More directly, they see two successive terms of approximately 20 years each (the Copyright Act of 1976 and the Bono Act) as the beginning of a "slippery slope" toward a perpetual copyright term that nullifies the intended effect and violates the spirit of the "for limited times" language of the United States Constitution, Article I, section 8, clause 8.
They question the proponents' life expectancy argument, making the comparison between the growth of copyright terms and the term of patents in relation to the growth of life expectancies. Life expectancies have risen from about 35 years in 1800 to 77.6 years in 2002. Considering the increase in life expectancies during that period of time was a bit more than double but the copyright terms have increased threefold from only 28 years total (under the Copyright Act of 1790) presents an apparent discrepancy. While copyright terms have increased significantly since the 1790 act, terms of patents have not been extended in parallel; patents adequately reward investment in the field with their mere 20-year term. Moreover, life expectancy statistics are skewed due to historically high infant mortality rates. Correcting for infant mortality, life expectancy has only increased by fifteen years between 1850 and 2000.
Opponents also argue that the Act encourages "offshore production." For example, derivative works could be created outside the United States in areas where copyright would have expired, such works advancing science or the useful arts, and that US law would prohibit these works to US residents. For example, a movie of Mickey Mouse playing with a computer could be legally created in Russia and children worldwide could possibly benefit from watching it, but the movie would be refused admission for importation by US Customs because of copyright, resulting in a deprivation to American children. Similarly, the first Winnie-the-Pooh book was published in 1926 and would have been public domain in 2001.
Opponents identify another possible harm from copyright extension: loss of productive value of private collections of copyrighted works. A person who collected copyrighted works that would soon "go out of copyright," intending to re-release them on copyright expiration, lost the use of his capital expenditures for an additional 20 years when the Bono Act passed. This is part of the underlying argument in Eldred v. Ashcroft. The Bono Act is thus perceived to add an instability to commerce and investment, areas which have a better legal theoretical basis than intellectual property, whose theory is of quite recent development and is often criticized as being a corporate chimera. Conceivably, if one had made such an investment and then produced a derivative work (or perhaps even re-released the work "in ipse"), he could counter a suit made by the copyright holder by declaring that Congress had unconstitutionally made, ex post facto, a restriction on the previously unrestricted.
Opponents also question the proponents' "new works would not be created" argument: the hidden presumption that the goal is to make the creation of new works possible. However, the authors of the United States Constitution evidently thought that unnecessary, instead restricting the goal of copyright to merely "promotthe progress of science and useful arts". In fact, some works created under time-limited copyright would not be created under perpetual copyright because the creator of a distantly derivative work does not have the money and resources to find the owner of copyright in the original work and purchase a license, or the individual or privately held owner of copyright in the original work might refuse to license a use at any price (though a refusal to license may trigger a fair use safety valve). Thus they argue that a rich, continually replenished, public domain is necessary for continued artistic creation.
March 25th, 1998 House Debate.
The House debated the Copyright Term Extension Act (House Resolution 390) on March 25, 1998. The term extension was almost completely supported, with only the mild criticism by Jim Sensenbrenner (Wisconsin) of "H.R. 2589 provides a very generous windfall to the entertainment industry by extending the term of copyright for an additional 20 years." He suggested that it could be balanced by adding provisions from the Fairness in Music Licensing Act (H.R. 789). Lloyd Doggett (Texas) called the 'Fairness in Music Licensing Act' the 'Music Theft Act' and claimed that it was a mechanism to "steal the intellectual property of thousands of small businesspeople who are song writers in this land." The majority of subsequent debate was over Sensenbrenner's House Amendment 532 to the CTEA. This amendment was over details of allowing music from radio and television broadcasts in small businesses to be played without licensing fees. An amendment to Sensenbrenner's amendment was proposed by Bill McCollum. The key differences between Sensenbrenner's proposal and McCollum's amendment were 1) local arbitration versus court lawsuits in rate disagreements, 2) all retail businesses versus only restaurants and bars, 3) 3500 square feet of general public area versus of gross area, 4) which music licensing societies it applied to (all versus ASCAP and BMI), and 5) freedom from vicarious liability for landlords and others leasing space versus no such provision. After debate (and the first verse of American Pie) the McCollum Amendment was rejected in by 259 to 150 and the Sensenbrenner amendment was passed by 297 to 112. The Copyright Term Extension Act H.R. 2589 was passed.
The term extension was supported for two key reasons. First, "copyright industries give us [(the United States)] one of our most significant trade surpluses." Second, the recently enacted legislation in the European Union had extended copyright there for 20 years, and so EU works would be protected for 20 years longer than US works if the US did not enact similar term extensions. Howard Coble also stated that it was good for consumers since "When works are protected by copyright, they attract investors who can exploit the work for profit." The term extension portion was supported by Songwriters Guild of America, National Academy of Songwriters, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar Association, the Recording Industry Association of America, National Music Publishers Association, the Information Technology Association of America and others.
Challenges.
Publishers and librarians, among others, brought a lawsuit, "Eldred v. Ashcroft", to obtain an injunction on enforcement of the act. Oral arguments were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on October 9, 2002. On January 15, 2003 the court held the CTEA constitutional by a 7–2 decision.
The plaintiffs in the "Eldred" case have begun to shift their effort toward the U.S. Congress in support of a bill called the Public Domain Enhancement Act that would make the provisions of the Bono Act apply only to copyrights that had been registered with the Library of Congress.

Feist v. Rural

Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States establishing that information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright. In the case appealed, Feist had copied information from Rural's telephone listings to include in its own, after Rural had refused to license the information. Rural sued for copyright infringement. The Court ruled that information contained in Rural's phone directory was not copyrightable and that therefore no infringement existed.
Background.
Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc. is a telephone cooperative providing services for areas in northwest Kansas, with headquarters in the small town of Lenora, in Norton County. The company was under a statutory obligation to compile a phone directory of all their customers free of charge as a condition of their monopoly franchise. 
Feist Publications, Inc. specialized in compiling telephone directories from larger geographic areas than Rural from other areas of Kansas. They had licensed the directory of 11 other local directories, with Rural being the only hold-out in the region. Despite Rural's denial of a license to Feist, Feist copied some 4000 entries from Rural's directory. Because Rural had placed a small number of phony entries to detect copying, Feist was caught.
Prior to this case, the substance of copyright in United States law followed the sweat of the brow doctrine, which gave copyright to anyone who invested significant amount of time and energy into their work. At trial and appeal level the courts followed this doctrine, siding with Rural.
Ruling of the Court.
The ruling of the Court was written by Justice O'Connor. It examined the purpose of copyright and explained the standard of copyrightability as based on originality.
It is a long-standing principle of United States copyright law that "information" is not copyrightable, O'Connor notes, but "collections" of information can be. Rural claimed a collection copyright in its directory. The court clarified that the intent of copyright law was not, as claimed by Rural and some lower courts, to reward the efforts of persons collecting information, but rather "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" (U.S. Const. 1.8.8), that is, to encourage creative expression. 
Since facts are purely copied from the world around us, O'Connor concludes, "the sine qua non of copyright is originality". However, the standard for creativity is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a "spark" or "minimal degree" of creativity to be protected by copyright. 
In regard to collections of facts, O'Connor states that copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange them it would destroy the copyright owned in the data.
The court ruled that Rural's directory was nothing more than an alphabetic list of all subscribers to its service, which it was required to compile under law, and that no creative expression was involved. The fact that Rural spent considerable time and money collecting the data was irrelevant to copyright law, and Rural's copyright claim was dismissed.
Implications.
The ruling has major implications for any project that serves as a collection of knowledge. Information (that is, facts, discoveries, etc.), from any source, is fair game, but cannot contain any of the "expressive" content added by the source author. That includes not only the author's own comments, but also his choice of which facts to cover, his choice of which links to make among the bits of information, his order of presentation (unless it is something obvious like an alphabetical list), any evaluations he may have made about the quality of various pieces of information, or anything else that might be considered "original creative work" of the author rather than mere facts. 
For example, a recipe is a process, and not copyrightable, but the words used to describe it are; see idea-expression divide and "Publications International v Meredith Corp." (1996). Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe in your own words and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular cookbook, you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright in the choice of recipes and their "coordination" and "presentation", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation. It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under patent law. 
Feist proved most important in the area of copyright of legal case law publications. Although one might assume that the text of U.S. case law is in public domain, Thomson West had claimed a copyright as to the first page citations and internal pin-point page citations of its versions of court opinions (case law) found in its printed versions of the case law ("West's citation claims.") West also had claimed a copyright in the text of its versions of the case law, which included parallel citations and typographical corrections ("West's text claims.") The text claim would have barred anyone from copying the text of a case from a West case law reporter, since the copied text would include West enhancements to which West claimed copyright.
In a pre-Feist case, West's citation copyright claim had been affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in a preliminary injunction case in 1986 brought by West against Mead Data, owner of Lexis. "West v. Mead" (1986); however, in a case commenced in 1994 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found Feist to have undermined the reasoning in West v. Mead. West's citation claims were challenged in 1994 by legal publisher, Matthew Bender & Company and by a small CD-Rom publisher HyperLaw, Inc. HyperLaw intervened, joining Matthew Bender in the citation challenge and separately challenging West's text copyright claims. West was found by the Second Circuit in 1998 not to have a protectable copyright interest in its citations; neither to the first page citations nor to its internal pagination citations. See Matthew Bender v. West, Citation Appeal. The Second Circuit thereby rejected the 1996 determination of a Minnesota district court in Oasis Publishing Co. v. West Publishing Co., 924 F.Supp. 918 (D. Minn. 1996), that the outcome of West is not changed by Feist.
In the same case, but in separate decisions in which Matthew Bender was not involved, HyperLaw successfully challenged West's text claims. Judge John S. Martin ruled in favor of HyperLaw against West in a U.S. District Court decision in May, 1996. 
Matthew Bender v. West, No. 94 Civ. 0589, 1997 WL 266972 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 1997), "aff'd", 158 F. 3d 674 (2nd Cir. 1998), "cert. denied sub. nom." West v. Hyperlaw, 526 U.S. 1154 (1999). West lost to HyperLaw in its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and certiorari was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
After the 1986 West v. Mead decision, Mead Data and Lexis were acquired by Reed Elsevier, a large English-Dutch based publisher. During the Matthew Bender v. West case, Reed Elsevier and Matthew Bender entered into a strategic relationship, culminating in Reed Elsevier's acquisition of Matthew Bender in 1998, just after the Second Circuit appeals were argued. Reed Elsevier now was on the side of West and filed an amicus brief opposing HyperLaw and supporting West. Thus, although the name of the case might suggest that Matthew Bender challenged West on the text claim, by the middle of the case Matthew Bender was on the side of West on the text issue. Reed Elsevier's support of West's claims to a copyright in text was consistent with the initiatives, discussed below, to sidestep Feist by implementing database protection, through legislation and treaties discussed below. Similarly, during the case, West was acquired by the Canadian based international publisher, the Thomson Corporation.
Another case covering this area is "Assessment Technologies v. Wiredata" (2003), in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a copyright holder in a compilation of public domain data cannot use that copyright to prevent others from using the underlying public domain data, but may only restrict the specific format of the compilation, if that format is itself sufficiently creative. Assessment Technologies also held that it is a fair use of a copyrighted work to reverse engineer that work in order to gain access to uncopyrightable facts. Assessment Technologies also created new law, stating that it is a copyright misuse and an abuse of process if one attempts to use a contract or license agreement based on one's copyright to protect uncopyrightable facts.
In the late 1990s, Congress attempted to pass laws which would protect collections of data, but these measures failed. By contrast, the European Union has a sui generis (specific to that type of work) intellectual property protection for collections of data.
Other countries.
The applicability of copyright to phone directories has come up in several other countries. 
In Canada, the appeal-level case of "Tele-Direct (Publications) Inc. v. American Business Information Inc." (1997) 76 C.P.R. (3d) 296 (F.C.A.) reached a similar result to that of Feist. However, the Supreme Court partially backed away from the originality doctrine in "CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada". Under the CCH ruling, someone may assert protection in a database where the facts are themselves not copied from another source. For example, a person may assert protection in a collection of her own recipes, but she may not assert protection in a database of facts about persons and their ancestry compiled from census records.
In Australia, the Federal Court decision of "Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems" FCAFC 112 followed the UK approach in "Walter v. Lane" and ruled that copyright law did, in fact, follow the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. However, "Desktop v. Telstra" held, as did "CCH Canadian", that collections of facts must not be copied from other sources to be eligible for protection. In 2010, the Telstra decision was overturned in a ruling by Justice Gordon by Telstra v Phone Directories using the precedent of IceTV v Nine Network.
Relation with treaties.
Congress has been considering whether to implement a treaty negotiated at the World Trade Organization. Part of the Uruguay Round Agreement resulted in text which states, in Part II, Section 1, Article 10:
The text mirrors that of Article 2(5) of the Berne Convention, which applies to "collections of literary or artistic works".
This treaty provision is broadly in line with the United States Copyright Act and the Act's case law, which protects compilations of data whose "selection and arrangement" is sufficiently original. "See" ("compilation" as defined by the United States Copyright Act includes compilations of data). The standard for such originality is fairly low; for example, business listings have been found to meet this standard when deciding which companies should be listed and categorizing those companies required some kind of expert judgment. "See Key Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chinatown Today Pub. Enters.", 945 F.2d 509 (2d Cir. 1991) (applying "Feist"). As such, implementation of this treaty would not overrule "Feist".

Personal Retirement Savings Account

A Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) is a type of savings account introduced to the Irish market in 2003. In an attempt to increase pension coverage, the Pensions Board introduces a retirement savings account that would entice the lower paid and self-employed to start making some pension provision. The intention was for PRSAs to supplement any State Retirement Benefits that would be payable in years to come.
The product.
There are two types of PRSAs, Standard and Non-Standard. The "Standard PRSA" has a legal cap on charges. The maximum annual management charge is 1% and the maximum charge on each contribution is 5%. There can be no other charge applied to the setting up of a PRSA, unless it forms part of an overall financial review. In this case, a fee may be charged for the advice given. The Non-Standard PRSA can have charges higher than those stated for a Standard PRSA. 
A consumer can purchase a PRSA with or without advice. If the consumer does not need advice on the product or in selecting investment funds, they can buy a PRSA on an 'Execution Only' basis. The reward for the consumer in electing for this method of purchase is that they can buy the product without the 5% contribution charge.
The PRSA product can also be used to supplement existing pension funding by making additional voluntary contributions to the main pension scheme available through employment.
Payment.
The minimum contribution to a PRSA is €10 per month. This can be paid by salary deduction or through the contributors own bank account. If the contribution is deducted from salary, then any Tax and PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) Reliefs are applied at source so that the payments are made on a nett basis.
If payments are made from the contributors bank account, then any Tax or PRSI Reliefs that may be due would have to be applied for 'manually' through Revenue. Tax Relief and PRSI Relief are dealt with by two separate section of Revenue.
Employers' obligations.
Employers have to offer their employees the facility to put in place at least one Standard PRSA in situations where:
Employers are not obliged to make contributions to an employee's PRSA
Funds.
The PRSA contributor can select a single fund or combination of funds from those provided by each of the PRSA providers. They can also elect to choose a 'Default Investment Strategy' which is designed to fulfil the reasonable expectations of a typical investor.
Death before normal retirement.
The full value of the PRSA fund, without liability to income tax, is paid to the PRSA holders estate. Inheritance Tax may apply to the fund. The PRSA fund assets can be used to provide a pension for a spouse.
Tax.
There are certain Revenue limits that apply to the maximum contribution that can be made in any one tax year. These are dependent on the age of the contributor and their earnings (defined as net relevant earnings).
The Tax Relief available on contributions are granted at the contributors highest marginal rate of tax. For example, if an employees highest rate of income tax is 41% and they also pay PRSI of 6%, the nett cost on a contribution of €100 would be €53.
Any investment growth accumulates free of tax.
Contributors are entitled to 25% of their accumulated fund at retirement, tax-free. The balance of the fund is subject to the income tax rates prevalent at the date of retirement.
At retirement.
Most PRSA contributors elect to take 25% of their fund tax-free. If they do this they can either buy an annuity with the balance, invest in an ARF (Approved Retirement Fund) or a combination of both. Contributions can be made to a PRSA up to age 75, but must then be transferred to an annuity or ARF.

Everything2

Everything2 (styled Everything2), or E2 for short, is a collaborative Web-based community consisting of a database of interlinked user-submitted written material. E2 is moderated for quality, but has no formal policy on subject matter. Writing on E2 covers a wide range of topics and genres, including encyclopedic articles, diary entries (known as "daylogs"), poetry, humor, and fiction.
History.
The predecessor of E2 was a similar database called Everything (later labeled "Everything1" or "E1") which was started around March 1998 by Nathan Oostendorp and was initially closely aligned with and promoted by the technology-related news website Slashdot (by virtue of various key principals having attended the Holland Christian High School), even sharing (at the time) some administrators. The E2 software offered vastly more features, and the Everything1 data was twice incorporated into E2: once on November 13, 1999, and again in January 2000.
The Everything2 server used to be colocated with the Slashdot servers. However, some time after OSDN acquired Slashdot, and moved the Slashdot servers, this hosting was terminated on short notice. This resulted in Everything2 being offline from roughly November 6 to December 9, 2003. Everything2 was then hosted by the University of Michigan for a time. As the Everything2 site put it on October 2, 2006:
Now, we have an arrangement with the University of Michigan, located in Ann Arbor. We exist thanks to their generosity (which is motivated by their academic curiosity, I suppose). They gave us some servers and act as our ISP, free of charge, and all they ask in exchange is that we not display advertisements.
The Everything2 servers were moved to the nearby Michigan State University in February 2007.
E2 was privately owned by the Blockstackers Intergalactic company, but does not make a profit and is viewed by its long-term users as a collaborative work-in-progress. Until mid-2007 it accepted donations of money and, on occasion, of computer hardware but no longer does so. Some of its administrators are affiliated with Blockstackers, some are not. The site is not a democracy, and the degree to which users influence decisions depends on the nature of the decisions and the administrators making them. As of January 23, 2012, it was announced that the site had been sold to long-time user and coder Jay Bonci under the name Everything2 Media LLC.
Writeups in E1 were limited to 512 bytes in size. This, plus the predominantly "geek" membership back then and the lack of chat facilities, meant the early work was often of poor quality and was filled with self-referential humor. As E2 has expanded, stricter quality standards have developed, much of the old material has been removed, and the membership has become broader in interest, although smaller in number. Many noders prefer to write encyclopedic articles similar to those on Wikipedia (and indeed some actively contribute to both E2 and Wikipedia). Some write fiction or poetry, some discuss issues, and some write daily journals, called "daylogs." Unlike Wikipedia, E2 does not have an enforced neutral point of view. An informal survey of noder political beliefs indicates that the user base tends to lean left politically. There are conservative voices as well, however, and while debate nodes (of any kind, political or not) are rarely tolerated, well-formed points of view from any part of the political or cultural spectrum are.
Community.
Policies.
Some of the management regard Everything2 as a publication, to which authors submit content. Although Everything2 does not seek to become an encyclopedia, a substantial amount of factual content has been submitted to Everything2.
Policy states that "Everything2 is not a bulletin board." Writeups which exist as replies to other writeups, or which add a minor point to them or which otherwise do not stand well alone are discouraged, not least because the deletion of the original writeup orphans any replies. This policy helps to moderate flame wars on controversial topics.
Everything2 is not a wiki, and there is no direct way for non-content editors to make corrections or amendments to another author's article. Avenues for correction involve discussing the writeup with its author; petitioning a content editor; adding a note in a special "broken nodes" section; or superseding the original writeup with an original, stand-alone follow-up.
Code of behavior.
Like other online communities, E2 has a social hierarchy and code of behavior, to which it is sometimes difficult for a newcomer to adjust. Moreover, some people complain that new users are held to a different standard from established contributors, and that their writeups are singled out for deletion regardless of content. Another complaint is that all too often, site administrators remove articles that they do not agree with or which they do not see explicit value in, thus biasing the content of the database. Others dismiss such complaints as unjustified; they observe that few communities treat newcomers exactly like long-time members, and they claim that those who learn and obey the rules are usually—though not always—treated fairly.
There is no consistent, written site policy on acceptable behavior, although the usual intolerance for trolling or hatemongering remains, as is the case with most web-based communities. Bans have occurred for antisocial and/or insulting behaviour, albeit very rarely and only after a more personal approach to change the offender's behavior. Though these decisions are broadly accepted, some current and ex-members of the site believe that this amounts to mismanagement, and point to accumulation of disgruntled ex-users as evidence of a problem.
Rarely, a noder will request their E2 account be locked, preventing them from logging in. The causes for this are equally varied as the causes for disruptive noders being forcibly locked out, and happens about as often.
Nodes and writeups.
E2 users called "noders" create entries called "nodes" and add information in multiple "writeups." Only logged-in users can create writeups, and only the author of a writeup or an editor appointed by the site administrators can edit a writeup. E2 categorizes writeups into thirteen types: "person", "place", "idea", "thing", "dream", "personal", "fiction", "poetry", "review", "log", "recipe", "essay", and "event". Two additional writeup types, "lede" and "definition", are usable only by editors and are applied retroactively. Writeups are written in a simplified HTML dialect and do not contain images.
There are other types of nodes that do not contain writeups; for instance, the administrators can create "superdoc" nodes (similar to Wikipedia's ) such as Everything New Nodes and Page of Cool that allow interaction, and each user has a "homenode" where he or she can add a short autobiography or other text (or a picture, if the user has posted ten writeups—see Rewards, below).
Copyright practice.
The copyright in a writeup rests with the author, and no agreement to any kind of license is entered into by writing on E2 (except for giving the site permission to publish). Authors retain the right to place their work in the public domain, to release it under a copyleft license such as one of those offered by the GNU project or Creative Commons, or to request the removal of their work from the site at some later date.
For a long time, the posting of copyrighted song lyrics and poetry to the site without approval from the copyright holders, while certainly frowned upon, was not actually prohibited. E2 chose to only passively enforce copyright law, in a manner similar to an ISP (for which see OCILLA section 512(c)). This policy changed in August 2003 to a more active one where writeups containing copyrighted material had to either conform to fair use guidelines (length limits, proportion of quoted material to new text) or be posted with permission.
Rewards.
The administrators loosely based E2's incentive system on a dual currency system borrowed from many role-playing games. Users may earn experience points ("XP"), which count strictly toward level progress, or convertible currency ("GP"), which may be used to purchase lesser, temporary privileges. Every time a user creates a writeup, he or she earns five XP. Users with at least ten contributed writeups and 500 experience points can vote (up or down) on a writeup. A positive vote grants the writeup's author one experience point while also having a roughly ⅓ chance of giving one GP to the voter. After voting on a writeup, a noder can see the writeup's "reputation," or number of positive and negative votes (staff do not need to vote in order to see a writeup's reputation). The site's editors may remove writeups that do not meet editorial standards from public view. Authors have the ability to withdraw their own writeups. In both cases the removed writeup is sent to its author's personal "drafts" space, where it may be prepared for re-submission or deleted. The only effect writeup deletion has on the author's account is that the five XP granted for creating the writeup is removed. Writeups deleted before March 2011 are visible to the author on a legacy page called "Node Heaven"; newer or more recently removed items become drafts.
New levels are attained by reaching a predefined, but arbitrary total of XP and writeups, which are given in the FAQ. The system grants special powers at certain experience levels, such as "cool", which rewards the author with 20 XP and sends the writeup to the "cool user picks" column on the front page; the ability to create basic chat rooms on the site; space for uploading a picture to a user's "homenode"; and the ability to hide one's self in the list of logged-in users.
Website views used to be tracked, but due to a glitch this ability was removed. The glitch looped the view counter and crashed the site on more than one occasion.
Messaging.
Everything2 provides two communication tools: the Chatterbox and the message system.
The Chatterbox is similar to an IRC channel. It appears as a panel on the right side of the page that logged-in users can use to read conversations and participate in them. The site's administrators used to have the ability to "borg"—prevent from using the Chatterbox or message system—those users whose behavior violated the unwritten standards of politeness and decorum. This was done through a bot called EDB (short for "Everything Death Borg"), which announced when it had "swallowed" a user. These silencings lasted for five minutes, though persistent trolls were silenced for a longer period—sometimes permanently. As of 2003, the EDB was no longer much used, only making mostly token appearances for humorous effect. Noders who consistently cause trouble (usually by trolling) can be silenced permanently and can be forbidden from noding altogether, though this is rarely done.
The message system lets users send private messages to other users. The messages are stored in the user's mailbox to be read when he or she next logs in. The main use for the message system is giving constructive criticism to the author of a writeup; however, it can be and is used like any medium of private communication. Messages received can be archived or deleted at the receiver's discretion.
Links.
Hard links.
"Hard links" in E2 are simply words or phrases surrounded by brackets. Any words inside square brackets in a writeup will become a link to the E2 node of that title. If a node with that title does not yet exist, following the link will bring up the option to create it.
For the longest part of its existence, E2 did not permit links to third-party web sites in submitted content. In February 2009, a degree of support for linking external URLs was implemented. A hard linked URL will be clearly marked as an external link with the same link icon that Wikipedia uses. Heavy use of external URLs is discouraged as E2 content is expected to stand on its own within a largely self-supportive infrastructure.
Pipe links.
"Pipe links" are a variant form of hard links. While a hard link to the node "Wikipedia" would look like codice_1" The sentence looks like this to the reader: "Online encyclopedias have started to become common sources in my students' research papers." Rolling over the phrase with the mouse (e.g. "online encyclopedias") shows the hidden content (in this case, "Wikipedia") as the link's title.
Noders can link to a specific writeup within a node by appending "(person)", "(place)", "(idea)" or "(thing)" to a pipe link. For example, the pipe link codice_2 links directly to the writeup of the type "thing" within the "Wiki" node. If the node contains more than one writeup of the specified type, the pipe link returns a "Duplicates Found" page linking to every writeup of the specified type within the node.
Pipe links on E2 often add "easter egg" content, such as commentary, humor and hidden information.
Soft links.
At the bottom of every node, the system displays up to 64 "soft links", though each node can store an unlimited number thereof. "Guest Users"—any viewers not logged in—can see 24, a logged-in user can see up to 48, and the senior administrators ("gods," though this term has fallen out of favour in recent years) can see up to 64. These are two-way links intended to approximate "thought processes," similar in concept to Jason Rohrer's tangle proxy. Whenever a logged-in user moves from one node to another, be it through a hard link, another soft link, or through the title search box, the system creates (or strengthens) the bidirectional soft link between the two; however, some nodes—namely the special pages and the user profiles—will not display the soft links so created. By repeatedly moving from one node to another, users can and do deliberately create and increase the degree of integration of such soft links; some users will use these soft links to make anonymous comments on others' writing. The site's administrators have the ability to remove soft links at their discretion.
Firm links.
"Firm links" are special, editor-created links that serve to redirect between nodes. Firm links are typically used to link multiple forms of a single name or title to aid searching and ensure that readers find the content that they are seeking. A typical use of firm links would be to permanently link the empty node titled 'USA' to a node titled 'United States of America' that contained writeups about the topic. Alternatively, automatic forwarding can be set up for the same thing, in much the same way as forwards exist on Wikipedia.
Software.
E2 is run by the open source Everything Engine ("ecore"), a Perl-based system; its data is stored in a MySQL database.
Media coverage.
In 2001, "The New York Times" cited E2 as an example of an emerging class of autonomous, self-organizing sites. A 2001 column in "The Japan Times" called E2 "awe-inspiring in its expansiveness and depth" and "a Sim City of knowledge management". In 2003, Guardian Unlimited listed E2 as one of the best collaborative encyclopedias on the Web. E2 was nominated for a 2004 Webby Award for Technical Achievement.

HMS Rover (1796)

HMS "Rover" was a 16-gun sloop that the Royal Navy purchased in 1796, commissioned in 1798, and that was wrecked in early 1798. In her brief career she captured one French privateer. 
Design.
"Rover" was designed by Goodrich & Co., and Captain Francis Pender contracted her building in October 1795. She was initially planned as a brig, but during construction she was lengthened and given a full ship rig. An Admiralty Order of 10 November 1795 agreed the purchase, and she was added to the establishment by a second Admiralty Order dated 1 January 1796. She was purchased on the stocks and launched in 1796.
Service.
"Rover" was rated as a sloop and she was commissioned as such in April 1798 under Commander George Irwin.
On 16 May 1798 "Rover" was sailing towards Bermuda when she captured and sent in the French privateer sloop "Jean Bart". "Jean Bart" was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 57 men. She was last in Porto Rico and had captured three American ships:
Fate.
"Rover" was wrecked in the Gulf of St Lawrence on 23 June 1798, but her crew were saved. She was convoying the transport "Elizabeth" to Quebec when she entered a fog. The pilot got a brief sight of land that he believed was Scaterie Island. As a result, he was comfortable continuing to maintain course. When lookouts spotted breakers ahead early in the evening it was too late to turn her and she struck rocks on Cape Breton Island. Eventually a seaman was able to swim to shore with a line that the crew then used to leave "Rover", which was by then filling rapidly with water. All the men reached the shore and the crew finally abandoned her on 26 June, at which time they sailed her boats to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The court martial attributed the loss of "Rover" to a very strong current.

Sami Tchak

Sadamba Tcha-Koura (born 1960 in Bowounda), pen-name Sami Tchak, is a Togolese writer.
Biography.
After a dissertation in philosophy at the University of Lomé in 1983, Sami Tchak taught in a high school for three years. He arrived in France in 1986 to start his 
sociology studies, and obtained his PhD at the Sorbonne University in 1993. His research on prostitution carried him to Cuba for seven months in 1996, resulting in the publication of the essay "Prostitution à Cuba. Communisme, ruses and débrouilles" (foreword by the Cuban writer Eduardo Manet). The discovery of Mexican and Colombian culture significantly influenced his literary choices. These places and the great writers who come from them offered him new horizons of writing. 
Since the novel "Hermina", published by Gallimard in 2003, all his works take place in an imaginary Latin American setting, which actually is far more similar to Africa.
Besides the short stories and articles that has appeared in several magazines and revues, he has published six novels and four essays.
In 2004, Sami Tchak won the "Grand Prix of Black African Literature" for the entire range of his work. 
His novels have been translated into Spanish, German and Italian.

Kevin Borlée

Kevin Borlée (; born 22 February 1988, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert) is a Belgian sprinter, who specializes in the 400 metres. He was a semi-finalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2009 World Championships, and is the 2010 European Champion on this distance.
Kevin also takes part in the Belgian 4 x 400 m relay team. The team finished 5th at the 2008 Summer Olympics and 4th at the 2009 World Championships. The team won silver at the 2010 World Indoor Championships and bronze at the 2010 European Championships.
He qualified for the finals of the 400 metres at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Biography.
Early successes.
He has a twin brother, Jonathan, younger brother, Dylan, and a sister, Olivia, who are also sprinters. All four are trained by their father Jacques.
Just like his twin brother, Kevin obtained his first senior title at the age of 18: the Belgian Indoor championships in 2006 in Ghent, where he won the 400 m, while his brother won the 200 m. Later on, Kevin would add 3 more Belgian indoor titles: once more on the 400 m and two on the 200 m.
On May 31, 2008 Kevin and Jonathan took part in the 4 x 400 m on a meeting in Neerpelt. Together with Cédric Van Branteghem and Kristof Beyens, they improved a 27 year old national record by more than a second to 3:02.51s. However, this was 1 hundred of a second above the qualification time for the Olympic Games. Two weeks later, with Nils Duerinck instead of Kristof Beyens, they broke the national record again in a meeting in Namur to 3:02.13s.
National records at Summer Olympics in Beijing.
On August 19, 2008, during the semi-finals of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Kevin Borlée ran a new national record of 44.88s, improving the former record of Cédric Van Branteghem by 14 hundreds of a second. Despite he did not reach the final.
On the 4 x 400 m relay, with teammates Jonathan Borlée, Cédric Van Branteghem and Arnaud Ghislain, they qualified for the final with a new national record of 3:00.67s. They finished 5th in the final with yet again a national record of 2:59.37s. The race was won by the US team in 2:55.39s, a new Olympic record.
At the end of 2008, Kevin received the Belgian Golden Spike award.
Move to the United States.
At the end of 2008, Kevin Borlée moved together with his brother Jonathan to Tallahassee to enroll in Florida State University. During this period, Kevin qualified for the NCAA-championships in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Kevin finished 4th on the 400 m in 45.43s in a race that was won by his brother Jonathan in 44.78s, a new national record. Later on they had a big part in 4 x 400 m relay victory of Florida State with time of 2:59.59s, the second best season time.
A couple of months later, at the 2009 World Championships, Kevin reached the semi-finals on the 400 m with 45.28s. On the 4 x 400 m relay with team mates Antoine Gillet, Nils Duerinck and Cédric Van Branteghem (Jonathan was out with a stress fracture), they finished 1st in their heat with 3:02.13s and finished 4th in the final in 3:01.88s.
Identical injury.
Directly after the World Championships, it became clear that Kevin had sustained the same injury that ruled out his brother Jonathan 6 weeks earlier: a stress fracture on the tarsus. The story shows many similarities with the stress fracture of the tibia of the Swedish hurdles sprinters Susanna and Jenny Kallur. Both had the same injury at the different leg.
Silver at World Indoor Championships.
At the beginning of 2010, the Borlée-twins were back in shape. At the 2010 World Indoor Championships, the 4 x 400 m relay team with team mates Nils Duerinck and Antoine Gillet, they won their heat in 3:09.84s, a national indoor record. In the final, with Cédric Van Branteghem instead of Nils Duerinck, they won silver with a time 3:06.94s, another national record. It was the first time a Belgian relay team had ever delivered such a performance.
European Championships 2010.
At the 400 m of the European Championships in Barcelona, Kevin Borlée reached the final with two wins in the heats and the semi-finals in 45.71s and 45.32s respectively. In the final, Kevin seemed to fall back after a good start, but with an impressive sprint in the last 50 m, he passed the pack to win in front of Britain's Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney in 45.08s, a season's best. With this win, he is only the third Belgian male athlete to become a European Champion. The last one was Karel Lismont on the marathon in 1971, the first one Gaston Roelants in 1962 on the steeple chase. His brother Jonathan finished 7th in 45.35s.
The Belgian 4 x 400 m relay team, which besides Kevin included Antoine Gillet, Cédric Van Branteghem and Nils Duerinck, reached the final. With 3:03.49s, they had the fastest time. In the final Antoine Gillet and Nils Duerinck were replaced by Arnaud Destatte and Jonathan Borlée. The Belgian team won bronze in 3:02.60s.

Balassi Institute

The Balassi Institute is a worldwide non-profit cultural organization funded by the ministry of education and culture of Hungary. The institute spreads and promotes Hungarian language and culture aboard. The Institute plays a key role in developing and attaining Hungary’s objectives in the area of cultural diplomacy. As an organizational hub, it coordinates and directs all activities provided by Hungarian institutes abroad.
It is named after hungarian Renaissance lyric poet Bálint Balassi.
Bálint Balassi.
Bálint Balassi (1554–1594) was a Renaissance lyric poet and regarded as a Hungarian in the deepest sense, the first to write the words "my sweet homeland" in reference to Hungary, a phrase which became a renowned canon of patriotism in Hungarian literature throughout the centuries that followed. Born into one of the wealthiest and most powerful noble families of the country, with strong ties to the Habsburg court, Balassi was educated by the Protestant reformer Péter Bornemisza and was already writing notable verse at a very young age. Unfortunately, his short life was marked by financial ruin and a series of social failures: an unhappy marriage, unrequited love, slander, legal troubles and a less than prominent military career. He died early in the war against the Turkish occupation of Hungary during the siege of Esztergom.
Balassi was a true Renaissance figure, a child of his age, a noble writer who was reckless in romance and hot-tempered, but also a humanist with exceptionally refined taste. It was he who was responsible for the rebirth of Hungarian literature, transforming Latin into the Hungarian language, making him the second world-class Hungarian poet after Janus Pannonius. A worthwhile contemporary of Ronsard, Spenser and Sidney, he was a loyal adherent to the Neo-Platonic philosophy of love and Francesco Petrarch's mode of poetic expression, which he refreshed with local flavor and new poetic solutions. Having been influenced by German, Italian, Polish, Turkish and perhaps also Croatian, Balassi absorbed Neo-Latin poetry at an early age, and eventually came to hold the same position in the history of Hungarian literature as that of Petrarch in Italian literature. Poems had already been written in Hungarian before him, but Balassi's technique of literary expression – fictive lyrical autobiographies in cycles of verse – was his true innovative gift to Hungarian literature. According to traditional historic accounts, he assembled his poems together, written in "his own hand" shortly before or after he left Hungary for Poland in 1589. The unprinted volume circulated for years thereafter and comprised a collection of 100 poems that depicted Balassi as a heavenly version of himself; hopelessly struggling with love, losing to Cupid, burned on the pyre of passion, relinquishing Julia, leaving his homeland, searching for his old love in a new one, embarking on a pilgrimage through hell, arguing with God in poetic guilt. It was this "virtual" Balassi that took the place of the "real" unsuccessful one and sparked the imagination of subsequent generations. His students not only respected him as an emblematic figure of Hungarian literature (and of the Hungarian language in a broader sense), but also of culture, worthy of following as a European model for the renewal of civilized life.
The more we know about Bálint Balassi and his work, the more he seems to be a poet who transcended borders. He was literally born on a border, in the Northern Hungarian-Turkish territory near Poland. His mother-tongue was Hungarian, but he probably learned Slovakian and Polish from his nanny first. There is no doubting the honesty of his religious emotions, although he belonged to several denominations during his life - raised by a Lutheran, Calvinist parents, and then the influence of Jesuits during his adulthood. He lived for years with his father in the Court of Vienna and in the royal courts of Transylvania and Poland, perhaps becoming more familiar with the refined order of royal style and etiquette than any other Hungarian. His religious verse dealt with the passion of romance while his romantic poems used theological terms and soared to religious heights. Researchers have debated for years whether his descriptive language and place in Hungarian literature was that of the first Renaissance poet or that of the last troubadour. Whatever the case may be, Balassi was both archaic and ahead of his time, renewing contemporary fashion by reaching back to ancient sources and later incorporating features of Mannerism and Turkish poetic forms. Moreover, he did so in Hungarian, which offered no previous traditional model to follow. According to legend, he spoke seven languages in addition to his own: Latin, German, Italian, Slovakian, Polish, Turkish and Croatian. Bálint Balassi was not only the first, but also the most deeply European Hungarian poet, and to this day his work continues to exemplify the openness of Hungarian intellectual life to Europe and the world.

Activities.
Since 2002 the headquarters of the Balassi Institute is located at Somlói út 51, Budapest.
Cultural diplomacy.
Hungarian Cultural Institutes.
The first Hungarian institutes abroad, the so-called Collegium Hungaricum, were established by Kunó Klebelsberg (minister of culture at the time) in the 1920s in order to build relations with the international scientific community (in Vienna and Berlin in 1924, in Rome and Paris in 1927). Organising scientific life and education make up a fundamental part of the institutes’ activity even today. Apart from differences shaped by history, there are also variations in the scope of activities, services and equipment of the institutes. Some of them maintain libraries, Hungarian language teaching centers and galleries in addition to their primary work in culture, education and organising science.
The Balassi Institute has 23 branches in 21 countries around the world:
The network of the diplomats for culture and education.
Diplomats specialised in education and culture promote Hungarian culture and education in countries where no such institutional representation is ensured.
Diplomats operate at the following foreign representations:
Joint Institutes.
Joint institutes are independently functioning institutions abroad promoting Hungarian culture, involved in broadly defined Hungarian cultural diplomacy via partnership and joint institutional agreements with the Balassi Institute.
The aim of establishing the network was to enhance cooperation between coexisting institutions and the Balassi Institute in order to reach their shared strategic goals. Henceforth, the Balassi Institute supports certain programs of member insititutes as well as their cultural, scientific and educational projects and helps them build relations with private and public institutions in Hungary.
Members of the Network:
Education.
The Institute, as a center for education and scientific cooperation, fulfills a supporting, coordinating and funding function in the international network of Hungarian Studies institutions and in the teaching of Hungarian as a foreign language.
Methodology Center for Teaching Hungarian as a Second Language.
The Institute not only provides support for Hungarian language training abroad, it also offers a wide range of language programs within Hungary. At the Institute’s central branch located in Budapest, those wishing to learn Hungarian can choose from a unique selection of in-depth courses geared toward various levels. Thanks to its highly-trained, experienced staff of language teachers, the Balassi Institute is a leader in the methodology of teaching Hungarian as a Second Language. Its foremost task is not only to develop teaching materials for non-native speakers, but also to provide appropriate educational resources to teachers of Hungarian as a heritage language abroad. Other than the organization of seminars, conferences and training sessions, the publication of professional journals, e-textbooks and e-books also forms a vital part of the Institute’s mission.
Learning Opportunities for Foreign Citizens.
Programs either 10 months or 2-4 weeks in duration can be attended by scholarship or payment of tuition. Year-by-year, nearly 350 foreign students receive scholarships to participate in courses offered in Budapest. Students—who arrive from all around the globe—have the opportunity to experience life in Hungary first-hand, benefit from intense language training in the classroom and forge life-long friendships. Our recently established Balassi Alumni Program seeks to keep the network of former students alive.
Program in Hungarian Language and Hungarian Studies.
This course is open to foreign university students not of Hungarian descent; the purpose is to supplement language skills and cultural knowledge acquired at foreign universities. Completion of the internationally recognized ECL language exam is a requirement at the end of this intense language course. Hungarian Studies courses provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of Hungary’s cultural heritage as well as of Hungarian society today.
Program in Hungarian Language and Culture.
The purpose of this course is to strengthen the cultural identities of Hungarians living in diaspora communities. Young people of Hungarian descent—from outside the Carpathian Basin—are eligible for scholarships to this program. This specialized course focuses on increasing language competencies of speakers lacking formal education in Hungarian; the ECL language exam is a requirement for course completion. Participants receive a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of Hungary’s cultural heritage and Hungarian society today.
Literary Translation Program.
Non-Hungarian, foreign citizens can apply to this program, intended for those university graduates who have chosen the translation of Hungarian literature and the promotion of Hungarian culture abroad as the focus of their careers. While a practical introduction to literary translation forms the backbone of this program, in-depth instruction in Hungarian language and literature is also provided. The number of translations published throughout the years attests to the ability of the Institute’s literary translation alumni.
Preparatory Program for University Entry.
Thanks to a series of bilateral cultural agreements, many non-Hungarian, citizens are able to attend this program on a scholarship; while the Scholarship Board for Minority Hungarians provides financial support to students of Hungarian descent. This preparatory program enables foreign students to acquire the kind of technical vocabulary and language proficiency demanded by the advanced-level, university entrance exam. Students who successfully complete the final exam may gain entry to those B.A.-level courses listed in the call for grant applications.
The Guest Lecturer Network.
The Institute’s network of guest instructors provides support for the teaching of Hungarian Studies and Language at over 30 foreign universities.
Lecturers are sent from Hungary to participate in programs at nearly 30 universities throughout Europe, thereby establishing close relations between Hungary’s universities and the rest of the continent, while also laying the groundwork for future cultural and scholarly programs in the field of Hungarian Studies. Regularly held conferences, meetings and training sessions continue to further and deepen close professional exchanges.
Facilitating the teaching of Hungarology – also called Hungarian Studies- at foreign universities is at the forefront of the institute’s international activity. Throughout the world more than fifty universities offer Hungarian language classes and an opportunity to meet Hungarian culture at lectorates, Hungarian departments and specialised Hungarian courses included in other majors.
The Balassi Institute as a legal successor of the International Hungarology Center sends visiting professors to more than thirty universities, with an average of 1500-2000 students attending their courses annually. Visiting professors’ tasks, in addition to classroom teaching, involve joining research projects, encouraging building relations with Hungarian universities and colleges, urging students to go on study tours in Hungary, taking an active part in introducing Hungarian culture to foreigners and organising local cultural events.
Scholarships.
Hungarian Scholarship Board.
The Hungarian Scholarship Board (HSB) Office provides scholarships for studying and to research, based on bilateral agreements. Therefore hungarian students and researchers can apply to a foreign coutry, and foreigners can apply to Hungary.
Since January 2007 the Hungarian Scholarship Board Office operates under the auspices of the Balassi Institute.

Campus Hungary.
The Campus Hungary program aims to enhance international student mobility in higher education, both in terms of having more incoming foreign students to Hungary and also having more Hungarian students studying abroad. The program supports Hungarian students, academics and university staff with different kinds of scholarships for partial studies to study abroad and gain experience. The main goal of the program is to support and facilitate the internationalisation of Hungarian higher education by initiating and deepening cooperation with foreign higher education institutions and achieving knowledge exchange by means of student mobility.
The Campus Hungary program is executed with the financial support of the European Union in the framework of the Social Renewal Operational Program (TÁMOP) of Hungary. It is implemented by the consortium of the Balassi Insitute and the Tempus Public Foundation.

Publishing Hungary.
The Publishing Hungary Program was established by the National Cultural Fund of Hungary.
The main purpose of the program is to bring Hungarian publications — whether literary or non-fiction, recently published or classical works — to the attention of the international book trade and readers alike. From 2012 it will contribute 100 million forints yearly to the support of Hungary’s participation on international book festivals, an effort coordinated by the Balassi Institute and other Hungarian institutes abroad.

Tomomi Itano

Career.
In 2005, Itano joined the Japanese idol girl group AKB48 as part of the first team, Team A. She also modeled for the women's fashion magazine "Cawaii!", and released her first photo book titled "T.O.M.O.row" in April 2009. In early 2010, she played Shibuya in AKB48's TV Tokyo drama "Majisuka Gakuen". She had a recurring role on "Kamen Rider W" as Queen, alongside fellow AKB48 performer Tomomi Kasai, until the show ended in late 2010. Together, they made up the sub-unit Queen & Elizabeth. In AKB48's 2010 general election, she placed fourth overall.
Itano released her first single, "Dear J", on January 26, 2011. It reached number 1 on the Oricon daily ranking and number 2 on the Oricon weekly ranking, selling 204,981 copies. In April, she reprised her role as Shibuya in "Majisuka Gakuen 2". Her first digital single "Wanna Be Now" reached number 2 on Recochoku's daily charts and number 6 on the weekly charts. She placed eighth overall in AKB48's 2011 general election held in June. Her second single, "Fui ni", was released on July 13 and sold 90,103 copies, and reached number one on the Oricon weekly chart.
In 2012, Itano was cited as the "queen of TV commercials" for having more contracts with companies than any other female "tarento" (although her count of 20 was technically a tie with those of fellow AKB48 member Mariko Shinoda).
On February 1, 2013, during an AKB48 stage greeting, Itano announced she was leaving the group. She released her fourth solo single, "1%" on June 12. The title track was used in television commercials for Samantha Vega. The music video was shot in New York, and includes an appearance by the American actress and model Taylor Momsen. Itano had her farewell "graduation" ceremony at the Tokyo Dome on August 25, and a followup performance on August 27 at the AKB48 Theater; the performance was streamed live by Nico Nico Namahousou. Her graduation song is "Saigo no Door", which was released as a B-side on one of the editions of AKB48's single "Koisuru Fortune Cookie".

Juan Carlos Moreno Rodríguez

Juan Carlos Moreno Rodríguez (born 19 April 1975) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.
He appeared in 374 games in Segunda División over the course of 14 seasons, scoring 52 goals in representation of eight teams, mainly Numancia. In La Liga, he appeared for Barcelona and Numancia.
Football career.
Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Moreno was a product of FC Barcelona's youth academy. He appeared in seven first-team matches during the 1995–96 season, courtesy of manager Johan Cruyff, following which he would return to the B-side for three years.
Moreno went on to have several second division stints, mainly in his native region: Albacete Balompié, UE Lleida (twice), Recreativo de Huelva, CF Extremadura and Terrassa FC. For the 2003–04 campaign he joined CD Numancia, being an undisputed first-choice from the start and producing his best individual season in his first year, scoring nine goals in 41 games (3,476 minutes) as the club returned to La Liga after an absence of three years.
On 14 September 2008, as Numancia had achieved another top flight promotion, Moreno netted the opener in a 3–4 defeat at Real Madrid; during that season he was used somewhat regularly and scored three times, but the Soria side was relegated.
In the last day of the January transfer window in 2010, Moreno was loaned to FC Cartagena in division two, until the end of 2009–10. In June, aged 35, he retired, having appeared in 419 games during his 16-year professional career – scoring 56 goals – although only 45 in the first division, 38 of those with Numancia.

Seven (Enuff Z'nuff album)

Seven is the 7th studio album by American rock band Enuff Z'Nuff, which was originally released in Japan as ‘Brothers’ under the band name "Chip & Donnie" in 1994. Seven was initially intended to form one half of a double-album for the Japanese market, paired with the record that would eventually become the album Tweaked. The sessions were split into two separate discs, with the pop sounding ‘Brothers’ LP getting re-branded as an Enuff Z'nuff album in 1997 for its stateside release. As well as the re-titling and new artwork, Seven contains two bonus tracks not available on the original ‘Brothers’ disc.
On Seven the band adopted a more acoustic sound compared to Tweaked, which may be seen as its heavier counterpart. Several tracks on the album are also significant to the band’s history:
"Down Hill" is thought by lead singer Donnie Vie to possibly contain late guitarist Derek Frigo’s last studio recorded solo with the band. "You And I" was played by Donnie Vie at bassist Chip Z’nuff’s wedding reception. "It’s No Good," an acoustic concert staple, was later re-recorded by and featured on Donnie Vie’s solo album Extra Strength. Other notable tracks are the lead single "Wheels," which was covered in 1998 by Arista recording artists The Tuesdays and the John Lennon cover "Jealous Guy." Liner notes for the album were written by Rolling Stone Magazine editor, David Wild. 
Causing some confusion, Seven was later re-released under its original Japanese title, "Brothers" in the U.S. (featuring with new artwork and the Enuff Z'Nuff name) in 2008. The "Enuff Z'Nuff: Brothers" re-issue is the same as the original "Chip & Donnie" Japanese release in '94, meaning the bonus tracks from "Seven" are no longer present.

Just a Love Song... Christian Bautista Live!

Just a Love Song... Christian Bautista Live! is the first live album by Filipino singer Christian Bautista, released on January 24, 2007 in the Philippines by Warner Music Philippines. The album is composed of nineteen revival tracks from the 70's up to the 90's. It was recorded overnight at Teatrino, Greenhills, backed by basic rhythm section, a grand piano and a string section, while being watched by an audience composing of specially invited fans. It was released both in the Philippines and Indonesia in CD and DVD formats. To date, the album has been certified Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry.
A "Special Christmas Edition" of the album was released in October 2007, with a new track list. Five additional Christmas songs were included plus the standard edition of the album.
Background.
Initially, Bautista refused to create a whole revival album, saying "I (Bautista) didn’t want to seem to be jumping on the bandwagon [...] it was time for me to offer something new at this point (for his fans)".
A brainstorming session was then made between him, his managers and his record label, after which the final list of tracks for the album was made.
Reception.
Commercially, "Just a Love Song... Christian Bautista Live!" is the weakest-selling album by Bautista. Although, it still managed to reach Platinum status by the PARI. On March 11, 2007, the album was given a gold record award on "ASAP '07" for selling more than 15,000 units in the Philippines.
Critically, the album received favorable reviews. Resty Odon of "Titik Pilipino" gave the album four out of five stars, stating "In this live recording, he works on romantic tunes and tries earnestly to tug at the memory's heartstrings". However, he disliked the fourth song, "Beautiful in My Eyes", and thought it was out of Bautista's upper register range. The review ended up with Odon, saying " All in all, though, this is a memorable recording for this artist and especially his fans.

<doc id="18932568" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932568" title="Free software license">
Free software license

A free software license is a notice that grants the recipient of a piece of software extensive rights to modify and redistribute that software. These actions are usually prohibited by copyright law, but the rights-holder (usually the author) of a piece of software can remove these restrictions by accompanying the software with a software license which grants the recipient these rights. Software using such a license is free software.
Some free software licenses include "copyleft" provisions which require all future versions to also be distributed with these freedoms. Other, "permissive", free software licenses are usually just a few lines containing the grant of rights and a disclaimer of warranty, thus also allowing distributors to add restrictions for further recipients.
The most widely used free software license is the GNU General Public License.
History.
Free software licenses before the 1980s were generally informal notices written by the developers themselves. At that time, sharing of software was common in certain developer communities and there were even questions about whether copyright law applied to software, so licenses weren't written with a view to having to be defended in court. Copyleft not yet having been invented, these early licenses were of the "permissive" kind.
In the mid-1980s, the GNU project produced individual free software licenses for each of its software packages. The first, GCC General Public License, was applied to the GNU Compiler Collection and was initially published in 1987. The original BSD license is also one of the first free software licenses, dating to 1988. In 1989, version 1 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) was published. Version 2 of the GPL, released in 1991, went on to become the most widely used free software license. Starting in the mid-90s and until the mid-00s, a trend began where companies and new projects wrote their own licenses, or adapting others' licenses to insert their own name. This license proliferation led to problems of complexity and license compatibility. One free software license, the GNU GPL version 2, has been brought to court, first in Germany and later in the USA. In the German case the judge did not explicitly discuss the validity of the GPL's clauses but accepted that the GPL had to be adhered to: "If the GPL were not agreed upon by the parties, defendant would notwithstanding lack the necessary rights to copy, distribute, and make the software 'netfilter/iptables' publicly available." Because the defendant did not comply with the GPL, it had to cease use of the software. The US case (MySQL vs Progress) was settled before a verdict was arrived at, but at an initial hearing, Judge Saris "saw no reason" that the GPL would not be enforceable.
FSF-approved "free software" licenses.
Free Software Foundation, the group that maintains The Free Software Definition, maintains a non-exhaustive list of free software licences. The list distinguishes between free software licenses that are compatible or incompatible with the FSF licence of choice, the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license. The list also contains licenses which the FSF considers non-free for various reasons, but which are sometimes mistaken as being free.
OSI-approved "open source" licenses.
The group Open Source Initiative (OSI) defines and maintains a list of approved open source licenses. OSI agrees with FSF on all widely used free software licenses, but differ from FSF's list since the two organizations have different requirement for approving licenses.
Accepted restrictions.
Certain licenses restrict distribution in order to force derived projects to allow the freedom to use, study, modify, and redistribute the derived project. Some free software licenses carry requirements and restrictions which apply to distributors. There exists an ongoing debate within the free software community regarding the fine line between what restrictions can be applied and still be called "free".
During the 1990s, free software licenses began including clauses, such as patent retaliation, in order to protect against software patent litigation cases - a problem which had not previously existed. This new threat was one of the reasons for writing version 3 of the GNU GPL in 2006. In recent years, a term coined tivoization describes a process where hardware restrictions are used to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware, which the Tivo device is an example of. It is viewed by the FSF as a way to turn free software to effectively non-free, and is why they have chosen to prohibit it in GPLv3.
Copyleft.
The free software licenses written by Richard Stallman in the mid-1980s pioneered a concept known as "copyleft". Ensuing copyleft provisions stated that when modified versions of free software are distributed, they must be distributed under the same terms as the original software. This is sometimes referred to as "share and share alike" or ""quid pro quo"". This results in the new software being open source as well. This restriction is still usually called "Free Software".
Developers who use GPL code in their product must make the source code available to anyone when they share or sell the object code. In this case, the source code must also contain any changes the developers may have made. If GPL code is used but not shared or sold, the code is not required to be made available and any changes may remain private. This permits developers and organizations to use and modify GPL code for private purposes (i.e. when the code or the project is not sold or otherwise shared) without being required to make their changes available to the public.
Supporters of GPL claim that by mandating that derivative works remain under the GPL, it fosters the growth of free software and requires equal participation by all users. Opponents of GPL state that "no license can guarantee future software availability" and that the disadvantages of GPL outweigh its advantages. They also state that restricting distribution makes the license less free. Whereas proponents would argue that not preserving freedom during distribution would make it less free.
Patent retaliation.
Most newly written free software licenses since the late 1990s include some form of patent retaliation clauses. These measures stipulate that one's rights under the license (such as to redistribution), may be terminated if one attempts to enforce patents relating to the licensed software, under certain circumstances. As an example, the Apple Public Source License may terminate a user's rights if said user embarks on litigation proceedings against them due to patent litigation. Patent retaliation emerged in response to proliferation and abuse of software patents.
Hardware restrictions.
Version 3 of the GNU GPL includes specific language prohibiting additional restrictions being enforced by hardware restrictions and digital rights management (DRM), a practice FSF calls Tivoization.
Attribution, disclaimers and notices.
The majority of free software licenses require that modified software not claim to be unmodified. Some licenses also require that copyright holders be credited. One such example is version 2 of the GNU GPL, which requires that interactive programs that print warranty or license information, may not have these notices removed from modified versions intended for distribution.
Practical problems with licenses.
License compatibility.
Licenses of software packages containing contradictory requirements, render it impossible to combine source code from such packages in order to create new software packages.
For example, if one license says "modified versions must mention the developers in any advertising materials", and another license says "modified versions cannot contain additional attribution requirements", then, if someone combined a software package which uses one license with a software package which uses the other, it would be impossible to distribute the combination because these contradictory requirements cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. Thus, these two packages would be license-incompatible or in commercial organisations.
For this reason, such licenses are not considered free software by the standards of the FSF, OSI, Debian, or the BSD-based distributions.
The FSF's free software definition further states that development and distribution must not be restricted. Thus, commercial distribution of free software is acceptable and has become common.
Permissive versus copyleft opinions.
Many users and developers of BSD-based operating systems have a different position on licensing. The main difference is the belief that the copyleft licenses, particularly the GNU General Public License (GPL), are undesirably complicated and/or restrictive. The GPL requires any derivative work to also be released according to the GPL while the BSD license does not. Essentially, the BSD license's only requirement is to acknowledge the original authors, and poses no restrictions on how the source code may be used. As a result, BSD code can be used in proprietary software that only acknowledges the authors. For instance, the IP stack in Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 and Mac OS X are derived from BSD-licensed software.
Supporters of the BSD license argue that it is more free than the GPL because it grants the right to do anything with the source code, second only to software in the public domain. This includes incorporating the BSD-licensed code into proprietary products. The approach has led to BSD code being used in common, widely used proprietary software. In response, supporters of the GPL license claim that it is more free than the BSD licence because it prevents other people from incorporating GPL-licensed code into proprietary products. They say that the freedom of others to make non-free software from free software is an unjust form of power rather than a necessary freedom.
Code licensed under a permissive free software licence, such as the BSD license, can be incorporated into copylefted (e.g. GPL'd) projects. Such code is thus "GPL-compatible". There is no need to secure the consent of the original authors. In contrast, code under the GPL cannot be relicensed under the BSD license without securing the consent of all copyright holders. Thus the two licenses are compatible, but the combination as a whole must be distributed under the terms of the GPL, not the permissive license.
Existing free software BSDs tend to avoid including software licensed under the GPL in the core operating system, or the "base system", except as a last resort when alternatives are non-existent or vastly less capable, such as with GCC. (Indeed however, note that as of mid-2010 FreeBSD for example are moving from GCC to the upcoming LLVM compiler, perhaps primarily for this reason.) The OpenBSD project has acted to remove GPL-licensed tools in favor of BSD-licensed alternatives, some newly written and some adapted from older code.
Debian.
The Debian project uses the criteria laid out in its Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). The only notable cases where Debian and Free Software Foundation disagree are over the Artistic License and the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). Debian accepts the original Artistic License as being a free software license, but FSF disagrees. This has very little impact however since the Artistic License is almost always used in a dual-license setup, along with the GNU General Public License.
Regarding the GNU Free Documentation License, Debian decided to apply the DFSG to everything in their distribution, including documentation. The FSF argues that documentation is qualitatively different from software and is subject to different requirements. The end result of a long discussion and the eventual vote in Debian was that the works licensed under the GFDL are considered free as long as they do not contain unmodifiable sections (what the GFDL calls ""Invariant Sections""). Most GNU documentation includes Invariant Sections.
Controversial borderline cases.
The vast majority of free software uses undisputed free software licenses; however, there have been many debates over whether or not certain other licenses qualify for the definition.
Examples of licenses which provoked debate include the 1.x series of the Apple Public Source License, which were accepted by the Open Source Initiative but not by the Free Software Foundation or Debian, the RealNetworks Public Source License, which was accepted by Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation but not by Debian, and in 2007, the Common Public Attribution License, which was approved by Open Source Initiative only.

Adventure International

Adventure International was a video game publishing company that existed from 1978 until 1985. It was started by Scott and Alexis Adams. Their games were notable for being the first implementation of the adventure genre to run on a microcomputer system. The adventure game concept originally came from "Colossal Cave Adventure" which ran strictly on large mainframe systems at the time.
History.
After the success of their first game "Adventureland", other games followed rapidly, with Adventure International (or "AI") releasing about two games a year. Initially the games were drawn from the founders' imaginations, with themes ranging from fantasy to horror and sometimes science fiction. Some of the later games were written by Scott Adams with other collaborators (such as Philip Case). Adventure International marked the start of many development careers, including Russ Wetmore (author or Preppie! and Homepak), and Jonathan Taylor (founder of Voxeo). Adventure International's games became known for quality, with a reputation only exceeded in the field at the time by Infocom.
In 1980, five of the company's games were ported to the Commodore Vic-20. Vic-20 developer Neil Harris recalled: "sales guys could not figure out what they were gonna do with them. 'What are these games? It's all words on the screen! There's no graphics! What kind of a video game doesn't have video?' [laughs And they became the best-selling cartridges for the VIC 20, period."
Fourteen games later, Adventure International began to release games drawn from film and fiction. The extremely rare "Buckaroo Banzai" game, developed with Phillip Case, was based on the film "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension" (1984). Other games came from a more well known source: Marvel Comics. Adventure International released three Questprobe games based on the Marvel characters: "The Incredible Hulk", "Spider-Man" and "Torch and the Thing".
By the end of 1982, game tastes were changing. The traditional text-based adventure game market had moved to graphical based adventures. Games like "The Hobbit" had increased expectations of such games, and although Adventure International games included graphics of a sort, they were significantly inferior to contemporary offerings at the time and the company was rapidly losing market share. At its peak in late 1983 to early 1984 Adventure International employed approximately 50 individuals, and published titles from over 300 independent programmer/authors. 
Adventure International was located in the Sabal Point subdivision of Longwood - at 155 Sabal Palm Drive, Longwood, FL near the east side of Sabal Point Elementary School. Adventure International also had a retail store front located in Sweetwater Oaks at 966 Fox Valley Dr, Longwood, FL near the west side of Sabal Point Elementary School. Both were in zip code 32750 (now 32779). Scott and Alexis Adams also lived in Sabal Point at 454 Timber Ridge Drive, Longwood, FL. The house still retains some of its tower and castle look.
Adventure International went bankrupt in 1985. The copyrights for its games reverted to the bank and eventually back to Scott Adams who released them as shareware. 
In Europe the "Adventure International" name was a trading name of Adventure Soft and other games were released under the name that were not from Adventure International in the USA.
Games.
Scott Adams's original twelve adventure games were:
The games were written using an in-house adventure creator with text compression and a sophisticated command interpreter running on a BBC Micro and a graphics tool running on an Apricot F1. The two parts were then merged, using a cross-compiler when necessary.
"Saigon: The Final Days".
A later Adventure International title, "", had as its very dark scenario the escape of a soldier from Vietnam at the end of the war.
A quirk in this game's input parser provided an unintentional surprise bit of morbid gameplay. At one point in the game, the player must figure out how to cross a predator-infested river. Entering the command ""confess to war crimes"" here would not be rejected as gibberish as one might expect, but would actually kill the player. This turned out to not be a planned feature; the parser was finding the command "swim" embedded in the phrase ("confess to war crimes"), and swimming across the river was invariably a fatal move.
The actual solution to the game was no less macabre, involving zipping oneself into a body bag to be carried out of the country by an evacuation helicopter.

Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella

Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella was a consul of the Roman Republic in 81 BC, with Marcus Tullius Decula, during the dictatorship of Sulla.
Biography.
Possibly a military tribune in 89 BC, Dolabella soon was attached to the staff of Sulla as a legate, holding command of one of Sulla's fleets in 83 BC. In 82 BC, Dolabella saw action during Sulla's second march on Rome, participating at the Battle of Sacriportus and the Battle of the Colline Gate. As a loyal lieutenant, Sulla made him consul in 81 BC, but the consuls of that year were only nominal, as Sulla had all the power in his hands.
In 80 BC, Dolabella was made proconsul of Macedonia, a position which he held until 78 BC. In 77 BC Dolabella was granted a triumph for victories he had achieved while governor over the Thracians, but shortly afterwards he was accused of extortion in Macedonia during his time as governor by the young Julius Caesar and brought to trial. Prosecuted by Caesar, Dolabella was defended by Gaius Aurelius Cotta and Quintus Hortensius. He was found not guilty and acquitted.
In fiction.
Dolabella is a minor character in the Colleen McCullough novel "Fortune's Favourites". In the novel, just prior to the Battle of the Colline Gate, he blackmails Sulla into giving him the consulship in return for his support, which he threatened to withdraw due to Sulla's decision to pass him over when Sulla gave the command of one of his wings to Marcus Licinius Crassus.

<doc id="18932581" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932581" title="Auteur theory">
Auteur theory

In film criticism, auteur theory holds that a director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the French word for "author"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.
In law, the film is treated as a work of art, and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original copyright holder. Under European Union law, the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.
Auteur theory has influenced film criticism since 1954, when it was advocated by film director and critic François Truffaut. This method of film analysis was originally associated with the French New Wave and the film critics who wrote for the French film review periodical "Cahiers du Cinéma". Auteur theory was developed a few years later in the United States through the writings of "The Village Voice" critic Andrew Sarris. Sarris used auteur theory as a way to further the analysis of what he defines serious work through the study of respected directors and their films.
Origin.
Auteur theory draws on the work of a group of cinema enthusiasts who wrote for "Cahiers du Cinéma" and argued that films should reflect a director's personal vision. The championed filmmakers such as Akira Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, and Jean Renoir are known as absolute "auteurs" of their films. Although André Bazin, co-founder of the "Cahiers", provided a forum for auteurism to flourish, he explained his concern about its excesses in his article "On the Auteur Theory" ("Cahiers du Cinéma" #70, 1957). Another element of auteur theory comes from Alexandre Astruc's notion of the "caméra-stylo" or "camera-pen", which encourages directors to wield cameras as writers use pens and to guard against the hindrances of traditional storytelling.
Truffaut and the members of the "Cahiers" recognized that movie-making was an industrial process. However, they proposed an ideal to strive for, encouraging the director to use the commercial apparatus as a writer uses a pen, and, through the mise en scène, imprint his or her vision on the work (minimizing the role of the screenwriter). Recognizing the difficulty of reaching this ideal, they valued the work of directors who came close.
The definition of an auteur has been debated since the 1940s. André Bazin and Roger Leenhardt presented the theory that it is the director that brings the film to life and uses the film to express their thoughts and feelings about the subject matter as well as a world view as an auteur. An auteur can use lighting, camerawork, staging and editing to add to their vision.
Truffaut's development.
In his 1954 essay "Une certaine tendance du cinéma français" ("A certain tendency in French cinema"), François Truffaut coined the phrase "la politique des Auteurs", asserting that the worst of Jean Renoir's movies would always be more interesting than the best of the movies of Jean Delannoy. "Politique" might very well be translated as "policy" or "program"; it involves a conscious decision to value and look at films in a certain way. One might see it as the policy of treating any director that uses a personal style or a unique world view as an Auteur. Truffaut criticized the Cinema of Quality as "Scenarists' films", which are works that lack originality and rely on literary classics. According to Truffaut, this means that the director is only a "metteur en scene", a "stager". This tradition suggests that the screenwriter hands the script to the director and the director simply adds the performers and pictures. Truffaut provocatively said: "(t)here are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors".
Truffaut's article, by his own admission, dealt primarily with scenarists or screenwriters, precisely the screenwriting duo Jean Aurenche and "Pierre Bost," who, Truffaut believed, simplified and compromised many of the great works of French literature in order to support the political agenda of their day. In Truffaut's article, he references the director Claude Autant-Lara's characterization of his adaptation of Raymond Radiguet's "Devil in the Flesh" as an "anti-war" book, citing the problem that the book pre-dated the Second World War. Truffaut applied the term "auteur" to directors like Jean Renoir, Max Ophüls, Jacques Becker, Jacques Tati, and Robert Bresson, who, aside from exerting their distinct style, wrote the screenplays or worked on the writing of screenplays of their films.
In its embryonic form, the auteur theory dealt with the nature of literary adaptations and Truffaut's discomfort with the screenwriters Aurenche's and Bost's maxim that any film adaptation of a novel should capture the spirit of the novel and deal only with its "filmable" aspects. Truffaut believed that film directors like Robert Bresson were able to use the film narrative to approach even the so-called "unfilmable" scenes. To support this assertion, he used the film version of Georges Bernanos's "Diary of a Country Priest".
Much of the writing of Truffaut and his colleagues at the film criticism magazine "Cahiers du cinéma" was designed to lambaste not only the post-war French cinema but especially the big production films of the "cinéma de qualité" ("quality films"). Although it has become widely believed that Truffaut's circle referred to these films with disdain as sterile, old-fashioned "cinéma de papa" (or "Dad's cinema"), in fact Truffaut never used the term "cinéma de papa". During the Nazi occupation, the Vichy government did not allow the exhibition of U.S. films such as "The Maltese Falcon" and "Citizen Kane". In 1946, when French film critics were finally able to see the 1940s U.S. movies, they were enamoured with these films.
Truffaut's theory maintains that a good director (and many bad ones) exerts such a distinctive style or promotes such a consistent theme that his or her influence is unmistakable in the body of his or her work. Truffaut himself was appreciative of directors whose work showed a marked visual style (such as Alfred Hitchcock) as well as those whose visual style was less pronounced but whose movies reflected a consistent theme (such as Jean Renoir's humanism). Truffaut "et al." made the distinction between auteurs and 'metteurs en scene', the latter not being described as inferior directors making inherently poor films, just lacking the authorial signature.
Impact.
The "auteur theory" was used by the directors of the "nouvelle vague" (New Wave) movement of French cinema in the 1960s (many of whom were also critics at the "Cahiers du Cinéma") as justification for their intensely personal and idiosyncratic films. One of the ironies of the Auteur theory is that, at the very moment Truffaut was writing, the break-up of the Hollywood studio system during the 1950s was ushering in a period of uncertainty and conservatism in American cinema, with the result that fewer of the sort of films Truffaut admired were actually being made.
The "auteur" approach was adopted in English-language film criticism in the 1960s. In the UK, "Movie" adopted Auteurism, while in the U.S., Andrew Sarris introduced it in the essay, "Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962". This essay is where the term, "Auteur theory", originated. To be classified as an "auteur", according to Sarris, a director must accomplish technical competence in their technique, personal style in terms of how the movie looks and feels, and interior meaning (although many of Sarris's auterist criteria were left vague). Later in the decade, Sarris published "The American Cinema: Directors and Directions, 1929–1968", which quickly became the unofficial bible of auteurism.
The auteurist critics—Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Éric Rohmer—wrote mostly about directors, although they also produced some shrewd appreciations of actors. However later Truffaut wrote: the auteur theory "was started by Cahiers du Cinema and is forgotten in France, but still discussed in American periodicals."
Criticism.
Starting in the 1960s, some film critics began criticising auteur theory's focus on the authorial role of the director. Pauline Kael and Sarris feuded in the pages of "The New Yorker" and various film magazines. One reason for the backlash is the collaborative aspect of shooting a film, and in the theory's privileging of the role of the director (whose name, at times, has become more important than the movie itself). In Kael's review of "Citizen Kane", a classic film for the auteur model, she points out how the film made extensive use of the distinctive talents of co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. But Kael's objections to the "auteur theory" were many and are best learned by reading her essay "Circles and Squares".
Notable screenwriters such as Ernest Lehman, Nicholas Kazan, Robert Riskin and William Goldman have publicly balked at the idea that directors are more authorial than screenwriters, while film historian Aljean Harmetz, referring to the creative input of producers and studio executives in classical Hollywood, argues that the auteur theory "collapses against the reality of the studio system".
The auteur theory was also challenged by the influence of New Criticism, a school of literary criticism. The New Critics argued that critics made an "intentional fallacy" when they tried to interpret works of art by speculating about what the author meant, based on the author's personality or life experiences. New Critics argued that information or speculation about an author's intention was secondary to the words on the page as the basis of the experience of reading literature.
In 2006, David Kipen coined the term Schreiber theory to refer to the theory of the screenwriter as the principal author of a film.

Zakojca

Zakojca is a settlement in the Municipality of Cerkno in the traditional Littoral region of Slovenia. It consists of three hamlets: Dolnja Vas, Srednja Vas, and Gornja Vas ().
Name.
The name of the settlement is derived from Mount Kojca. It is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost case inflection ("za" + "Kojca", literally 'behind Mount Kojca') and refers to the settlement's location on the opposite (north) side of Mount Kojca in relation to other nearby villages on the south side of the mountain.
France Bevk home.
Zakojca is best known as the birthplace of the writer France Bevk. The house where he was born—a small half-stone, half-log building known as "Jernej's shed" ()—is no longer standing. The house where he spent his childhood is known as the Volar Farm () and is located at Zakojca no. 10 in the hamlet of Dolnja Vas. The house was purchased at an auction by Bevk's grandfather Jakob when Bevk was three years old. The house contains a small ethnological museum downstairs and a literary history museum in the attic with exhibits related to Bevk and his life and work. The home was registered as a Slovenian cultural heritage site in 1986.
Other cultural heritage.
There is a double hayrack belonging to the farm at Zakojca no. 1. It bears a stone inscription with the Christogram "IHS", the year 1832, and the name "Jakob Klousher" (i.e., "Jakob Klavžar").
There is a Partisan monument in the eastern part of the hamlet of Srednja Vas. It consists of a plaque mounted on a concrete block and a concrete pillar on the right side topped by a five-pointed star. The monument was unveiled on 19 August 1951.
Recreation.
The Flander Farm () at Zakojca no. 1 offers farm stays and has an inn. The settlement is also a starting point for hikes to Mount Kojca, Mount Porezen, and the Zakojca Gorge (), as well as the Bača Gorge ().

Berne Convention

The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, usually known as the Berne Convention, is an international agreement governing copyright, which was first accepted in Berne, Switzerland, in 1886.
Content.
The Berne Convention requires its signatories to recognize the copyright of works of authors from other signatory countries (known as members of the "Berne Union") in the same way as it recognizes the copyright of its own nationals. For example, French copyright law applies to anything published or performed in France, regardless of where it was originally created.
In addition to establishing a system of equal treatment that internationalised copyright amongst signatories, the agreement also required member states to provide strong minimum standards for copyright law. 
Copyright under the Berne Convention must be automatic; it is prohibited to require formal registration (note however that when the United States joined the Convention in 1988, it continued to make statutory damages and attorney's fees only available for registered works).
Applicability.
Under Article 3, the protection of the Convention applies to nationals and residents of signatory countries, and to works first published or simultaneously published (under Article 3(4), "simultaneously" is defined as "within 30 days") in a signatory country. Under Article 4, it also applies to cinematic works by persons who have their headquarters or habitual residence in a signatory country, and to architectural works situated in a signatory country.
Country of origin.
The Convention relies on the concept of "country of origin". Often determining the country of origin is straightforward: when a work is published in a signatory country and nowhere else, this is the country of origin. However, under Article 5(4), when a work is published simultaneously in several signatory countries (under Article 3(4), "simultaneously" is defined as "within 30 days" ), the country with the shortest term of protection is defined as the country of origin. 
For works simultaneously published in a signatory country and one or more non-signatory countries, the signatory country is the country of origin. For unpublished works or works first published in a non-signatory country (without publication within 30 days in a signatory country), the author's nationality usually provides the country of origin, if a national of a signatory country. (There are exceptions for cinematic and architectural works.)
In the internet age, publication online may be considered publication in every sufficiently internet-connected jurisdiction in the world. It is not clear what this may mean for determining "country of origin". In "Kernel v. Mosley", a U.S. court "concluded that a work created outside of the United States, uploaded in Australia and owned by a company registered in Finland was nonetheless a U.S. work by virtue of its being published online". However other U.S. courts in similar situations have reached different conclusions, e.g. "Håkan Moberg v. 33T LLC". The matter of determining the country of origin for digital publication remains a topic of controversy among law academics as well.
Copyright term.
The Berne Convention states that all works except photographic and cinematographic shall be copyrighted for at least 50 years after the author's death, but parties are free to provide longer terms, as the European Union did with the 1993 Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection. For photography, the Berne Convention sets a minimum term of 25 years from the year the photograph was created, and for cinematography the minimum is 50 years after first showing, or 50 years after creation if it hasn't been shown within 50 years after the creation. Countries under the older revisions of the treaty may choose to provide their own protection terms, and certain types of works (such as phonorecords and motion pictures) may be provided shorter terms.
If the author is unknown, because for example the author was deliberately anonymous or worked under a pseudonym, the Convention provides for a term of 50 years after publication ("after the work has been lawfully made available to the public"). However if the identity of the author becomes known, the copyright term for known authors (50 years after death) applies.
Although the Berne Convention states that the copyright law of the country where copyright is claimed shall be applied, Article 7(8) states that "unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work", i.e., an author is normally not entitled a longer copyright abroad than at home, even if the laws abroad give a longer term. This is commonly known as "the rule of the shorter term". Not all countries have accepted this rule.
Fair use.
The Berne Convention authorizes countries to allow "fair" uses of copyrighted works in other publications or broadcasts. Implementations of this part of the treaty fall into the broad categories of fair use and fair dealing.
The Agreed Statement of the parties to the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996 states that: "It is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Treaty or the Berne Convention." This language may mean that Internet service providers are not liable for the infringing communications of their users. Critics claim that the convention does not mention any other rights of consumers of works except for fair use.
History.
The Berne Convention was developed at the instigation of Victor Hugo of the Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale. Thus it was influenced by the French "right of the author" ("droit d'auteur"), which contrasts with the Anglo-Saxon concept of "copyright" which only dealt with economic concerns. Under the Convention, copyrights for creative works are automatically in force upon their creation without being asserted or declared. An author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Convention. As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work and to any derivative works, unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them or until the copyright expires. Foreign authors are given the same rights and privileges to copyrighted material as domestic authors in any country that signed the Convention.
Before the Berne Convention, national copyright laws usually only applied for works created within each country. So for example a work published in United Kingdom by a British national would be covered by copyright there, but could be copied and sold by anyone in France. Dutch publisher Albertus Willem Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1899 in opposition to the convention over concerns that its international restrictions would stifle the Dutch print industry.
The Berne Convention followed in the footsteps of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883, which in the same way had created a framework for international integration of the other types of intellectual property: patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
Like the Paris Convention, the Berne Convention set up a bureau to handle administrative tasks. In 1893 these two small bureaux merged and became the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (best known by its French acronym BIRPI), situated in Berne. In 1960, BIRPI moved to Geneva, to be closer to the United Nations and other international organizations in that city. In 1967 it became the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and in 1974 became an organization within the United Nations.
The Berne Convention was revised in Paris in 1896 and in Berlin in 1908, completed in Berne in 1914, revised in Rome in 1928, in Brussels in 1948, in Stockholm in 1967 and in Paris in 1971, and was amended in 1979. 
The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty was adopted in 1996 to address the issues raised by information technology and the Internet, which were not addressed by the Berne Convention.
Adoption and implementation.
The UK signed in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
The United States initially refused to become a party to the Convention, since that would have required major changes in its copyright law, particularly with regard to moral rights, removal of the general requirement for registration of copyright works and elimination of mandatory copyright notice. This led first to the U.S. ratifying the Buenos Aires Convention (BAC) in 1910, and later to the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) in 1952 to accommodate the wishes of the United States. But on 1 March 1989, the U.S. Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 was enacted, and the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, making the United States a party to the Berne Convention, and making the Universal Copyright Convention nearly obsolete. Except for extremely technical points not relevant, with the accession of Nicaragua in 2000, every nation that is a member of the Buenos Aires Convention is also a member of Berne, and so the BAC has also become nearly obsolete and is essentially deprecated as well.
Since almost all nations are members of the World Trade Organization, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights requires non-members to accept almost all of the conditions of the Berne Convention.
As of September 2013, there are 167 states that are parties to the Berne Convention. This includes 166 UN member states plus the Holy See.

African Regional Intellectual Property Organization

The African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO), formerly African Regional Industrial Property Organization, is an intergovernmental organization for cooperation among African states in patent and other intellectual property matters. ARIPO was established by the Lusaka Agreement of 1976. It has the capacity to hear applications for patents and registered trademarks in its member states who are parties to the Harare (patents) and Banjul (marks) protocols. ARIPO also features a protocol on the protection of traditional knowledge, the Swakopmund Protocol, signed in 2010 by 9 member states of the organization. However, that has not come into force yet, as of July 2013.
ARIPO has the WIPO ST.3 code AP. Its 18 member states are mostly English-speaking countries. Rwanda became the 18th member state on March 24, 2010.
The name of the organization changed from "African Regional Industrial Property Organization" to "African Regional Intellectual Property Organization" in 2005.
Rights covered.
Together, the two protocols constituting the organisation cover copyright, industrial design, patent, trademark, traditional knowledge and utility model rights.
