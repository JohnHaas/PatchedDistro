Oksa

Oksa is a village in Jędrzejów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Oksa. It lies approximately north-west of Jędrzejów and south-west of the regional capital Kielce. The village has an approximate population of 890.
Oksa, which in the past was spelled Oxa and Oksza, used to be a town from 1554 to 1867. It was founded by one of the most famous Polish poets, Mikolaj Rej, and the name of the town comes from Oksza - the coat of arms of the Rej family (in the Old Polish language, the word oksza meant axe). The name Oksa has been in use since app. late-19th century. 
In the location of Oksa, a village of Tworow existed in the early 16th century. It belonged to a nobleman named Hieronim Rzeszowski, who in 1554 handed Tworow over to Mikolaj Rej, in exchange for the villages of Chycza and Besk. In the same year, King Zygmunt August allowed the writer to found the town of Oksza, in the location of Tworow. In order to attract settlers to his town, Mikolaj Rej provided those willing to come to Oksza with a land plot. Furthermore, residents were granted right to cut down parts of local forests, in order to create pastures. Oksa developed slowly, by 1573, the town had few artisans, ten houses and a mill. Due to efforts of Andrzej Rej, the son of Mikolaj Rej, a town hall and butcher shops were opened. At the same time however, Rej increased taxes, which did not help the development of Oksa. In the 17th century, the town belonged to several owners, who often argued with each other. Oksa was one of main centers of the Protestant Reformation in Lesser Poland, with a Calvinist prayer house, founded here by Andrzej Rej in 1570. 
In 1667, after the disastrous Swedish invasion of Poland, Oksa had 26 houses and the population of 179. After the Partitions of Poland, the town briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1827, the population of Oksa was 380, with 51 houses. During the January Uprising, a battle took place here on October 20, 1863, between Polish rebels and Russian troops. As a result, Oksa lost its town charter in 1867, and has been a village since then. In 1960, its population was 1,235. 
Oksa Parish Church.
The parish church at Oksa was founded by Andrzej Rej in 1570 as a Calvinist prayer house (the construction of the church had been initiated by his father Mikolaj, who intended it to serve local Roman-Catholics). At that time, Oksa was an important center of Reformation, here several Calvinist synods (councils) of Lesser Poland’s protestant szlachta took place in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. 
In 1678, the prayer house was taken over by the Cistercians from Jedrzejow, who turned it into a Roman Catholic church, despite protests of Calvinists. In 1770, a new sacristy was built, together with a main altar. Inside the church there is a genuine, 16th century Calvinist pulpit.

The Secret of Annexe 3

The Secret of Annexe 3 is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the seventh novel in Inspector Morse series.
The guests of Haworth Hotel rose late, after New Year's Eve. But there was one exception, the guest in Annexe 3 missed New Year's Day completely. He was still in his room, lying dead on the blood-soaked bed. Inspector Morse began investigating each of the guests. Was Mrs. Palmer really a faithful wife? Just who exactly were the Ballards? And, how had the hotel's booking confirmation been delivered to a nonexistent address?
As the novel begins, Margaret Bowman of Charlbury Drive Chipping Norton is off to a funeral. Her husband, left alone, finds an angry letter, apparently from a lover, in his wife’s handbag.
After the murder, Inspector Morse, with the help of the pretty receptionist, Miss Sarah Jonstone, examines the letters and phone messages booking the various rooms at the hotel. Discovering the non-existent address, he deduces that a postman must be involved.
Thomas Bowman, the postman, turns out to be the corpse, and his wife and her lover the instigators of the murder. Winston Grant, a black musician, was hired to provide the alibi.
Although the narratives differ, this novel provided the inspiration for the Inspector Morse television film "The secret of bay 5B".

Phase dispersion minimization

Phase dispersion minimization (PDM) is a data analysis technique that searches for periodic components of a time series data set. It is useful for data sets with gaps, non-sinusoidal variations, poor time coverage or other problems that would make Fourier techniques unusable. It was first developed by Stellingwerf in 1978 and has been widely used for astronomical and other types of periodic data analyses. The current version of this application is available for download.
Background.
PDM is a variant of a standard astronomical technique called data folding. This involves guessing a trial period for the data, and cutting, or "folding" the data into multiple sub-series with a time duration equal to the trial period. The data are now plotted versus "phase", or a scale of 0->1, relative to the trial period. If the data is truly periodic with this period a clean functional variation, or "light curve", will emerge. If not the points will be randomly distributed in amplitude. 
As early as 1926 Whittiker and Robinson proposed an analysis technique of this type based on maximizing the amplitude of the mean curve. Another technique focusing on the variation of data at adjacent phases was proposed in 1964 by Lafler and Kinman. Both techniques had difficulties, particularly in estimating the significance of a possible solution.
PDM analysis.
PDM divides the folded data into a series of bins and computes the variance of the amplitude within each bin. The bins can overlap to improve phase coverage, if needed. The bin variances are combined and compared to the overall variance of the data set. For a true period the ratio of the bin to the total variances will be small. For a false period the ratio will be approximately unity. A plot of this ratio versus trial period will usually indicate the best candidates for periodic components. Analyses of the statistical properties of this approach have been given by Nemec & Nemec and Schwarzenberg-Czerny.
PDM2 updates.
The original PDM technique has been updated (PDM2) in several areas::

Apparatjik

Apparatjik ( ) are a multinational supergroup formed in 2008. The band is a supergroup that consist of bassist Guy Berryman from Coldplay, guitarist/keyboardist Magne Furuholmen from A-ha, singer/guitarist Jonas Bjerre of Mew and producer Martin Terefe. The band's name literal translation is "agent of the apparatus". Apparatjik is based on apparatchik, which is a word of Russian origin and is used to describe "people who cause bureaucratic bottlenecks in otherwise efficient organisations".
History.
The band first came together for a charity album for Survival International called "Songs for Survival". The album was produced by Martin Terefe and Molly Oldfield, and the band produced the first track on the album, "Ferreting". This track was used as the theme music for the "Amazon" series on BBC 2. Subsequently they continued to work together in Magne Furuholmen's studio in Norway, and created more tracks that were periodically made available on their MySpace and YouTube pages. They also have a complex website, through which they released various videos and song snippets. They have an alliance with the "Eye On Committee" and aim to bring fans into their world, "inside the cube", in their uniquely odd way by claiming "you too can be an Apparatjik". On 30 November, they released the first official track, "Electric Eye", from their then-upcoming album through their website.
Apparatjik's first live performance was at the eleventh edition of club transmediale, an annual festival in Berlin, which took place from January 28 to February 7, 2010. This gig consisted of the band performing inside a specially constructed cube at the WMF on February 1, 2010. The same day saw the release of their debut album, titled "We Are Here", for digital download via their official website. They have since released further singles, their "4 Can Keep A Secret If 3 Of Them Are Dead" extended-play, and on June 15, 2010, they re-released "We Are Here" on iTunes in standard and deluxe versions.
After playing at the Flø festival in Norway in June, on 23 September 2010, the band played their third concert in London. The cube was transported to the red summer pavilion, designed by Jean Nouvel, when Molly Oldfield brought the group to the Serpentine Gallery, in Hyde Park, London. As a nod to the fusion of art and music in their performances, they were invited by the Serpentine Gallery to play at the Future Contemporaries party.
Performances by Apparatjik are an eye-catching affair, with specially-created visuals and silhouettes of the four band members being projected onto all four sides of the cube.
Apparatjik's first song to be played on BBC Radio 1 was a radio edit of "Datascroller", which aired on June 14, 2010.
In November 2010, Magne Furuholmen revealed the promise for "a few very exciting things with in 2011" during a BBC Radio 2 interview.
Apparatjik launched a new project called agreeneryouniverse on 11 February 2011. This project invites people across the world to plant a tree, make a picture and upload it to their website. The first 1,000 people in doing so would receive new music as a gift.
A new download-only single was released on 28 March 2011 called "Combat Disco Music".
On 11 November 2011, Apparatjik released their second album called "Square Peg In A Round Hole" as a free iPad application. Four days later it was given away as a gift as part of the agreeneryouniverse project. The initial target was to release new music upon reaching 1,000 newly planted trees across the world, but the album was released to a wider public after 727 trees had been planted.
The iPad application contains a date of 21-02-2012 (21 February 2012) which has led to discussions by fans about the album being released in a physical format on that date.
The band collaborated with Canadian singer Elizabeth Lowell Boland, better known as Lowell, who drummer and producer Martin Terefe has been working with beforehand, and released the mini-album "If You Can, Solve This Jumble" (stylized as "Apparatjik Presents Lowell: if YOu_ _ caN, 5olve thi5 jumble?") on 29 October 2012. Each track in the extended play features lead vocals by Lowell. The debut single "Shake Him Off" has been played on BBC Radio 1 and became single of the week in Canada on iTunes.

Center for Applied Linguistics

The Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) is a private, nonprofit organization that describes its mission as “working to improve communication through better understanding of language and culture” (www.cal.org). CAL is headquartered in Washington, DC and provides a wide range of services, information, and resources related to language and culture. Its current President and Chief Executive Officer is Terrence G. Wiley.
The organization carries out its mission by working in the fields of bilingual education, English as a second language, literacy, foreign language education; dialect studies; language policy; refugee orientation; and the education of linguistically and culturally diverse adults and children (Peterson, 2004). Staff members conduct research, design and develop language assessments and instructional materials, provide technical assistance and professional development, and disseminate information and resources related to language and culture.
History.
At the close of the 1950s, issues of language diversity, interest in language policy, and the emergence of English as a world language created a demand for information about world languages and for expertise in linguistics and language training. In the United States, reactions to the launch of Sputnik and the continuation of the Cold War led to concern about the ability of U.S. schools to train students in mathematics, the sciences, and foreign languages. CAL was created in this environment of increased interest in language issues by Dr. Charles A. Ferguson, a pioneer in the field of applied linguistics. Through a grant from the Ford Foundation to the Modern Language Association, CAL was established in 1959 to serve as a liaison between the academic world of linguistics, and the practical world of language education and language-related concerns (Spolsky, 1999; Troike, 2008). CAL's original mandate was to improve the teaching of English around the world; encourage the teaching and learning of less commonly taught languages; contribute new knowledge to the field by conducting language research to resolve social and educational problems; and serve as a clearinghouse for information collection, analysis, and dissemination and as a coordinating agency to bring together scholars and practitioners involved in language-related issues.
Current Activities.
Since its inception, CAL has played a leading role in conducting research on language use, language learning, and effective teaching methods, and translating research into practical applications to help language learners succeed (Christian, 2008; Berns, 2010). Among the populations that CAL serves are language educators of children and adults who are learning foreign languages and English as a second language; immigrants and refugees in the United States and the agencies that provide services for them; schools, school districts, and other educational institutions in need of curriculum development, professional development, and assessments; and policy makers who need information about language and culture to address the important issues of the day.
CAL’s website provides detailed information about the organization and access to resources on a wide range of topics including
English Language Learners: CAL works with educators and practitioners to help the growing number of students who speak English as a second language in the United States succeed in the classroom and the workplace.
Foreign Language Education: Proficiency in languages other than English is critical in the global society. CAL provides resources to inform language education at all levels of instruction, from early language programs in elementary schools through graduate level programs for individuals seeking high levels of proficiency in a range of languages.
Sheltered Instruction: CAL supports educators who are implementing sheltered instruction, an approach to teaching that promotes language development and content-area learning for students who are not yet proficient in the language of instruction.
Two-Way Immersion: Two-way immersion is an educational approach that integrates native English speakers and speakers of another language in classrooms where they all receive instruction in both languages. The goal of these programs is bilingualism and biliteracy for all students along with high levels of academic achievement.
Bilingual Education: Proficiency in more than one language is a valuable skill to be cultivated and nurtured in schools and communities. CAL provides information and resources to support the development of bilingualism and the academic success of English language learners through programs that utilize their native language in instruction.
Heritage Languages: The United States has a rich diversity of languages other than English that are spoken in communities around the country. CAL works with the National Foreign Language Center and other colleagues in the Alliance for the Advancement of Heritage Languages to promote the conservation and development of these heritage language resources in the country.
Literacy Education: Literacy is a central component in language learning and a critical skill for success in academic, career, and life pursuits. CAL provides resources for literacy education for learners of every age, particularly related to biliteracy and English language literacy.
Refugee Integration: Since the major influx of refugees from Southeast Asia in the 1970s, CAL has conducted programs in refugee integration and orientation, helping newcomers understand fundamental aspects of life in the United States while helping service providers and interested parties understand the rich cultures and likely resettlement needs of the new members of their communities.
Assessment and Testing: CAL researches and develops assessments of language proficiency in English as a second language and foreign languages at all educational and proficiency levels. Specialists also examine the language and culture issues related to assessment of subject matter knowledge through a second language for English learners and design innovative approaches to addressing these concerns.
Dialects: Virtually every language in the world has dialects—varieties of the language that are particular to a group of speakers--and there are often social, educational, and economic consequences associated with dialect diversity. To help inform the discussion and improve responses to dialects, particularly in education, CAL has created and collected a variety of resources related to dialects and language diversity.
Research: CAL is involved in a variety of research projects that inform its mission, such as math, science, and language education for English learners, biliteracy development for Spanish-speaking students, effective approaches for developing high levels of language proficiency in English and other languages, and innovative methods for assessing math and science knowledge in English learners. Much of CAL’s grant and project work includes a substantial research component.
Services: CAL offers solutions to the challenges faced by practitioners working with language learners at all levels of instruction through professional development, technical assistance, program evaluation, and other services.
Resources: CAL provides research-based language and cultural education resources and testing tools, including publications, teacher tools, free downloadable digests, and databases and directories of information about language programs.
On its website, CAL provides information about current projects. The organization also distributes a monthly email newsletter, "CALNews", and an annual report.

Sophienkirche (Berlin)

The Sophienkirche is a Protestant church in the Spandauer Vorstadt part of the Berlin-Mitte region of Berlin, eastern Germany. One of its associated cemeteries is the Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin.
History.
Designed by Philipp Gerlach, its foundation stone was laid by Frederick I of Prussia. After the death of her husband Frederick's third wife Sophie Luise von Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1685-1735), did not (as originally intended) have the church named after her at the consecration ceremony presided over by Frederick's successor Frederick William I on 25 February 1713. On 18 June 1713 the church was dedicated as the "Spandauische Kirche". It was first named after Sophie Luise under his successor Frederick II, and has been called the Sophienkirche ever since.
A baroque tower was added in 1732-34 by Johann Friedrich Grael.
In 1891/92 the church was rebuilt to designs by Friedrich Schulze by the practice Kyllmann & Heyden, overseen by Kurt Berndt. The roof was raised and an altar niche added at the east end, and the surviving interior decoration is almost entirely from this restoration.
There is a memorial to the poet Karl Wilhelm Ramler on the outside wall of the church's sacristy and one on the exterior north wall of the church to the poet Anna Luise Karsch.
Prominent graves in the churchyard include those of Carl Friedrich Zelter, founder of the Berlin Singakademie, and graves from the last days of the Second World War in the adjacent Sophienstraße.

The Antiquary (play)

The Antiquary is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy written by Shackerley Marmion. It was acted in the 1634–36 period by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and first published in 1641. "The Antiquary" has been succinctly described as "Marmion's best play."
Contemporary references.
The play drew upon several contemporary sources for its inspiration. Antiquarianism and the collection of "rarities" was a growing trend in Marmion's era. Marmion's title character, Veterano, has a habit of staring at a sculpture with a broken nose; this may have been intended as an allusion to Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, a famous antiquarian and art collector of the day. Marmion also was influenced by a contemporary controversy: in 1629, King Charles I and his Privy Council developed a scheme to confiscate the collection of the celebrated antiquary Charles Cotton the elder.
Synopsis.
Marmion set his play in Pisa (although, with references to the Rialto and the senate, he seems to have been thinking more about Venice). Like some other rulers in folklore and story (Harun al-Rashid being the most famous example), the Duke of Pisa chooses to go about in disguise among his subjects, to observe them and to amuse himself in the process. He witnesses a variety of odd characters, including Petrutio, who has been made vain and conceited by his foreign travels, and Moccinigo, an old man shocked by a courtesan's rejection into pursuing the hand of the 16-year-old Lucretia.
Veterano is an elderly and wealthy collector of antiquities; he denies his nephew Lionell any financial support and spends his money on his supposed treasures. Gullibly, he believes he owns the net in which Vulcan captured Mars and Venus, and "the great silver box that Nero kept his beard in." Lionell, an "ingenious witty gentleman" and a "young knave," cheats his uncle by selling him bogus rarities in disguise. The Duke, in confederacy with Lionell, threatens to confiscate Veterano's collection, since it is too precious to be in the hands of a private citizen; in response, Veterano wills his estate to Lionell.
Lionell places his boy page with Lucetia's parents, Lorenzo and Aemilia. Aemilia develops an infatuation with the boy; when Lorenzo discovers this, he is outraged. Aemilia manages to turn the tables on her husband with Lionell's help: she reveals that the page is a girl (Lionell's sister Angelia) in disguise, and accuses Lorenzo of sneaking his own mistress into their house. A shocked Lorenzo is forced to yield command of his household to his wife.
In addition to Moccinigo, Lucretia is courted by the ardent Aurelio — but she abuses her would-be lover so severely that she converts him into a misogynist. Yet when she learns that Moccinigo plots Aurelio's murder, Lucretia tries to forestall the crime and set things right; she apologises to Aurelio, and he abandons his misogyny as quickly as he adopted it. Aurelio tricks Lucretia into marrying him by trapping her in appearances: he bribes her servant into granting him entry into her apartments, and emerges the next morning to announce that they are married. To save her honour, Lucretia must marry him in fact. (This plot device is used in other plays of the era, from Lording Barry's "Ram Alley", c. 1607, to Thomas Killigrew's "The Parson's Wedding", 1641.)
Lionell and the Duke get Veterano drunk; in his inebriated state, Veterano claims that his hat was worn by Julius Caesar, his breeches by Pompey the Great, and his eyeglasses by Hannibal. When he falls asleep, they dress the old man in a fool's coat. Waking to find himself so attired, Veterano goes to the Duke to complain – only to find that the "Duke" is his nephew in disguise.
Moccinigo is tricked and cheated into signing his estates over to the newly married Aurelio and Lucretia. The foolish Petrutio is similarly tricked into marrying Lionell's sister Angelia, a young woman he'd formerly courted but neglected. (He believes he's marrying the Duke's sister – and in a sense he is, since the man he thinks is the Duke is actually Lionell.) The real Duke, emerged from concealment at the play's end, exults in the pleasure he's enjoyed and in the fitness of the outcome.
After 1642.
During the Restoration, Thomas d'Urfey borrowed from Marmion's drama to create his "Madame Fickle, or the Witty False One" (1677). Veterano reappears in different guises in later plays as well, in Samuel Foote's "The Nabob" (1773) and in John O'Keeffe's "Modern Antiquities" (1791).
"The Antiquary" was also admired by Sir Walter Scott; he included it in his collection "Ancient British Drama."

Portland Pilots

The Portland Pilots is the nickname for athletics at the University of Portland. The Pilots compete in the West Coast Conference (WCC) at the NCAA's Division I level.
History.
The Pilots started to gain attention when Clive Charles began coaching the women's soccer team in 1989. He already had been the men's soccer coach since 1986, and he continued to coach both teams until his death in 2003. He was replaced by the current coach Bill Irwin. The women's soccer team won national championships in 2002 and 2005 and were led by numerous national-level players (see Notable Alumni Athletes section).
In addition to soccer, UP consistently has one of the top cross country programs in the nation. Their men's team, coached by Rob Conner, won their 33rd straight West Coast Conference championship in October, 2012. The men's team has finished among the top 10 at the NCAA championships four times in its history. In 2001 and 2008, the Pilots finished 7th, which is their highest placement. They finished 12th in 2012. In 2008, David Kinsella finished 4th overall, the highest any Pilot has ever placed individually at the national championships.
The Pilots have had success in other sports as well. The men's basketball team has gone to the NCAA tournament twice (1959 and 1996). Their women's basketball team has gone to the NCAA Tournament 4 times (1994-1997) and the WNIT twice (1998 and 2009). Their baseball team has also gone to the NCAA tournament five times (1957, 1958, 1979, 1989, and 1991).
UP has not fielded a football team since 1950.
Teams.
The University of Portland sponsors teams in seven men's and eight women's NCAA sanctioned sports:
Men's Intercollegiate Sports
Women's Intercollegiate Sports
Conference championships.
The Pilots compete in the West Coast Conference, which they joined in 1976. Below are a few of their conference titles:
Venues.
The Portland Pilots play home soccer matches at Merlo Field, part of the Clive Charles Soccer Complex. All volleyball and basketball games are held in the Chiles Center. The baseball team plays in Joe Etzel Field. The Louisiana-Pacific Tennis Center is home to the tennis teams.
Preliminary campus expansion plans include moving the baseball field and tennis facilities from their current locations down to the waterfront in the Triangle Park property.

Wodzisław, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship

Wodzisław is a village in Jędrzejów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wodzisław. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-west of Jędrzejów and south-west of the regional capital Kielce.
Between the 16th and 19th centuries, Wodzisław was a property of the Lanckorońscy family. The village has a population of 1,100.
Wodzisław has a long and rich history, which dates back to the reign of King Wladyslaw Lokietek, who granted it town rights in ca. 1317. At that time, it was called Wlodzislaw, and the town was a royal property. In 1370, King Kazimierz Wielki handed the town over to a local nobleman Zbigniew Przedbor. In the 16th century, Wodzisław became property of the Lanckoronski family, and was a local center of artisans. In 1551, the wooden Roman Catholic church was transferred to the Calvinists, and most residents switched to Calvinism. Wodzisław was one of main centers of Protestant Reformation in Lesser Poland, here as many as 20 Calvinist synods took place (1557, 1558, 1559, twice in 1560, 1561, 1566, 1583, 1589, 1590, 1595, twice in 1597, 1599, 1601, 1604, 1606, 1607, 1609, 1610, 1611, and 1612). Calvinist prayer house at Wodzisław was closed down in 1613, after the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, when town’s owner Samuel Lanckoronski abandoned Calvinism and became a Roman Catholic. Soon afterwards, Lanckoronski built St. Martin church, and ordered all Calvinists either to convert, or to leave Wodzisław. The church burned in 1746, to be rebuilt in 1787 by Maciej Lanckoronski.
The town had a castle, built in mid-16th century by Jan Lanckoromski. In the late 17th century, the castle was turned into a palace, and at the same time, first Jewish settlers came to Wodzisław, and in 1720, first synagogue was opened. Until the Partitions of Poland Wodzisław was part of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1795 it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. According to the 1827 census, Wodzisław had the population of 1,760, with 191 houses. By 1857, the population grew to 2,081, with 1,463 Jews. In 1865, the town burned in a fire, and in 1869 it lost its town rights.

Pan Tadeusz (film)

Pan Tadeusz: The Last Foray in Lithuania is a 1999 Polish film directed by Andrzej Wajda. It is based on the eponymous epic poem by Polish poet, writer and philosopher Adam Mickiewicz (1798–1855). In his film, Andrzej Wajda weaves the tangled passions of men and women into a handsome, expansive tapestry of exile, yearning, Polish pride, war and history. In a nutshell, "Pan Tadeusz" is a story of family feuds, vows of vengeance, concealed identities, thwarted love, lusty passions, murder, pain, guilt, deathbed revelations and reconciliations that resonate through the generations.
Synopsis.
"Pan Tadeusz" is told in flashbacks as the author, Adam Mickiewicz, reads his work to a group of elderly exiles in Paris. The story takes place over the course of five days in 1811 and one day in 1812 in rolling landscapes of Lithuania inhabited by Poles whose homeland has been recently partitioned among Russia, the Austrian Empire and Prussia. Not far off in history looms Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the prospect of which heartens Poles yearning for liberation. But more immediately, the characters in "Pan Tadeusz" are feuding among themselves.
At odds are two families: the Soplicas and the Horeszkos. Their differences arise from a bloody night when the dashing Jacek Soplica (who was earlier rejected as a suitor for the old Count Horeszko's daughter), takes advantage of a Russian assault on the Count's castle to kill him. At that moment, the Count's faithful warden, Gervazy, vows vengeance for his master's death. Gervazy will not forgive and forget that in 1792, the last household lord of the Horeszkos was killed by Jacek Soplica and as a result, the latter was rewarded with the former's castle by the Russian colonizers.
20 years later, matters remain unresolved. Jacek Soplica's brother, Judge Andrzej Seweryn (who now lives in the castle of Count Horeszko), is locked in a lawsuit over the castle. A relative of the old murdered Count, young Count Horeszko (Marek Kondrat) has just arrived on the scene, as has 20-year-old Tadeusz Soplica (Michal Zebrowski), the Judge's nephew. He is soon smitten with the innocent Zosia (Alicja Bachleda), the teenage ward of his manipulative aunt, Telimena (Grazyna Szapolowska).
Preaching insurrection among the people is Priest Robak (Boguslaw Linda), who carries more than a few secrets under his cowl.
Robak informs the Poles who are living in Lithuania that Napoleon is marching against the Russians and will be crossing the nearby Niemen River. Naturally, the Poles get intensely worked up over this news as they abhor their Russian overlords.
In the meantime, aunt Telimena, who is in charge of raising 14-year old Zosia, begins a relationship with Tadeusz. This relationship does not please the rest of the family who expect Tadeusz to marry Zosia.
More reports arrive of the approach of Napoleon's army. It is said that Polish horsemen are coming with the French and will cross the Niemen. At this time Tadeusz finds out that his father Jacek is still alive and that it was he who sent Priest Robak to his uncle to secure the marriage of Tadeusz and Zosia. Through this marriage, Jacek wishes to make amends for his past sins by restoring the land back to the Count. However, aunt Telimena (who is in love with Tadeusz herself) secretly wishes for Zosia to marry the wealthy Count.
When the Count attends a banquet given by the Soplica's family, Gervazy (the old Count's faithful warden) wreaks havoc by bringing up the old family dispute (namely Jacek Soplica killing old Count Horeszko). The Count and Tadeusz agree to settle their dispute with a duel. Meanwhile, it is revealed to the judge that Father Robak is actually Jacek Soplica. To take vengeance on the Soplica family, the Count and Gervazy head to the village of Dobrzyn to recruit some of the gentry to help destroy them. Vengeance is combined with the goal of starting an insurrection against the Russians. The recruited gentry along with the Count put the Soplicas under house arrest while Gervazy and his forces settle in the castle and make it the headquarters of the Count. The Russian soldiers intervene and capture all the rebels and make them prisoner. Nonetheless, the Soplica's supply weapons and free the rebels, which ultimately allows both Poles and Lithuanians to come together to fight the Russians. In the struggle, Jacek Soplica personally saves the lives of both the Count and Gervazy, for which the two men forgive Jacek Soplica for his past sins. Climactically, the Poles and Lithuanians win the battle, but many will have to leave their homes to avoid the wrath of the Russians.
As news is received that Napoleon has declared war on Russia, the Count and Tadeusz, forgetting their promised duel, head off to join the French troops marching against the Russians. As the story of Pan Tadeusz approaches the end, Count Horeszko and Tadeusz Soplica return as soldier heroes and both families (Soplicas and Horeszkos) celebrate and rejoice in peace as Tadeusz is betrothed to Zosia.
The film ends, as it began, with many of the protagonists, now emigres in Paris, listening to Adam Mickiewicz as he reads from his poem about the homeland to which they cannot return.
Box Office performance.
"Pan Tadeusz" was an overwhelming commercial success, but only in its domestic market. With more than 6 million tickets sold to its screenings in Poland, it was significant in allowing for the unprecedented domination of Polish box-office by domestic productions, an exception in the history of the late 20th century Polish and also European cinema. "Pan Tadeusz" did not do what Wajda’s other films managed in the past; it did not make the Polish voice heard internationally. While Wajda’s Neo Realist trilogy of Pokolenie (A Generation) (1954), Kanal (Canal) (1957), and Popiol i diament (Ashes and Diamonds) (1958) was quoted as inspiration by, for instance, Martin Scorsese, and Wajda’s diptych, Czlowiek z marmuru (Man of Marble) (1976) and Czlowiek z zelaza (Man of Iron) (1981), was a lauded messenger from behind the Iron Curtain, "Pan Tadeusz" answered to a different set of needs and problems faced by the post-transitional Poland. It was most audible where it was most needed: at home.
"Pan Tadeusz" played in eastern Europe during the latter half of 1999, featured at the Berlin Film Festival, and endured a limited, albeit financially unsuccessful, run in the US early in 2000 before vanishing from screens forever.
Soundtrack by Wojciech Kilar.
The famous Polish composer, Wojciech Kilar conceived his breathtaking score for "Pan Tadeusz" in addition to scores for over 100 films, including: Bram Stoker's Dracula, Death and the Maiden (film), The Portrait of a Lady (film), The Pianist (2002 film), the The Truman Show and The Ninth Gate. Kilar is also internationally known for his epic "Exodus", which is famous as the trailer music from Schindler's List.
Academy Award submission and Awards.
"Pan Tadeusz" was Poland's official Best Foreign Language Film submission at the 72nd Academy Awards, but did not manage to receive a nomination.
Pan Tadeusz did however win awards at The Polish Film: Eagle award 2000. It won Best Film score, Best actress, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Editing and Best Production Design. Andrzej Wajda won a Life Achievement Award at the same ceremony. Mr. Wajda also won an honorary Academy Award (Oscar statuette) in the same year for five decades of extraordinary film direction.

Archeological Trzcinica.
Trzcinica is the site of one of the most important settlements of the Bronze- and Iron-Age Poland, where around 2100 BCE. the people of the early European Bronze Age culture created a settlement, and where archeologist found, amongst 30,000 objects, artifacts showing influence of the more advanced Carpathian Basin Otomani-Fűzesabony culture - clay wheels of toy or ritual carriages, clay animal figurines. Around 1600 BCE. the Otomani peoples actually arrived, crossing the Carpathian Mountains, from present Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, and took over the existing settlement of Trzcinica, expanding the existing stronghold and fashioning a fortress known to the archaeologists as the "Troy of the North". Amongst the artifacts recovered, some 60,000, there are numerous bronze objects linking the gord of Trzcinica with the Mediterranean Troy. The cumulative area of the Bronze Age Trzcinica fortress was 2 hectares, with powerful earth ramparts. Around 1300 BCE. the stronghold was abandoned. During the early Medieval period, between 770-780 CE, Slavs built a new gord, 3 hectares large, a testimony to the power of a local ruling elite. This gord's power was circumscribed or ceased to exist by the 1030s.

Bejsce

Bejsce is a village in Kazimierza County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Bejsce. It lies approximately east of Kazimierza Wielka and south of the regional capital Kielce.
Bejsce belongs to Lesser Poland, and has a long history, which dates back to the early years of the Kingdom of Poland. In the 10th century, a defensive gord probably existed here, with a chapel, which later was expanded into a church. First mention of Bejsce comes from the year 1063, in a document by Bishop of Kraków Lambert. In 1190, new church was blessed by another Bishop of Kraków, Fulko. Current St. Nicholas church was funded in 1340 by a local nobleman Ostasz Firlej. Throughout the centuries, the church was remodelled and expanded several times. Its oldest part consists of a presbytery with a sacristy. In ca. 1600 late Renaissance-style chapel was added. In the presbytery, there are fragments of Gothic polychrome, which present Byblical scenes. The 1600 chapel was built as a tomb for Voivode of Kraków Mikołaj Firlej and his wife Elżbieta nee Ligęza. It was modelled after Wawel’s Sigismund's Chapel, and the Bejsce chapel is regarded as one of the finest examples of Renaissance chapels in Poland. 
Apart from St. Nicholas church and chapel, Bejsce has a neoclassical palace, built in 1802 by architect Jakub Kubicki for Marcin Badeni, Minister of Justice in the Governments of the Duchy of Warsaw and Congress Poland. Currently the palace houses a Senior Citizen House (see also Neoclassical architecture in Poland).

Sophia Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

Sophia Louisa of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Sofie Luise; 6 May 1685 – 29 July 1735) was a princess of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The third wife of King Frederick I of Prussia, she died childless having gone mad. 
Background.
She was the fourth child of Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow, and Christine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg. She was an aunt of Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Russia, herself mother of Ivan VI. She was a princess of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by viture of her birth. 
Marriage.
On 28 November 1708 she became the third and last wife of Frederick I of Prussia; they had no children. The Sophienkirche in Berlin is named after her. Sophia Louise's marriage was arranged by the powerful Prussian Minister-President Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg, who pressured King Frederick to marry for the sake of the succession after he had been widowed for a second time. Upon her marriage, she was at first known as the "Mecklenburg Venus", but she soon alienated herself from Prussian court life in Berlin. 
She had received no education except in French and music, was described as introverted and serious, and thus was not able to replace her brilliantly cultivated predecessor at court, Queen Sophia Charlotte. Sophia Louise, along with Mademoiselle Gravenitz, made attempts to convince Frederick to convert from Calvinism to the Lutheran faith. Her efforts led to severe arguments with her husband. 
Sophia Louise was not equal to the intrigues of the Berlin court. Her principal opponent, Catharina Rickers, was both the wife of the Count of Wartenberg and the king's mistress. Under the influence of August Hermann Francke, Sophia Louise took refuge in Pietism. She fell into mental derangement in the royal palace and frightened King Frederick into believing that she was the legendary "White Lady" who would foretell his death. 
Finally, she fell into deep depression, and was eventually unable to performed her ceremonial duties. In January 1713, only a few weeks before his death, Frederick sent her back to her family in Mecklenburg-Schwerin. From then on she lived in Grabow castle, and on her death she was buried in the Schelfkirche St. Nikolai in Schwerin.

Similicaudipteryx

Similicaudipteryx, meaning "similar to "Caudipteryx"" (which itself means "tail feather"), is a genus of theropod dinosaur of the family Caudipteridae.
Discovery and naming.
In 2007 the find of a new caudipterid was reported. In 2008 the new genus "Similicaudipteryx", with as type species "Similicaudipteryx yixianensis", was named and descrived by He Tao, Wang Xiaolin and Zhou Zonghe. The generic name, derived from Latin "similis", "resembling", refers to its similarity to the closely related "Caudipteryx". The specific name refers to its provenance from Yixian County. Presently, "S. yixianensis" is the only species named in the genus.
The holotype specimen, IVPP V 12556, was recovered from the Jiufotang Formation of northeastern China, dating to the early Cretaceous Period middle Aptian stage, about 120 million years ago or perhaps early Albian stage, about 112 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton of an adult individual compressed on a plate, that however lacks the skull, the front neck and the hands.
In 2010 two additional specimens were referred to "Similicaudipteryx", one of a juvenile, STM4-1, and the other of a much larger juvenile, STM22-6. Both were reported as found in the Yixian Formation, dating to the early Aptian stage, about 124 million years ago.
In 2010 Gregory S. Paul renamed the species to "Caudipteryx yixianensis", but this has found no acceptance.
Description.
"Similicaudipteryx" is known from three specimens ranging from young juvenile to adult. It was a small oviraptorosaur similar to, but larger than, the perhaps closely related "Caudipteryx". Paul in 2010 estimated the length at one metre, the weight at seven kilogrammes. Like "Caudipteryx", it had a short snout with a downcurved lower jaw. It had relatively short arms and long legs. "Similicaudipteryx" also differed from its relatives by possessing a dagger-shaped pygostyle (the bone at the end of the tail to which feathers anchor in birds) consisting of the two most extreme tail vertebrae and several unique features of the back vertebrae. The pubic bone was exceptionally long relative to the ilium. The only other oviraptorosaur reported to have a pygostyle is "Nomingia", though the feature is widespread in more advanced birds and appears to have evolved at least twice.
Feathers.
The first "Similicaudipteryx" specimen lacked traces of feathers, but He and colleagues speculated that they were probably present based on its pygostyle, the anchor point of long tail feathers (rectrices) in modern birds. In 2010, two new specimens were described, both of which preserved feather traces. These specimens (both juveniles, though one closer to maturity than the other) showed that the feathers were similar to the related "Caudipteryx", with long (symmetrical) vaned feathers on the hand and tail, and the rest of the body covered in simpler, downy feathers.
Paleobiology.
The nature of the feathers preserved in the two immature Yixian specimens of "Similicaudipteryx" appeared to Xu and colleagues, who described the two feathered specimens, to change with age. The youngest specimen had relatively short primary feathers (those anchored to the hand) compared to its tail feathers. In the older specimen, the primary feathers were the same length as the tail feathers, and secondary feathers (those anchored to the lower arm) were also present. The primary feathers may have grown more slowly than the tail feathers, not reaching equal size until the animal was close to maturity, and the secondary feathers would not appear at all until this more mature stage. This suggests that the wing feathers had little use at a young age, only becoming fully developed with maturity.
Additionally, the youngest specimen's vaned feathers appeared to lack barbs except at the tip, instead consisting of a solid sheet. Xu and colleagues interpreted the stark differences in the feathers of the two specimens as primarily age-related. They speculated that hatchling "Similicaudipteryx" would have been covered in natal down like modern birds. As the animal aged, the down would be replaced by vaned pennaceous feathers on the hands and tail, but ribbon-like and primitive in form, similar to the tail feathers of "Confuciusornis", "Epidexipteryx", and some enantiornithines. These feathers would be lost through moulting as the animal aged, and replaced with more modern-style barbed feathers. The primary feathers grew more slowly than the tail feathers, not reaching equal size until the animal was close to maturity, and the secondary feathers would not appear at all until this more mature stage. This suggests that the wing feathers had little use at a young age, only becoming fully developed with maturity.
However, feather development specialist Richard Prum disputed the above interpretation of the feathers in a November 2010 letter to the journal "Nature". Prum noted that the apparently ribbon-like structure of the juvenile's feathers were consistent with pennaceous feathers in the midst of moulting. In modern birds, new vaned feathers emerge from the feather follicle enclosed in a "pin feather", a solid tube covered in keratin. Usually, the tip of this tube will fall away first, leaving a structure identical to that seen in the "Similicaudipteryx" fossil. Later, the rest of the sheath falls away when the entire feather has fully developed. Prum also noted, as did Xu and his team, that the structure of the "Similicaudipteryx" feathers is fundamentally different from other prehistoric birds with ribbon-like tail feathers. In those other species, the ribbon portion is formed from a flattened and expanded rachis, or central quill, of the feather, with the feather barbs expanding out at the tip. In "Similicaudipteryx", however, the "ribbon" like portion is the same width as the vaned tip. This is consistent with what is seen in feathers in the process of moulting. Prum concluded that rather than representing an instance of feathers changing in form as the animal aged, this specimen represents the first known fossil evidence of feather moulting.
Prum also noted that in modern birds, tail feathers moult sequentially, not simultaneously as in "Similicauipteryx". However, the sequential moulting of modern birds is because the birds need to retain their ability to fly during the moult. For lineages more primitive than the advent of flight, like "Similicaudipteryx", this would not have been an issue, and all the wing and tail feathers of primitive feathered theropods may have moulted simultaneously.
Phylogeny.
"Similicaudipteryx" was by its describers assigned to the Caudipteridae. An exact cladistic analysis of its position was not performed.

Bad Reputation (Joan Jett song)

"Bad Reputation" is a rock song performed by Joan Jett and first released on her debut album titled "Bad Reputation" in 1980.
Accolades.
In 2009 it was named the 29th best hard rock song of all time by VH1. It is the highest song by a woman on the list.
Video.
The video, directed by David Mallet, is a re-enactment of 23 record labels rejecting Joan Jett's first solo album and her subsequent rise to the top of the charts with "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". Kenny Laguna, cofounder of Blackheart Records, makes a cameo as the Warner Brothers executive.
In popular culture.
The song is featured in the following films and television series:
Additionally, the song is featured as playable song in the video game "Rock Band 2". Cover versions are sung by surf band Los Straitjackets and Avril Lavigne. The song was sampled by Peaches on the track "I Don't Give A...," taken from her 2003 album Fatherfucker.
The song was used for a 2011 animated AIDS awareness video produced by the French non-profit organization AIDES. The cartoon, produced by Goodby, Silverstein and Partners and presented in the style of 1920s era animation, features the comically exaggerated sexual adventures of a cat named "Smutley" and ends with the message, "He has nine lives. You only have one. Protect yourself."
The song is also used as the walkout song for current UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey.
Avril Lavigne version.
"Bad Reputation" was recorded by Canadian singer Avril Lavigne for a video montage interval in her "Best Damn Tour". The studio recording of the cover was later included on the deluxe edition of her fourth studio album "Goodbye Lullaby" and on the Japanese edition of her fifth self-titled album. It was then reported on 17 October 2012 that Lavigne would be contributing two cover songs to the anime film ""; the latter studio recording and a cover of Nickelback's "How You Remind Me". The song was released for the film only in Japan on 11 December 2012, as a digital download on the ""One Piece Film: Z"" soundtrack. After heavy radio airplay, the cover peaked at #8 on the Japan Hot 100.

List of School Days episodes

The "School Days" anime, based on the visual novel of the same name, was produced by TNK as a twelve-episode television series and two direct-to-video (OVA) releases. With the exception of the latter releases, the story, much like the game, follows the life of Makoto Ito, a first-year high school student who becomes the ambivalent love-interest of several girls during his second term, and the effects this has on himself and his relationships.
The premiere of the televised anime aired on July 3, 2007 on TV Kanagawa and finished up broadcast September 26 on AT-X. Other stations that participated in the broadcast included Chiba TV, TV Aichi, TV Osaka and TV Saitama. On September 17, 2007, the day before the twelfth and final episode of the televised anime was to air on TV Kanagawa, a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their Kyoto home with an axe. TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content, as did every other station but AT-X who remained indecisive. In the week following though, AT-X announced that it had decided to air the finale on September 27 and October 1.
Eleven pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; two opening themes and nine ending themes. Three albums, "Innocent Blue", "School Days Ending Theme+", and the "School Days TV Original Sound Track" were published by Lantis, respectively containing the opening, closing and background themes. From September 26, 2007 to February 27, 2008, "School Days" was published into six limited and regular edition DVDs containing two episodes each. The first direct-to-video episode, "Valentine Days" was bundled with limited edition copies of "School Days L×H". The second, "Magical Heart Kokoro-chan", was released on March 6, 2008.

Stradów, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship

Stradów is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Czarnocin, within Kazimierza County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Czarnocin, north of Kazimierza Wielka, and south of the regional capital Kielce.
History.
In the Middle Ages, a large Slavic gord was located here. Altogether, the complex covered the area of some 25 hectares, and was among the largest of early Poland. The gord probably existed from the 8th to the 12th century, and was placed among hills, which provided defensive cover. Archaeologists found here traces of wooden houses, furnaces, and fortifications. The gord had the population of several hundred, it probably was an important administrative center of the region. Most likely, it belonged to the state of the Vistulans, and some time in the late 10th century, Stradów was seized by another Slavic tribe, the Polans. By the 12th century, the importance of Stradów diminished, as it was replaced by other local towns, seats of castellans, such as Wislica.
Central part of the gord of Stradów was the so-called Zamczysko, with the area of 1,5 hectares. It was surrounded by a rampart with a moat, which had the shape of a horseshoe. Next to Zamczysko there were subdivisions of the gord, now known as Miescisko and Barzynskie. They also were protected by a system of ramparts and moats. The size of the complex suggests that in case of danger, hundreds of local residents were able to find protection there.
Stradów also has a wooden church of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, which was founded in 1657 by Voivode of Kraków, Wladyslaw Myszkowski. It was built in the spot of an earlier church from 1326, which was burned down in 1656, during the Swedish invasion of Poland. In the 19th century, the church, which is famous for the painting of Our Lady of Stradów, was remodelled and expanded. Inside there is a stone baptismal font (17th century), several paintings (17th and 18th centuries), Baroque equipment and silver dress of Our Lady of Stradów (1879). Next to the church stands a wooded bell tower (1780).
During World War Two, on January 11, 1945, a unit of the Home Army destroyed here a unit of the Wehrmacht, together with their Ukrainian collaborators.

Mark Oldroyd

Sir Mark Oldroyd (30 May 1843 – 5 July 1927) was a British woollen manufacturer and Liberal Party politician from West Yorkshire.
He was born the youngest of three sons and two daughters of Mark Oldroyd and his wife Rachel. He was educated initially at a small school in Dewsbury, followed by a spell at Batley Grammar School. He then trained as a minister at New College London, but he did not pursue his vocation and returned to Dewsbury in 1862, getting a job at the family woollen firm. And in World War II he made army and navy uniforms.
In 1871 he married Maria Mewburn, with whom he had no children however, he did have illegitimate children with a single mistress who was one of his mill girls and now has many descendents. In 1874 the family company was publicly floated for £750,000 in £10 shares, with Mark and his brother John running the firm as life directors, presiding over a merger with Blakeley & Latta, a blanket company. In 1877 John got into financial difficulties and was forced to leave the company, putting Mark in charge of rebuilding and managing the business, which he did with great success. By the 1880s the business’s blanket works near Leeds was manufacturing 1000 pairs of blankets a day, and four factories in Dewsbury were making between 7000 and of broadcloth a day. By 1888 the company employed 2000 people on of mill floor space, and had invested in a pair of collieries at Castleford, which supplied coal for the textile industry.
In 1888 he was also elected Member of Parliament for Dewsbury as a Liberal, having been a card-carrying member since 1866. He had previously been a town councillor, Alderman, a borough magistrate and one-time Mayor of Dewsbury. His parliamentary attendance was infrequent, but was actively involved in trade and industry-related committees. In 1902 he resigned from Parliament to concentrate on business interests, and he was knighted in 1909. Local and national commitments diverted Mark's attentions from the company, and he resigned his life directorship in 1913. 
Sir Mark was also a philanthropist who donated money for the building of local places of worship, schools and the first local hospital.

The Riddle of the Third Mile

The Riddle of the Third Mile is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the sixth novel in Inspector Morse series.
Inspector Morse is not sure what to make of the truncated body found dumped in the Oxford Canal, but he suspects it may be all that's left of an elderly Oxford don last seen boarding the London train several days before. Whatever the truth, the inspector knows it will not be simple—it never is. As he retraces Professor Browne-Smith's route through a London netherworld of topless bars and fancy bordellos, his forebodings are fulfilled. The evidence mounts; so do the bodies. So Morse downs another pint, unleashes his pit bull instincts, and solves a mystery that defies all logic.
Plot summary.
The novel is divided into three books - the first mile, the second mile and the third mile. The title is a reference to the biblical sentence "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain" as in St Matthew, Chapter Five, Verse Forty-One. The third mile could also indirectly refer to a particularly elaborate scheme used in the book to lure three of the college staff to London.
The First mile.
There are three main narratives in this book. 
During the world war, there are three brothers Albert, Alfred and Johnny Gilbert serving as tank officers in the army. Albert and Alfred are said to be lookalike twins. The youngest brother is trapped in his tank during an offensive and is burnt to death. The two elder brothers are unable to help due to a direct order from the lieutenant Browne-Smith. They develop a hatred to Browne-Smith (mistakenly) believing that he was a coward not to try and save a fellow officer. 
At the present time, Browne-Smith is a Professor at Oxford. He departs on a mysterious trip to London where he visit a topless bar and then proceeds to a brothel. There he is served drugged drinks and he collapses on the floor.
A few days later, the Master of Lonsdale college invites Morse and voices suspicion about the disappearance of Browne-Smith. He has left the college without any communication or forwarding address. Morse promises to keep an eye out for any information that comes his way. It is revealed that Morse was a student of Browne-Smith in his college days and the reason Morse picked up his obsession for grammar and spelling. We also see a short flashback into Morse's college days and his breakup with his college sweetheart.
Then, the police discover a dismembered corpse in the water at Trupp. The corpse is missing the head, arms and legs. This makes identification difficult but Morse believes that the corpse could be that of Browne-Smith. It is also found that Browne-Smith was suffering from brain tumour and had only a few more weeks left to live.
The Second Mile.
As more evidence accumulates, suspicion seems to fall on Prof.Westerby who was antagonistic towards Browne-Smith at college and is supposedly on a vacation to Greece after his recent retirement. But Morse speculates that the body is not that of Browne-Smith but probably Westerby thereby the need to dismember the corpse to confuse the police.
During a visit to Browne-Smith's room at the college, Morse meets one of the Gilbert twins who is running a packers and movers business engaged to shift the retired Westerby's effects. Thereby Morse, gains the address of Westerby's new flat in London. On travelling there, he finds another corpse, this time stabbed with a screw driver. In a moment of forgivable lapse brought about his fear of corpses, Morse does not recognize the murderer and allows him to walk free.
The second mile concludes with three more deaths - one being murder, one suicide and one general causes, thereby leaving none of the suspects alive.
The Third Mile.
Morse largely guesses how things happened. His theory goes as follows: The Gilbert twins wanted to kill Browne-Smith in order to avenge the death of Johnny Gilbert and set up an elaborate scheme to lure him to London. They realize that Johnny actually committed suicide so let Browne-Smith go. Browne-Smith in turn uses the same scheme to lure Westerby and confronts him. Browne-Smith in turn, realizes that he was mistaken in his antagonism. He has always assumed (wrongly) that Westerby had voted against him in the election for Master of the college. Westerby and Browne-Smith both realize that the current Master had voted against both of them in their previous elections. So they use the same scheme for the third time to lure the Master to London and kill him. Browne-Smith was, however, guilt-ridden and tried to steer Morse to the culprits. It is suggested that he was mentally not in control due to side-effects of the tumor.
Morse further guesses that the corpse found in Trupp was the Master. Westerby killed Alfred in his London flat and in turn, Albert killed Westerby and then committed suicide. Browne-smith died of his tumor.
Characters.
He is one of the Gilbert twins. He is described as the quick witted and resourceful of the two. He kills Westerby and commits suicide on learning that his wife has left him.
He is the second twin and is killed by Westerby. 
He is a professor of Lonsdale college and suffering from a life threatening brain tumour. He was a former Lieutenant and the Gilbert brothers served under him. Like Morse, he is obsessed with grammar and spelling.
Another professor at Lonsdale who dislikes Browne-Smith as he thinks that Smith voted against him in the election for the Master's seat. He used his car to dump the first corpse into the Trupp.
While never mentioned by name, he is finally revealed to be of a dubious character. He has voted against Smith and later Westerby thereby voting them out of the race for the Mastership. He is also said to be involved in inappropriate dealing about the results.

Aimery of Limoges

Aimery or Aymery of Limoges (died c. 1196), "Aimerikos" in Greek and "Hemri" in Armenian, was a Roman Catholic ecclesiarch in Frankish Outremer and the fourth Latin Patriarch of Antioch from c. 1140 until his death. Throughout his lengthy episcopate he was the most powerful figure in the Principality of Antioch after the princes, and often entered into conflict with them. He was also one of the most notable intellectuals to rise in the Latin East. 
Aimery was a nobleman of high rank, wealthy and worldly. He was an intellectual with sound knowledge of both Greek and Latin as well as some vernaculars. He may have been the first to translate parts of the Bible into a Romance language, namely Castilian. As a scholar he was well-informed about Greek history. He wrote to Hugh Etherian requesting the commentaries of John Chrysostom on the Pauline epistles, the acts of the Council of Nicaea, and a history of the Byzantine emperors "from the time their emperors split away from the Roman Empire until the present day." He also fulfilled a request of Pope Eugenius III for a Latin translation of Chrysostom's commentary on the Gospel of Matthew by sending an original Greek manuscript to Rome. As bishop Aimery sought to control the hermits who inhabited the Black Mountain, ordering each to have his own spiritual adviser. 
Disputed succession (1140–49).
Aimery's succession to the patriarchate was disputed. His predecessor, Ralph de Domfront, was not dead, but rather had been deposed and was arguing to Pope Innocent II to be reinstated. Aimery appears to have waited a long time for his consecration after Ralph's dismissal. Until 1149 there is no mention of Aimery as patriarch, probably because Ralph was alive and the legitimacy of either was suspect. After the Battle of Inab in 1149, the victorious Nureddin besieged the city of Antioch, which was stoutly defended by Aimery and the Princess Constance until a relief force led by Baldwin III of Jerusalem arrived and dispersed the Muslims. Ralph probably died in 1149 and Aimery was accepted universally among Catholics. 
Dispute with Raynald of Châtillon (1153).
In 1153 Aimery opposed the secret marriage of Constance to the petty nobleman Raynald of Châtillon. Aimery's subsequent relationship with Raynald was stormy. In 1156 Raynald claimed that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus had reneged on his promise to pay Raynald a sum of money, and vowed to attack the island of Cyprus in revenge. When Aimery refused to finance this expedition, Raynald had the Patriarch seized, beaten until bloody, stripped naked, covered in honey, and left in the burning sun on top of the citadel to be attacked by insects. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition against Cyprus. Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island and pillaging its inhabitants. Aimery meanwhile left Antioch for the city of Jerusalem, where he stayed until Raynald's capture. 
Exile in Jerusalem (1156–60).
In September 1158 Aimery performed the marriage of Theodora Comnena, Manuel's niece, and Baldwin III, because the elected Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, had yet to be consecrated. Aimery returned to Antioch with Baldwin in 1159. 
In 1160 Aimery, with many other Palestinian prelates, recognised Alexander III as pope only after a long debate. 
In 1160 Raynald was captured by Maj al-Dīn, the ruler of Aleppo, and imprisoned. Though Constance claimed the right to rule on her own, Baldwin III installed her son by an earlier husband, Bohemond III, as Prince and appointed Aimery regent. Constance protested this decision at the court of the emperor Manuel in Constantinople, as the Byzantine emperor was nominal overlord of Antioch. 
Regency (1164–65) and second exile (1165–71).
In 1164, Bohemond was captured by Nureddin at the Battle of Harim. Aimery assumed the regency of the principality and immediately sent a letter to Louis VII of France requesting military aid. The rule of the patriarch was brief. Bohemond was freed, for a ransom of 150,000 dinars, in 1165 through the intervention of Manuel and Amalric I of Jerusalem. Upon his release Bohemond visited Manuel and agreed to re-establish a Greek Patriarch in Antioch, Athanasius I. Aimery protested this and imposed an interdict on the city. He remained in exile at his castle of al-Quṣayr ("Xusayr") until the death of Athanasius in 1170 in an earthquake that destroyed the cathedral during the liturgy. By 1180 the Byzantine emperor was treating Aimery as the legitimate patriarch, and it is not unlikely that William of Tyre in some negotiations at Antioch and then Constantinople on behalf of Amalric of Jerusalem had reconciled them. 
During his exile Aimery was on good terms with the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch, Michael the Syrian, whom he met at Jerusalem during Easter 1167. In order to humiliate Athanasius, Aimery arranged with Bohemond III for Michael's ceremonious entry into Antioch and there Aimery welcomed him in the cathedral of Saint Peter. Michael stayed with Aimery until Easter 1169. He also invited the Jacobite to accompany him to the Third Lateran Council in 1179, and Michael obliged him with a treatise against Manichaeism that the Catholics could use against the Cathars, but declined to attend. Aimery was the first Latin prelate to allow the Jacobite Patriarch to appoint a vicar, his brother Athanasius, in Antioch. 
Antioch under interdict (c. 1180–81).
Around 1181, Bohemond left his wife Theodora, a niece of the recently deceased Emperor Manuel, and married a woman named Sibylla, "who had the reputation of practicing evil arts" according to William of Tyre. He was excommunicated by Pope Alexander III, and Antioch was placed under an interdict. He imprisoned Aimery and other bishops and looted their churches. Aimery, supported by the nobility of Antioch under their leader, Reynald Mazoir, lord of Margat, held out in al-Quṣayr under siege by Bohemond. Aimery himself took part in the fighting and even instigating rioting against Bohemond's rule. Baldwin IV of Jerusalem intervened by sending Patriarch Eraclius of Jerusalem to Laodicea to negotiate with both parties. Bohemond remained excommunicate so long as he kept Sibylla, and Aimery's church property was returned, but the interdict on Antioch was lifted. 
Defence of Antioch (1194).
In 1194 Bohemond, his family, and his court were captured at Baghrās by Leo II, Prince of Armenia, and imprisoned on Sis. To gain his freedom, he agreed to surrender Antioch to Leo. Bartholomew Tirel, the marshal of Antioch, and Richard de L'Erminet were sent to surrender the city to the Armenian Heṭoum of Sassoun. Aimery, at the head of the clergy, encouraged the citizens to resist the takeover and the Armenians were forced outside the walls while a commune was established that recognised the authority of Raymond IV of Tripoli until Bohemond's release. The commune then sent for aid to Henry I of Jerusalem. 
Maronite– and Armenian–Latin reunion.
In 1181 Aimery was met by the Maronite Patriarch and some of his bishops from the Catholic dioceses of Jubayl, Botrun, and Tripoli on Mount Lebanon. They formally asked for recommunion with the Catholic Church, from which the Maronites had been separated since the eighth century. Aimery did not live to see reunion, but he did have a part to play in reunion with the Armenian Church in 1195 and he even permitted Nerses of Lampron to preach in his churches.

He won the Piano Competition in Geneva (1955), the Michaels Memorial Award in Chicago (1956), the Leventritt Competition in New York (1959), and the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels (1960). 
He made his Carnegie Hall debut in November 1960, performing Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 6. 
His Grammy-nominated debut recording with RCA Victor Red Seal was Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 16 and Haydn's Sonata No. 35 in E-flat. He recorded music by Mozart, Haydn, Chopin, Schumann, Beethoven, Brahms and Prokofiev. Frager regularly programmed the two piano concertos and numerous solo works by Carl Maria von Weber, as well as the keyboard compositions of C. P. E. Bach.
Frager's personal library is now housed at the Sibley Library Special Collections at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.

Nowhere to Go (1958 film)

Nowhere to Go is a 1958 British crime film directed by Seth Holt, his directorial debut. It stars George Nader, Maggie Smith (receiving her first screen credit), Bernard Lee, Harry H. Corbett and Lionel Jeffries. After a criminal escapes from jail, his attempts to recover his stashed loot end in failure, as he is shunned by the criminal community and hunted down by the police.
Originally edited down as part of a double bill, the full-length version of "Nowhere to Go" was released on DVD in January 2013.
Plot.
Paul Gregory (Nader), a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match,he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He then completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. 
However, the judge makes an example of the uncoooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane (Bernard Lee), one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. He makes his way to London where he plans to collect his hidden money. Almost immediately things begin to go wrong. Fearing being arrested by the police he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. 
Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead - accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth - they refuse to offer him any assistance as he is now too "hot".
With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard (Maggie Smith), a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out where he is found by another farmer. Meanwhile Bridget tells the police nothing. She waits in vain for Gregory at the cottage, then walks into the distance.
Production.
The film was based on a novel by Donald MacKenzie. It was made at MGM's British studios, but put out under the Ealing Studios banner. Ealing had moved there following the sale of its own studio base in 1955. It was the penultimate Ealing release, followed only by the "The Siege of Pinchgut" (1959). The film's director Seth Holt had been a long-term film editor at Ealing, and he was the last major beneficiary of studio head Michael Balcon's policy of promoting from within.
Reception.

United States presidential election in California, 1976

The 1976 United States presidential election in California refers to how California participated in the 1976 United States presidential election. California narrowly voted for the Republican incumbent, Gerald Ford, over the Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter.
Ford won the state with a plurality of 49.35% of the vote to Carter's 47.57%, a victory margin of 1.78%. Carter performed more strongly in rural Northern California, winning many counties in California's Central Valley, while Ford performed more strongly in Southern California, sweeping every county there except Los Angeles County, which narrowly voted for Carter.
This was only the fifth time in California’s electoral history that it did not support the winning candidate from either party. This is also the last election where the Democrat candidate won the Presidency without carrying California.
Carter is the last Democrat to carry the counties of Amador, El Dorado, Lassen, Madera, Placer, Shasta, Sierra and Yuba, and the last to win a majority of the vote in Del Norte, Plumas and Tehama. Carter is also the last candidate from either party to carry Los Angeles by only a plurality, while Ford is the last Republican to win a majority of the vote in Marin (Ronald Reagan later won that county by plurality in 1980).

Kenneth A. Spencer

Kenneth Aldred Spencer (January 25, 1902-February 19, 1960) was a Kansas coal mine owner who transformed a government surplus factory into the world's biggest ammonium nitrate producer. Money from his and his wife's estate was donated to philanthropies throughout the Kansas City, Missouri area.
He was born in Columbus, Kansas but grew up in Pittsburg, Kansas.
Spencer graduated from the University of Kansas in 1926 and went into his father's business of Pittsburg & Midway Coal Company in Pittsburg, Kansas. 
In 1941 the War Department contacted him about operating a weapons-grade ammonia nitrate plant in Galena, Kansas that would become the Jayhawk Ordnance Works. He would say later:
He set up the Military Chemical Works, Inc. as a subsidiary of Pittsburg & Midway with himself as President and built the plant by 1943 with it producing 14,500 tons a month.
U.S. ordnance facilities were placed in the mid-U.S. during World War II. Other plants to be built and owned by others included the Kansas Ordnance Plant at Parsons, Kansas, the Sunflower Ordnance Plant at DeSoto, Kansas, the Ozark Ordnance Plant at El Dorado, Arkansas.
After the war with help from J.H. Whitney & Company he entered into a lease with an option to buy (which he did in 1951) the plant to use the ammonia nitrate as fertilizer under the new name of Spencer Chemical. He succeeded his father as head of the Pittsburg and Midway. It was so successful that he was able to endow a foundation by 1949.
Spencer would also buy plants in Calumet City, Illinois, Henderson, Kentucky, Vicksburg, Mississippi, Fort Worth, Texas and Orange, Texas.
Spencer was one of the nine original founders of the Midwest Research Institute, founded in 1944. Its first mission was finding peaceful uses of ammonium nitrate. He would be chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1954 to 1957.
Helen Foresman Spencer.
Helen Elizabeth Foresman (November 8, 1902-February 15, 1982) was born in Joplin, Missouri and grew up in Amarillo, Texas and spent high school in Pittsburg, Kansas where she married Kenneth Spencer on January 6, 1927. They moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1940.
Following the success of the Spencer Chemical Company, they formed the Spencer Foundation in 1949. When Kenneth died in 1960, she liquidated the companies selling Spencer to Gulf Oil and then oversaw the Kenneth A. and Helen F. Spencer Foundation until her death in 1982.
The Spencer Chemical Corporation name disappeared with the new owners. The Pittsburg and Midway company continued to operate under that name under its eventual owner Chevron although no longer mining in Kansas. That company name was abolished in 2007 when Chevron formally consolidated its mining operations under the Chevron Mining name.

Ventricina

Ventricina is a delicatessen item commonly found in the Abruzzo Region of central Italy. It is most similar to what Americans refer to as "cold cuts". Traditionally made using relatively low grade, very fatty meat cuts pig and encasing them in the animal's intestines or stomach while they cure. There are two principal types of ventricina: those of the area in and around the city of Teramo, and others coming from the area of Vasto. 
Teramo ventricina.
This version of ventricina is made from pork meat with added pork fat, the latter amounting to approximately 50-60% by weight of the finished product. The meat and fat are finely ground together and various spices are then added to the mixture. Most often these include garlic, salt, ground black and white pepper, hot and bell peppers, orange peel, rosemary, bell pepper paste, and fennel seeds. Other spices are sometimes added according to the taste of the producer. Traditionally, this mixture would be encased in the bladder, stomach, or intestines of the pig. More recently, synthetic casings have been employed or the mixture is simply stored in glass containers. Ventricina is often hung to cure in a cool dark place for several months before it is eaten. Ventricina teramana (that from the area around Teramo in Abruzzo) is most often eaten when it is young and has been allowed to age only a few months. Many people spread this delicacy on an open slice of bread. If desired the bread slices can be placed on the grill or in the oven for a period of time, thereby making a kind of bruschetta.
Vasto ventricina.
In comparison to the Teramo ventricina, that made in Vasto contains a much lower percentage of fat, typically in the neighborhood of 30% or so. The meat in this ventricina is cut into larger cubes of about two centimeters. Spices include bell peppers, hot peppers, fennel seeds and ground pepper.

Idaho Museum of Natural History

Idaho Museum of Natural History (IMNH) is the state's official natural history museum located on the Campus of Idaho State University located in Pocatello. Founded in 1934, it has collections in anthropology, vertebrate paleontology, earth science, and the life sciences. Additionally, it contains an archive of documents and ethnographic photographs.
History.
The founding of the IMNH can be traced back to 1934 when a group of dedicated professors and researchers decided to collect, preserve, and display the region's natural and cultural heritage. The Museum was originally established as the Historical Museum at the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho. In the beginning, the Museum’s collection consisted of 5,000 objects that were primarily anthropological, archaeological, and historical artifacts that were donated by the Pocatello Chamber of Commerce, faculty, and supporters of the university's Southern Branch. 
The Museum was governed by a 17 member Historic Museum Committee until the mid-1950s when it was renamed the Idaho State College Museum. By 1963, the Idaho State College was renamed Idaho State University and the Museum changed its name to the Idaho State University Museum. 
In 1977, the museum shifted its focus toward natural history, the Ray J. Davis Herbarium, and zoological collections. A majority of the collections were transferred from the Idaho State University Department of Biological Sciences to the museum. Also during this time, the Idaho State University Museum acquired historical collections from the Idaho State Historical Society, the Bannock County Historical Society, and the Idaho State University Library. 
In May 1977, the Idaho State Board of Education adopted a resolution requesting that Governor John V. Evans designate the Idaho State University Museum as the Idaho Museum of Natural History (IMNH) and signed into law on July 1, 1977. In 1986, the Idaho State Legislature confirmed the IMNH as Idaho’s official state museum of natural history.
Mission statement.
The Idaho Museum of Natural History actively nurtures an understanding of and delight in Idaho's natural and cultural heritage. As the official state museum of natural history, it acquires, preserves, studies, interprets and displays natural and cultural objects for Idaho residents, visitors and the world's community of students and scholars. The Museum also supports and encourages Idaho's other natural history museums through mentoring and training in sound museological practices. 
Collections.
IMNH houses over 500,000 specimens in collections. The Museum collects, preserves, and documents the natural history of Idaho and the Intermountain West. Collections are divided into three areas: anthropology, earth sciences, and life sciences. A majority of the artifacts found at IMNH have been recovered and analyzed by staff and students of Idaho State University.
Anthropology.
Anthropology is the study of human cultural diversity, archaeology, language, human biology, and evolution. The anthropology collection focuses on Idaho, but is not limited to the region. The collection represents a number of human artifacts which range from the Late Ice Age in Idaho to modern bead working traditions. These collections emphasize the diverse range of research and educational opportunities within the anthropological collections. 
Earth Science.
The earth science collection focuses on the natural history of rocks, minerals, and fossils. Specimens within the earth science collection focus on a number of different studies including paleontology, geology, paleobotany, and comparative osteology.
Life Science.
The life science collection comprises a number of life science studies including the study of living organisms such as plants, animals, and human beings. The Museum’s life science collection is one of the most complete collections of the biological makeup of Idaho. The Ray J. Davis Herbarium houses over 70,000 pressed plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. The zoological collection consists of roughly 1,200 mammals, 1,800 birds, 2,500 reptiles, and 1,000 fish.
Exhibits.
IMNH exhibits come directly from the museum’s collections and help describe the natural and cultural history of the surrounding area.
Anthropology.
The anthropology displays within the gallery represent the peoples of Idaho both past and present. The displays represent how the peoples of Idaho lived, survived, and used the landscapes, ecosystems, and geology of Idaho. The exhibits contain ethnographic material, archaeological material, replicas, historic and modern photographs, and historic audio recordings in several Native Idahoan languages. 
Earth Science.
The Earth Science exhibits provide insight into Idaho’s geology, trackways of Idaho, and Ice-age megafauna. The Idaho Geology exhibits display a number of artifacts from minerals to fossils. The geology exhibits allow individuals to discover and learn about the geology of Idaho by providing individuals with hands-on activities. Trackways exhibits display ancient footprints left in sandstone by animals. Footprints that can be found in these exhibits vary from spiders, dinosaurs, and early mammals. The Ice-age Megafauna exhibits display the areas fossil history. These exhibits allow individuals to discover the skeletons of large prehistoric creatures such as saber tooth cats, giant bison, and the Hagerman horse.
Life Science.
The Life Science exhibits highlight the diverse flora and fauna of the Snake River plains. Some of the artifacts that are currently on display include a diverse array of rodents, including flying squirrels, kangaroo rats, beavers, and marmots. Other artifacts on display include owls and sage groups. The Life Science exhibits also display a diverse collection of native reptiles, amphibians, and fish of Southern Idaho. Lastly, the Ray J. Davis Herbarium allows IMNH to display a wide arrangement of native plants, some of which are extinct. Plants that are on display include the yellow glacier lily, camas, syringe, and many more.
Education.
Educational programs developed by the Museum are intended to provide individuals with a rich learning experience. The educational opportunities the IMNH provides vary in age and target group to give every child an educational experience that is appropriate for their age and interest. Educational programs include: 
Role of Idaho State University.
The IMNH was established under Idaho Statutes with the intention of: 
Recognizing the importance of our natural heritage to citizens of the state of Idaho, and the need for a state museum of natural history which would preserve and interpret natural history objects and which would provide educational services about our natural heritage for both residents and visitors through its own facilities and by supporting and encouraging local municipal natural history museums throughout the state of Idaho, there is hereby created and established at Idaho State University a state museum of natural history to be known as the Idaho Museum of Natural History, where tangible objects and documents reflecting our natural heritage may be collected, preserved, studied, interpreted, and displayed for educational purposes.
Under Idaho Statute, IMNH is intended to display Idaho’s natural history. However, IMNH is also used for academic purposes. The museum allows students the opportunity to conduct research on many of the artifacts that are in the museums collection.

Mama (1990 film)

Mama is a 1990 Chinese film directed by Zhang Yuan. Zhang Yuan's directorial debut, "Mama" is today considered a seminal film in the history of Chinese independent cinema, and by extension, as a pioneering film of the Sixth Generation of which Zhang is a member.
Shot on an extreme budget within Zhang Yuan's apartment, "Mama", follows the story of a mother and her grown mentally challenged son. 
Plot.
The film focuses on a librarian struggling to raise her mentally handicapped son in modern day Beijing while at the same time dealing with an absent and unresponsive husband. The story garnered much criticism from state-censors, who found the film too dark. 
While the film was originally written to end on the dour note of the mother euthanizing her son, director Zhang Yuan eventually opted for a more open-ended and ambiguous conclusion.
Production history.
The film that was to become "Mama" began as a screenplay in the Children's Film Studio for a film entitled "The Sun Tree" as based on a story by writer Dai Qing. Zhang Yuan at the time was still a student in the Beijing Film Academy's cinematography department and was slated to serve as the film's director of photography, with Fifth Generation graduate Sun Chen slated to direct. For three months, Zhang worked with screenwriter (and planned lead actor) Qin Yan and Sun storyboarding "The Sun Tree". The studio, however, ultimately decided that the film was not profitable and canceled production.
The project was then picked up by the August First Film Studio, now with Gong Yiqun set as the director. During this second production period, Zhang Yuan again was set to serve as cinematographer and conducted several location-scouting trips to Dunhuang. However, August First canceled the production shortly after the Tiananmen Square incident, in part because Dai Qing had supported the demonstrations and was now a problematic figure politically.
With the project seemingly dead, Zhang Yuan and Qin Yan decided to produce the film independently, asking friends and family for funds. Zhang, Qin, and Zhang's wife, screenwriter Ning Dai also went back to rework the film's original story. The result was a film, in Zhang's words, that "was completely different" and "something much closer to the everyday reality of average Chinese people."
While Zhang Yuan's friend, director Wang Xiaoshuai, was originally set to direct, Zhang himself eventually took over directing duties.
The film was ultimately shot in 1989 in Zhang's apartment on a budget of only ¥100,000, shortly after Zhang had graduated from the BFA.
Style.
Filmed mostly in black and white, the film's small budget often shows in its minimalist style. "Mama"'s small cast of characters and minimal plot would become trademarks to Zhang's films. The film is also notable as an example of Zhang's documentary leanings, as "Mama" also intercuts actual interviews with parents of autistic children throughout the narrative.
Reception.
"Mama" was registered with the state-run Xi'an Film Studio, but was given only a minimal distribution in its native China. Instead the film received numerous accolades abroad, screening at several international film festivals and winning the Special Jury Prize at the Nantes Three Continents Film Festival in 1991.
Today the film is considered a pioneering work and the "first independent Chinese film since 1949." It was selected to screen in the 2005 62nd Venice International Film Festival, as part of that festival's retrospective on Chinese cinema.

2012 Republican National Convention

The 2012 Republican National Convention was a gathering held by the U.S. Republican Party during which delegates officially nominated Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for President and Vice President, respectively, for the 2012 election. Prominent members of the party delivered speeches and discussed the convention theme, "A Better Future."
The convention was held during the week of August 27, 2012, in Tampa, Florida, at the Tampa Bay Times Forum. The city, which expected demonstrations and possible vandalism, used a federal grant to bolster its police force in preparation.
Due to the approach of Hurricane Isaac, convention officials changed the convention schedule on August 26, 2012; the convention came to order on August 27, 2012 and then immediately recessed until the following afternoon because of the risk of Isaac hitting Tampa.
Background.
Host Committee.
On August 14, 2009, the Republican National Committee named an eight member Site Selection Committee to start the process of selecting a host city for the 2012 convention.
News reports in early 2010 indicated that Tampa, as well as Salt Lake City, Utah, and Phoenix, Arizona, had been selected as finalist candidates for the convention site. The decision was announced on May 12, 2010, when Tampa was selected as the host city.
The 2012 Tampa Bay Host Committee, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, was the official and federally designated presidential convention host committee for the convention, charged with the task of raising the necessary funds to hold the convention. The Host Committee was composed of 10 prominent Florida business executives, civic leaders, and other community leaders. Al Austin was chairman and Ken Jones served as the President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Host Committee achieved its fundraising goal as of August 27, 2012, having raised more than $55,000,000 to host the 2012 Republican National Convention.
Objectives and themes.
The convention theme was "A Better Future". Each day also had its own theme: Monday's was "We Can Do Better"; Tuesday's was "We Built It"; Wednesday's was "We Can Change It"; and Thursday's was "We Believe in America." The choice of theme for Tuesday, "We Built It, " drew comments as the Convention was hosted in an arena built with public funds. In addition to these daily themes, the Republican National Committee announced that it would present a series of policy workshops to be hosted by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called "Newt University".
A primary objective of the convention, described both as Romney's "biggest election hurdle" and as Romney's "most urgent task" of concern by top Republicans, was to counter efforts to portray him as an out-of-touch elitist and to rehabilitate the image of his business career.
The convention lasted from August 27 to 30, 2012. According to the convention website, it hosted 2,286 delegates, 2,125 alternates, and 15,000 credentialed members of the media. The convention CEO was William D. Harris.
Several notable Republican figures chose not to attend the convention, including former presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, and former vice-president Dick Cheney. However, a video tribute to George W. Bush, who has stayed out of the political arena since leaving office, was shown at the convention on Wednesday night, in which Bush's family members praised him. In the tribute, Bush's father, George H. W. Bush, said of George W. Bush: "There was never a taint of scandal around his presidency. And I think we forget the importance of that."
Security.
The convention was designated as a National Special Security Event, which meant that ultimate authority over law enforcement went to the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. The federal government provided $50 million for Convention security. Much of the money went to deputizing additional police. Other expenses included expanded surveillance technology and an armored SWAT vehicle. Tampa Bay disclosed specifically that it had spent $1.18m on video linkages between ground police and helicopters. The city paid $16,500 to the Florida State Fairgrounds Authority in exchange for police use of local fairgrounds as a command center.
Dani Doane of the Heritage Foundation described the police presence as "unnerving" and "like a police state". Others reported a quiet week with small protests and few arrests. Police handed out bottles of water during the event and at one point served protestors a box lunch.
The convention.
Platform.
A committee, chaired by Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, met in Tampa to draft a party platform. On August 21, 2012, the committee released a 60-page document for approval at the convention. The platform was enthusiastically approved at the convention on August 28. Policies include:
Nominations.
According to Fox News and Associated Press delegate projections, Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, clinched the Republican presidential nomination in the Texas primary on May 29, 2012 and became the party's presumptive nominee. Two weeks before the convention, on August 11, Romney announced Paul Ryan as his running mate. The decision made Ryan the first major party vice presidential candidate from Wisconsin.
Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich formally released their delegates in the week before the convention and encouraged them to vote for Romney. Ron Paul retained his delegates, as part of an overall strategy to influence the party. The final composition of several delegations was subject to ruling of the Committee on Contests.
The traditional roll call of the states, which permits delegates to promote their home states, took place on Tuesday, August 28, 2012, the first full day of the convention.
Paul Ryan was nominated for vice-president by voice vote.
Speakers.
The original plan called for speeches on Monday, but due to Tropical Storm Isaac most of the Monday program was cancelled and all the main speakers were rescheduled to speak later at the convention.
Ron Paul was offered a speech slot, under the conditions that the Romney campaign could pre-review his remarks and that he would fully endorse Romney. Paul declined the offer, saying that he remained an "undecided voter". Paul explained that "It wouldn’t be my speech. That would undo everything I’ve done in the last 30 years. I don’t fully endorse him for president." Instead, a tribute video to Paul was shown at the convention.
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers served as the official convention host, speaking at the start of each night of the convention to provide the theme of the speeches for each evening.
The most coveted speaking slot that was intended to close the Monday night program of the convention was scheduled to go to Ann Romney, Mitt Romney’s wife. But since the major television networks had opted out on Monday's primetime coverage (prior to Monday's cancellation of activities), her speech was moved to Tuesday, August 28 after 10:00 pm EDT, when broadcast networks began coverage, with an introduction by Lucé Vela Fortuño, the First Lady of Puerto Rico. Ann Romney's task in her speech was described by Lois Romano of POLITICO as "to try to accomplish what the sharpest minds in Republican politics have failed to do: present her stiff and awkward husband as a likable guy."
Other August 28 speakers included Governors John Kasich (Ohio), Nikki Haley (South Carolina), Bob McDonnell (Virginia), and Mary Fallin (Oklahoma).
Monday, August 27.
Due to Tropical Storm Isaac, the scheduled activities on Monday were postponed or canceled; RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called the convention to order at 2:00 pm on Monday and started a debt clock in the arena, before putting the convention into recess at 2:10 pm.
Tuesday, August 28 - Ann Romney and Christie.
On Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of the Maine delegates walked out of the convention in protest of the decision to replace 10 Ron Paul delegates with 10 Romney delegates. This action by the RNC came in response to a takeover of Maine's Republican State Convention by Paul supporters which resulted in Paul's percentage of delegates being doubled over the percentage of delegates to which he would have been entitled by the caucus vote count; the additional ten delegates came at the expense of Romney.
Originally scheduled to speak at the closing of Monday night's program, Ann Romney spoke in front of the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, August 28, 2012. Romney started off by stating that her speech was not about politics or party, but about love. She spoke about her husband, Mitt Romney, in an attempt to present her husband as likeable and relatable, responding in part to his opponents' depiction of him as an out-of-touch elitist. 
The speakers for the day were:
Wednesday, August 29 - Paul Ryan.
Wednesday saw a speech from vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan. The accuracy of some of Ryan's statements was widely challenged by the media, fact-checkers, and political opponents. The Associated Press criticized Ryan for taking "factual shortcuts", and the speech was criticized in other outlets for being "misleading" and "dishonest". The most widely challenged portion of Ryan's speech occurred when Ryan criticized Obama for supposedly claiming, at a 2008 campaign appearance at a GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin (which was slated for closure), that he (Obama) would keep that plant open if he became President. GM began a phased plant closing for the Janesville facility during the 2008 presidential campaign, laying off nearly all of its 1,200 workers on December 23, 2008. 57 workers remained employed at the plant during final assembly and another 40 to 50 in the decommissioning of the plant. On September 19, 2011, GM reported that the Janesville plant was on standby status, as part of a contract between itself and the UAW.
The speakers for the day were:
Thursday, August 30: Eastwood, Rubio and Romney.
Actor and director Clint Eastwood made a planned surprise appearance at the convention, speaking at the top of the final hour. He spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Obama. In at least two instances, Eastwood implied the President had uttered profanities directed both at Romney and Eastwood. Eastwood's remarks were well-received within the convention hall, but responses were mixed in the media. Film critic Roger Ebert commented "Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic. He didn't need to do this to himself. It's unworthy of him". Breitbart.com editor-at-large John Nolte was more positive in his review, stating that the performance was "funnier, fresher, edgier, and braver than anything those comedy cowards Chris Rock, Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert have done in 15 years." Comedian Bob Newhart, who had popularized empty-chair interviews in the 1960s, tweeted in his deadpan humor style, "I heard that Clint Eastwood was channeling me at the RNC. My lawyers and I are drafting our lawsuit".
Thursday night concluded with Romney's acceptance speech. He announced that if elected, a Romney administration energy policy would take "full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables". Romney also joked about the Obama administration's policies on climate change, saying "President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet", a line which elicited laughter from the convention audience. By way of contrast, Romney continued "MY promise...is to help you and your family."
Thursday's speakers included:
Invocations and blessings.
Besides Rabbi Soloveichik, another five religious leaders were scheduled to provide blessings or invocations, including the Rev. Sammy Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference; Ishwar Singh of the Sikh Society of Central Florida; Archbishop Demetrios, primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America; Ken and Priscilla Hutchins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (to open); and Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan. Dolan gave the closing prayer.
Protests.
In October 2011, Tampa city officials began planning for anticipated protests, and discussions centered around small prior protests by the Occupy movement. According to former Tampa City Council member John Dingfelder, then the senior staff attorney for the mid-Florida office of the American Civil Liberties Union, the convention should expect to draw far more protestors and the city should plan on up to 10,000. Dingfelder encouraged the city to be proactive regarding where protests could occur and protestors could sleep. Tampa's Mayor Bob Buckhorn's response was "If they want a place to sleep, they can go home or to a hotel... Just because they want to occupy something doesn't mean we are obligated to provide them with an opportunity to camp out in a public park or on a sidewalk."
The city of Tampa has banned puppets from downtown during the convention, a decision which some puppet-makers say violates their civil liberties. Police claimed that puppets could be used to conceal weapons—at the 2000 RNC, police charged a group of puppet-makers in Philadelphia with conspiracy to resist arrest.
On August 4, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) held a forum addressing what would be considered free speech during the Convention.
In early August, the city announced plans to provide delegates and protestors alike with potable water and toilets.
Various groups began demonstrating on July 27 in Tampa and Tallahassee as part of a one-month countdown to the convention, calling for "good jobs, healthcare, affordable education, equality and peace."
Unlike the 2004 Republican National Convention which saw 1800 individuals arrested in New York City the Occupy Tampa demonstrators were met with tolerance by Tampa officials.

2012 Democratic National Convention

The 2012 Democratic National Convention was a gathering, held from September 4 to 6, 2012, in Charlotte, North Carolina, in which delegates of the Democratic Party chose the party's nominees for President and Vice President in the 2012 United States national election.
On April 3, 2012, President Barack Obama won the Maryland and District of Columbia primaries, giving him more than the required 2,778 delegates to secure the presidential nomination. He had previously announced that Vice President Joe Biden would be his vice presidential running mate in his re-election bid.
Choice of Charlotte for convention site.
First Lady Michelle Obama announced on February 1, 2011, in an email to supporters that Charlotte, North Carolina, had been chosen as the site for the 2012 Convention. The event was the first nominating convention of a major party ever held in North Carolina. Charlotte was one of four finalists announced by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on June 30, 2010, the others being Cleveland, Minneapolis and St. Louis. It was expected that Charlotte's hosting of this event would generate more than $150 million for Charlotte and surrounding metropolitan areas and bring over 35,000 delegates and visitors. North Carolina was a closely contested state in the 2008 presidential election, with Barack Obama winning the state's 15 electoral votes by just 13,692 votes (out of more than 4.2 million votes cast) and Democrats Kay Hagan and Bev Perdue winning close elections for U.S. Senate and Governor, respectively.
Convention activities.
All three dates of the convention were held at the Time Warner Cable Arena. The announcer for the convention was Sylvia Villagran. The last night, Thursday, September 6, was originally scheduled to be held at the 72,000-seat Bank of America Stadium, where presumptive presidential nominee Barack Obama was to deliver his acceptance speech. After Convention officials insisted that they would hold Thursday's activities at the stadium "rain or shine", the venue was moved to the 20,000 seat indoor arena “... due to thunderstorm threat.” Some in the media questioned the move, wondering whether it was motivated more by an inability to fill the 70,000 seat stadium and the possibility that empty seats would show a lack of enthusiasm. The risk of severe weather wasn't high; Charlotte NBC affiliate WCNC-TV chief meteorologist Brad Panovich tweeted that the "threat is almost zero Thursday night & chance of rain is 20%", adding, "It's a simple question...if you had a Panthers game, concert or soccer match with a 20% chance of storms would you cancel 24 hrs prior?" The date of Obama's acceptance speech caused the National Football League to move the Kickoff game, normally on a Thursday, to Wednesday, September 5, to avoid a conflict. This in turn caused the DNC to move Joe Biden's vice presidential acceptance speech, normally held the day before the presidential acceptance speech, to Thursday, before Obama's speech, to avoid a conflict with the NFL game.
Tuesday, September 4 – Julián Castro and Michelle Obama.
In the opening session on September 4, the keynote speech was delivered by 37-year old San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. In his speech, Castro stated that “the Romney-Ryan budget … doesn't just pummel the middle class, it dismantles it...it dismantles what generations before have built to ensure that everybody can enter and stay in the middle class” and that “Now we need to make a choice...a choice between a country where the middle class pays more so that millionaires can pay less, or a country where everybody pays their fair share, so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future. It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell Grants, or a nation that invests more in education. It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas, or a leader who brings jobs back home...this is the choice before us … Our choice is a man who has always chosen us. A man who already is our president, Barack Obama”, with the "Global Post" describing the audience as "adoring and appreciative" and the speech as "powerful words, and the audience responded with gratitude."
First Lady Michelle Obama gave the final speech of the evening, stating that “Barack knows what it means when a family struggles...he knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids. Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it, and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.” Her speech lasted 25 minutes and focused on the Barack Obama she fell in love with as well as the strength of the American Spirit and those in the military. "I've seen it in our men and women in uniform and our proud military families…in a young man blinded by a bomb in Afghanistan who said simply, 'I'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what I have done, and what I can still do." Jim Rutenberg, of the "New York Times", described the crowd as "electrified" by her remarks, "her impassioned delivery drawing the crowd to its feet."
The speakers for the day included:
Wednesday, September 5 – Elizabeth Warren and Bill Clinton.
The speakers for the day included:
David Foster was identified as a former employee of Bain Capital, advertised as an employee of GST Steel during Bain's acquisition of the then-bankrupt company in 2001, after Romney had taken a leave of absence for the company. Foster, however, was never a GST Steel employee; instead, he was an employee of the United Steelworkers of America assigned to organize the local chapter of the union.
Nomination of Obama.
Bill Clinton officially nominated Obama for re-election and Obama was nominated unanimously by the 5,556 delegates of the convention. During the roll call, Mississippi delayed its vote so Ohio could give Obama the nomination, putting the tally over the top of 2,778 votes. The roll call continued while delegates started to leave and ended with Wyoming casting its votes in an almost empty hall.
Platform vote and controversy.
The original 2012 party platform caused widespread controversy after it was written with the typical invocations and references to God and God-given rights were omitted, and language affirming the role of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was removed. On Wednesday, September 5, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland introduced an amendment on the floor of the convention to reinsert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Convention chairman Antonio Villaraigosa put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote was indecisive, Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with an equal volume of "ayes" and "nos". A woman standing to his left said, "You've got to rule, and then you've got to let them do what they're gonna do." Villaraigosa called a third vote with the same result. Villaraigosa then declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.
Thursday, September 6 – Joe Biden and Barack Obama.
The speakers for the day included:
Pledge of Allegiance:
Live Music Performances:
Military montage.
During the last night, as Senator Kerry and retired Admiral Nathman spoke there was a montage of military ships and aircraft, as a tribute to veterans; the ships were Russian warships, and the aircraft were Turkish F-5s. The Democratic National Convention Committee later apologized for the featuring of Russian warships.
Protest activity and policing.
Protest activity and demonstrations was anticipated at the convention. Over ninety organizations gathered into a group known as the Coalition to March on Wall St. South, and have declared their intention to protest at the convention. The left-leaning coalition reflects the rhetoric and ideology of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, and several Occupations from North Carolina are endorsers of the coalition. Demonstrators say they want to call attention to the influence of corporations on politics as well as the role of the military-industrial complex in US politics; they have scheduled a dance party to honor imprisoned soldier Bradley Manning. One group of undocumented immigrant workers is traveling to the convention via bus, "The Undocubus." They risk deportation if they are arrested for civil disobedience.
Charlotte has received a $50 million grant from the federal government for convention security. The city plans to spend $25 million on its police force. Some of the money has been allocated to police bicycles ($303,596), software ($61,000), and a 'command center upgrade' ($704,795). The city also plans to spend $937,852 on officers from neighboring forces.
In anticipation of protest activity, the city of Charlotte has also passed a variety of new ordinances. These include:
These ordinances are permanent and will remain effective after the end of the convention. The camping prohibition was used to evict Occupy Charlotte from its encampment in January 2012. . A request by Occupy Charlotte to enjoin enforcement of the camping prohibition was rejected by a State Court judge in March 2012.
The DNC has been designated a National Special Security Event, which means that the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security will do some of the policing. The Charlotte Police Department will be responsible for the areas outside the convention venues. Police note that it will be relatively easy to surround protestors in the city's downtown business district, which is enclosed by expressway.
By contract the DNC required Charlotte to create a demonstration area for people to exercise their First Amendment rights. Eventually the city of Charlotte became an open Free Speech Zone with peaceful protests, pickets, and pamphlets throughout the city.
Controversies.
Location.
After North Carolina voters passed Amendment 1, on May 8, 2012, banning same-sex marriage in the state, several groups called for the DNC to pull the convention out of Charlotte. Unions have also complained about North Carolina's labor laws. However, the DNC said that they will still proceed with their plans to hold it in the state.
The leader of the Democratic National Committee Debbie Wasserman Schultz verified in an interview that North Carolina was chosen due to the controversy in the state and stated that it is “a critical battleground”. When questioned about being able to raise the funds for the convention Schultz stated "We’re not having a hard time raising the funds", contrary to reports.
Disqualified delegates.
Randall Terry, a vocal pro-life advocate and former Republican congressional and state senate candidate, received a large enough percentage of votes in the Oklahoma Primary to receive as many as seven delegates. However, the DNC has declared him as "illegitimate" because he failed to inform the Oklahoma Democratic Party of the names of his delegates. As such, no Terry delegates were in attendance. Keith Russell Judd and John Wolfe, Jr., who have also both qualified for delegates to the convention by virtue of their performances in West Virginia (in Judd's case), Arkansas and Louisiana (in Wolfe's), face similar obstacles to having their delegates seated. Wolfe commenced legal proceedings to have delegates in his name seated but lost his case one week prior to the start of the convention.
Funding.
The Democratic Party announced in February 2011 that it would not accept corporate donations to fund the convention. This decision was made to increase the party's populist appeal and create distance from Bank of America and the financial industry. As of June 2012, the convention was $27 million short of its fundraising goals and consequently canceled some planned events. (The last DNC raised $33 million from corporate donors.)
The Obama campaign has also received less in union donations than it did in 2008.
Corporate sponsors can make in-kind donations such as transportation, as well as host parties. They can also donate to a non-profit called "New American City, Inc.", which is run by the directors of the convention host committee. New American City, incorporated on April 4, 2011, exists to "defray administrative expenses incurred by the host committee organizations". (The host committee, in turn, provides "goods, facilities, equipment and services".)
Donors to this group include Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy.
The Party's convention funds are stored in a Bank of America account. The convention also has a $10 million line of credit available from Duke Energy.

The Road of Bones

The Road of Bones is a 2006 young adult novel written by Anne Fine. It was shortlisted for the 2007 Carnegie Medal. The judges described it as being "incredibly well-written" and having "political resonance for young people".
Setting.
The story is set in Stalinist Russia, a totalitarian state with prison camps in the icy north. The author has said that it was inspired by Anne Applebaum's "".
Plot summary.
The story centres on a Russian boy named Yuri who in school is taught that the revolution liberated his country, and that the new leaders are always working for greater good. But the life for his family and people around him is full of poverty and misery, and the government only punishes those who protest. And one day Yuri is considered an 'enemy of the state' for saying a few careless words, and is sent to a camp in the frozen wastelands of Siberia.
Literary significance and reception.
Reviewers commented on the power and intelligence of the book while noting its appropriate bleakness. "The Scotsman" rated it "without doubt one of the top novels of the year" and the "Sunday Times" reviewer wrote: "This ambitious book is a rare achievement... This book is subtle, stimulating and morally complex, but it is also evocative and convincing: we feel keenly the chill of both soulless hegemony and its frozen wastes".

Contract manufacturing organization

A Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO), sometimes called a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), is an organization that serves the pharmaceutical industry and provides clients with comprehensive services from drug development through manufacture.
Services offered by CMOs include, but are not limited to: pre-formulation, formulation development, stability studies, method development, pre-clinical and Phase I clinical trial materials, late-stage clinical trial materials, formal stability, scale-up, registration batches and commercial production.
Evolution.
The pharmaceutical market uses outsourcing services from providers in the form of contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations. In recent years, the concept of a comprehensive single-source provider from drug development through commercial manufacture has emerged. This concept has been implemented by providers known today as contract development and manufacturing organizations (CMOs).
CMOs are a response to the competitive international nature of the pharmaceutical market as well as the increasing demand for outsourced services. The best-positioned service providers focus on a specific technology or dosage form and promote end-to-end continuity and efficiency for their outsourcing clients. With lower-cost international manufacturers capturing an increasing percentage of the contract manufacturing market, specialization may be an effective hedge against loss of market share.
Advantages.
Outsourcing to a CMO allows the pharmaceutical client to expand its technical resources without increased overhead. The client can then manage its internal resources and costs by focusing on core competencies and high-value projects while reducing or not adding infrastructure or technical staff. Virtual and specialty pharmaceutical companies are particularly well-suited to CDMO partnerships, and big pharmaceutical companies are beginning to view relationships with CDMOs as strategic rather than tactical.
Working with a CMO also limits a client’s upfront capital investment for drug development, thus minimizing a project’s cost. By concentrating resources with a single-source provider, the outsourcing client can minimize technical transfer of projects or products, thereby reducing unforeseen costs and potentially speeding new products to market.
Disadvantages of CMOs.
The pharmaceutical client using the services of a CMO does not have direct control of the project in regard to scheduling, cost, quality or accountability. Security is an issue to be considered when selecting a CMO, as intellectual property and data are exchanged between client and service provider.

Perfect Understanding

Perfect Understanding is a 1933 British comedy film directed by Cyril Gardner and starring Laurence Olivier, Gloria Swanson and John Halliday. The film was an independent production made at Ealing Studios, conceived as an attempt to revive Swanson's career which had suffered following the conversion to sound films.
Plot.
Judy (Swanson) and Nicholas Randall (Olivier) are a newly married couple who agree to a marriage based on "perfect understanding." This agreement is meant to rule out any form of jealousy. During their honeymoon they are called away to Cannes to spend time with their friends. Judy chooses to go back to London to decorate their home but insists that Nicholas spend time with their friends. While in Cannes, Nicholas becomes drunk and ends up sleeping with Stephanie (Swinburne), his former mistress. Nicholas is guilt-stricken and immediately returns home and confesses to Judy his sin. Judy forgives him due to their prior agreement of a perfect understanding. However, while Nicholas is away on business she confesses to her friend Ivan (Halliday) that she is still upset with Nicholas. Ivan then declare his love for Judy and tells her that if she would like, he would be willing to spend the night with her. Judy leaves Ivan to consider her options and ends up wandering the streets at night. Meanwhile, Nicholas has been outside Ivan's apartment and does not realize that Judy has left. He concludes that the two are having an affair. When Judy returns from walking the streets she leaves a letter for Ivan, thanking him for his love. 
When she arrives home, she is confronted by Nicholas who accuses her of an affair. She denies this and an argument ensues. Nicholas later drives to Ivan's apartment and finds the letter. He and Judy eventually separate. A month later, Judy finds that she is pregnant. She informs Nicholas who questions whether the baby is his. Angrily, she declares that their marriage is over and chooses to initiate divorce proceedings.
Nicholas is distraught over his failed relationship with Judy and confers with his lawyer over preventing the divorce. Unfortunately, due to Nicholas's infidelity the judge will grant the divorce for Judy unless he can prove that Judy was also unfaithful. During the court proceedings, Nicholas' lawyer displays her letter to Ivan. The judge dismisses the divorce due to the appearance of Judy's unfaithfulness. Afterward, Nicholas tells Judy he believes her and the couple promise to make amends and create a new life together.

On August 22, an area of low pressure gained enough organization and became Tropical Depression Ten. Two days later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Eileen. Eileen headed northwest-ward as the slowly became stronger. On the morning of August 26, Eileen rapidly strengthened and became the seasons 5th hurricane.
Eileen stayed this was for 36 hours and her minimum pressure of 990 mbar was recorded.. Just before she recurved, she weakened into a tropical storm as she moved over cooler waters.
As she continued to recurve sharply, and on the night of August 28 (PDT time) she weakened into a remnant low. During the 26th, a ship sailed through the hurricane but there was no reported damage aboard the ship. Eileen also caused no deaths. 
Hurricane Francesca.
Tropical Depression Eleven formed due south of La Paz, Mexico on September 5. The next morning, the depression became the season's sixth tropical storm and was named Francesca. Francesca entered a period of rapid strengthening for six hours as the storm's winds increased by and became the season's sixth hurricane. After this period of strengthening, Francesca leveled out and remained a hurricane until the morning of September 9 when it weakened prior to a southward dive as the result of interacting with nearby Tropical Storm Gretchen. Francesca continued to trek southward until the evening of September 11, when the storm very sharply recurved. Subsequently Francesca weakened into a tropical depression as it went due east for 36 hours. Francesca degenerated into a remnant low on the morning of September 16. Francesca was the longest lived hurricane of the season by lasting eleven days. Wave action from Francesca and Hurricane Helga caused beach erosion throughout California 
Tropical Storm Gretchen.
During the evening of September 7, a tropical disturbance that was near Hurricane Francesca became Tropical Storm Gretchen, bypassing the depression stage. Gretchen did not strengthen during her lifetime due to her proximity to Francesca and was nearly absorbed by her because Francesca disorganized Gretchen, the last advisory was issued on September 11. Because Gretchen never affected land, there was no damage or deaths reported from her.
Hurricane Helga.
On the morning of September 9, a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Thirteen. The storm was quickly to intensify and was named six hours later. The tropical storm began to curve north and on September 12 Helga became the eighth, and last hurricane of the season. She remained at that intensity for 36 hours and then began to weaken. She had weakened into a tropical storm when she made landfall on the Baja Peninsula and weakened into a tropical depression. The depression dissipated on the 17th while in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. 
Helga caused the death of one person in California and also caused beach erosion throughout California and the Baja Peninsula. The combined wave action from Helga and Francesca caused extensive damage throughout the region
Tropical Storm Ione.
On September 10, Tropical Depression Fourteen formed west of Tropical Storm Helga. The depression was slow to organize and became Tropical Storm Ione during the afternoon of the 12th. Ione's time as a tropical storm was brief and the last advisory was issued the next morning due to land interaction that weakened the system. Even though Ione dissipated near Mexico, the remnant low brought rain to Mexico. No deaths or damages were reported due to Ione when she was warned upon. While she was a low, there is no information. 
Tropical Depression Twenty-Two.
On September 10 a tropical depression was located by the Joint Hurricane Warning Center (JHWC) and was designated Tropical Depression Twenty-two and was heading westward. During the morning of the 12th, the depression passed 240 miles south of the island of Hawaii. It dissipated that night. The depression caused heavy rainfall throughout the Hawaiian Islands during the 12th. The reason that this depression was named 22 is unknown, but it is probably because it was numbered with the Western Pacific storm numbers. 
Tropical Storm Joyce.
During the late evening of September 14, Tropical Depression Fifteen formed far away from land. The depression took a long time to strengthen and became a tropical storm for only 24 hours late in its life before cooler waters took hold of the system and made it a remnant low on September 20. Joyce was one of the shortest lasting storms of the season.
Tropical Storm Kirsten.
Six days after Joyce dissipated, a new tropical depression formed while southwest of the Baja Peninsula of California. This depression, like Joyce before it, took a long time to become named. The depression finally became named storm on September 28 while nearing landfall. Kirsten made landfall during the late morning of September 28 on the Baja Peninsula. She made another landfall near Los Mochis, Mexico later that day. Kirsten rapidly dissipated over land the next morning. Kirsten caused at least eight deaths in Ciudad Obregon and an estimated damage of 5.6 million dollars (1966 USD). Despite this, Kirsten was not retired.
Tropical Storm Lorraine.
Near the end of the season Tropical Depression Sixteen formed while south of Mexico. The depression quickly intensified and became a tropical storm and was named Lorraine. Lorraine made landfall west of Tecoman, Mexico and quickly dissipated. Lorraine brought rain to Mexico in areas that would get rain from Tropical Storm Maggie (see below) a few days later. Lorraine caused no reports of damage or deaths in Mexico.
Tropical Storm Maggie.
On October 16, Tropical Depression Eighteen formed while south of Mexico. The depression, like Joyce and Kirsten before it took a long time to become a tropical storm. Finally on October 18 the depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Maggie, the final tropical storm of the season. Maggie brought torrential rains to areas affected by Lorraine earlier in the month as she paralleled the Mexican coast. She finally made landfall near Manzanillo, Mexico and weakened into a tropical depression while near Puerto Vallarta. The depression briefly emerged off the coast before making landfall near Puerto Vallarta for the last time. Maggie dissipated shortly afterward. Maggie caused no reports of damages or deaths. 
Storm Names.
The name Adele was last used this season, it was replaced by Aletta for 1974 and never was put back on a list.

United States presidential election in California, 1972

The 1972 United States presidential election in California refers to how California participated in the 1972 United States presidential election. 
California voted for the Republican incumbent, Richard Nixon, over the Democratic challenger, South Dakota Senator George McGovern. Nixon took 55.00% of the vote to McGovern's 41.54%, a margin of 13.46%. Although California was Richard Nixon's home state, his performance in the state was somewhat underwhelming, as California's result was nearly 10 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole.
This was the first presidential election in which California had the most electoral college votes as a result of the 1970 census, a status it has maintained ever since.

Łagów, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship

Łagów is a village in Kielce County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Łagów. It lies approximately east of the regional capital Kielce. The village, which used to be a town from 1253 to 1869, lies at the eastern edge off the Swietokrzyskie Mountains, along National Road Nr. 74, which goes from Kielce to Zamosc. Historically, Łagów belongs to Lesser Poland. 
According to Jan Dlugosz, in the year 1085 Prince Wladyslaw Herman gave the settlement of Łagów to the bishops of Wloclawek. The name of the village was first mentioned in documents from 1148 ("cum castro Lagow"), and it probably comes from a man named Łag or Łaga. Some time before 1230, a church was erected here, together with a Roman Catholic parish. By 1340, the Parish of Łagów had the area of 174 km2., and was very sparsely populated, due to the poor quality of soil and extensive forests.
Lagow received Magdeburg rights on April 9, 1253, which makes it one of the oldest towns of Lesser Poland. This was due to the efforts of Prince of Krakow and Sandomierz, Boleslaw V the Chaste, as during his reign, several other locations in Lesser Poland were granted town charters in a short period of time (Bochnia and Łagów in 1253; Krakow in 1257; Skaryszew in 1264; Skala in 1267; Koprzywnica in 1268; Jedrzejow and Opatowiec in 1271; Mstow in 1278, Nowe Brzesko in 1279). 
In the 14th century, several villages were founded around Łagów (Piotrow, Wola Lagowska, Sadkow, Gesice, Lechowek). On July 28, 1375, Queen Elizabeth of Poland issued a privilege, which allowed the Bishop of Wloclawek to found a new town, located in the area of the village Stary Łagów. The town was named Nowy Łagów, and remained in the hands of the bishops of Wloclawek. In the early 16th century Łagów emerged as a local center of glass industry, with three plants established here by bishops Maciej Drzewicki and Jan Karnkowski. The town had a voigt, hospital, town hall, and stone church. In the late 16th century, Lagow became famous for its pottery, which was sold as far away as Krakow and Biecz. 
In September 1502 the town, which was part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, was burned in a Crimean Tatar raid, but it was quickly rebuilt, and exempted from all taxes for the period of 12 years. In 1534, three iron ore mines and a bloomery operated here. In 1581 - 1600, Bishop of Wloclawek Henryk Rozdrazewski founded a Gothic - style church. Łagów burned to the ground in ca. 1575, and in ca. 1630, its population was 1,150. Apart from iron ore, lead and lime were mined in the area of the town. Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660) brought widespread destruction, followed by an epidemic (1662), which decimated the population. By 1663, the population of Łagów shrank to 170 residents 
After the Partitions of Poland, Łagów briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and since 1815 it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In the 1820s, the government of Congress Poland, on initiative of Stanislaw Staszic, initiated the program of Old-Polish Industrial Region, together with construction of blast furnaces in Łagów. The program was abandoned due to the November Uprising. The town declined, and following the failed January Uprising, Russian government reduced it to the status of a village (1869), as a punishment for the support of Polish rebels. In 1884, the population of Łagów was 2,000.
The village, which in the Second Polish Republic belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, was seized by the Wehrmacht on September 7, 1939 (see Invasion of Poland). In late 1944, Łagów was located along front line, which resulted in almost complete destruction of the village, and the death of some 1,500 residents. 
Among points of interest in Łagów there are:
In the Dule Gorge, near Łagów, there is the so-called Jaskinia Zbojecka (The Robber’s Cave), one of the earliest known caves in the region. Its length is 160 meters, and is located at the height of 312 meters above sea level. Inside there are stalactites and stalagmite, and several kinds of bats. Archaeologists found there pottery and bones of domesticated animals from the 11th or 12th century.

Sayed Malike

A New York cab driver, Sayed Abdul Malike was arrested after allegedly trying to purchase explosives and investigating bridges and ships near Miami, Florida. He was not accused of ties to any terrorist groups, although false rumors about "known connections to al-Qaeda" were common.
Life.
Malike legally entered the United States from Afghanistan on September 26, 1996, and was awarded political refugee status in 1998 with help from immigration lawyer Eric Levine. He had also traveled to Italy and Pakistan, and settled in Astoria, Queens. He is married with two children, although his wife lives in Pakistan. 
In 2000, he launched a $5,000,000 lawsuit against the New York Port Authority, complaining his civil rights had been ignored in an altercation with police at the 42nd Street bus station. brought about by being issued a fine for jumping to the front of a line of taxicabs. He allegedly ripped his shirt off and "went berserk", and began banging his head on the car shouting about the "Giuliani Police State", while he claims that officer William Finnie beat him. He told the jurors that he was a lowly immigrant driving a cab to raise funds for a human rights organisation in Afghanistan, but the suit was rejected.
Neighbours reported that he often brought women to his apartment, and grew irate when they made jokes about him being a terrorist and comparing him to Saddam Hussein.
Investigation.
On March 21, 2003, he entered a computer shop in Queens, New York and struck up a conversation with the sales clerk about the vastness of the internet, and ended up asking the clerk about finding bombmaking instructions online. The clerk contacted the FBI, sparking an investigation.
On a trip to Florida a week later, Malike boarded a sightseeing vessel in the Port of Miami, and asked Captain John Martin about how close his ship could come to the I-95 bridge above it, where to rent a jet-ski and how close one could come to cruise ships in the area, prompting Martin to contact the Coast Guard with his concerns. The FBI was dispatched and conducted an interview with Malike, who assured them he was just a tourist taking photos with his camera phone, denied having any source of income other than his taxi occupation, left his film with them and was released.
When he returned to New York, he was contacted by the store clerk and directed to undercover agent Todd Renner who posed as an illegal arms dealer. Malike then told Renner that he wanted to purchase five stolen bulletproof vests, night vision goggles, a "half-case of C-4", Viagra, 50 Valium and 50 sleeping pills, and bulletproof-plating and a camera to mount on his car, stating that he needed the equipment to build a gem mine in Afghanistan and would therefore need enough C-4 "to blow up a mountain", a statement widely repeated in media outlets after his arrest.
On April 18, Renner brought him "dummy material" packaged in a wooden crate to look like C-4 and told him it would cost $10,000 for his requested collection. Malike declined and said he didn't have the money nor the space to store the stuff currently.
A month later, Malike phoned Renner and asked him if he could purchase just 100 Valium pills and 50 sleeping pills for $150, and met up with him for a fourth time.
Arrest.
Immediately after Renner sold him Valium and placebo sleeping pills, the 43-year old Malike was arrested on charges of "unlawful possession of Valium" and lying to law enforcement about his interactions with the store clerk, his alleged disinterest in explosives, his purposes in Florida and denying he had other streams of income. He was arraigned the following day.
He was given Heidi Cesare as his court-appointed defence attorney, and was arraigned without bail the following day as federal attorney Catherine Friesen said that his actions suggested he "may either be a terrorist or have delusions of undertaking terrorist-type activities". 
He pled guilty to the charges of lying to officials and was sentenced to 37 months, which his attorney Alan M. Gardner appealed.

Dheri

Dheri is name of a village in tehsil Katlang, District Mardan. It is a pashto word which means small mound of soil. Dheri is union council of district mardan and usually called as " Dheri-Likpani".
Dheri Union council is a stronghold of PTI (Pakistan Thereek-e-insaaf) JUI(F), ANP and QWP. It consists of the following villages: Zareef Khan Dheri, Madad Khan Bandda, Mohalla Daavikhel, Cheel, Charchur, Lekpanray, Kotkay, Jhangi-deer etc.
The Chiefs of Dheri village were Madad Khan of Katlang and Kamal Shah Daavi.
There are four main Pashtun tribes living in Dheri.
Ghurghusht tribe is further divided into Kakar, Daavi ( also called Daavi Khel), Jalal Khel and Cheenawal.
The population of Ghurghusht tribe is more than Dalazak and Wardag tribes. Wardak tribe mainly lives in Lekpani village.
There are other tribes too living in Dheri union council namely Sahibzadgan, Miangan, Tarkan, Sayydan, Lowaran and Kasab Ghar.
The prominent figures of Dheri-Lekpani union Council:
The prominent figures of Likpani:
The prominent figures of Charchur:
Baghicha Dheri (Mardan).
Kakakhel (tribe) inhabitants of Mardan District mainly belong to the village of "Baghicha Dheri" (meaning fruit bearing hill), previously known as Surkh Dheri (meaning red rock). Except for the family of late Mian abidulhaq, and his cousins ( Mian Fazle Hanan, Mian Wajid Ulhaq, Mian Fazle Rehman) who inherited huge land holdings from his ancestors, There is limited land ownership in Baghicha Dehri among some of the notables mentioned here but there are those among the Kakakhels that own quite a bit of land over here in Baghicha Dehri as well as own land and entire villages in other nearby locations, such are the names of Mian Fazle Hanan who has already been mentioned above and the other is Major retd. Mian Faqir Ahmad who's name has not been mentioned above erroneously. For he is the patriarch of the families of Baghicha Dheri. The aforementioned now owns very little land in Baghicha Dheri and most of his land is now placed in Fazal-e-abad while the latter still owns prominent land in Baghicha Dheri as well as being the land Lord of an entire other village known as Choora. After the demise of Major retd. Mian Faqir Ahmad the village of Choora has been divided among his two remaining sons Mian Javaid Ahmad Kakakhel (eldest) and Mian Shahid Ahmad (second youngest).
Baghicha Dheri was a.k.a Chota Valiyat (meaning small United Kingdom)that's how modern and open minded the elders of the village were and one elder in particular (Major retd. Mian Faqir Ahmad) who donated land for the making of a school, mosque and also erected a water tank for the supply of water all for further betterment of the people of his village (are just a few things among many he managed to achieve during his lifetime). Brought up by their elders who continuously invested in education, this branch of the Kakakhels from Baghicha Dheri have excelled in the government and private sectors. This village has produced a number of notable high ranking Pakistan Army Officers. This small village had the first high school in Mardan after Peshawar. It was called burhaniya high school. Much of the elite of the Mardan including Nawab Akbar Khan Hoti went to this school. The first IGP of Khyber the famous AB Awan also went to this small school. It produced men of learning in British era and can be judged from the fact that at time of partition in 1947, Pakistan had only three pukhtoon generals, and out of these three two came from this small village.
A police officer from this village rose to the rank of SP, and was awarded the Kings police Medal in 1913. His name was Mian Unwanuddin. He was grandfather of famous landlord and industrialist Mian Abidulhaq.
Few famous names from this village of recent past are: Major retd. (Mian Faqir Ahmad) (after his demise there has been no further development or progress in Dheri). ( MajGen.Mian Khateeb Uddin, MajGen.Jillani Mian, MajGen.Mian Hayaud Din, MajGen.Mian Badar Uddin, Brig.Mian Taskin Uddin,Brig Mian Hameed Uddin. Police Officers SP ,Mian Shoiab Uddin CID police late' Mian Mohib Uddin working in Regional passport office,Mian Sakeen Uddin, D.I.G Dr. Mazhar Ulhaq, S.P Mian Bacha), Ambassadors (Mian Zia Uddin of Dheri was the 1st Ambassador of Pakistan for Germany).
Advocates (Mian Amin Uddin never lost any case in his career), Barristers (Mian Moeen Uddin), Senior Bureaucrats, District Officers (Mian Jameel Uddin was Ex District Officer for Education of Peshawar including Chitral and Charsadda. In his time the education system of Peshawar was very much improved), CEOs and Directors of world class corporations and agencies.
Many of the Kakakhel's sold their entire ancestral home including lands have now settled in different parts of Pakistan, some moved abroad, while some others lingered on till their demise. While a few still have their ancestral homes and lands their which they visit frequently from their city homes, some not so often.
DIG Dr Mazhar Ulhaq Kakakhel, is the proud recipient of United Nations Peace medal, and President of Pakistan police medal for valour. He has done many positive things for the uplift of the village and the community. He is now posted as consular in Jeddah.
This branch of the Kakahels have rich military and civil service traditions running in the families, however for the past few decades it is witnessing decline due to prevalence of drugs in youth, and lack of education, which was the main reason of their respect, and rise. Moreover they were propelled by the high quality of men and women they produced through high quality of Islamic and wordly education. Along with the prevalence of western education which has been an integral part of the Miangaans of Baghicha Dheri since very early on. The elders of this village most of whom have passed on in particular the patriarch Maj rtd. Mian Faqir Ahmad is the reason why there might be a slight decline and no new development or progression is occurring in Baghicha Dheri now as compared to earlier times.
Among the other families are not Kakakhels are Adab Gar, Akokhel, Behzadkhel, Utmanzai, Dalazak and Akhunzadgan (Molvi Sahiban)'s family of baghicha dheri. Most of them came and settled in this village soon after mian burhan ud din and his family (forefathers of kakakhel miangaan of baghicha dheri) settling here.These other families also produced some famous personalities like commissioner Adil khan, Fida ullah sehrai (ex director Peshawar museum).
One of the leading persons in Adab ghar is Maqbool Ahmad, a great business man of the village.
Zia Ullah Sehrai( Associate professor in ICP), DRO Khalid Zaman, Lecturer Manzoor Ahmad, Lt. col Alamgir Khan, (Engr. Shabir) and many more.
Also some others families proud of baghicha dheri are DILZAK tribe, Akokhel, Utmanzai, behzad khel are also lived in this village.

Alabama Museum of Natural History

__NOTOC__
The Alabama Museum of Natural History is the state's natural history museum, located in Smith Hall at the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa. The oldest museum in the state, it was founded in 1831. The exhibits depict the natural diversity of Alabama from the Age of Dinosaurs, the Coal Age, and the Ice Age. Collections include items relating to geology, zoology, mineralogy, paleontology, ethnology, history, and photography. The Grand Gallery Exhibition Hall houses a replica of a Basilosaurus cetoides, an Eocene whale that has been designated as the State Fossil. Exhibits of special interest include the skull of an American mastodon dredged from the Tombigbee River near Demopolis and the Hodges meteorite. The latter hit a woman as it fell to earth near Sylacauga on November 30, 1954. The museum sponsors expeditions throughout the year, as it has since 1979.
History.
The current home for the Alabama Museum of Natural History, Smith Hall, is named in honor of Dr. Eugene Allen Smith. He was appointed as state geologist in 1873 and spent nearly forty years surveying, mapping and collecting scientific specimens throughout the state. The cornerstone for Smith Hall was laid on May 28, 1907. Construction of Smith Hall was completed in fall 1909 and it was formally dedicated on May 5, 1910.
Eugene A. Smith recruited collector Herbert Huntington Smith (no relation) as the Museum's Curator. Herbert H. Smith directed the Museum under Eugene A. Smith from 1910 till his death in 1919. During this period the Alabama Museum of Natural History was very active in acquiring natural history objects by collecting, trading and donation, especially fossil and recent mollusks of Alabama. Large collections of Tertiary shells were made and traded to other institutions and individuals. The two Smiths generously sent specimens to local and out-of-state researchers, generating many publications on Alabama material. The Museum also improved its exhibits and provided identified sets of natural history objects to schools in Alabama.
Herbert Smith's wife, Amelia ("Daisy") Woolworth Smith, was also a collector and worked for the Museum, but with scant public attention, as this would have been thought of as immodest at the time. Remarkably, after her husband's unexpected death, Daisy Smith replaced him as Acting Curator, making her one of the few women to direct a natural history museum in the early twentieth century. Her endeavors included seeing her late husband's malacological projects through to completion, which she accomplished by recruiting Calvin Goodrich and other malacologists.
Architecture.
Smith Hall consists of a three-story central block, built to house the Alabama Museum of Natural History, and adjoining two-story north and south wings. The north wing originally housed the Department of Biology with the south wing housing the Department of Geology. The Department of Geology currently occupies both wings. The architecture of Smith Hall mirrors the design and layout of several large natural history museums that were also built in the early years of the 20th century in Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C., only on a smaller scale.
The building is designed in a Classical Revival style known as Beaux-Arts. The exterior features an engaged colonnade of eight Ionic columns raised above a podium-like ground floor. The main entrance is at ground level through a pedimented stone doorway. Immediately inside the entrance is a center hall dominated by a sweeping staircase made of Alabama marble and supported by Alabama-manufactured iron. The staircase leads to the Grand Gallery Exhibition Hall on the second floor. The Grand Gallery is ringed by a colonnade of monumental Corinthian columns supporting an entablature and cornice. A barrel vaulted ceiling above the cornice contains skylights that provide the space with natural light.

During the Battle of the Dukla Pass in September–October, 1944, the village was totally destroyed by military operations. In the ethnic cleansing of the Lemkos by the Communist government of Poland in Operation Vistula in 1947, Olchowiec was one of a very small number of Lemko villages - perhaps only two, the other being Komańcza - from which the Lemko population was not deported to northern or western Poland.
The village has a population of 60, mostly Lemkos. The Kermesz Łemkowski, an annual festival of Lemko culture is held in the village.

History.
Troup County Comprehensive High School is a public high school, serving primarily the rural portions of western and southwestern Troup County. Center and Rosemont high schools closed to form Troup High in 1956.The present facility was built in 1986. Troup High meets accreditation standards for the state Georgia as well as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Students are enrolled in one of eight programs of study. Troup High serves 1,300 students, 98% of whom are in attendance each day. The school employs 92 certified personnel who have an average of 24.8 years of experience each.
Athletics.
In addition to the many teams available for student athletes, Troup High recently built an athletic complex with men’s and women’s locker areas and has a newly equipped weight room for use by all athletes. Some Troup High graduates who have entered the professional athletic field give donations for the upkeep of said facilities.
The Tiger Den gymnasium, also located on campus, provides students with a large gym for practice and competition. Inside the gym are practice areas for volleyball, cheerleading, basketball, and wrestling.
Troup High School won football Region Championships in 1972, 1986 and 1987. Troup High produced many football standouts such as Tommy Cox, Tony Cox, Chris Burnette, Dino Stafford, Gary King, George Brewer and Charlie Flowers. Charlie Flowers returned to coach Troup High years later. Former THS football player, Donnie Laney, said the 1986 team was and still is the greatest team in the history of the school. 
Troup High also offers fields for baseball and softball competition, and a practice field for football and soccer. An indoor hitting facility will soon be completed near the baseball/softball fields for use by the softball and baseball teams.
Troup High School's wrestling team won 9 state championships under the tutelage of Coach Dariel Daniel. Daniel's teams never finished worse than 3rd in the state during his tenure. Daniel left after the 2002 season and started coaching and teaching in Allen, Texas. He moved back to LaGrange after his retirement. Coach Daniel passed away on November 19, 2013.
Troup High's football and soccer teams play at Callaway Stadium.
Fine arts.
Troup High School is locally noted for its very professional productions which the Fine Arts department produces. 
The theater department has been hailed as a very professional and impressive sect, with the usual theater season containing three shows, one being a musical. Actor Elijah Kelley is a product of the direction of the THS Drama Dept.
The choral department usually also gives three concerts, with the main attraction being the "Spring Show".
All of these Fine Arts groups are centered around the Fine Arts Auditorium, constructed in 2002, that can seat about 900 people. The local SPLOST made funding for this building possible.
