Prussian T 20

The German DRG Class 95 was a ten-coupled tank locomotive with a 2-10-2 wheel arrangement, which was procured by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (also referred to later as the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft or "DRG") in 1922 for hauling heavy goods trains on steep main lines. Because the development of this class was begun by the Prussian state railways, it was designated as the Prussian Class T 20.
History.
The first ten locomotives, built in 1922, were ordered as "T 20 Magdeburg 9201–9210" and, because they were at first intended to be grouped into Class 77, were supplied as numbers 77 001 to 77 010. By 1923 they had been renumbered to 95 001–010. A total of 45 locomotives were built by 1924. Their areas of operations included the Sonneberg–Probstzella line, the Spessart ramp, the Franconian Forest Railway, the Geislingen ramp ("Geislinger Steige"), the Schiefe Ebene and the Rübeland Railway, where they earned their nickname "Bergkönigin" ('mountain queen').
The locomotives were the most powerful tank engines procured by the DRG. They could haul a train load of 2060 tonnes at a speed of 50 km/h on the flat and could still manage 430 tonnes at 25 km/h on a 25‰ incline. The very high traction load of 95.3 tonnes enabled it to cope with inclines of up to 70‰ without needing a rack and its Riggenbach counter-pressure brake ensured that it could brake even heavy loads on a downhill stretch.
Of the 45 examples owned by the Reichsbahn, the Deutsche Bundesbahn took over 14 that, towards the end, were stationed in Aschaffenburg and used as pusher locomotives on the Spessart ramp. They were retired in 1958. Locomotives had also been stabled in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg until 1952 for duties on the Schiefe Ebene.
31 locomotives ended up in the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn. Of these, 24 were rebuilt to oil-firing between 1971 and 1973 and ten were given a newly designed boiler. From 1970 the oil-fired engines were designated as DR Class 95.0 and the unconverted ones as DR Class 95.1. The last locomotives worked the line from Sonneberg toEisfeld and were retired in 1981.
Preserved Locomotives.
The following locomotives have been preserved:
At present only 95 027 is operational.

Robert Drury (priest)

Robert Drury (1567–1607) was an English Roman Catholic priest, executed for treason. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987.
Life.
He was born of a Buckinghamshire family and was received into the English College at Reims, 1 April 1588. On 17 September 1590, he was sent to the new College at Valladolid; here he finished his studies, was ordained priest and returned to England in 1593. He worked on his mission chiefly in London. He was one of the appellants against the archpriest George Blackwell, and his name is affixed to the appeal of 17 November 1600, dated from Wisbech Castle.
An invitation from the English Government to these priests to acknowledge their allegiance and duty to the queen (dated 5 November 1602) led to the loyal address of 31 January 1603, drawn up by Dr. William Bishop, and signed by thirteen of the leading priests, including Drury and Roger Cadwallader. In this address they acknowledged the queen as their lawful sovereign, repudiated the claim of the pope to release them from their duty of allegiance to her, and expressed their abhorrence of the forcible attempts already made to restore the Catholic religion and their determination to reveal any further conspiracies against the Government which should come to their knowledge. In return they pleaded that as they were ready to render to Caesar the things that were Caesar's, so they might be permitted to yield to the successor of Peter that obedience which Peter himself might have claimed under the commission of Christ, and so to distinguish between their several duties and obligations as to be ready on the one hand "to spend their blood in defence of her Majesty", but on the other "rather to lose their lives than infringe the lawful authority of Christ's Catholic Church". This repudiation of the papal deposing power was condemned by the theological faculty of the Catholic University of Leuven; but Dr. William Bishop was in the end nominated Bishop of Chalcedon and first vicar Apostolic in England in 1623.
Elizabeth I of England died within three months of the signature of the address, and James I of England was not satisfied with purely civil allegiance. A new oath of allegiance was drawn up. It was imposed 5 July 1606, and about this time Drury was arrested. He was condemned for his priesthood, but was offered his life if he would take the new oath. A letter from Father Robert Persons, S.J., against its lawfulness was found on him. The oath declared that the "damnable doctrine" of the deposing power was "impious and heretical", and it was condemned by Pope Paul V, 22 September 1606, "as containing many things contrary to the Faith and Salvation". This brief, however, was suppressed by the archpriest, and Drury probably did not know of it. But he felt that his conscience would not permit him to take the oath, and he died a Catholic martyr at Tyburn, 26 February 1606-7.
A contemporary account of his martyrdom, entitled "A true Report of the Arraignment . . . of a Popish Priest named Robert Drewrie" (London, 1607), which has been reprinted in the "Harleian Miscellany", calls him a Benedictine, and says he wore his monastic habit at the execution. But this "habit" as described proves to be the cassock and cap work by the secular clergy. The writer adds, "There were certain papers shown at Tyburn which had been found about him, of a very dangerous and traitorous nature, and among them also was his Benedictine faculty under seal, expressing what power and authority he had from the pope to make men, women, and children here of his order; what indulgence and pardons he could grant them", etc. He may have been a confrater or oblate of the order.

Dancing in my Nuddy-Pants! is young adult novel (a romance aimed at girls aged 13–15), by British author Louise Rennison. It is the 4th book in the Georgia Nicolson series. The book was first published in Great Britain by Piccadilly Press Ltd in 2002.
Plot.
The book is written in the form of a diary. It is about Georgia Nicolson (14), her friends (the Ace Gang) and her infatuation with boys (or snogging in particular). Georgia's boyfriend Robbie ('the sex god or SG') has been invited to go on tour with his band The Stiff Dylans. He has received an offer to go to Los Angeles in hamburger-a-gogo-land (United States), where Georgia is thinking of becoming a 'girlfriend to a pop-star'. At the end of the book he goes for an interview and gets a job in Whakatane (New Zealand) instead. Even though Georgia is upset about this she still has enough courage in her to (when her house is empty) dance in her nuddy-pants (naked).
Success.
The work was preordered by roughly 80,000 readers and hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, in the children's Books list in March 2003.

<doc id="19077114" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19077114" title="Excessive Bail Clause">
Excessive Bail Clause

The Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits excessive bail set in pre-trial detention. 
The Clause was drafted in response to the perceived excessiveness of bail in England. Excessive bail was also prohibited by the English Bill of Rights. If a judge posts excessive bail, the defendant's lawyer may make a motion in court to lower the bail or appeal directly to a higher court.
Origins.
The excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution is based on old English common law and the British Bill of Rights.
In England, sheriffs originally determined whether to grant bail to criminal suspects. Because they tended to abuse their power, Parliament passed a statute where bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined. The king's judges often subverted the provisions of the law. It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign's command. Eventually, the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the king did not have such authority. Later, technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. Thereafter, judges were compelled to set bail, but they often required impractical amounts. Finally, the English Bill of Rights (1689) held that "excessive bail ought not to be required." Nevertheless, the bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment08/01.html]
Text.
The Eighth Amendment provides:
Interpretation.
The Excessive Bail Clause currently governs only federal pre-trial detention.
Presence at trial.
In "Stack v. Boyle", , the Court found that a defendant's bail cannot be set higher than an amount that is reasonably likely to ensure the defendant's presence at the trial. In "Stack", the Court found bail of $50,000 to be excessive, given the limited financial resources of the defendants and a lack of evidence that they were likely to flee before trial.
Preventive detention.
Preventive detentions are when someone is denied bail because the court fears that if the accused is released they will be a danger to the community. Congress authorized preventive detention in the Bail Reform Act of 1984, and the Court upheld the Act in "United States v. Salerno", . The Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that "the government's proposed conditions of release or detention not be 'excessive' in light of the perceived evil."
Incorporation.
The incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear. In "Schilb v. Kuebel", 404 U.S. 357 (1971), the Court stated in dicta: "Bail, of course, is basic to our system of law, and the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment." In "Murphy v. Hunt", , the Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as moot. Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in "McDonald v. Chicago" (2010) footnote 12, citing "Schilb".
U.S. state law.
Most U.S. states have similar provisions for preventing excessive bail. For example, similar prohibitions are contained in the Connecticut Constitution and the Constitution of Hawaii.
In Michigan, a judge or justice may be censured for "setting 'grossly excessive' bail and showing a 'severe attitude' toward witnesses and litigants," as the Michigan Supreme Court did to a trial judge in 2008.
In New Hampshire, a writ of habeas corpus which is a summons to the court, may be used to change the amount of excessive bail; the bail must be "reasonable".
Virginia's Bill of Rights states: "That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted; that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of invasion or rebellion, the public safety may require; and that the General Assembly shall not pass any bill of attainder, or any ex post facto law."
Notable cases.
One example of a large bail requirement was a case in Texas where a New York real estate heir received a bail of $3 billion. The estate heir's lawyer appealed the bail to the Texas Court of Appeals. The court responded with, “…it could not find a case where bail was set, let alone upheld, at even 1 percent of any of the amounts against the millionaire, "regardless of the underlying offense, wealth of the defendant, or any other circumstance." The court reduced bail to $450,000.
Michael Jackson famously argued for lower bail in his trial concerning alleged child sexual abuse, for which he eventually won the court case.

Cyclone Kamba

Intense Tropical Cyclone Kamba (JTWC designation: 23S) was a powerful tropical cyclone which remained out over the open waters of the south-central Indian Ocean for its entire existence. The fourth and final intense tropical cyclone of the 2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kamba developed out of an area of disturbed weather just outside Météo France's area of responsibility on March 5. Over the next several days, the system intensified, becoming a moderate tropical storm, at which time it was named Kamba, late on March 8. rapid intensification followed shortly after with Kamba becoming an intense tropical cyclone around 1200 UTC on March 10. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone moved over cooler waters and into a less favorable environment. By March 12, Kamba rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area and dissipated two days later.
Meteorological history.
On March 5, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the southwest Indian Ocean, Météo-France, began monitoring an area of disturbed weather located just outside their area of responsibility. At 0000 UTC, the system was classified as a tropical disturbance. Operationally, Météo France did not begin issuing advisories on the disturbance until it had crossed 90°E. Early on March 7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the disturbance as they anticipated it to develop into a tropical cyclone with 24 hours. Although the center of circulation was partially exposed, deep convection was developing on the western half of the storm as the vertical wind shear, which previously caused to low to become exposed, began to weaken. Later that day, Météo France upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression. About three hours after being classified as a depression, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 23S as they estimated winds to have reached 75 km/h (45 mph 1-minute winds).
Late on March 8, the depression was upgraded to a moderate tropical storm as 10-minute sustained winds reached 65 km/h (40 mph). Wind shear continued to impact the organization of the system as the eastern portion of the storm remained partially exposed. Shortly after, the storm was given the name "Kamba" by the Meteorological service in Mauritius, a name contributed by the Comoros. Tracking towards the southwest, Kamba quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm at 1200 UTC on March 9 as winds increased to 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds). Not long after being upgraded to a severe tropical storm, the JTWC estimated that Kamba had strengthened into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Early on March 10, Kamba began to undergo rapid intensification and Météo-France upgraded the storm to a tropical cyclone as an eye developed. At this time, Kamba also started to turn towards the south as it tracked around the northwestern edge of a strong subtropical ridge.
With low wind shear, Kamba continued to intensify throughout the first half of March 10, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 930 hPa (mbar) at 1200 UTC according to Météo-France. Kamba developed a 46 km (28 mi) wide eye as it reached peak intensity. Shortly after, the JTWC upgraded Kamba to a Category 4 equivalent cyclone with winds of 215 km/h (135 mph 1-minute winds). By March 11, Kamba began to move over cooler waters and into an area of higher wind shear, causing the storm to deteriorate. About 24 hours after reaching peak intensity, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition and weakened to a tropical cyclone. Early on March 12, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Kamba as it rapidly weakened over open waters. At the same time, Météo-France further downgraded the cyclone to a severe tropical storm as winds dropped below 120 km/h (75 mph 10-minute winds). Kamba further weakened to a moderate tropical storm as convection associated with the storm significantly diminished. The final advisory by Météo-France was issued shortly after as the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area. The remnants of Kamba persisted for a few more days before ultimately dissipating at 0600 UTC on March 14.
Impact.
As Kamba remained out over open waters for the duration of its existence, there was no impact on any land-masses.

Charles Pearson (British Army officer)

Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Knight Pearson KCMG CB (July 1834 – 2 October 1909) was a military commander in the British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War (also known as the Zulu War). Pearson was born in Somerset to Commander Charles Pearson of the Royal Navy. After buying the rank of Ensign in the 99th Regiment of Foot in 1852, Pearson served during the Crimean War where he was Mentioned in Despatches. After steadily rising through the ranks, Pearson was sent to South Africa to command a battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs). After retiring for a short period, he rejoined the Army after the outbreak of the Zulu War. Pearson was placed in command of a column of infantry which then became besieged at Eshowe for 70 days until Lord Chelmsford relieved them. After the war, Pearson became Governor and Commandant of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, then commander of forces in the West Indies, before retiring in 1885. Pearson died in 1909.
Early life and military career.
Pearson was born in July 1834 in Thorne Coffin, Brympton, near Yeovil, Somerset to Commander Charles Pearson of the Royal Navy, who had served in the Peninsular War. He was educated at King's School, Bruton from 1847 until 1851.
Little is known of Pearson's early military career. Pearson bought the rank of Ensign in the 99th Regiment of Foot on 23 November 1852. He moved to the 31st Regiment of Foot on 18 February 1853. He was promoted to lieutenant (without purchase) on 15 June 1855, and served as adjutant of the 31st Regiment from 20 July 1855 during the Crimean War. He was present throughout the Siege of Sevastopol, including the "attack on the Redan", for which he was Mentioned in Despatches, he also received the Crimean medal with clasp and the Turkish Crimean War medal. He was promoted to captain (by purchase) on 15 February 1856. After a period on half pay, he returned to active duty on 7 August 1857, transferring to 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs), and purchased his promotion to major on 2 May 1865.
He married Marian Catherine Mundy daughter of Lieut. Col. Sir Robert Miller Mundy in 1866. Pearson purchased his promotion to lieutenant-colonel and command of 2nd battalion, the Buffs on 14 August 1867, and received a brevet promotion to colonel on 14 August 1872. The Buffs were posted to South Africa, and in addition to command of the battalion he served as commandant in Natal from November 1876 to December 1877, and then served as a staff colonel in Natal and Cis-Vaal until September 1878 He retired, and went on half pay on 30 November 1878. However, with the outbreak of the Zulu war, he was placed in command of No 1 Column of the four columns Lord Chelmsford organised to begin the invasion of Zululand.
Zulu war.
While the British suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana, to the south-east at Inyanzani, No 1 column had repelled a Zulu advance, this engagement apparently included the first use of a Gatling gun by British forces. No 1 column was made up of 5,000 regular and Natal Native Contingent soldiers led by Pearson. They repelled a 6000 strong Zulu attempt to stop the British advance to Ulundi. Pearson had suffered minimal losses for 400 Zulu and he advanced 4 miles further towards their objective; Eshowe. Eshowe was originally planned to be a forward depot for a final advance towards Ulundi. This was thrown into doubt after the defeat at Isandlwana. Pearson received instructions from Lord Chelmsford stating "consider all my instructions cancelled and act in whatever manner you think most desirable in the interests of the column under your command." Pearson decided to dig-in and he ordered his column to build heavy fortifications around the garrison in preparation for a siege; the Siege of Eshowe had started. The siege lasted for 71 days until Chelmsford broke through to relieve them. For his actions throughout South Africa he was Mentioned in Despatches a further 10 times, and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) whilst he was still fighting, On 6 October 1879 he received a hero's welcome in his home town of Yeovil, the church bells were rung, he was greeted by the Mayor, who compared him with previous West Country heroes such as Drake, Grenville, Raleigh and Hawkins, and presented with a specially inscribed sword. The war was already somewhat controversial, the actions by Sir Bartle Frere and Lord Chelmsford which began it had not been specifically authorised by the British Government in advance, and the disaster at Isandlwana led to the defence of Eshowe by Pearson, and the famous action at Rorke's Drift being used to distract from the failure there. At this reception, Pearson defended the conduct of the war, and was supported by Sir Percy Douglas, who had preceded Chelmsford as the commander of British forces in South Africa. He was invested with the insignia of a Companion of the Bath by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 8 December, and those of a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 11 December 1879, although this award was not actually gazetted until 19 December.
Later life.
After the war, Pearson became Governor and Commandant of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley on 5 May 1880. Pearson was promoted from Colonel to Major-General on 1 April 1883. On 1 April 1885, Pearson was promoted to the post of Major-General on the Staff to command troops in the West Indies. He stayed in the post until March 1890. He was promoted to Lieutenant General on 28 January 1891 and he retired on 1 April 1895. On 22 December 1899, he travelled to Southampton as part of the send off for his old battalion, 2nd Buffs, who were departing for South Africa once again, this time to fight in the Boer War. Pearson died in Upper Norwood, Surrey (now South London) on 2 October 1909.

Joseph Dixon (bishop)

Joseph Dixon (born at Coalisland, Co. Tyrone, in 1806; died at Armagh, 29 April 1866) was an Irish Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh.
Life.
Having entered Maynooth College at the age of sixteen he was ordained priest in 1829. He was initially appointed as Junior Dean of the College, rising to Senior Dean in 1833. In 1834 he was appointed to the chair of Sacred Scripture and Hebrew, a post he occupied for the next eighteen years. His class had an average of 200 students, amongst whom was John McEvilly, afterwards Archbishop of Tuam. 
As Primate of Armagh he held an important synod in 1854, at which all the bishops of the northern province assisted with their theologians. In the same year he began completing the unfinished cathedral of Armagh and almost accomplished the work before his death. In 1856 he formed the diocesan chapter consisting of thirteen members. 
During his incumbency he brought some religious congregations into the diocese, viz. the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul (1855), who opened a house in Drogheda; the Marist Fathers (1851) who opened a college and novitiate in Dundalk, and the Vincentian Fathers who were placed in charge of the ecclesiastical seminary the same year. The primate was a defender of the Holy See and at a public meeting in Drogheda denounced Napoleon III for complicity in the acts of the Italian revolutionists. His speech and subsequent letter to the "Freeman's Journal" created a sensation and the emperor made them a subject of complaint to Pope Pius IX. Dixon was the organizer of the Irish Brigade in the papal service.
Works.
Dixon's professorship was signalized by his "Introduction to the Sacred Scriptures", a work praised by Cardinal Wiseman. The first edition appeared in 1852 and a second in 1875.

History.
Its name came from Machhenarayan, an avatar of god Vishnu. It is said that during ancient time, Manu found a small fish about to die while he was having a bath in a river. He brought the fish to his home and put it into a small pot of water. Next day, the fish grew in its size amazingly and was no longer fit in the small pot. So he put the fish in a pond just to find next day that the fish had grown larger and no longer fit in the pond as well. Knowing that this fish is no ordinary fish, Manu bowed with respect and asked to show the fish who he was. Then god Vishnu emerged from the mouth of the fish. To remember this event, Manu established Machhenarayan temple in the center of the pond.
A mela (fair), named MangalMas, is organized every three years in Machhegaun for a month, mostly during a month from April to July. During this month god Vishnu is worshiped all over the country.

South African War Memorial (South Australia)

The South African War Memorial (also known as the Boer War Memorial or, prior to 1931, the National War Memorial) is an equestrian memorial dedicated to the South Australians who served in the Second Boer War of 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902. It was the first war in which South Australians fought, and 1531 men were sent in nine contingents, with over 1500 horses to accompany them. Over 59 South Australians died in the war.
The memorial is located in front of the main entrance to Government House, one the most prominent buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier, there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.
The statue was unveiled by the Governor of South Australia, George Le Hunte, on 6 June 1904. It has since become one of the focal points for the Anzac day marches, as well as being regarded as one of the most "eye-catching" and significant statues in the city. As such, it was added to the national heritage listing in 1990.
Background.
In 1899, the Orange Free State and Transvaal declared war on Britain. South Australia, "fiercely" loyal to the British Empire and still "two years away from federation", joined the other Australian colonies in sending troops to support the Empire in the conflict. With the support of Adelaide's newspapers, nine contingents of South Australian troops were sent to the war during the three years of hostilities, totaling 1531 men and 1507 horses. Funding for the endeavor was garnered through the State and Imperial Governments in combination with funds raised through public subscriptions. In addition to the formal contingent, a number of Australians served as colonial troops, either having paid their way to Southern Africa after the conflict had begun or having already been present in the region prior to the outbreak of hostilities. By the time hostilities ended on 31 May 1902, at least 59 South Australians had been killed in the war.
Design and construction.
A committee to build a memorial to those who served and died in the Second Boer War was formed shortly after the war was ended, spurred by a suggestion in July 1901 by J. Johnson to erect an equestrian statue. Chaired by George Brookman, the committee rapidly raised £2500 from public donations. With the assistance of the Agent-General, Henry A Grainger, a subcommittee consisting of members who were present in London at the time was engaged to find a sculptor who would be able to provide the statue that they desired. The original intent of the committee was to purchase a secondhand statue and to make alterations to suit. Nevertheless, the Agent-General recommended Captain Adrian Jones, a veterinarian, military officer and sculptor who had an "affinity for animals", and who had previously worked on equestrian projects. Jones made two offers to the committee: the first was to construct a replica of a work that he had entered into a South African competition, on the condition that it would be cast only if the original was accepted; while the second was to model a smaller work based on a sketch he had produced. The second option he priced at £1600, arguing that the reduced cost was acceptable as it would allow him to keep his staff in employment until the larger South African commission was finalized. The committee were quite taken by his sketch, agreeing to the second option and looking no further.
Finding that he needed advice in regard to accouterments and the attitude of Australian soldiers, Jones made inquiries about consulting with an Australian. George Henry Goodall, a South Australian veteran of the Second Boer War, was at the time serving as Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant with the Australian Corps engaged in London at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII. Goodall was "volunteered" to attend Jones in order to model and to provide advice. Goodall later described how Jones had requested that he pose while the sculptor created a clay model of his head, but Simon Cameron observed that Jones's memoirs "do not mention any sittings." Nevertheless, a 1940 memorandum, based on a conversation with Goodall, noted that "a comparison of a photograph of Mr Goodall, taken in 1902 with the statue itself certainly indicates a strong facial likeness". In the same memorandum it was noted that Goodall only posed for the head, and that he insisted that his selection to model for the statue was not based on any outstanding merit as a soldier.
With the choice of statues settled, a competition was run in Adelaide in 1903 to find the design for the pedestal. A total of 12 entries were received, with the submission by Garlick, Sibley and Wooldridge being selected as the winner. The pedestal is 12 feet in height, and was constructed from granite quarried from the nearby town of Murray Bridge.
The bronze plaques which are mounted on the sides of the pedestal list the names of 59 South Australians who died in the conflict, and were cast from gun plates by A. W. Dobbie and Company. (A. W. Dobbie and Company were later responsible for the bronze castings on the South Australian National War Memorial to those who served in World War I). A further 16 South Australians died in relation to the Boer War, while an additional four died either during training or upon their return. Also missing from the list is Harry "Breaker" Morant, who had served in the second contingent of troops to be sent from South Australia, and was executed by the British after being found guilty by court martial of the murder of unarmed Boer troops. There was no controversy at the time in regard to his omission, although the decision not to include his companion Peter Handcock (who was executed alongside Morant) on the Bathurst, New South Wales, memorial was more problematic, and was rescinded in 1964.
The memorial is located in front of Government House on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street, one of the busiest corners in the city.
Unveiling.
The memorial was unveiled on 6 June 1904. This date was significant both as the birthday of the then Prince of Wales, George V, and the third anniversary of the Battle of Graspan, (in which South Australian soldiers had served). A large crowd gathered to view the unveiling, and the speakers included the chair of the memorial committee, George Brookman, and George Le Hunte, the Governor of South Australia. The memorial itself was shrouded by canvas and the Union Jack, which fell away to reveal the statue underneath.
At the time of the unveiling the memorial was referred to as the South Australian "National War Memorial", but the name was later changed to the South African War Memorial after the 1931 completion of a new memorial on the corner of Kintore Avenue and North Terrace, which was built to remember those who served in the first World War.
When it was unveiled, the South African War Memorial was one of only two public equestrian sculptures in the country (the other being a depiction of Saint George and the Dragon at the National Gallery of Victoria), and the only commemorative equestrian work.
Reception.
The memorial has been well received from the outset. When shown sketches the design, one of the Adelaide contingent described it as "spirited" – a word that was echoed by King Edward VII upon being shown a photograph of the model that was produced. When the completed statue arrived in Adelaide in 1904, the committee was reportedly delighted, and many in Australia viewed it as the best statue in the country.
In more recent times, Ken Inglis has described the work as the "apotheosis" of the bushman soldier, representing the bushman and the horse at war (the "Australian centaur"), and noted that it was possible to view the memorial as commemorating "dead horses as well as dead men". Simon Cameron, in his work "Silent Witness: Adelaide's statues and monuments", described the memorial as the most eye-catching statue in Adelaide, a view that was echoed by Chris Brice in 1999. More generally, the memorial is regarded as one of "Adelaide's most significant statues". The statue received national heritage listing in 1990, having been described both as a "significant landmark" and an "important piece of public sculpture of its period."
The memorial today.
After World War I the memorial became one of the centerpieces of the Adelaide Anzac Day march. The route for the march starts at the National War Memorial, heads west along North Terrace, and turns right down King William Road before culminating in a service at the Cross of Sacrifice (in the Adelaide Park Lands opposite the St Peter's Cathederal). As the marchers turn on to King William Road they salute the South African War Memorial.
As part of the State of South Australia's sesqui-centenerary in 1988, referred to locally as "Jubilee 150", a "Jubilee 150 Walkway" was created along the north side of North Terrace, commenencing at the memorial. 
The memorial's location on a busy street corner has caused it to deteriorate, resulting in at least two recent clean-up and restoration projects. The first involved a clean-up of the granite base, while the second involved more extensive restoration, and was completed in April, 2007 at a cost of $90,000.
A commemoration ceremony for the memorial was to be held on the 100th Anniversary of its dedication, 6 June 2004, with the Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson in attendance.
In recent years there has been talk of building a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on ANZAC Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: going so far as to say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.

Zappanale

Zappanale is an annual music festival held outside Bad Doberan, a German town previously part of East Germany. The festival was first held in 1990, and the program features various bands performing the music of the late composer and guitarist Frank Zappa. Many musicians who have previously played with Zappa have performed at the festival over the years.
Background.
Many of the festival's organizers originate from East Germany, and grew up in a period where Zappa's music was considered unacceptable by several Eastern European communist countries. One of the festival's founders, Wolfhard Kutz, was persecuted by the East German secret police, the Stasi, for being a Zappa fan. When all Stasi files were declassified by the German government in 1992, Kutz learned that his file stated that he "knows how to influence the youth with Zappa". When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kutz could openly enjoy his passion for Zappa's music, and he founded the fan club "Arf-society". The Zappanale premiered the year after, as what was just an extended party with only one band playing some Zappa songs. Since then, the festival has grown, and more than 2,000 attend the festival in a weekend in August. The Arf Society became an officially registered organization in 1993.
In 2002, the organizers helped raise money to have Czech sculptor Vaclav Cesak make a bronze bust of Zappa, which is now placed in the centre of Bad Doberan.
Lawsuit.
In November 2007, the festival was sued by the heirs of Frank Zappa for use of the Zappa name and image without permission. Court hearings were held in Düsseldorf in August 2008, and the involved parties were given time to reach an out-of-court settlement. In January 2009, the court ruled against Zappa's heirs for lack of proof that they actively used their trademarks in Germany. Such activity was assessed as a prerequisite for winning the lawsuit.

Dawn (1928 film)

Dawn is a 1928 British silent war film directed by Herbert Wilcox and starring Sybil Thorndike, Gordon Craig and Marie Ault. It was produced by Wilcox for his British & Dominions Film Corporation. The film was made at Cricklewood Studios with sets designed by Clifford Pember.
Based on a play by Reginald Berkeley, this film tells the story of World War I martyr Edith Cavell. Sybil Thorndike stars as Cavell, a nurse who risked her own life by rescuing British Prisoners of War from the Germans. When Cavell was captured and sentenced to be executed, it sparked international outrage, even from neutral nations.
One of the most controversial British films of the 1920s, Dawn was censored because of what objectors considered its brutal depiction of warfare and anti-German sentiments. Pressure was exerted by both the German Ambassador and the British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain to prevent the film being passed for exhibition.
Wilcox returned to the subject in 1939 with "Nurse Edith Cavell" starring Anna Neagle.

77th Air Refueling Squadron

The 77th Air Refueling Squadron (77 ARS) is a United States Air Force Reserve squadron, assigned to the 916th Operations Group, stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina.
Overview.
The squadron operates the KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft conducting aerial refueling missions.
History.
Established in early 1943 as a C-47 Skytrain transport squadron under First Air Force, later trained under I Troop Carrier Command in the eastern United States. Deployed to England in late 1943, being assigned to Ninth Air Force in England, IX Troop Carrier Command to participate in the buildup of forces prior to the Allied landings in France during D-Day in June 1944. Began training for participation in the airborne operation over Normandy. Entered combat on D-Day 1944 by dropping paratroops of the 101st Airborne Division near Cherbourg; towed Waco and Horsa gliders carrying reinforcements to that area on the afternoon of D-Day and on the following morning; received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its part in the Normandy invasion.
Began transport services following the landings in France and intermittently engaged in missions of this type until V-E Day; hauled supplies such as serum, blood plasma, radar sets, clothing, rations, and ammunition, and evacuated wounded personnel to Allied hospitals.
Interrupted supply and evacuation missions to train for and participate in three major airborne assaults. A detachment that was sent to Italy in July 1944 for the invasion of Southern France dropped paratroops over the assault area on 15 August and released gliders carrying troops and equipment such as jeeps, guns, and ammunition; flew a resupply mission over France on 16 August; and then transported supplies to bases in Italy before returning to England at the end of the month.
In September 1944 the group participated in the air attack on Holland, dropping paratroops of 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions and releasing gliders carrying reinforcements.
Moved to France in February 1945 for the airborne assault across the Rhine; each aircraft towed two gliders in transporting troops and equipment to the east bank of the Rhine on 24 March; then the group flew resupply missions to Germany in support of ground forces. Transported supplies to occupation forces in Germany and evacuated Allied prisoners of war after V-E Day.
Returned to the US in August Inactivated on 15 November 1945.
The squadron trained for and flew airlift missions in the reserve for most of the period of 1947-1972, including airlift to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Since October 1985 it has flown air refueling and air transport missions as needed worldwide, taking part in many contingency and humanitarian operations, including air refueling support during the U.S. invasion of Panama, December 1989-January 1990 and the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

Anemic Cinema

Anemic Cinema or Anémic Cinéma (1926) is a Dadaist, surrealist, or experimental film made by Marcel Duchamp. The film depicts whirling animated drawings—which Duchamp called Rotoreliefs—alternated with puns in French. Duchamp signed the film with his alter ego name of Rrose Sélavy.
"Rotoreliefs" were a phase of Duchamp's spinning works. To make the optical "play toys" he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonograph turntable that when spinning the flat disks appeared 3-dimensional. He had a printer run off 500 sets of six of the designs and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring 3-dimensional sight to people with one eye.
In collaboration with Man Ray and Marc Allégret, Duchamp filmed early versions of the "Rotoreliefs" and they named the first film version "Anémic Cinéma".
The Rotoreliefs are alternated with nine revolving disks with the following text in French, consisting of puns and alliteration by Duchamp:

Simplified Spelling Board

The Simplified Spelling Board was an American organization created in 1906 to reform the spelling of the English language, making it simpler and easier to learn, and eliminating many of what were considered to be its inconsistencies. The board operated until 1920, the year after the death of its founding benefactor, who had come to criticize the progress and approach of the organization.
Founding.
The Simplified Spelling Board was announced on March 11, 1906, with Andrew Carnegie funding the organization, to be headquartered in New York City. "The New York Times" noted that Carnegie was convinced that "English might be made the world language of the future" and an influence leading to universal peace, but that this role was obstructed by its "contradictory and difficult spelling". Carnegie committed $15,000 (1906 dollars – over $350,000 in 2010 dollars) per year for five years to get the organization off the ground.
The initial 30 members of the Board consisted of authors, professors and dictionary editors, among them Supreme Court Justice David Josiah Brewer, President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University, Dr. Melvil Dewey (inventor of the Dewey Decimal Classification), Dr. Isaac K. Funk (editor of "The Standard Dictionary"), former United States Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage, United States Commissioner of Education William Torrey Harris (and editor-in-chief of the 1909 "Webster's New International Dictionary"), publishing magnate Henry Holt, professor Calvin Thomas, and author Mark Twain. Offices were obtained at the Metropolitan Life Building at 1 Madison Avenue, and Brander Matthews was selected as the board's chairman.
Charles E. Sprague of the Union Dime Savings Institution, the board's first treasurer, noted that the group was careful to keep the word "reform" out of its name and gave the word "believe" as an example of a word that would benefit from elimination of its unneeded "i", stating that "If believe were spelled 'beleve', I think it would be a good change." Although many consider this change to be phonetically incorrect and a prime example of oversimplification leading to difficulties in logical pronunciation patterns.
On March 13, 1906, "The New York Times" editorialized in support of the Simplified Spelling Board's efforts, noting that 90% of English words are "fairly well spelled", but that "a vast improvement could be effected by reducing to some sort of regularity the much-used tenth that makes most of the trouble". An editorial in the following day's edition noted that opponents of the board's efforts had suggested that the language be kept as is, only taught better, but that the members of the board would respect the language's history in its improvement efforts without hiding or distorting it. Brander Matthews, the board's chairman, emphasized that the board's primary mission in simplifying the language was to eliminate unneeded letters, noting that "by omission – this is its platform; this is its motto". Isaac Funk wrote to "The Times" on March 20, 1906, emphasizing that the board's first aim was "a conservatively progressive evolution, aiming chiefly at the dropping of silent letters", accelerating a process that had been going on for centuries. This would be followed by the use of a phonetic alphabet developed by the American Philological Association and including the 40 basic sounds used in English. Phonetics would be taught to children in nursery school or kindergarten.
The first 300 words.
The board's initial list of 300 words was published on April 1, 1906. Much of the list included words ending with -ed changed to end -t ("addressed", "caressed", "missed", "possessed" and "wished", becoming "addresst", "carest", "mist", "possest" and "wisht", respectively). Other changes included removal of silent letters ("catalogue" to "catalog"), changing -re endings to -er ("calibre" and "sabre" to "caliber" and "saber"), changing "ough" to "o" to represent the long vowel sound in the new words altho, tho and thoro, and changes to represent the "z" sound with that letter, where "s" had been used ("brasen" and "surprise" becoming "brazen" and "surprize"). Digraphs would also be eliminated, with the board promoting anemia, anesthesia, archeology, encyclopedia and orthopedic.
The board noted that the majority of the words in their list were already preferred by three current dictionaries: Webster's (more than half), the Century (60%) and the Standard (two-thirds). In June 1906, the board prepared a list of the 300 words designed for teachers, lecturers and writers, which was sent out upon request.
In June 1906, the New York City Board of Education received a report from the Board of Superintendents recommending adoption of the 300-word list, and would pass on the recommendation to the Committee on Studies and Textbooks for approval.
In August 1906, President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt had supported the plan, signing an executive order at his home in Oyster Bay, New York, mandating the use of reformed spelling in his official communications and messages to Congress. Prof. Matthews stated that he had received no advance notice of the President's order and had been taken by surprise when it was issued.
Roosevelt tried to force the federal government to adopt the system, sending an order to the Public Printer to use the system in all public federal documents. The order was obeyed; among the many documents printed using the system was the President's special message regarding the Panama Canal.
"The New York Times" noted that the New York State Commissioner of Education thought the state would not support the board's proposal as "he did not believe that the State educational department should tell the people how they must spell". By August 1906, The board reported that over 5,000 individuals had pledged to use the words on the initial list, with another 500 to 600 agreeing to use some of the words, but objecting to others.
The press on both sides of the Atlantic had a field day with the "reform spelling crusade", and editorials and cartoons abounded. While the London press viciously mocked the executive order, the board received a significant spike in interest in the word list following Roosevelt's edict.
In response to mounting criticism from British newspapers, the board announced the additions of James Murray, the Scottish lexicographer and primary editor of the "Oxford English Dictionary", along with Joseph Wright, an Oxford University professor of comparative philology and editor of the "English Dialect Dictionary". Combined with the earlier naming of Walter William Skeat, editor of the "Etymological English Dictionary", the board could claim it had the three top English language dictionaries from both the United States and United Kingdom on its side.
The Supreme Court entered the fray and directed that its opinions should be printed in the old style.
Finally, Congress had the last word when Representative Charles B. Landis of Indiana, Chairman of the House Committee on Printing, introduced a resolution on December 13, 1906: "Resolved, That it is the sense of the House that hereafter in the printing of House documents or other publications used by law or ordered by Congress, or either branch thereof, or emanating from any executive department or bureau of the Government, the House printer should observe and adhere to the standard of orthography prescribed in generally accepted dictionaries of the English language." The motion passed unanimously. The President let the Public Printer and the Nation know that the old style was reinstated.
Roosevelt ultimately decided to rescind the order. Brander Matthews, a friend of Roosevelt and one of the chief advocates of the reform as chairman of the Simplified Spelling Board, remonstrated with him for abandoning the effort. Roosevelt replied on December 16, 1906: "I could not by fighting have kept the new spelling in, and it was evidently worse than useless to go into an undignified contest when I was beaten. Do you know that the one word as to which I thought the new spelling was wrong – thru – was more responsible than anything else for our discomfiture?" Next summer Roosevelt was watching a naval review when a press boat marked "Pres Bot" chugged ostentatiously by. The President waved and laughed with delight.
Carnegie's dissatisfaction.
Andrew Carnegie, the founding and major benefactor of the board, disagreed with its chosen approach of prescribing recommended changes. Rather, Carnegie believed that the board would be more productive by encouraging grass-roots changes. His beliefs are contained in a statement given to an editor of "The Times": "Amended spellings can only be submitted for general acceptance. It is the people who decide what is to be adopted or rejected." For their part, some members of the board believed that Carnegie was too meddlesome in its business.
Signs of a break with the board were apparent as early as January 16, 1915. Carnegie received a letter from Matthews, which included a list of daily newspapers that had adopted the reformed spellings. Carnegie was not impressed. In reply, Carnegie wrote, "Please note, not one Eastern paper. I see no change in New York and I am getting very tired indeed, of sinking twenty-five thousand dollars a year for nothing here in the East." Carnegie was further irritated to learn that his own trusts' annual financial reports were seen to be taking "a step backwards in reference to spelling."
One month later, on February 25, 1915, Carnegie penned a letter to Holt, the president of the board. In this letter, Carnegie wrote that "A more useless body of men never came into association, judging from the effects they produce. [...] Instead of taking twelve words and urging their adoption, they undertook radical changes from the start and these they can never make..." Using spelling that demonstrated his own continuing attachment to certain reforms, Carnegie added, "I think I hav been patient long enuf... I hav much better use for twenty thousand dollars a year."
Dissolution.
It was always a condition that Carnegie's dollars had to be matched by results, and at his death in November 1919, his will contained no provision for the Simplified Spelling Board. Without that source of funds (a total of $283,000 over the 14 years), the board's operations ceased in 1920, in which year it published its "Handbook of Simplified Spelling".
"Handbook of Simplified Spelling".
In 1920, the SSB published a "Handbook of Simplified Spelling", which was written wholly in reformed spelling.
Part 1 is a brief outline of the history of English spelling and the attempts to reform it up until 1920.
Part 2 presents the arguments in favor of reform and replies to the objections that are commonly made.
Part 3 contains the SSB's proposed rules for simplified spelling and a list of the words that would be changed by them.
The handbook repeated and explained the SSB's plan of "gradual" rather than "sudden" reform. It noted that all past spelling changes had come into use gradually—"so gradually, in fact, that at all times (as today) ther hav been, and ar, many words speld in more than one way on equal authority of good usage". It also noted that most reformed spellings now in general use were originally the overt act of a lone writer, who was followed at first by a small minority. Thus, it encouraged people to "point the way" and "set the example" by using the reformed spellings whenever they can. The handbook used and set forth the following rules:
The handbook also suggested the following spelling changes, which are not covered by the above rules: acre→aker, answer→anser, beleaguer→beleager, campaign→campain, counterfeit→counterfit, delight→delite, foreign→foren, forfeit→forfit, friend→frend, masquerade→maskerade, mortgage→morgage, receipt→receit, sieve→siv, sleight→slight, sovereign→sovren, sprightly→spritely, touch→tuch, yeoman→yoman.

Carl Baudenbacher

Carl Baudenbacher is a Swiss jurist. He has served as the President of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Court since 2003 and has since 1987 been a Professor of Law at the University of St. Gallen. From 1993-2002 Baudenbacher was a Permanent Visiting Professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law for International and European Law.
Career.
Carl Baudenbacher attended Law School of the University of Bern. He received his doctoral degree from the University of Bern in 1978 and his habilitation from the University of Zürich in 1982. Baudenbacher was an Acting Law Professor at several German Universities and a Full Professor at the University of Kaiserslautern. Since 1987 he holds the Chair of Private, Commercial and Economic law at the University of St Gallen HSG, Switzerland. Since 1990 he is also Managing Director of the Institute of European and International Business Law at the University of St Gallen HSG. Carl Baudenbacher founded the global postgraduate program Executive Master of European and International Business Law E.M.B.L.-HSG in 1995 which takes place in Europe, the U.S., Japan and China. He is Chairman of the St Gallen International Competition Law Forum ICF, the St Gallen International Energy Forum IEF (together with Dr Dirk Buschle) and the St Gallen International Dispute Settlement Conference IDSC. From 1999 to 2007, Professor Baudenbacher chaired together with the former Vice-Chancellor of the Republic of Austria, Dr. Erhard Busek, the Vienna Globalization Symposium.
From 1994-1995 Carl Baudenbacher served as a member of the Supreme Court of the Principality of Liechtenstein. In 1995 he was appointed Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) upon a proposal of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Since 2003 Baudenbacher has been the Court’s President. The EFTA Court hears cases originating from the EFTA States which are Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement. These are currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. EEA law which has been implemented into the legal orders of the EEA/EFTA States is capable of having direct effect and eventually takes precedence over conflicting national law. The EFTA Court has also recognized EEA State liability. Moreover, EEA law must be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights. The EFTA Court is bound by homogeneity rules to follow or to take into account relevant ECJ case law. In the majority of its cases, it is, however, faced with novel legal questions. This has led to judicial dialogue in the form of numerous references by the ECJ, its Advocates General, the General Court and high courts in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and Sweden. President Baudenbacher has frequently been described as a very influential judge. On 16 April 2011, the leading Norwegian business paper Dagens Næringsliv referred to him as “King Carl of the EEA”.
Baudenbacher has acted as an arbitrator and as an expert witness in international arbitration cases. He was furthermore the main expert advisor to the Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein during the multilateral negotiations on the establishment of a European Economic Area (EEA). He also advised the President, the Government and the Parliament of the Swiss Confederation on matters of European integration, competition law and of copyright law, the Israeli Government on matters of unfair competition and trademark law and the Government of the Russian Federation on matters of competition law.
Baudenbacher is a much sought-after speaker at international conferences in particular on competition law, EU/EEA Law, and the law of international adjudication and arbitration. He is also invited on a regular basis to speak on these topics in European, U.S.-American and Asian universities.
Published works.
40 books and over 200 articles on European and International law, law of obligations, labour law, law of unfair competition, antitrust law, company law, intellectual property law, comparative law, arbitration and the law of international courts.

William Errington (priest)

William Errington (17 July 1716 – 28 September 1768) was an English Roman Catholic priest, founder of Sedgley Park School.
Life.
He was son of Mark Errington of Wiltshire, a descendant of the Erringtons of Walwick Grange, Northumberland; his mother's maiden name was Martha Baker. In 1737 he went to Douai, took the mission oath 28 December 1741, and was ordained a priest in December, 1747. If he acted as professor at Douai after his ordination, as is generally stated, it could only have been for a very short time, as he left there for England, 26 March 1748 (manuscript list of Douai clergy in the Westminster archives). 
On arrival in London he took up his residence with Bishop Richard Challoner, then coadjutor to Bishop Benjamin Petre. Kirk states that Dr. Challoner "had a high opinion of Mr. Errington, both as an active and zealous missionary and as a man of business". It was on account of these qualities that when the bishop wished to found a good school in England he induced Errington to undertake the work. 
Errington made three unsuccessful attempts, the first in Buckinghamshire, the second in Wales, and the third at Betley near Newcastle-under-Lyne, in Staffordshire, before he succeeded in founding a permanent school at Sedgley Park in the neighbourhood of Wolverhampton. On Lady-Day, 1763, he opened this school with twelve boys in the house known as the Park Hall, till then the residence of John, Lord Ward, afterwards Viscount Dudley and Ward. The foundation was at once attacked in Parliament, but Lord Dudley successfully defended himself. 
The school was not interfered with; it developed into the Sedgley Park School which existed for over a century, and was succeeded by St. Wilfrid's College, Oakmoor, near Cheadle. Having founded the school, Errington's work there was done, and as soon as he secured the appointment of the Rev. Hugh Kendall as head-master in May, 1763, he returned to Bishop Challoner in London. He was appointed archdeacon and treasurer of the Old Chapter and held these offices till his death.

Harm avoidance

In psychology, harm avoidance (HA) is a personality trait characterized by excessive worrying; pessimism; shyness; and being fearful, doubtful, and easily fatigued. In MRI studies HA was correlated with reduced grey matter volume in the orbito-frontal, occipital and parietal regions.
Harm avoidance is a temperament assessed in the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), its revised version (TCI-R) and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and is positively related to the trait neuroticism and inversely to extraversion in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Researchers have contended that harm avoidance represents a composite personality dimension with neurotic introversion at one end of the spectrum and stable extraversion at the other end. Harm avoidance has also been found to have moderate inverse relationships with conscientiousness and openness to experience in the five factor model.
The HA of TPQ and TCI-R has four subscales:
It has been suggested that HA is related to high serotonergic activity,
and much research has gone into investigating the link between HA and components of the serotonin system, e.g. genetic variation in 5-HTTLPR in the serotonin transporter gene.

Niklaus Gerber

Niklaus Gerber (1850–1914) was a Swiss dairy chemist and industrialist. He was born in 1850 in Thun, Switzerland. He attended the University of Bern and University of Zurich, studied chemistry in Paris and Munich and spent 2 years at the Swiss-American Milk Co. in Little Falls, New York.
In 1887, Gerber founded United Dairies of Zurich. At this time, the quality of raw milk was poor due to lack of hygiene. Further, dishonest dairymen would dilute raw milk with water and no means existed to effectively test the milk. In 1892, Dr. Gerber developed a method of analyzing fat content in milk in a relatively fast, simple and reliable manner for the time. Niklaus obtained a patent on this "Acid-Butyrometry," which came to be known as the "Gerber Method". Although the method was originally developed for use only by United Dairies, Dr. Gerber began to sell the equipment to milk processors globally and created a separate company to commercialise the Gerber Method.
In 1904, Gerber founded the "Dr. N. Gerber's Acid-Butyrometry Ltd., Leipzig", which later merged with another entity to create "Dr. N. Gerber's m.b.H Zurich and Leipzig" to produce and develop the Gerber instruments.
Gerber died in 1914.
The Gerber method remains in wide use throughout much of the world. The Babcock test is similar and is more widely used in the United States.

John Townsend (British politician)

John Townsend (2 April 1819 – 22 December 1892) was a British actor and Liberal Party politician. 
Born in Deptford, in the south eastern suburbs of London, Townsend was the son of an auctioneer and estate agent in the neighbouring town of Greenwich. He began acting at the age of 12. In 1841 he married Sarah Mitchell, also an actor, and they had at least seven children all of whom were trained for the stage. In 1842 he took out a lease on the Theatre Royal in Richmond, specialising in Shakespearian productions.
In 1852 his father died, and Townsend gave up acting to take over the family business. In 1857 was approached by the Liberals to run in the general election of that year in opposition to one of the sitting members of parliament for Greenwich, Montague Chambers. Chambers had been elected as a Liberal in 1852, but had since left the party to run as an independent. Townsend was only approached two days before nominations for the election were made, but was very well known in the area, and easily defeated Chambers. Soon after the election it was alleged that Townsend was ineligible for election as he did not have an annual income of £300. In March 1858 he was adjudged bankrupt. He was suspended from the House of Commons, and came to an arrangement to pay off his debts within 12 months. He returned to the stage in an attempt to pay off his creditors, playing leading roles in a number of London theatres where was billed as "John Townsend, MP". After a prolonged attempt to retain his seat, he resigned by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead in February 1859. 
Townsend became the manager of the Theatre Royal, Leicester, and by 1862 had discharged his debts. He emigrated to Canada in May 1862, purchasing a farm outside Kingston, Ontario. He returned to acting in 1864, and in 1868 the family moved to Hamilton. They formed the "Townsend Family Star Dramatic Troupe" and toured Canada and the United States.
In 1877 Townsend became seriously ill in Indiana and had to leave the travelling company. He became a teacher of acting and elocution in Hamilton, where Julia Arthur was his most famous student. Townsend died in 1892 of liver cancer.

Astra 4A

Astra 4A is one of the Astra communications satellites owned and operated by SES at the Astra 5°E orbital slot providing digital television and radio broadcasts, data, and interactive services to Nordic countries, eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa in the 11.70 GHz-12.75 GHz range of the Ku band and 18.8 GHz-21.75 GHz range of the Ka band.
The satellite was launched in November 2007 as Sirius 4 by SES Sirius. At that time, SES owned a 75% shareholding in SES Sirius, which was increased to 90% in 2008 and to 100% in March 2010. In June 2010, the affiliate company was renamed SES Astra (then a subsidiary company of SES) and the Sirius 4 satellite was renamed Astra 4A.
Astra 4A provides three Ku band broadcast beams - the Nordic beam to Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, the European beam to Eastern European and Baltic countries including Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia and Ukraine, and the African beam to sub-Saharan Africa.
Reception is possible on dishes as small as 60 cm from all three beams, with reception from the European beam across Europe and from the African beam across sub-Saharan across Africa with dishes of 90 cm-120 cm.
The satellite also carries a dedicated payload of two transponders for Ka band services, for applications such as interactive and contribution services. Both uplink and downlink within the African footprint are available, and also inter-connectivity between Africa and Europe so broadcasting out of Europe is available without the need for expensive fibre ground links.
Five of these African beam transponders are contracted with ETV and Globecast having signed one transponder each and three transponders signed by On Digital Media for the South African TopTV network.
Co-located with Astra 4A at 5°E is the SES-5 satellite. Launched in July 2012, this satellite provides a similar European and African coverage and was originally named Sirius 5, but renamed to Astra 4B in 2010 and then to SES-5 in 2011.
Previous Use of Name.
The Astra 4A designation was originally given in June 2005 to 33 transponders of the NSS-10 craft (itself formerly called AMC-12) owned by another then subsidiary of SES, SES New Skies, and positioned at 37.5° west for broadcast, data, and telecommunications into Africa.
For the current spacecraft, the Astra 4A designation originally applied only to the FSS Africa beam that provides six 36 MHz transponders for sub-Saharan Africa. The remainder of the spacecraft was called Sirius 4 at that time (from November 2007 to June 2010).

Murderdrome

Murderdrome is the title of a mobile comic created by Al Ewing and PJ Holden. It is an ironic pastiche of certain British 'boys adventure' comics of the late seventies, particularly "Action". It contains scenes of on-panel decapitation and extremely over-the-top dialogue.
The series is notable because it is one of the first comics to be drawn specifically for the iPhone with the intention of distribution through the App Store. This has been made possible by the "Comic Reader App" developed for the iPhone by Infurious Comics. However, the Murderdrome project is surrounded by controversy as 'Murderdrome' has been rejected by Apple on the grounds of 'objectionable content'. Although Apple have defended this decision, it has been described by some as blatant censorship.
However, the publicity got the Comic Reader App attention, which resulted in NBC licensing it for their "Heroes" comics. This led the BBC to suggest that "Mr Holden and his colleagues may have accidentally hit upon what could be the future of comic book publishing.

Alan Judge (Irish footballer)

Alan Christopher Judge (born 11 November 1988) is an Irish footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Brentford in League One, on loan from Blackburn Rovers. He began his career at Blackburn Rovers and returned to the club in 2013 after a two-and-a-half season spell with Notts County. Judge represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level.
Career.
Blackburn Rovers.
Born in Dublin, Ireland, Judge began his career at St. Joseph's National School in Dún Laoghaire, appearing for the school's Senior Boys team. In 2006, Judge joined the academy at Premier League club Blackburn Rovers. He turned professional at 17 and was a regular in their reserve team during the 2007–08 season, scoring seven goals. He made his debut for the senior team as a substitute in the League Cup against Grimsby Town in August 2008 and his first start followed in the FA Cup victory against Blyth Spartans in January 2009. Judge featured regularly for the club during the 2009–10 pre-season, including friendlies against Italian giants AS Roma and Portuguese side CD Nacional. He signed a new contract to tie him to the club until June 2011. Towards the end of the 2009–10 season, Judge said he was open to offers for a permanent transfer after being told by Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce that he was surplus to requirements at the club. "I have still got a year left at Blackburn, but I think my time there will be up in the summer," he said. "We have talked over the phone, so I know more or less what's going to happen. I will just see what clubs are interested in me." Judge departed Blackburn in January 2011 after making only two appearances.
Plymouth Argyle (loans).
Judge joined Championship club Plymouth Argyle on loan in January 2009, for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. He made his debut for the Pilgrims against Ipswich Town as a substitute and went on to feature regularly in the starting eleven for then manager Paul Sturrock's team. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley in March 2009 and followed that up with a well-worked goal against Coventry City in April. The season ended with Judge having made 17 appearances in all competitions.
Judge rejoined Argyle on loan for the duration of the 2009–10 season. He continued to feature regularly in the first-team and added another three goals to his tally, against Derby County in August, Scunthorpe United in October, and Doncaster Rovers in November, four days before his 21st birthday. He scored his first brace in senior football with two goals in an impressive 4–1 win over Reading. The club were relegated from the Championship at the end of the season and Judge returned to Blackburn before his contract expired.
Notts County (loan & permanent signing).
On 31 August 2010, Judge signed a six-month loan deal with League One club Notts County. His loan finished on 1 January 2011, but County re-signed the player on an initial one-month loan so he would be available for forthcoming matches whilst a permanent deal was finalised. He made 14 appearances during his loan spell and scored no goals.
On 14 January 2011, Judge completed a permanent move to Notts County, signing a two-year deal with the club. Just days after signing, Judge broke a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a match against Hartlepool United. After a seven-week spell on the sidelines, Judge returned to action against Swindon. He scored the equaliser, before setting up Lee Hughes to give County the three points. Judge scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 3–1 away win against Chesterfield. His form saw him pick up consecutive player of the month awards for November and December respectively. He believed that his good form was aided by Notts County manager Martin Allen, saying "I had a meeting with the gaffer and he was really encouraging. He said I need to play with a lot more confidence and he's giving me that." Judge took his goal tally for the 2011–12 season to seven after his brace earned Notts County a 4–3 win at Wycombe Wanderers on 28 April. He ended the season by scoring in a 4–1 victory over Colchester United. Judge finished the season with 8 league goals and 13 assists. At the end of season awards Judge scooped both the "Players' Player of the Year" and "Fans' Player of the year" for the 2011–12 season. He scored his first goal in the 2012–13 season in a 2–0 win over Bury. He scored his second goal of the season and picked up the Man Of The Match award against Portsmouth in a 3–0 victory. He scored the only goal in 1–0 over Swindon, allowing Notts to move back into the play-off positions. In a 1–0 win over Carlisle Judge's fine solo effort in which he delicately chipped the ball over Mark Gillespie won the Sky Sports Goal Of The Day award. Judge's performances saw him named in the 2012–13 League One PFA Team of the Year. Judge finished the season with three league goals and 11 assists. It was announced after a spell of two years at the club that Judge would not renew his contract. Judge expressed the main reason being his desire to play at a higher level, saying "there just comes a time when you think it’s right to move on and I’ve given everything to this club, it’s just a matter of a new challenge. I’m an ambitious person and I hope fully would like to try myself up another level if that comes.”
Return to Blackburn.
On 16 May 2013, it was revealed that Judge would be returning to Blackburn Rovers at the end of his contract with Notts County. Judge re-signed for Rovers, now in the Championship, on 1 July 2013. Judge scored his first Blackburn goal in a 3–3 League Cup first round shootout defeat to Carlisle United on 7 August 2013. He made 12 appearances during the 2013–14 season, scoring one goal.
Brentford (loan).
On 8 January 2014, Judge joined League One side Brentford on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. He was awarded the number 18 shirt, vacated earlier in the season by Javi Venta. Judge's debut came in a 2–0 win over Port Vale on 11 January. He played 67 minutes before being substituted for Jake Reeves. Judge scored his first Bees goal on his fourth appearance, netting the second in a 3–1 win over Bristol City on 28 January. In a "majestic display", Judge bagged two goals from long-range in a 3-1 away victory over Crewe Alexandra on 15 February. His form prompted former Blackburn teammate and fellow Irishman Jonathan Douglas to suggest that Brentford sign Judge permanently.
International career.
Judge represented the Republic of Ireland U18 side at the 2005 summer European Youth Olympic Festival in Lignano Sabbiadoro, Italy. A 4-2 victory over Switzerland in the third-place playoff saw the U18s win the bronze medal. Judge made his U19 debut in a 2-1 friendly win over Ukraine at Terryland Park on 15 August 2006. He was a regular for the U19s during their qualifying campaign for the 2007 European U19 Championship and scored his first goal in a 2-1 qualifying win away to Macedonia on 6 October 2006. Judge appeared in all three of the U18s' elite qualification games, but despite victories over Bulgaria and Hungary, defeat to Germany saw the Germans qualify for the finals. Judge also represented the U19s in the 2007 Oporto Tournament in Portugal, but went home without any silverware. Judge made his U21 debut in a 3-2 friendly victory over Sweden on 12 October 2007, coming on as a substitute for Jim O'Brien after 68 minutes. Judge made two appearances during the U21s unsuccessful 2009 UEFA U21 Championship qualifying campaign. He appeared in all of the qualifying games for the 2011 UEFA U21 Championship, with an early goal scored in a 1-1 draw with Georgia being the sole highlight of a campaign which saw the U21s finish bottom of their group. He won 13 U21 caps and scored two goals. Judge made four appearances for the U23s in the 2008 Inter Continental Cup, but came away without the trophy.
Style of play.
Judge is known for his energy and his driving runs, as well as his ability to score spectacular long range goals. This has led to him being nicknamed "The Irish Messi" by players, fans and pundits.
Personal life.
Judge's father Dermot played for Shamrock Rovers and captained Bray Wanderers to success in the 1990 FAI Cup Final.

Oklahoma Emergency Interim Executive and Judicial Succession Act

The Emergency Interim Executive and Judicial Succession Act (63 O.S. Sections 685.1 - 685.11) is an Oklahoma state law governing emergency succession to the all offices of the state and local governments, excluding the members of the Oklahoma Legislature, which are governed by the Oklahoma Emergency Management Interim Legislative Succession Act. 
The Emergency Executive and Judicial Succession Act was signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on August 29, 2003.
In General.
All Emergency Interim Successors and Special Emergency Judges must take the same oath of office as the officers they are acting as. However, they do not need to fulfill any other prerequisite of office. All officials authorized to act as Governor, Emergency Interim Successors and Special Emergency Judges may exercise their powers only after the declaration of a state of emergency. The Oklahoma Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may, at any time, terminate the authority of any Emergency Interim Successor or Special Emergency Judges to exercise their powers and discharge their duties.
Any dispute concerning a question of fact arising under the Emergency Succession Act with respect to an office in the executive branch of the state government (except a dispute relative to the Office of Governor) is determined by the Governor and his decision is final. Any dispute with respect to the Office of Governor is be determined by the Supreme Court.
Succession to the Office of Governor.
Under normal circumstance, in the event of a vacancy in the office Governor of Oklahoma, the Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma would become the Governor, as provided by the Oklahoma Constitution. The Constitution also provides that if the Lieutenant Governor is unable to become Governor, then the duty falls to the President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate and then to the Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. 
However, during a state of emergency, should the Governor be unable to exercise his powers or the Governorship is vacant and the Lieutenant Governor, President pro tempore, and Speaker of the House are unable to act as Governor or succeed to the Governorship, it is the duty of the Emergency Interim Successor to the Governor to exercise the powers of the Governor until the Governor returns, a higher officers can act as Governor, or until new Governor is elected. Such Successor only acts as Governor, however, and such Successor may not succeed to the Governorship.
The order of Emergency Interim Successor to the Governorship is as follows:
Succession to other State Offices and Local Officers.
All state officers (e.g. the Attorney General, State Treasurer, etc.), other than the Governor, and local officers (e.g. Mayor, County Commissioner, etc.) must designate an Emergency Interim Successor to exercise their powers in their absence. Such designation are subject to the such regulations as the Governor may determine. The state or local officer must designate no less than three but no more than seven Successors. Such list of Successors may be amended as necessary by the state officer. 
In the event that any state or local officer is unavailable following a state of emergency, and in the event a deputy (if any) is also unavailable, the powers of the office are exercised the designated Emergency Interim Successors in the order specified by the state officer. The authority of a Successor ceases: 
Special Emergency Judges.
In the event that a state of emergency occurs and if any judge of any court in the Oklahoma Court System is unavailable to exercise the powers the of their office, and no other judge is authorized to act or no special judge is appointed to act, the duties of the office are discharged by a Special Emergency Judge.
The Governor designates Special Emergency Judges for each Justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and for each Judge of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in consultation with the other members of the Court, designates all Special Emergency Judges for each District Judge and each court of record in the state. Each District Judge, in consultation with the other District Judges, designates all Special Emergency Judges for the courts of no records within their district.
All Special Emergency Judges, regardless of how appointed, shall discharge their duties and exercise their powers until such time as a vacancy which may exist shall be filled in accordance with the law or until the regular judge becomes available to exercise their powers and discharge their duties of the office.

John MacGregor (Glasgow MP)

John MacGregor (1797–1857) was a Scottish statistician and politician.
Early life.
He was the eldest son of David MacGregor and Janet (née Ross) of Drynie, near Stornoway, in the Western Isles of Scotland. The family emigrated to Canada in 1803, sailing to Pictou, Nova Scotia. 
In 1806, they moved to Covehead on Prince Edward Island. 
As a young man MacGregor set up as a merchant in Charlottetown. 
In 1822, he served in the office of high sheriff; he was dismissed as a result of involvement in the dealings of Charles Douglass Smith. 
Put on trial at Smith's behest, he became popular and in 1824 a member of the House of Assembly. 
He left Canada, travelling through North America, collecting statistics.
Return to the UK.
Returning to the United Kingdom, MacGregor set up as a commission agent in Liverpool, in 1827.
In 1836, MacGregor reported to the Board of Trade on the "Zollverein". In 1839 he represented the British government in the negotiations with the Kingdom of Naples for a revision of the commercial treaty of 1816. In 1840 he succeeded James Deacon Hume as one of the joint secretaries of the Board of Trade. A strong free-trader, he prompted Joseph Hume's motion for a select committee on import duties, and gave evidence before the committee (July 1840), against protectionism.
In politics.
On the repeal of the Corn Laws, MacGregor gave up his post at the Board of Trade, and entered politics parliament, He was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Glasgow in July 1847, resigning in 1857 shortly before his death, by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead. He spoke frequently on commercial, financial, and colonial questions.
In business.
John MacGregor was the principal promoter and sometime chairman of the Royal British Bank, incorporated by royal charter in 1849. Though it was far from prosperous, he shamelessly puffed it, in a chapter on "Banking" contributed to Edwin Troxell Freedley's "Money" in 1853. 
He was also a party to the publication of accounts which concealed the true position of the bank.
This was not the only occasion on which he lent his status as an MP to companies; and the Eastern Archipelago Company, as well as the Royal British Bank, gave rise to a fraud trial. He lived at 61 Ennismore Gardens, London, from 1849 to 1855 
The Royal British Bank stopped payment in September 1856, and MacGregor, who had absconded shortly before, died at Boulogne on 23 April 1857, indebted to the bank in the sum of £7,362.
Works.
On his return to Europe (about 1828) he published "Historical and Descriptive Sketches of the Maritime Colonies of British America", London, 1828; and "Observations on Emigration to British America", London, 1829. In 1830 he made a tour on the continent of Europe, and published a travel book based on it, "My Note-book" (1835), London, 3 vols. With his friend James Deacon Hume, he projected in 1832 a major work on international commercial statistics. It occupied him during the next seven years, during which he visited most of the countries of Europe.
During his tenure of office he made 22 parliamentary statistical reports, in "Commercial Tariffs and Regulations of the several States of Europe and America, together with the Commercial Treaties between England and Foreign Countries", published, with appendix, in 8 vols., London, 1841–50; and in "A Digest of the Productive Resources, Commercial Legislation, Customs Tariffs, Navigation, Port and Quarantine Laws and Charges, Shipping, Imports and Exports, and the Monies, Weights, and Measures of all Nations, including all British Commercial Treaties with Foreign States, collected from Authentic Records, and consolidated with especial reference to British and Foreign Products, Trade, and Navigation", London, 1844–8, 3 vols.
Karl Marx referred to him as "the celebrated statistical writer" in "The Economic Crisis in Europe" (1862). He was a member of the Académie de l'Industrie Agricole.
MacGregor also published:
MacGregor also edited, for Bohn's Standard Library, De Lolme's "Constitution of England", with a life of the author, and notes, London, 1853.

Tom Pearson (rugby union)

Thomas William Rory Pearson (10 May 1872-12 September 1957) was a Welsh international wing who played club rugby for Cardiff and Newport and county rugby with Middlesex. He won 13 caps for Wales and captained the team on one occasion, against England. Pearson was an all-round sportsman, representing Wales not only in rugby, but also in squash, tennis, hockey and golf. In 1902 Pearson was given the captaincy of the Welsh hockey squad, while playing for Newport Hockey Club.
During World War I he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Field Artillery.
Rugby career.
Pearson was born in Bombay, but moved to England at the age of five. By 1889 he had moved to Wales and was living in the capital, joining Cardiff Rugby Club.
Pearson gained his first cap for Wales while playing with Cardiff in 1891. His debut was against England on 3 January at Rodney Parade and Wales lost 7-3, though Pearson scored a try for Wales. This try made Pearson the youngest player to score a try for Wales at 18 years and 238 days until overtaken by Tom Prydie in 2010. Pearson's try also made him the youngest player to score a try on his Wales debut until George North surpassed the record in 2010. Pearson was dropped after the 1892 Championship and didn't regain his Wales place until the end of 1894 tournament, an unusual situation as during 1892/93 season, he scored a record 40 tries for Cardiff, a club record. Pearson played fairly frequently for Wales through to 1898, but in 1903, with his international career supposedly far behind him, he was recalled to captain Wales against England. Pearson had already scored a try when he was forced to leave the field after a particularly heavy tackle from Harry Gamlin. His replacement, Jehoida Hodges scored a hat-trick of tries. Pearson played a total of 13 matches for his country.

Clayton McDonald

Clayton Rodney McDonald (born 26 December 1988) is an English football defender who plays for Grimsby Town in the Conference Premier.
He graduated out of the Manchester City youth academy in 2008, and spent the 2008–09 season on loan at League Two sides Macclesfield Town and Chesterfield. He spent the start of the 2009–10 season on loan at Walsall, before the deal was made permanent in December 2009. He was released by the club at the end of the 2010–11 campaign, at which point he signed with Port Vale. He joined Bristol Rovers on loan in January 2013. Port Vale secured promotion out of League Two in 2012–13. He signed with Grimsby Town in July 2013.
Playing career.
Manchester City.
A graduate of the Manchester City youth set-up, he turned professional in 2008. He signed on loan for Macclesfield Town in August 2008, and made his competitive debut in a 2–0 defeat at Accrington Stanley on 23 August. He was substituted in the 70th minute after picking up an injury. Macclesfield manager Keith Alexander commented that "He did a good job for us, I was delighted with his performance" and "for a young lad to come in and do so well, it augurs well for the future." Alexander stated they had an option to extend the loan, but both parties agreed it would be best if he returned to his parent club. McDonald signed on loan for Chesterfield on transfer deadline day, 2 February 2009, initially on a one-month emergency loan. On his return to Manchester, he played for the Reserves in the Manchester Senior Cup final on 9 March, in the 1–0 defeat to Manchester United Reserves at Ewen Fields, Hyde.
Walsall.
McDonald signed a one-month loan deal with Walsall in September 2009. His father previously played for the club. McDonald impressed Walsall manager Chris Hutchings, who twice had the loan extended for an extra month, before he signed for Walsall on a permanent basis in December 2009, following the player's release from Manchester City. The decision to leave City for Walsall won him praise from new teammate Troy Deeney. He played 27 games in the 2009–10 campaign, and picked up his first senior goal on 16 February, in a 2–1 victory over Leeds United at Elland Road. He was more of a bit-part player in Walsall's 2010–11 season, making just seventeen appearances. In April 2011 he picked up a shoulder injury that would keep him out of action for the rest of the season.
Port Vale.
After being told he would not be retained by the "Saddlers", he was due to sign a contract at Port Vale in June 2011, but failed a medical due to a shoulder injury. Regardless of this he signed a six-month deal with the club the following month. He aimed to regain his fitness, win a first team place, and thereby earn a longer stay at Vale Park. He quickly managed to achieve the first two of these goals by October, as he started nine of Vale's first fourteen games of the season. He achieved the third target in December, signing a contract lasting until the end of the 2011–12 season, having already made eighteen appearances in league and cup. However his next contribution to Vale's campaign would be his 64th minute sending off at Southend United, following a second bookable offence. He returned to the first team after serving his suspension, but received his second red card of the campaign on 17 March after receiving a second yellow card 47 minutes into a defeat at Crawley Town. He played 31 games for the "Valiants" with a court case hanging over his head, though boss Micky Adams said that there would be "no favours" for the player for proving his innocence and insisted that his decision on whether or not to offer a contract to McDonald would be based on the footballing ability he had shown over the course of the campaign. Though suspensions and court appearances limited his contribution to the campaign, he still managed to post 33 first team appearances in 2011–12. He accepted Adams' offer of a new one year contract in May 2012; Adams stated that "I'm obviously pleased Clayton has agreed to sign. He has done well since he has been at the club and has the potential to do even better. He was under a lot of stress with everything that was going on last season, but now he can get his mind clear and concentrate totally on football."
After David Artell left the club, Gareth Owen picked up an injury and Joe Davis suffered a loss of form, McDonald managed to build a solid centre-back partnership with John McCombe at the start of the 2012–13 campaign, but was warned to lose weight and improve his fitness by manager Micky Adams. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 win against Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 3 November, in the First Round of the FA Cup; during the match he also made a goal-line clearance with the score at 2–2. Speaking after the game, McDonald said "I'm just trying to pay back the fans and the manager for all their support in the past with performances on the pitch. Hopefully it's the first of many... hopefully I can catch Tom Pope up. The support they have given me has meant a lot to me. They are a top bunch of people, it's a top area." However the arrival of new signings Darren Purse and Liam Chilvers displaced McDonald from the first team picture. On 21 January, he joined Bristol Rovers on loan until the end of the season, as cover for the injured Garry Kenneth. The "Pirates" were then bottom of the Football League, and manager John Ward said that McDonald was "prepared to come down for the cause avoiding relegation and that's a really big plus for me." However McDonald remained on the bench as the "Gas" lost only three of their next 15 games, and had to wait until Tom Parkes received a suspension before he finally started a game for the club on 6 April, in a 1–0 win at the Memorial Stadium that saw Rovers climb into 11th place. He returned to Vale in time to see the club secure promotion with a third-place finish. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season and was released as a free agent.
Grimsby Town.
McDonald signed a one-year contract with Grimsby Town of the Conference Premier in July 2013. On 19 November, McDonald scored his first goal for the "Mariners" by providing the winner in a 2–1 victory over local rivals Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup First Round.
Style of play.
Walsall manager Chris Hutchings said of McDonald "he's a talented young lad. He's strong in the air, tackles well and can play."
Personal life.
Family.
His father, Rod, was previously a professional footballer who played for Walsall, Partick Thistle, Chester City, and numerous other non-league clubs. His younger brother, also named Rod, is also a professional footballer, and played for Stoke City and Oldham Athletic after leaving the Manchester City Academy in 2005.
2012 acquittal of rape.
On 20 April 2012 after a trial at the Crown Court at Caernarfon before His Honour Judge Merfyn Hughes QC and a jury, McDonald was acquitted of the rape of a woman at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan on 30 May. His co-defendant, and former Manchester city teammate, Ched Evans was convicted of the charge, and sentenced to five years imprisonment. McDonald's lawyer stated after his acquittal that: "Clayton McDonald has maintained his innocence from the start and is relieved at his verdict. However, he is very upset and disappointed regarding the verdict given to his lifelong friend, Ched Evans, whom he will continue to support in any way possible."

Coleman Manufacturing Company

The Coleman Manufacturing Company (1899–1904) was the first cotton mill in the United States owned and operated by African Americans, located in Concord, North Carolina.
Company established (1897).
The company was established in 1897 primarily by black North Carolinian capitalists. Their idea was to establish a cotton mill that would be entirely managed and operated by blacks, since all the cotton mills in North Carolina, and the South overall, would only employ blacks in menial positions.
Richard B. Fitzgerald was its first president, Edward A. Johnson its first vice-president (and was later president), and Warren C. Coleman was its first secretary, treasurer, and manager. The initial board of directors was S. C. Thompson, L. P. Berry, John C. Dancy, S. B. Pride, C. F. Meserve, and Robert McRae.
About $50,000 was subscribed, which soon increased to $100,000, by "several hundred" African Americans, mainly living in or near Concord; a few white philanthropists, such as Benjamin N. Duke who subscribed $1,000 (at six-percent interest), also invested in the capital stock of the company.
The mill was to have between 7,000 and 10,000 spindles, and from 100 to 250 looms, and, according to their charter, was "allowed to spin, weave, manufacture, finish, and sell warps, yarns, cloth, prints, or other fabrics made of cotton, wool, or other material". 
The mill had "a 270 horse power Corliss engine there and machinery that will compare favorable with any in or around Boston". Apparently, most if not all of the equipment, described as inefficient "second-hand English" equipment by one source, was purchased used by Coleman, which eventually caused production problems.
On February 8, 1898, the cornerstone of the 80×120 feet, three-story brick building was laid "with Masonic honors". Four-room mill houses were built by April 1900, and were rented out at about $3 per month to the employees of the mill. 
Local black laborers and artisans initially accepted stock as payment for their work in the construction of the mill, but most soon decided to accept only money instead of more stock, and many workers quit due to the inability of Coleman to raise the necessary amount of cash at that time.
During the Paris Exposition of 1900, in Paris, France, the mill was touted as evidence of progress among African Americans in the United States, in an exhibit titled the "Negro Exhibit," put together by W. E. B. Du Bois, and photographs of the mill were displayed.
Building finished (1901).
The building was finally completed in 1901, and in July of that year, Coleman informed investor Washington Duke that the mill was operating successfully. However, the mill soon began to have financial problems, mostly due to the high price of cotton, and in 1902 it was temporarily shut down.
Mill closure (1904).
In 1904, the company was unable to remain afloat financially, and to add to the mill's problems, Coleman died. Mainly due to these problems, the mill was advertised for sale in July 1904, and was purchased by Washington Duke for $10,000 at the "sheriff's sale." Duke sold the property in 1906 for $13,000.
Site today.
The original mill structure has been integrated into Fieldcrest Cannon Plant #9, northeast of the intersection of Main Street and Highway 601 South (which was named "Warren C. Coleman Boulevard" in 2001) in Concord.

Oliver Twist (1933 film)

Oliver Twist is a 1933 American film directed by William J. Cowen. It is an adaptation of Charles Dickens's popular novel with the same name and was the first sound version of the classic. It stars Irving Pichel as Fagin, Dickie Moore as Oliver, Doris Lloyd as Nancy, and William "Stage" Boyd as Bill Sikes. Pichel played Fagin without resorting to any mannerisms which could be construed as offensive.
Released by Monogram Pictures, the film was made on an extremely low budget. It never really achieved much success and was out of circulation for many years, but resurfaced on television in the 1980s.
Plot.
An orphan boy in 1830's London is abused in a workhouse, then falls into the clutches of a gang of thieves.
Differences from novel.
Despite the fact that the Sowerberrys and Noah Claypole appear in the cast list, the entire Sowerberry sequence is omitted from this film, as is Monks, Oliver's half-brother. Rose Maylie becomes Brownlow's daughter in this version, and it is Brownlow's house that Sikes attempts to rob. It is possible that early releases of this film did include Noah Claypole and the Sowerberrys.

List of spacecraft from the Space Odyssey series

Various fictional spacecraft have appeared in the "Space Odyssey" series by Arthur C. Clarke. Most prominent is the "Discovery One" - famously controlled by HAL 9000. The following is a list of craft and space stations depicted in the books and films of the series.
Aries Ib.
The Aries Ib is a fictional spacecraft seen in the film "". It is a ball-shaped lunar lander built for providing regular passenger commuting between Earth's orbit and the Moon, just as the "Orion III" spaceplane (both operated by Pan Am) provided for travel between the Earth and "Space Station V". It is nuclear powered, the high performance of its engines allowing it to make a fast transfer to the moon (at about one day, compared to three days which were necessary for "Apollo"). It also carries a retractable landing gear.
Cosmos.
The Cosmos is the first of three versatile spacecraft featured in "", designed and constructed by "Tsung Spacelines". The Cosmos is only mentioned briefly, its two sister ships, "Galaxy" and "Universe", play a larger role in the story.
Discovery One.
United States Spacecraft "Discovery One" "(or XD-1)" is a fictional spacecraft appearing in the "Space Odyssey" series, including the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". "Discovery One" is a large, nuclear-powered interplanetary spaceship. "Discovery" was named after Captain Robert Scott's RRS "Discovery", launched 1901; Arthur C. Clarke used to visit the ship when she was moored in London.
Discovery Two.
Discovery Two is an unfinished spacecraft mentioned in both "", and the 1984 film adaptation "2010", but is never actually seen. Little information is given about the ship, but it is explained in the novel that "Discovery Two" is being constructed under the supervision of Dr. Curnow to rendezvous with "Discovery One" and to investigate the failure of the HAL 9000 unit aboard the "Discovery One". The construction of the ship is halted after the American taskforce instead travels in the Russian-built "Alexei Leonov", as it would take too long to wait for "Discovery Two" to be completed.
EVA Pod.
The EVA Pod is a fictional spacecraft used for extra-vehicular activity seen in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". The Jupiter spacecraft "Discovery One" carries three of these small, one-man maintenance vehicles. The craft has similarities with the in development FlexCraft for servicing NASA Deep Space Habitats.
A section of the pod appears briefly in the background in a scene from "" as a tribute to the film.
Galaxy.
The Galaxy is the last of three versatile spacecraft featured in "", designed and constructed by "Tsung Spacelines". While performing a fly-over of Europa, a terrorist seizes control of the "Galaxy" and crashes it the nearly all-encompassing ocean covering the moon's surface. "Galaxy's" sister ship, "Universe", quickly responds, rescues the crew and passengers and transports them to the nearby moon, Ganymede. The "Galaxy" was lost and ultimately sank beneath the surface of Europa's oceans.
Goliath.
The Goliath is a sturdy craft designed to capture cometary fragments and other stellar ice to send toward Mercury and Venus for terraforming. The "Goliath" and its crew found Frank Poole's body drifting out near Neptune and brought him back to Earth where he was revived by 31st Century medicine. Frank later hitched a ride to Ganymede on "Goliath". Many years after Poole returned to Earth, the ship and its crew were lost when a cometary fragment it was preparing for sunward launch exploded.
The "Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov".
The Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov is a fictional Soviet spaceship in the novel "", and its film adaptation "2010". It was named after Soviet Air Force General Alexey Leonov, the first man to walk in space.
In the book, "Leonov" is described as being equipped with a Sakharov drive, a fictional new method of propulsion that makes it possible for the craft to make a round-trip to Jupiter. The craft also uses a large heatshield to aerobrake in Jupiter's outer atmosphere, saving fuel. In recognition of Alexei Leonov, after whom the craft is named, there is a framed painting by the cosmonaut in the mess room. The Russians are said to view gravity as more or less a luxury and the "Leonov" does not have artificial gravity. The ship was originally to be christened the "Gherman Titov", but was changed later for undisclosed reasons; a character in the film version offers the cryptic explanation that "people "referring to either Titov or someone involved with the current mission" fall out of favor", but does not elaborate.
In the film, "Leonov" is shown to have a large rotating midsection providing artificial gravity (presumably artistic license for ease of filming,) and has a large ballute in place of the heatshield.
The model of the "Leonov" for the film was designed by Syd Mead. It was the inspiration for the "Omega"-class destroyers seen in the TV series "Babylon 5".
Moonbus.
The Moonbus is a fictional spacecraft from the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". The vehicle is a small, low altitude rocket craft meant to be used for quick transportation of passengers and cargo above the surface of the Moon.
Orion III spaceplane.
The Orion III is a fictional passenger spaceplane seen in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". It is a two-stage space shuttle launched on a reusable winged booster. It is equipped with aerospike rocket engines and jet engines for atmospheric flight. Pan American World Airways operates the "Orion III", just as it operates the "Aries Ib". In early stages of planning for the film, the spaceplane's engines on the back were designed to break away from the passenger section of the plane.
Space Station V.
Space Station V is a fictional space station seen in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". Operational, it is a large, international, rotating wheel space station used as a transfer point from Low Earth orbit to the moon and other planets. It also functions as an orbital hotel. Rotation of the station provides artificial gravity for people aboard the station. The station contains two docking bays for docking spacecraft, placed on its rotational axis at the opposite sides of the construction. By the time of events depicted in the film, it is still under construction, with the incomplete second wheel. A Hilton hotel is located on board the film version of the vessel, the company's logo visible on screen in several scenes. The station is served by shuttle service from the Earth's surface from Pan American World Airways and Aeroflot, as the logos of both companies are depicted; the former is seen on an Orion III shuttle spacecraft, and the latter is shown on the hand luggage of Russian scientists stopping at the station en route back to Earth.
The rotating wheel depicted in the movie traces its lineage back to wheeled space station designs by Wernher von Braun and Herman Potočnik, the latter describing such a space station design in his book "The Problem of Space Travel - The Rocket Motor" (1928). The studio model was reported to be eight feet wide (Bizony) or six feet wide (Agel), and stuffed with tiny lights behind the windows. Due to its large size and delicate structure, the model always seemed in danger of breaking apart. Kubrick had most of the models and props used in "2001" destroyed, discarded, or securely stored away so they would not be used in productions not under his control. When the Borehamwood, England studio used to shoot the film was demolished in the early 1970s, the model for "Space Station V" was dumped in a field about 20 miles away. It was destroyed by vandals a few days later.
Tsien.
The Tsien was a fictional Chinese spacecraft - named after Chinese rocket engineer Tsien Hsue-shen - that was featured in the novel "", but did not appear in the film "2010". During the course of the novel, the "Tsien", a new Chinese Earth-orbiting space station, unexpectedly leaves on a secret mission to Jupiter. After burning all of its fuel to reach Jupiter before the "Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov", the "Tsien" makes a perfect landing on Europa, prompting China to lay claim to the moon. The character Heywood Floyd interprets their actions as an attempt by the Chinese to use Europa as a refuelling point, after which they can rendezvous with "Discovery One" and the alien artifact at the Io-Jupiter L1 point before the joint Russian-American team. Before it can leave Europa, the ship is destroyed by the primitive life dwelling beneath the surface of the moon.
Universe.
The Universe is the second of three versatile spacecraft featured in "", designed and constructed by "Tsung Spacelines". In the novel, the "Universe" embarks on a mission to land on Comet Halley but not long after setting down on the comet, it is called away to rescue its sister ship, "Galaxy", which had crashed on Europa after being hijacked by a terrorist organization.

Biography.
Early Life and Career.
Bruce Driscoll was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He started playing piano and drums at an early age then picked up the guitar when he was fifteen, inspired by the sound of Johnny Marr and George Harrison. Taking quickly to the instrument, he began accompanying his two sisters, Monica and Erica, in a band called Nectar. In order to free himself to tour with the group he withdrew from traditional high school and completed an independent study program through the University of Missouri.
The siblings embarked on a national tour and eventually landed a development deal with EMI Publishing when Bruce was only 17. Soon after they showcased for many of the US Major Labels, including Warner Bros. Records, Maverick, and Capitol. In 2002 they won Runner Up in the Pop Category for the UK songwriting Contest with the song Life Out Loud. Later that year the siblings disbanded over creative differences.
Astaire.
In 2003 Bruce and Erica began recording songs in their parents' basement which would turn out to be early Astaire demos. The songs took a stylistically more left of center pop sound. The demos were sent to Andy Chase of Ivy who loved the songs and wanted to produce the duo at his studio, Stratosphere Sound, in New York. After working with Chase in the studio the siblings relocated to New York and released their first EP, Don't Whisper Lies, on their own label.
The band toured with Ivy, Stars, and Robbers On High Street in 2005. In the middle of the tour lawyers for the Fred Astaire Estate threatened to sue if the duo did not change their name. Lacking the money to afford legal fees they changed their name to Blondfire.
Blondfire.
The duo continued on as Blondfire signing a Major Record Deal with EMI UK in October 2006. Shortly thereafter EMI was bought out by Terra Firma and went through massive internal changes. Bruce and Erica left the label in mid-2007 and self-released their debut album, My Someday, in April 2008.
In September 2012 following the viral internet and radio success of their song, Where The Kids Are, Blondfire signed to Warner Bros. Records and Primary Wave Publishing and began mixing of their full length LP, Young Heart, with mixer Wally Gagel.

Sleepy Rebels was formed after several of the songs Bruce had written with TV & ad composer Jeremy Adelman were used in commercials. Erica also joined the group and collaborated with them over the course of three albums, World Record, Yellow Tree and the Christmas themed album, Bah Humbug. Sleepy Rebel's music has been used in ads for J. C. Penney, VW, Tide and others.
Freedom Fry.
In April 2011 Driscoll met Parisian born Marie Seyrat during pre-production on Blondfire's Where The Kids Are video. Seyrat, the stylist on the video, played him a cover of her singing a song over a ukulele. Entranced by Seyrat's whispery voice, Driscoll asked her if she'd be interested in writing some songs together. The following August they formed the duo Freedom Fry and released the Let The Games Begin EP.
Their song Rolling Down was featured in the premiere episode of Bones, during the birth of baby Christine. And their single, Earthquake, was named as single-of-the-week by well respected French magazine, Les Inrockuptibles.

London Motors

London Motors was a Canadian automobile company located in London, Ontario. The company was formed by William Stansell, who was previously involved with the production of the Brock car in Amherstburg, Ontario.
In 1921 Stansell raised $75,000 to form London Motors Limited, with a factory located at King and Rideout Streets. Prototypes were ready by the autumn of 1921.
The London Six was an impressive vehicle featuring wooden disc wheels, pointed windscreen and a Herschell-Spillman 6 cylinder engine.
The engine was tilted down at the rear, providing a lower drive shaft and reducing universal joint strain. The aluminium body made the car very light, allowing a top speed of 85 mph to be reached.
Production began in late 1921, with the following models:
Prices ranged from $2,600 for the tourer to $3,700 for the sedan. The car's slogan was "Canada's Quality Car".
Bodies were originally built at a factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, but when the supplier was unable to keep up with demand, Stansell rented factory space next door to the London Motors factory.
When Governor General Julian Byng visited London, several London Six owners loaned their cars for official ceremonies. Lady Byng claimed that the London Six was the most comfortable car that she had ever travelled in.
In 1924, Stansell made visits to various firms and bankers looking for extra capital in order to expand production. In his absence, the board of directors of the company allowed control to be taken over by new investors, who wound up the company in early 1925. Total production of the London Six was 98 cars.

Strezimirovci

Strezimirovci (Serbian and ; also "Strezimirovtsi", "Strezimirovtzi") is a divided village in easternmost Serbia and westernmost Bulgaria. The Bulgarian half of the village is part of Tran Municipality, Pernik Province, whereas the Serbian part belongs to Surdulica municipality, Pčinja District. The village has a border checkpoint and its residents on either side of the border are mostly Bulgarian; however, its division has caused its population to decrease more than tenfold. It lies in the geographic region of Znepolje (Znepole), at , in a valley along the Jerma (or Erma) River, 830 metres above mean sea level.
The village was first mentioned in Ottoman registers of 1451 as "Stryazimirovtsi" and in 1453 as "İstrazumirofca". Its name is derived from the personal name "Strezimir" (Стрезимир). From the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 until the post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919, Strezimirovci was located in Bulgaria and was administratively part of the Tran district of Sofia Province. As Bulgaria participated in the war on the side of the Central Powers, it was obliged to cede a Bulgarian-populated area of 1,545 km² to Serbia, a region afterwards known in Bulgaria as the "Western Outlands". The new border did not take the location of extant communities, property, roads and rivers into account, it was drawn so as to give Serbia a strategic importance in future wars. Strezimirovci was among 25 villages more or less divided into two by the new Serbian-Bulgarian border. Reputedly, four locals even tricked the international commission sent to mark the border by moving the temporary border stones overnight in order to include more of the village in Bulgaria.
As a consequence of this bisection, the village's population has declined significantly on either side of the border. For example, the Serbian part had a population of 485 in 1948; by 2002, it had decreased to 53, of whom 47 Bulgarians (88.67%), 4 Yugoslavs (7.54%) and 2 Serbs (3.77%). The Bulgarian part of Strezimirovci is only inhabited by 25 people as of June 2008.

It is funded by the Purchase Student Government Association through mandatory student activity fees. The paper is published weekly during the academic year and is distributed on Thursdays.
History.
The Indy was founded in 2001 by Purchase student Glen Parker. Parker wanted to open an on-campus thrift store, but could not fund it through the Purchase Student Government Association (PSGA) due to rules about operating a business within the business of the PSGA. He could, however, use the profits from the thrift store to fund a student-run publication. At the time, The Purchase College Dispatch, operated by the Journalism department and open only to Journalism majors, was the only news source on campus.
Parker's joint venture combined the thrift store, The Independent Purchase, with the new newspaper, The Purchase Independent, forming I.P.P.I. In 2003-2004 the thrift store folded and the newspaper became separate, funded by the PSGA.

Desai
Khush Malik
Critical reception.
The reviews to the film were rarely all negative, blaming the script and lack of comedy. The film had a poor opening. Many people saw it as a crude remake of the blockbuster Home alone, while lacking the humor and emotional depth of Home Alone.
Box office.
"Dum Kata" made only about Rs.342,000 at the box office. It was declared not a flop but a 'disaster' by Box Office India due to the lacklustre business.

Podenco Canario

Podenco Canario (In English: "Canary Islands Hound", "Canarian Warren Hound") is a breed of dog originally from the Canary Islands. The Podenco Canario is still used in the Canary Islands today in packs as a hunting dog, primarily used for rabbit hunting. The word "podenco" is Spanish for "hound". "Canario" means "Canarian" or "of the Canaries".
Appearance.
The Canarian hound is a slender and lightly built but sturdy dog, of medium size, with height at the withers approximately 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes vary with the terrain on which the dog hunts. The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, or a combination of red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the dog's nose, nails and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to "blush" when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an extended and agile trot. Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as cow hocks, and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.
History.
The Podenco Canario is found on all of the Canary Islands and has long been thought to descend from a very ancient type brought to the islands in antiquity, and isolated there, presumed to be an example of the very oldest breeds. It was thought to have originated in Egypt and North Africa, and brought to the Canaries by the very earliest human settlers on the islands. Linguistic and genetic analyses of the descendants of the earliest known human inhabitants of the Canary Islands seem to indicate a common origin with the Berbers of northern Africa, who may have brought the dogs there as a food source.
However, recent genetics studies have concluded that the Podenco is a type of dog more closely related to, and no more primitive than, the rest of the European hunting breeds.
Current use.
Rabbits ("Oryctolagus cuniculus") are a serious pest in the islands, where they were introduced (first on La Palma) in the 16th century. Rabbit hunting with the Podenco Canario is a very popular sport, and a necessary pest control, yet does little to currently significantly alter the rabbit population. Hunting seasons are organised to maximize rabbit control while minimizing any damage hunters and their dogs may do to agricultural areas [http://www.socpvs.org/journals/index.php/wbp/article/view/10.2461-wbp.2008.4.4.] 
The Podenco Canario is recognised by "La Real Sociedad Canina de España" (R.S.C.E., the Spanish Kennel Club) as an indigenous breed and is recognised internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as breed number 329 in Group 5 "Spitz and primitive types", Section 7 : "Primitive type - Hunting Dogs", Spain. In North America the breed is listed with the United Kennel Club as a hunting dog in the Sighthound & Pariah Group. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses. Exported from its homeland, it is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
Health and temperament.
A very rare genetic disorder of sexual development has been observed in this breed, a testicular/ovotesticular disorder, which can result in dogs that are genetically female (XX) developing testes or ovotestes instead of ovaries. This disorder was formerly referred to as SRY-negative XX sex reversal, and is more commonly documented in American and English Cocker Spaniels.
The breed standard states that the typical behaviour is "nervy, agitated, and of an enthusiastic dynamism" a typical high-key hunting dog. Dogs of this breed that are aggressive should not be bred, but there are many others that make wonderful pets, as they are notably loyal and gentle in a way that is similar to the Greyhound.
Similar breeds.
Breeds also listed in Group 5/Section 7 include the
Ibizan Hound, Cirneco dell'Etna, Portuguese Podengo, and the Thai Ridgeback.

Eel buck

Eel bucks are a type of fish trap that was prevalent in the River Thames in England up to the 20th century. It was used particularly to catch eels which were a staple part of the London diet.
Eel bucks were baskets made of willow wood, and were often strung together in a fishing weir. Construction of such weirs was outlawed under the terms of Magna Carta
However the practice continued unabated, often with adverse effects on navigation.
Several islands in the River Thames reflect the presence of bucks at those points - for example Buck Ait and Handbuck Eyot.
A surviving eel buck may be seen on the River Test at .

Every year, the money goes toward BC Children’s Hospital’s most urgent needs, including specialized equipment and research.
Event.
The event spans three consecutive days, typically during the Friday, Saturday and Sunday following the Victoria Day long-weekend in May. Up to eighty teams are divided into industry sectors such as financial (banks and credit unions), real estate and development, mining, hospitality, retail and wholesale, technology and more. Together, these corporate teams gather to compete in round-robin and competitive divisional softball tournaments. 
In addition, there are also recreational round-robin play and creative corporate challenges within the divisions. New in 2009 is the skills competition, where players face-off to raise more money for BC Children’s Hospital, and the Saturday Media Feature game where popular local media personalities will step up to the plate.
During the event, there is also a KidZone geared toward children and activities such as crafts, entertainment, activities, balloons and more. A raffle and daily barbecue is also available at the event.
Jeans Day.
On Jeans Day, people across British Columbia, Canada, wear their jeans and their lapel pin or button acknowledging their support of BC Children's Hospital. Jeans Day typically falls on the last Thursday in April.
Anyone can participate in Jeans Day by purchasing a $20 lapel pin or a $5 button before or on Jeans Day.
Since its inception in 1991, Jeans Day has raised millions of dollars to ensure that children in British Columbia have access to quality pediatric care at BC Children’s Hospital. In 2008, over 180,000 British Columbians purchased Jeans Day lapel pins or buttons and helped raise over $1.25 million for BC Children’s Hospital.

Armida al campo d'Egitto

"Armida al campo d'Egitto" is an opera in three acts by Antonio Vivaldi to a libretto by Giovanni Palazzo. It was first performed during the Carnival season of 1718 at the Teatro San Moisè in Venice. Vivaldi's version is different from the more than 50 operas whose themes derive in varying degrees from the story of Rinaldo and Armida in Torquato Tasso's epic poem "La Gerusalemme liberata" ("Jerusalem Delivered"). Unlike the more than 50 operas based on the romance of Rinaldo and Armida, Vivaldi's version starts during previous events before the war against the Crusaders. Armida was revived for the Carnival season of 1738, with much of the music rewritten, and arias by Leonardo Leo added. Act II of the original version of the opera is now lost.

Cora Cohen

Cora Cohen (born October 19, 1943) is an American artist whose works include paintings, drawings, photographs, and altered x rays.
Career.
Cohen's first solo museum exhibition was initiated by James Harithas at the Everson Museum of Art in 1974. She began exhibiting regularly in New York at the Max Hutchinson Gallery in 1976. Her 1984 exhibition at that gallery garnered critical attention. "The New York Times" art critic Michael Brenson wrote, "The works are dense, brooding and yet elated. The turbulence of the paint not only looks but also feels like freedom.". Cohen exhibited widely from the late eighties onward, in New York at the Holly Solomon Gallery, and Wolff Gallery. In the early nineties she began exhibiting in Europe. From 1993 to 2007 she was represented by Jason McCoy Inc, New York. In 2008, her exhibition "Come in a Little Closer" at Michael Steinberg Fine Art received wide attention. It was written about in the "New York Times", "artcritical.com", and reviewed in depth in "The Brooklyn Rail" by Joan Waltemath who wrote, "her brushstrokes...hover between the task of delineating form and the state of becoming form. They mimic the fluctuation between being and reflecting on being and so embody the Cartesian dualism that determines our consciousness."
The first exhibition of Cohen's altered x rays, her works on exposed x ray films in which cuts and other interventions subvert or enhance the image, was held at The Field Institute Hombroich, Museum Insel Hombroich, Neuss in 2011. In 2013, The Responsibility of Forms, an exhibition of Cohen's 2012-13 paintings that examine a place between uncertainty and sureness was held at Guided by Invoices, New York. It was written about extensively, in artcritical.com, The Huffington Post and The Brooklyn Rail. In 2013, a selection of drawings from 2007 to 2013 was exhibited at Galerie Hafemann, Wiesbaden.
In recent years, Cohen's work has been exhibited in many prestigious group exhibitions throughout the United States and abroad, including, "70 Years of Abstract Painting - Excerpts", 2011, curated by Stephanie Simmons at the Jason McCoy Gallery, New York; "Auf Papier", 2011, at Galerie Hafemann, Wiesbaden; "Invitational Exhibition of Visual Arts 2012", at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York; "Assembly 2012", at Edward Thorp Gallery, New York; "Paper Band", 2012, curated by Stephanie Simmons at Jason McCoy Gallery, New York, with Frederick Kiesler, Lee Krasner, Jim Lee, etc., and "Season Review 2013", at Edward Thorp Gallery, New York with Andrew Guenther, June Leaf, Henri Michaux.
Cohen is a frequent guest teacher and lecturer at various institutions including The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia University School of the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Medicine Hat College, Alberta. She lives and works in Long Island City, New York and continues to spend time in Cologne and the Rhine region of Germany.
Collections.
Cohen’s works are in many public collections, including The Museum of Modern Art, The Swedish State Art Council (Stockholm), The Ulla and Heiner Pietzsch Collection (Berlin), the Weatherspoon Art Museum (Greensboro), Yale University (New Haven), The William and Uytendale Scott Memorial Study Collection of Works by Women of The Bryn Mawr College Art and Archaeology Collection (Bryn Mawr), and the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, (Purchase, New York).

Grooming claw

A grooming claw (or toilet claw) is the specialized claw or nail on the foot of certain primates, used for personal grooming. All prosimians have a grooming claw, but the digit that is specialized in this manner varies. Tarsiers have a grooming claw on second and third toes. With one possible exception, in the suborder Strepsirrhini, which includes lemurs, galagos and lorises, the grooming claw is on the second toe. The possible exception is the aye-aye, which has claws instead of nails on toes 2 through 5. There is some debate concerning whether any of these claws (and if so which ones) are grooming claws. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of owl monkeys ("Aotus"), titis ("Callicebus"), and possibly other New World monkeys.
The first toe is the large one, the equivalent of a human big toe. However, in all these prosimians the foot is more or less hand-like. The first toe is opposable, like a human thumb, and the second and third toes correspond approximately to the index and middle fingers.
Like a claw or a nail, the grooming claw is also made of keratin. It resembles a claw in both its lateral compression and longitudinal curvature. However, the tip is not as pointed, and it always stands at a steeper angle, a characteristic that also distinguishes it from a nail.
Function.
The grooming claw is used in personal grooming to rake through the fur or scratch, particularly around the head and neck.

Operational from 1871 to 1988, Kew was one of the largest asylums ever built in Australia. Later known as Willsmere, the complex of buildings were constructed between 1864 and 1872 to the design of architects G. W. Vivian and Frederick Kawerau of the Victorian Public Works Office to house the growing number of "lunatics", "inebriates", and "idiots" in the Colony of Victoria.
The first purpose built asylum in the Colony of Victoria, Kew was also larger and more expensive than its sister asylums at Ararat and Beechworth. The asylum's buildings are typical examples of the French Second Empire style which was popular in Victorian Melbourne. Designed to be elegant, beautiful, yet substantial, and to be viewed as "a magnificent asylum for the insane" with the aim of portraying Melbourne as a civilised and benevolent city whilst avoiding the jail-like appearance of other asylums. These aims were furthered by the use of low Ha-Ha walls and extensively landscaped grounds. Long considered of cultural and historic significance to Melbourne, Kew Asylum and its complex of buildings were registered on the Register of the National Estate in March 1978.
Despite initial grand plans and ideals, Kew Asylum had a difficult and chequered history contributing to several inquiries throughout its 117 years of operation, including a Royal Commission. Overcrowding, mismanagement, lack of resources, poor sanitation and disease were common criticisms during the asylum's first five decades; out-dated facilities and institutionalisation were criticisms of Kew's later period.
Kew continued to operate throughout the 20th century as a "Hospital for the Insane", "Mental Hospital", or "Psychiatric Hospital", treating acute, long-term and geriatric patients until it closed in December 1988. The main building and surrounding grounds were sold by the State Government in the 1980s and were redeveloped as residential properties.
Site and planning.
During the 1850s, the existing lunatic asylums of the Colony of Victoria were overcrowded. Yarra Bend Asylum, while only six years old, was considered unsuitable and Carlton Lunatic Asylum (which was originally a jail) was in a state of disrepair. As a result, in 1854 the Government of the Colony of Victoria commissioned a report proposing sites and designs for a new lunatic asylum. Contemporary educated opinion was that lunatic asylums should be built "on a healthy site, freely admitting light and air, and drainage ... a gentle eminence in a fertile and agreeable country". In a report by the New South Wales' Inspector of Asylums, Frederick Norton Manning stated that "the site chosen is of primary importance. On it must depend the comfort, happiness and health of the inmates." Thus a hilltop site, across the Yarra River from Yarra Bend was recommended in a report by G.W. Vivian of the Public Works Office. Vivian described the site as 
a section of land, about 400 acres in extent, situated on the River Yarra, about 4 miles from Melbourne, and ½ a mile to the north of the village of Kew ... the site selected is a fine slope, elevated about 100 feet above the level of the river, admitting of proper drainage and admirably adapted for ornamental grounds, the aspect chosen is south-east, and during the summer months the refreshing influence of the sea-breeze will be felt, without being exposed to south west gales.G. W. Vivian, "Report on the Proposed Kew Lunatic Asylum" The idea that breezes or wind-swept locations were healthy came from a wider Victorian belief that associated disease with congestion and squalor, and that miasmas of impure air caused epidemics. The area Vivian recommended for the asylum had originally been set aside for a village reserve. Locals from Kew were upset by the proposal and petitioned the government, to no avail. of land in the County of Bourke, parish of Boroondara, city of Kew were permanently reserved as a "Site for Lunatic Asylum" in the Government Gazette of 1864. Construction began in 1864, however was halted almost immediately with reports of inferior works on the foundations. An investigation followed and Frederick Kawerau resigned. Contractor Samuel Amess continued construction at Kew using Kawerau's designs. They were derived from plans earlier outlined by Vivian, and were basically identical to Kawerau’s designs for Ararat and Beechworth, though Kew was much larger, and more expensive at a cost of ₤198,334.
Distinctive features.
The asylum complex is an example of the E-plan lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England, which itself was based on the 1830 design of Hanwell Asylum in London, England. Kew was also considered a barracks style asylum due to its perceived resemblance to stockades or jails. The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, made from local clay which was quarried on-site. The bricks were then rendered with cement. The central administration block is three storied with a mansard roof and cupola. Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. Each wing has a four storey, mansard-roofed tower, which contained water tanks. The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas, many of which were retained when the complex was redeveloped. Internally, the dormitories had ceilings and brightly coloured walls with the beds aligned in neat rows. The floors were of timber, principally so they could be scrubbed.
The primary access to the complex was from a tree-lined drive from Princess Street (now known as "Main Drive") culminating in an elliptical carriageway in front of the main building. A second drive (now known as "Lower Drive") extended from Princess Street to the rear gates of the asylum. This road was commonly used for deliveries to and from the asylum via the rear gatehouse.
While Kew's plan and detail are similar to its sister asylums at Ararat and Beechworth, the Kew asylum is much larger with the front buildings and towers more impressive architecturally. Kew's distinctive towers and mansard roofs make it one of the most prominent architectural landmarks in Melbourne and is clearly visible on the eastern skyline.
Ha-Ha walls.
Another distinctive feature of Kew Asylum and its sister asylums is the use of a variation on Ha-Ha walls around the patients' courtyards. They consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, detering them from escaping, while from outside the walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment. A journalist with "The Argus" described the walls as an 'excellent arrangement, as it enables the patients to see the outside world, and does away with that gaol appearance and feeling inculcated by the walls of the old asylums'. Many of Kew's Ha-Ha walls were retained and remain intact, unlike those at Beechworth and Ararat which were partially dismantled or the trenches were filled in.
Grounds and landscaping.
The conifer plantings and oak avenues along Main and Lower Drives were well established and of a mature size by the 1940s. Conifers were widely planted from the 1860s along with Moreton Bay Figs and occasionally Oaks. Oaks and elms were more widely planted from the 1880s. It is not known if Linaker was responsible for the oak avenues, but it appears that many of the conifers, Monterey Pines, Canary Island Pines, Monterey Cypress, Hoop Pine, Bunya Bunya Pines and Himalayan Cedars, predate Linaker and the oaks and elms may have been planted soon after his appointment. The use of Bhutan Cypress in the landscape is almost certainly due to Linaker as he favoured upright trees. It is possible that the two remnant Monterey Cypress along Main Drive and a Monterey Pine along Lower Drive are trees from an earlier planting scheme. Several trees and plants on the grounds of Kew Asylum and Kew Cottages have been classified as of historical significance by the Victorian Heritage Council and the National Trust of Australia (Victoria), and have been protected during the property's redevelopment.
In addition to the asylum's ornamental gardens, the grounds featured vegetable gardens, farms and recreational areas such as cricket ovals and bowling greens. Little evidence remaining of these structures except there is now a road that encircles the former cricket oval.
Patients.
Many of Kew's early patients were transferred from Yarra Bend Asylum and Carlton Lunatic Asylum and were housed in the two main wings—men in the right wing, women in the left. The wards were dormitory style and were divided by patient type—male/female, paying/pauper, manageable/refractory. The area of the women's wards was smaller due to the laundries and drying courtyards being located on the women's side of the asylum.
Admission process.
Under the Lunacy Statute of 1867, Lunacy Acts from 1880 to 1928 and Mental Hygiene Act of 1933, people could be admitted to the asylum by a number of means:
Until the end of World War I, there was little change in the admission process at Kew. Upon arriving, a variable amount of data was collected on the person being admitted. These basic details included age, sex, marital status and former address (or name of the asylum/jail transferred from). Other details requested included names of relatives or friends, the person's religion and occupation and whether others in the family have ever been classified as insane. Other information recorded, where available, were dates of previous admissions, "form of mental disorder", bodily condition ("satisfactory", "unsatisfactory", "feeble", etc.) and "duration of existing attack". From approximately 1900 onwards, photographs were usually taken on admission. If the person was very restless, the photograph was omitted. Belongings, such as books and clothes, were often returned to friends or family. Inmates were required to dress in institutional clothes. This was useful in a number of ways as it assisted the public in easily identifying escaped inmates; reduced the need to request clothes (or money for clothes) from the inmate's family or their estate; and minimised inmate conflict when inmates swapped or stole clothes from each other. The property and estates of people who were deemed to be insane were controlled and administered by the Master-in-Equity, also known as the Master-in-Lunacy.
Diagnoses.
The diagnoses given to patients during Kew's first fifty years were the common ailments found in most lunatic asylums of the pre-Kraepelin era
It should be noted that some of these terms are still in use today, however they may now have different meanings. For example, from examining the notes on some of Kew's early "dementia" patients, it can be deduced that many were most likely suffering from what we now term severe depression, catatonia or schizophrenia.
Children at Kew.
In the early days of Kew Asylum, the distinction between "lunatics" and "idiots" (or "imbeciles") was not made. Therefore, many wards of the state, "difficult" children and children with mental retardation were housed with the adults at Kew. By 1879 nearly 600 children, representing a quarter of all inmates, were accommodated in various institutions in Victoria. In the 1880s the government decided that a separate building should be built to accommodate child inmates. The Zox Commission recommended the Yarra Bend Asylum site as appropriate for buildings for "imbecile" children. However, a site between the main building and the entrance gates of Kew was chosen and in 1885 a contract was let for the erection of cottage units. The Kew Idiot Ward (Kew Cottages) was opened in May 1887. The Idiot Ward was initially considered a ward of Kew Lunatic Asylum, however later became known as a separate institution – "Kew Idiot Asylum". Although the Idiot Asylum only admitted children, many of those children remained in residence at the Cottages as adults.
Inebriates at Kew.
Under the Lunacy Statute of 1867, the Master-in-Lunacy was able commit inebriates to an asylum for any period up to twelve months. Inebriates who were able to pay the lodging fees at private inebriate asylums were able to be housed in inebriate-specific institutions such as Northcote Inebriate Asylum. Paupers were placed in lunatic asylums.
After the 1888 Zox Commission into Asylums, all private/semi-private inebriate asylums were abolished under the provisions of the Inebriate Asylums Act 1888. Northcote was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1890 and converted into a public inebriate retreat. Brightside and Lara Inebriate Retreats were opened soon after, and many alcoholics were moved out of the lunatic asylums.
Investigations and inquiries.
Despite initial grand plans and ideals, Kew Asylum had a difficult and chequered history resulting in several inquiries, including a Royal Commission. The first inquiry occurred in 1876, only five years after Kew opened. Another notable inquiry occurred in 1907 after a severe outbreak of Typhoid fever, which at the time was thought to have been virtually eradicated in Melbourne. This inquiry in turn lead to amendments to the Lunacy Act, improvements to Kew (and the state's other asylums) and the planned construction of Mont Park Asylum.
Zox Royal Commission.
Public outcry at the treatment of the insane in the colony's lunatic asylums increased in the 1870s, fueled by articles and woodcuts in magazines and the writings of "The Vagabond" in "The Argus". Officially known as "Royal Commission on Asylums for the Insane and Inebriate 1884–1886," the Royal Commission chaired by Ephraim Zox was required to inquire into and report upon the state and condition of Asylums for the Insane and Inebriates, both public and private. The Royal Commission made some sixty five recommendations in its final report. A number of the Commission's recommendations were implemented prior to the presentation of its final report, others were implemented through the Lunacy Amendment Act 1888 and some recommendations were not implemented until proclamation of the Lunacy Act 1903 in 1905.
The Commission recommended that criminal patients be kept apart from other patients, thus male criminally insane patients were moved to J Ward of the Ararat Asylum and female dangerous patients to Sunbury Asylum.
The Commission also recommended that inebriates and idiots be housed in asylums separate from the insane which led to the construction of Kew Idiot Ward and various Inebriate Asylums.
The Zox Commission further recommended increasing the role of medical doctors at the asylums and that "Medical men have the sole and exclusive right to determine whether their fellow citizens are sane or insane. The medical expert therefore stands in the position of witness, jury and judge". Prior to (and in some instances, for a time after) the Zox Commission, many superintendents at asylums did not have any training in insanity.
Changing names, changing society.
During its 120 years of operation, Kew’s title changed numerous times. This has been in response to society’s changing views towards the treatment and care of mentally ill persons; improvements in treatment leading to better health outcomes and changes in the Victorian Government’s various Health Acts. From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Kew was known as an asylum – a title which emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a place where people could possibly be cured. Kew was also for a short period known as the Metropolitan Lunatic Asylum at Kew, possibly to differentiate it from its sister country asylums at Ararat and Beechworth. During this period, all people committed to the asylum were termed 'inmates' rather than patients - again emphasising detention rather than cure.
The Lunacy Act of 1903 changed the title of all Victorian "asylums" to "hospitals for the insane" however this Act didn’t come into operation until March 1905. From this time onwards, inmates began being referred to as patients. The Mental Hygiene Act of 1933 again altered Kew's title to "Kew Mental Hospital". The move from 'asylum' to 'hospital' and 'inmate' to 'patient' also reflected the increased involvement of the medical profession in the management and treatment of mental illness.
After World War II there was a period of significant change in the treatment and prognosis for people with a mental illness. Drugs such as Lithium carbonate (discovered in 1948 by Australian psychiatrist John Cade) and chlorpromazine (discovered in 1950's) lead to improvements in treatment. Thus many people with a mental illness could in many cases be treated in hospital for a shorter period and return to the community. The Mental Health Act of 1959 designated hospitals providing short-term diagnosis and accommodation as "psychiatric hospitals". Therefore any institution could have a section designated as a mental hospital for long-term or indefinite hospitalisation and a section designated as a psychiatric hospital for short term diagnosis and treatment of acute psychiatric illness.
In 1962 the decision was made to no longer house acute or short-term patients at Kew and therefore it was formally proclaimed a Mental Hospital under the Mental Health Act of 1959. Up until this time, Kew Mental Hospital was still colloquially known as "Kew Asylum". In the 1960s Kew began to be known as "Willsmere", however some authors state the name change to "Willsmere" was later.
In January 1982 three wards of Kew Mental Hospital were proclaimed a Psychiatric Hospital under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959. These wards were then known as the Willsmere Unit and were established to receive and accommodate short-term acute patients.
Shrinking grounds.
When opened, Kew's extensive of grounds were intended to be used for farming, agriculture and recreation for the inmates. However as treatment methods, inmate profiles, superintendents and societal factors changed, use of the grounds changed accordingly.
A large area of the grounds between the asylum main buildings and Princess street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s lead to a section of the asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.
In 1958, of the northern section of the asylum grounds were offered under a Crown Grant to the Talbot Colony for Epileptics. Later known as Royal Talbot (now part of Austin Health), the hospital and training centre continue to operate on the site to this day. An area of Kew's grounds adjacent to the Talbot Colony was granted to the Guide Dog Association of Victoria for the building of a guide dog breeding and training centre, which opened in 1962. The construction of the Eastern Freeway in the early 1970s also resulted in property loss for both Royal Talbot and Kew Asylum.
Decommissioning and redevelopment.
In June 1943 the Town Clerk of the City of Kew, W. D. Birrell, produced a report on the immediate post-war priorities for Kew. Birrell strongly urged the council to propose the closure of Kew Asylum, with the grounds to be subdivided and "...laid out on modern town planning principles with some 700 to 800 homes". According to Birrell, this would have been an ideal post-war scheme as it would provide employment and much needed land for housing. Birrell's proposal was not new; ever since the establishment of the asylum, proposals for its closure and redevelopment had recurred every few years. Birrell's plans did not eventuate as overcrowding at other mental hospitals throughout Victoria necessitated Kew's continued operation.
By 1986 Willsmere Hospital's bed numbers had been reduced to 430, three quarters of which were for psychogeriatric patients.
As a result of ongoing mental health reform, the then Labor Government of Victoria commissioned the "Willsmere project", the purpose of which was to plan for decommissioning the hospital and develop services and facilities in the community. Long-term psychogeriatric patients were transferred to new psychogeriatric nursing homes in the suburbs, to a re-opened ward of Plenty Psychiatric Hospital in Bundoora, to the refurbished Heatherton Tuberculosis Sanatorium or to other psychiatric institutions. Acutely unwell patients that would have previously been admitted to Willsmere were now sent to newly built units at Maroondah Hospital, Monash Medical Centre or Peninsula Hospital.
Willsmere was finally closed in December 1988 and sold by the Government of Victoria in the late 1980s. An extensive Conservation Analysis was completed in 1988 that recommended the bulk of the original buildings be conserved.
The hospital complex was eventually developed by Central Equity into residential apartments. The Willsmere residential development was officially opened on 27 October 1993 by Premier Jeff Kennett.
The remaining grasslands between the Eastern Freeway and the main hospital buildings, including the site of the asylum's cricket field were developed as the Kew Gardens residential estate. The Kew Gardens project was completed in 1995. The buildings and grounds of the Kew Cottages (formerly the grounds of Kew Asylum) are currently being redeveloped as the "Main Drive" project by Walker Corporation.
One of the conditions of the development permit from the Historic Buildings Council required that a section of the building be set aside and maintained as a museum that documented the history of the site. This led to the creation of an interpretive display in a section of the old "Female Paying Patients Ward", development of an Archive / Resource Collection consisting of the few remaining records and artefacts left behind when Central Equity gained control of the site from A.V. Jennings. The Archive and Resource Collection was created by the Australian Science Archives Project (ASAP) at the University of Melbourne.
Documented histories.
There are few documented or published histories of Kew Asylum. The majority of information available on the asylum comes from the Kew's official records which are now held by the Public Record Office Victoria. Some of the early documents are open (or part open) to the public for viewing such as admission books, case notes, registers, and medical journals. However, the majority of documents dating from 1915 onwards are closed, due to the sensitive nature of the material they contain and the possibility that first degree relatives may still be alive.
A number of photographs of Kew Asylum are kept by the Victorian Mental Health Library at Royal Melbourne Hospital. The State Library of Victoria also holds a number of early photographs of Kew. The University of Melbourne has a small number of theses on Kew – the majority of which are short in length and are architecture-based. The exception to this is Cheryl Day's unpublished PhD thesis which is an ethnographic description of the first fifty years of Kew's existence. While the thesis was unpublished, it is available in PDF form through the University of Melbourne Library website.
Some contemporary accounts of life in Kew are available. Paul Ward Farmer wrote an essay "Three weeks in the Kew Lunatic Asylum", describing his admission to Kew in the 1890s. Julian Thomas, an American reporter, wrote a series of articles for "The Argus" in 1876–1877 under the pseudonym of "The Vagabond". Thomas was an attendant at Kew at the time. There are also excerpts of affidavits from patients, doctors, and attendants at Kew (as well as other Victorian mental hospitals such as Royal Park, Mont Park and Sunbury) detailing the terrible conditions in the asylums during the 1920s in the book "A Plea for Better Treatment of the Mentally Afflicted" by Hon. William G. Higgs.

Kelly-Ann Baptiste

Kelly-Ann Kaylene Baptiste (born 14 October 1986) is a track and field sprint athlete who competes internationally for Trinidad and Tobago.
Junior.
Competing at the international level for the first time, Kelly-Ann bowed out in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championships in Athletics. She ran 12.03 seconds to end seventh in her heat at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica.
In 2003, Kelly-Ann was the first Trinidad & Tobago female sprinter to win a medal in a global track meet when she ran 11.58 seconds to take bronze in the 100m at the 3rd IAAF World Youth Championships in Sherbrooke, Canada. Less than a year later, she took 200m gold and 100m silver at the XVI Central American and Caribbean (CAC) Junior Track & Field Championships, in Veracruz, Mexico. She followed that up with fourth place in the 200m final at the 10th IAAF World Junior Championships, in Grosseto, running 23.46 and missing out on bronze by one-thousandth of a second.
Kelly-Ann completed a busy year by making her Olympic debut in Athens, running the lead-off leg in the 4x100m relay, but she was unable to complete the baton exchange with Fana Ashby, and T&T exited the event in the first round.
In 2005, Kelly-Ann ran 11.39 and 23.35 to win the 100m and 200m races at the CARIFTA Games on her home island of Tobago. She then competed at the 10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, Finland, and reached the quarter-finals of the 100m, where she ran 11.42 to finish sixth.
College.
Also in 2005, Kelly-Ann took up studies at Louisiana State University. In her freshman season, sandwiched between CARIFTA and World Championships, she made the finals of three events at the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships, finishing fourth in the 100m (11.37), eighth in the 200m (23.42) and anchoring the Lady Tigers to fifth in the 4x100-m relay.
She would end her collegiate career in 2008 as a 14-time All-American (having made that number of NCAA event finals), a six-time NCAA Mideast Regional Champion and a two-time NCAA champion. Her two titles came in her senior season, as she became the first Lady Tiger to sweep 60m and 100m titles at the NCAA Championships in the same season. She scored a team-high 19 points at the 2008 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships to lead the Lady Tigers to their first national championship since 2004 and their 25th NCAA team title.
Those accomplishments earned Kelly-Ann recognition as Southeastern Conference Female Runner of the Year for the Indoor and Outdoor seasons, and US Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association South Central Region Female Track Athlete of the Year.
Kelly-Ann returned to major international competition when she represented Trinidad and Tobago at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She competed at the 100m and placed second in her first round heat after Chandra Sturrup in a time of 11.39. She qualified for the second round in which she failed to qualify for the semi finals as her time of 11.42 was the sixth time of her race. Together with Wanda Hutson, Ayanna Hutchinson and Semoy Hackett she also took part in the 4x100 metres relay. In their first round heat they did not finish and once again Trinidad & Tobago was eliminated due to a mistake with the baton exchange.
Professional.
In May 2009, at the Grande Prêmio Brasil Caixa in May 2009, Kelly-Ann set a Trinidad & Tobago national record in the 200 metres finishing with a time of 22.60 seconds. Later that year, she would go on to make the semifinals of the 100 and 200 at the 10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics, finishing fifth (11.04 seconds) and 4th (22.96) respectively. She was also invited to the IAAF/VTB Bank World Athletics Final, where she ran 11.27 to finish 8th in the 100.
Despite the absence of major meets in 2010, Kelly-Ann had a stellar competitive year. She began training in Florida with 2007 triple world champion Tyson Gay, 2001 World 200m gold medallist Debbie Ferguson Mc Kenzie and 2004 Olympic and 2009 World 4 × 100 champion Aileen Bailey, under coach Lance Brauman. Although she had had success in the collegiate ranks under head track and field coach Dennis Shaver, the change of environment brought the desired results.
In June, the Trinidadian star achieved the then-best performance of the year in the women's 100, doing 10.84 at the National Training Centre (NTC) Stars Invitational meet, in Clermont, Florida, making her the 27th-fastest woman over that distance all-time. She had a good run at the inaugural Samsung Diamond League, ending third in her event on points. Kelly-Ann then achieved perhaps her most significant victory to date, winning the 100 at the first-ever IAAF / VTB Continental Cup. Her time of 11.05 was the fourth-fastest winning time in the history of that meet.
Kelly-Ann then joined American Shalonda Solomon (who was second in the individual 100), Cydonie Mothersill of the Cayman Islands and Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie of the Bahamas to win the women’s 4×100 relay for the Americas in a time of 43.07. 2011 ISTAF IAAF World Challenge meet, in Berlin, German 100m Winner.
Failed drugs test.
Baptiste failed a drugs test in August 2013 and did not compete at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics in Moscow

William M. Timlin

William Mitcheson Timlin (11 April 1892 - 1943) was an architect and illustrator. He was born in Ashington, Northumberland, the son of a colliery foreman. He showed talent for drawing at Morpeth Grammar School, and received a scholarship to the Armstrong College of Art in Newcastle. In 1912, he joined his parents in South Africa where he completed his training in art and architecture and remained for the rest of his life.
Timlin designed a number of important buildings in Kimberley including Kimberley Boys' High School while pursuing his interest in art, turning out a large number of watercolour fantasies in addition to oils, pastels, etchings and periodical illustrations. His work was regularly exhibited. He also wrote stories and composed music. 
Timlin worked on "The Ship that Sailed to Mars" for two years. It was started as a diversion for his son in 1921. The work expanded until in its final form it had 48 pages of text and 48 colour plates showing remarkable flights of fantasy. 
Timlin sent the book to publishers George Harrap, who were delighted with the illustrations and the calligraphic text, deciding to print it without typesetting. The book has since become a fantasy classic. The film rights to the book were purchased in the United States, where Timlin enjoyed great popularity. Alan Horne in "The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators" describes the book as a masterpiece and "the most original and beautiful children's book of the 1920s".
Timlin illustrated many South African travel books and prepared illustrations for a book titled "The Building of a Fairy City" which was never published. He died in Kimberley, Northern Cape in 1943.

Leonard–Merritt mass estimator

The Leonard–Merritt mass estimator is a formula for estimating the mass of a spherical stellar system using the apparent (angular) positions and proper motions of its component stars. The distance to the stellar system must also be known.
Like the virial theorem, the Leonard–Merritt estimator yields correct results regardless of the degree of velocity anisotropy. Its statistical properties are superior to those of the virial theorem. However, it requires that two components of the velocity be known for every star, rather than just one for the virial theorem.
The estimator has the general form
formula_1
The angle brackets denote averages over the ensemble of observed stars. formula_2 is the mass contained within a distance formula_3 from the center of the stellar system; formula_4 is the projected distance of a star from the apparent center; formula_5 and formula_6 are the components of a star's velocity parallel to, and perpendicular to, the apparent radius vector; and formula_7 is the gravitational constant.
Like all estimators based on moments of the Jeans equations, the Leonard–Merritt estimator requires an assumption about the relative distribution of mass and light. As a result, it is most useful when applied to stellar systems that have one of two properties:
Case (1) applies to the nucleus of a galaxy containing a supermassive black hole. Case (2) applies to a stellar system composed entirely of luminous stars (i.e. no dark matter or black holes).
In a cluster with constant mass-to-light ratio and total mass formula_8, the Leonard–Merritt estimator becomes:
formula_9
On the other hand, if all the mass is located in a central point of mass formula_10, then:
formula_11
In its second form, the Leonard–Merritt estimator has been successfully used to measure the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy

Bundelkhand Yearly Meeting

Bundelkhand Yearly Meeting (Bundelkhand Masihi Mitr Samaj) is a yearly meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh state in mid-India. It was formed from Friends Churches set up by missionaries from Ohio Yearly Meeting in 1896, and the first independent yearly meeting was held in Chhatarpur in 1956. Theologically it falls within the evangelical tradition, unlike Mid-India Yearly Meeting.
The main Friends' Church is at Chhatarpur, where the church is adjacent to Chhatarpur Christian Hospital, which was set up by Friends from the Friends' Foreign Mission Society in 1930, and run by Friends although is now administered as part of Emmanuel Hospital Association.

Bezdonys

Bezdonys () is a town in Lithuania, located to the north of Vilnius, within the Vilnius district municipality. It is best known for the 1908 Bezdany raid, one of the most daring and successful train robberies in history. According to the 2001 census, the town had 857 inhabitants.
History.
The site of the modern village has been inhabited at least since early Middle Ages. Local dense forests were a hunting resort of the Grand Dukes. Jan Długosz mentions, that the local hunting manor was visited by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila who was later elected as a king "Władysław I of Poland". In 1516 a hunting manor and surrounding land was granted by Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old to Ulryk Hozjusz, better known as father of Stanisław Hozjusz. The area donated to the Hozjusz family consisted of roughly 7000 hectares of forests, with a single mill and three villages (two of them – Żwiniany and Łuczniki – do not exist any more).
On March 1, 1605 Ulryk Hozjusz's great-grandson sold the village and the adjoining land for 5000 złoty to canon of Vilna Wilczopolski, who in turn donated it to the Jesuits in 1609. The village remained administered by the Jesuits until the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1774. The area was taken over by the royal treasury, but already on July 12 of that year king Stanislaus Augustus of Poland donated it to Mikołaj Łopaciński in exchange for a yearly donation for the Commission of National Education. At that time the village had roughly 300 inhabitants, including roughly 20 noble families.
After the Partitions of Poland the village remained in the hands of the Łopaciński family. The yearly fee however was instead paid to Saint Petersburg. Following the January Uprising the peasants living in Bezdany were granted with roughly 400 hectares (or "desiatinas") of land. On March 15, 1862 the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was opened and one of its stations was located in Bezdany (or Безданы in Russian). It was there that the Bezdany raid of September 26, 1908 took place. A group of Polish revolutionaries led by Józef Piłsudski stole roughly 200,000 Russian rubles from a passenger train. 
After Poland regained independence, the village started to grow. Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski, the owner of the nearby village of Orwidowo (modern Arvydai) and future Prime Minister of Poland financed a new public school in Bezdany. Also, in 1937 a new wooden church was opened in the presence of the President of Poland Ignacy Mościcki. Until then, the nearest church was located in Niemenczyn (modern Nemenčinė), 8 kilometres away. By the end of 1930s the village grew to almost 500 inhabitants and 70 houses. Following World War II the village was annexed by the USSR and attached to the Lithuanian SSR. Roughly half of pre-war inhabitants were repatriated to Poland. In 1946 a Russian language class was added to the Polish language school, in 1957 also Lithuanian language class was opened. In 1968 a new school building was opened and in 1992 a new Lithuanian language only school was built.

Mobile laboratory

A mobile laboratory is a laboratory that is either fully housed within or transported by a vehicle such as a converted bus, RV, or tractor-trailer.
Such vehicles can serve a variety of functions, including:
Mobile Teaching Laboratories.
A novel use of the mobile laboratory is in science education. In some cases, the mobile laboratory travels to a schools, museums, and other community organizations, providing the school with educational resources they otherwise lack. The mobile laboratory coalition is a loose partnership of groups that provide such services. In other cases, students must also travel to the mobile lab, such as when the lab takes the form of a boat or a train. Mobile laboratories have recently been gaining favor from the National Institutes of Health, in the form of the particular mobile laboratories such as the Biobus and the Boston University MobileLab, as a way to develop knowledge and understanding regarding biotechnology and medicine amongst the United States population.
The practice of mobile teaching labs exists outside the USA as well with examples, in the UK and in African countries. The UK Institute of Physics is touring secondary schools with their Lab in a Lorry. This is a large articulated truck with three small laboratories. In these, pupils can learn about the use of Physics in Medicine, and do hands-on experiments with light and sound using good physics lab equipment. These are guided by local volunteers and an IoP scientist. Volunteers usually have an interest in general science, or come from a science background. The project has the backing of the British Science Association, the STEMNET Ambassadors Scheme, and sponsors such as EDF Energy.

Margaret C. MacDonald

Major Margaret Clothilde MacDonald (1873 in Bailey Brook, Nova Scotia, Canada-1948 in Bailey's Brook, Nova Scotia, Canada) is a Canadian who, on April 11, 1914, was appointed Matron-in-Chief of the Canadian Nursing service band becoming the first woman in the British Empire to reach the rank of major during a nursing career of over thirty years. She served in the Spanish-American War. She was one of twelve Canadian women who served in the Second Boer War. She also served in the World War 1. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross and the Florence Nightingale Medal.
She graduated as a nurse from the New York City Hospital in 1895. After achieving her post-graduate, she went to Panama to serve for eighteen months during the building of the Panama Canal. There, she caught malaria and promptly returned after she recovered. In the Spanish-American War she served at Camp Wikoff. Camp Wikoff which was used to quarantine 29,000 soldiers including Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War to prevent the spread of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.
In 1901, nurses officially became a component of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, with nursing sisters Georgina Fane Pope and Macdonald being appointed as the first full-time Canadian military nurses in 1906. Over 3,000 nursing sisters served in the First World War.
She was one of five founding members of the Canadian Army Nursing Corps and the second to serve as the Matron-in-Chief.
Her work also brought her to Quebec City, Kingston, Ontario, Halifax, Nova Scotia as well as England. While working in London, she was responsible for over 1,900 Canadian nurses. She returned to Canada in the Fall of 1919 to help in the re-organization of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. She retired in 1923 at the age of 51.
After her military career, she travelled extensively. She earned an honorary DDL from St. Francis Xavier University. A ceremony took place in 1926 at Parliament Hill to unveil a memorial to the Canadian Nursing Sisters, a sculpted marble panel which portrays the history of Canadian nurses. She was immortalized as a national historic person of Canada by a plaque set in her birthplace in 1983.

More Than I Can Say

"More Than I Can Say" is a song written by Sonny Curtis and Jerry Allison, both former members of Buddy Holly's band The Crickets. They recorded it in 1959 soon after Holly's death and released it in 1960. Their original version hit No. 42 on British Record Retailer Chart on 5/12/60. It has been notably performed by singers Bobby Vee and Leo Sayer.
Bobby Vee version.
Vee is an American pop music singer whose prominence in the music industry arose from tragedy. After Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper were killed in a plane crash in February 1959, a then-teenaged Vee was one of a group of local musicians recruited to play at the next leg of a scheduled concert in Fargo, North Dakota. In 1961, Vee (whose other hit singles include "Take Good Care of My Baby" and "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes") recorded "More Than I Can Say", and it reached No. 61 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. It was a bigger hit in the United Kingdom, where the song and its B-side, "Staying In", peaked at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart.
Leo Sayer version.
Sayer is a British singer-songwriter who enjoyed the majority of his chart success in the 1970s and early 1980s. He had two singles reach No. 1 in the U.S., "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" and "When I Need You", both in 1977. He nearly had a third song achieve this feat, as his cover version of "More Than I Can Say" spent five weeks at No. 2 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in December 1980 and January 1981, kept from the top spot by "Lady" by Kenny Rogers and "(Just Like) Starting Over" by John Lennon. Sayer's version of the song was certified a Gold Record by the RIAA. It also spent three weeks at No. 1 on the "Billboard" adult contemporary chart. In the U.K., the song peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, while it spent two weeks atop the Kent Music Report in Australia. Sayer has stated that while looking for an "oldie" to record for his album "Living in a Fantasy", he saw a TV commercial for a greatest hits collection by Vee and chose the song on the spot: "We went into a record store that afternoon, bought the record and had the song recorded that night."

Parkia biglobosa

Parkia biglobosa, commonly known as the locust bean tree, African locust bean or néré, is a perennial deciduous tree of the Fabaceae family. It is found in a wide range of environments in Africa and is primarily grown for its pods that contain both a sweet pulp and valuable seeds. Where the tree is grown, the crushing and fermenting of these seeds constitutes an important economic activity. Various parts of the locust bean tree are used for medicinal purposes. As a standing tree, locust bean may have a positive effect on the yield of other nearby crops.
Description.
"Parkia biglobosa" is a dicotyledonous angiosperm belonging the family Fabaceae – Mimosoideae. It is categorized under spermatophytes, vascular plants.
It is a deciduous perennial that grows to between 7 and 20 metres high, in some cases up to 30 metres. The tree is a fire-resistant heliophyte characterized by a thick dark gray-brown bark. The pods of the tree, commonly referred to as locust beans, are pink in the beginning and turn dark brown when fully mature. They are 30-40 centimetres long on average, with some reaching lengths of about 45 centimetres. Each pod can contain up to 30 seeds.
History, Geography and Ethnography.
The tree locust bean (also known as "arbre à farine, fern leaf, monkey cutlass tree, two ball nitta-tree, nété and néré") was first written of by Michael Adamson in 1757’s West Africa. The use of fermented locust beans in Africa, however, dates as far back as the 14th century.
Geographically, "Parkia biglobosa" can be found in a belt stretching from the Atlantic coast in Senegal to southern Sudan and northern Uganda. The tree currently exists within a wide range of natural communities but is most abundant in anthropic communities – places where cultivation is semi-permanent.
Annual production of seeds in northern Nigeria is estimated at around 200 000t. While the products of the tree are not common in international trade, they form an important part of local and regional trade in West Africa. The seeds are especially prized, and much trade occurs locally in the Sahel region where they are transferred between borders.
Growing Conditions.
Seed Germination.
There are two types of seed within each pod – reddish-dark and dark (black). The ratio between these seeds varies from 1:20 to 1:5, with darker seeds outnumbering lighter seeds. Reddish-dark seeds have a thinner coat and they germinate earlier than black seeds that haven’t first been acid treated. “Dark seeds have a harder seed coat and require various pretreatments to ensure good germination rates.”
Although the seeds’ usual germination rate has been reported at 75%, germination can be improved by scalding for about 7 minutes, then soaking seeds in hot water overnight prior to planting. Locust tree seedlings “can be established vegetatively in nursery beds by grafting or budding, or by rooting adult cuttings.” These methods have shown good results in 11-25 year old trees in Burkina Faso and Nigeria.
Agronomy.
After the initial sowing into seed beds, seedlings at 3 days old can be transplanted into pots. Seedlings typically reach 20-25 centimetres tall after 20 weeks in the nursery, at which point they can be planted out into the field; direct sowing is possible, but its viability largely depends on soil moisture and the degree of insect/rodent threats. Preliminary ploughing “contributes to proper establishment of seedlings in the field with a success rate of 82% four years” in some cases after planting. Seeds can be treated with concentrated sulphuric acid “in a concentration of 97% for 10 minutes and then immersed in water for 24 hours to break their dormancy period.”
Seedlings grow comparatively fast – they can reach a height of 1 metre in just 1 year. They will begin to flower at 5–7 years during the dry season in the Sahel (December to April), while occurring slightly earlier in less dry regions. The tree is pollinated primarily by bats, but can also occur by way of “honeybees, flies, wasps, ants, tenerionid beetles and tettigometid bugs.” Fruiting can occur at anywhere from 5–10 years, and they will start to ripen just before the first rains and continue over most of the season.
Foliage of locust bean has been found to contribute to soil fertility improvement. In one experiment, the isolated relative effect of locust bean in the third year of the experiment was 86%, compared to 138% for neem, a related tree. The relative index of soil productivity during this time clearly appreciated for locust bean, as well as the accumulation of P and organic C compared with neem.
Shade tolerance of other crops planted the near locust bean tree may present additional problems. In a 2-year experiment on shading, Parkia biglobosa was “found to have suppressive effects on vegetative growth and yield of pearl millet in both years.” Eggplant yields were also suppressed by trees to between one third and one tenth of the yield in controlled plots, which themselves were damaged by rain. Despite this, chilli pepper yields (which were also affected by rain in the controlled plots) increased by up to 150% under the canopy of the locust bean tree.
Biophysical Limitations.
The tree of the African locust bean requires “between 0-300 metres of altitude, a mean annual rainfall of between 400-700 millimetres and a mean annual temperature of about 24-28°C.” It prefers well-drained, thick clay soils but can also be found on shallow, thin sandy soils.
Practical Uses.
Food.
The yellow pulp, which contains the seeds, is naturally sweet “and is processed into a valuable carbohydrate food known as sikomu and dodowa among the Yoruba and Hausa people of Nigeria, respectively.” However the most valuable parts of the locust bean, and possibly the entire tree, are the seeds themselves which are high in lipid (29%), protein (35%), carbohydrate (16%), and is a good source of fat and calcium for rural dwellers. Seeds are often ground into a nutritious spice or condiment, called dawadawa, which is beloved in large parts of Africa. “The seed is first cooked to remove the coating and cotyledons and then fermented to produce the desired result.” In a study conducted on the fermentation of dawadawa, it was found that Gmelina arborea as well as banana leaves accelerated fermentation of seeds, while also bringing “an increase in protein, crude fat and moisture contents with corresponding decrease in carbohydrate.”
Economic Activity.
The cultivation of this tree can be seen as an important economic activity for many in Africa, including a large portion of women. Néré fruits are highly commercialized in Burkina Faso; “over 50% of respondents in a nation-wide survey said they participated in its trade.” In general, women are wholly responsible for the sale of fermented seeds (dawadawa) even though both men and women are equally responsible for the sale of dry seeds.
Medical.
Indigenous healers in Africa use different parts of the locust bean tree for health benefits. In a survey conducted on healers in Togo, Parkia biglobosa was one of the highest cited plants used for treating hypertension. The tree was also one of two plants “listed as having real wound-healing properties in South-Western Nigeria, influencing the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts significantly.” In a similar survey conducted in Guinea relating to their use of antimalarial plants, "Parkia biglobosa" was cited among those most often successfully used. In an analysis on the antibacterial properties of the plant, another study found that “these properties compare favourably with those of streptomycin, making it a potential source of compounds used in the management of bacterial infections.”

Hackett represented Trinidad and Tobago at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed fourth in her first round heat, which normally meant elimination. However, her time of 11.53 seconds was among the ten fastest losing times and she qualified for the second round. There she failed to qualify for the semi finals as her time of 11.46 was the sixth time of her race. Together with Wanda Hutson, Ayanna Hutchinson and Kelly-Ann Baptiste she also took part in the 4x100 metres relay. In their first round heat they did not finish and were eliminated due to a mistake with the baton exchange.
She ran in the relay at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but was retrospectively disqualified and banned for six months because of a failed drugs test for Methylhexaneamine at the National Championships.
In November 2012 Louisiana State University reported that Hackett had again tested positive for methylhexaneamine at the 2012 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track & Field Championships in June. LSU were forced to vacate their championship win. Trinidadian authorities were told that the positive test had not, as of November 24, yet been reported to the IAAF.[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sports/LSU_confirms_Hackett_positive-180715561.html]

Ygnacio Palomares Adobe

The Ygnacio Palomares Adobe, also known as Adobe de Palomares, is a one-story adobe in Pomona, California, built between 1850 and 1855 as a residence for Don Ygnacio Palomares. The adobe was abandoned in the 1880s and was left to the elements until it was acquired by the City of Pomona in the 1930s. In 1939, the adobe was restored in a joint project of the City of Pomona, the Historical Society of Pomona Valley and the Works Project Administration. Since 1940, the adobe has been open to the public as a museum on life in the Spanish and Mexican ranchos. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Of the more than 400 sites in Los Angeles County that have been listed on the National Register, fewer than ten received the distinction prior to the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe.
History and architectue.
Rancho San Jose.
The Ygancio Palomares Adobe, built between 1850 and 1855, was once the center of the sprawling Rancho San Jose. The Rancho San Jose consisted of land taken from the Mission San Gabriel in 1834 as part of the Mexican government's secularization decree. In 1837, Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado granted the land to Ygnacio Palomares and Ricardo Vejar, both sons of native Spaniards. The Rancho San Jose operated by Dons Palomares and Vejar covered land that now forms the communities of Pomona, LaVerne, San Dimas, Diamond Bar, Azusa, Covina, Walnut, Glendora, and Claremont. Palomares initially lived in the "Casa Primera", an earlier adobe which is also operated by the Historical Society of Pomona Valley.
Construction and architecture.
Between 1850 and 1855, Palomares built a new home, which is the present historic site. The 13-room adobe was built in a T-shape with a courtyard. The living room and master bedroom were located at the stem of the T, and the adobe also had four more bedrooms, a dining room, kitchen, storeroom, tienda (or store), and storage chambers. The kitchen was located at the north end of the T, close to the outdoor oven (or "horno"). The house has been said to represent the blending of Mexican adobe construction and American styles, with the use of milled roofing and flooring on the adobe structure.
Use by the Palomares family.
The Palomares Adobe was used for a time as an overnight stagecoach stop at the midway point between Los Angeles and San Bernardino. The Palomares home was reportedly "the heart of the rancho," with its doors open to travelers and a store that provided goods to settlers. The large living room served for many years as a meeting place and a chapel where padres from the San Gabriel Mission would travel once a month to say mass. Ygnacio Palomares and his wife operated the land as a sheep and cattle ranch, grew their own crops, and raised five children at the adobe. The ranch prospered for many years, but a severe drought devastated the ranch in the early 1860s. Smallpox also claimed the lives of three of the Palomares' children, and Don Ygnacio died in 1864.
Don Ygnacio's widow, Dona Concepcion Lopez de Palomares (also known as "Dona China"), began selling off the ranch land in 1865. In 1874, another of the Palomares' children died, and Dona China sold the remaining , including the adobe, at $8 an acre, to John R. Loop and Alvin R. Meserve. The new owners, the Meserve family, continued to maintain the adobe as a community gathering place afterh acquiring it in 1874. Prominent Los Angeles attorney Edwin A. Meserve, later recalled coming to the adobe as "a sickly youngster of 13" in 1877, regaining his health while living in the old adobe. However, by the mid-1880s, the old adobe had been deserted.
Deterioration and restoration.
From the 1880s through the 1920s, the adobe was left to the elements and fell into severe disrepair, with whole wings of the house being washed away and the walls and roof crumbling. The dilapidated condition of the adobe is shown in 1938 photographs seen here and here. In 1934, the City of Pomona purchased the land for a reservoir, and the Historical Society of Pomona Valley began plans for restoration of the old adobe. In the spring and summer of 1939, 70 WPA workers began the process of restoring the adobe. The workers used dirt from the Ganesha Gills for adobe mud to build new adobe bricks. The adobe bricks were made using straw as the only binder, molding the bricks in forms by hand, and curing the bricks in the sun. Approximately 25,000 new adobe bricks were used in the restoration process. The cost of the restoration was placed at $54,000. Many of the bricks were made from the broken original adobe bricks, and the new bricks can reportedly be distinguished by the short lengths of straw used to mix with the mud, while marsh grass can be seen in the old adobe bricks.
The restoration was completed in December 1939, and and the restored house was furnished with period furniture typical of the California ranchos, much of it donated by Mrs. Harry Walker of San Dimas. The original landscaping was also restored with wisteria vines, wild cherry, black walnut, pomegranates and poplar trees. Charles Gibbs Adams oversaw the landscaping restoration, planting trees, shrubs and rosebushes in the same locations where they had been in the mid-19th Century. 
Operation as a museum.
The adobe was dedicated and opened to the public in April 1940 as a museum focusing on life in the early California ranchos. At the dedication ceremony, the keys were presented by Pomona's mayor to the Historical Society of Pomona Valley, and Ygancio Palomares, grandson of Don Ygnacio, "danced the dances taught him by his grandmother, his granddaughter Hilda Ramirez, being his dancing partner." The restoration was well-received, with one writer in the "Los Angeles Times" writing: "The example of this restoration ought to inspire other communities and families to do the same. This adobe has now become an imperishable glorification of early California, and an irresistible lure for modern visitors." Two years later, the "Times" reported: "The structure has become famous throughout the nation as a permanent museum housing many relics and equipment of the early Spanish days in California." In 1968, it was called "one of the pleasantest and most complete of the rancho restorations."
Members of the Palomares family were invited to move into the restored adobe as caretakers. In December 1939, Porfiero R. Palomares (c. 1871-1942), who was born in the adobe and was the grandson of Don Ygnacio, moved into the restored structure as caretaker with his wife and daughter. Porfiero lived at the adobe until he died there in October 1942. Porfiero's widow, Hortensia Yorba Palomares, continued to live in the adobe until her death in July 1958.

College football playoff debate

The college football playoff debate is a hot topic of discussion, concerning college football in the United States, among fans, journalist conference representatives, government officials, university administrators, coaches, and players concerning whether or not the current postseason format of the Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) should be changed or modified. Playoff proponents argue that a bracket-style playoff championship should replace the current Bowl Championship Series, while others advocate for a Plus-one format, which would create a single national championship game with participants selected after the conclusion of the traditional bowl season. This debate has been ongoing since at least 1971.
The BCS system was established prior to the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season to select two participants to compete for college football's FBS division (formerly division I-A) national championship. There have been numerous controversies about the teams that should play for the college football national championship.
Several polls have shown significant support among college football fans for a playoff to replace the BCS.
In 2012, the Commissioners of the BCS announced that a four team College Football Playoff would replace the BCS following the 2013-14 football season.
For a playoff.
Playoff proponents argue against the internal validity of the BCS National Championship and lament that the participants of the BCS National Championship game are decided based upon coaches' and media polls rather than via previous, on-field competition such as the case with head-to-head, bracket-style tournaments in other major sports and levels of college football. Proponents occasionally accuse the Bowl Championship Series of financial conflict with respect to the money earned in bowl games and the allocation of those resources.
Barack Obama has spoken out in favor of a playoff, before and after the 2008 U.S. presidential election. On November 18, 2008, in Obama's first interview as president-elect, Steve Kroft of "60 Minutes" ended the interview with a question about the topic. Obama replied: I think any sensible person would say that if you've got a bunch of teams who play throughout the season, and many of them have one loss or two losses, there's no clear decisive winner that we should be creating a playoff system. Eight teams. That would be three rounds, to determine a national champion. It would add three extra weeks to the season. You could trim back on the regular season. I don't know any serious fan of college football who has disagreed with me on this. So, I'm gonna throw my weight around a little bit. I think it's the right thing to do.
Proposals.
Several proposals for change to the current Bowl Championship Series (BCS) have been presented. The BCS commissioners contemplated replacing the current BCS with a plus-one format, which would create a national championship game at the conclusion of the traditional bowl season with the two participants selected among BCS bowl winners. Ultimately, the commissioners rejected any immediate action and tabled the discussion on whether to establish a plus-one format.
Other proposed formats include a bracket-style playoff championship with 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 32, or 64 teams. Although popular among college football fans, these formats have gained little momentum within the circle of BCS commissioners. The official response from the BCS to these formats is: "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".
Another proposal to change the structure of the post-season came from the Mountain West Conference at the Bowl Championship Series commissioners' annual spring meetings in Pasadena, California in conjunction with the Rose Bowl's staging the 2010 BCS title game. The Mountain West Conference commissioner argued for a selection committee to replace the BCS ranking system, the establishment of an eight-team playoff, and a revision to the automatic qualifier rules. 
The latest proposal was announced on June 26, 2012, and will adopt a four-team playoff system. The system is to go into effect starting after the 2013 season and continuing to 2025. A new selection committee will determine which four teams will be playing for the championship. 
United States Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has indicated that he would hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after the 2008 Utah Utes football team didn't get to play in the national championship game after finishing the regular season undefeated (they were in the Mountain West at the time; they have since left for a BCS AQ conference, the Pacific-12 Conference).
The sports simulation website WhatIfSports.com has demonstrated how a 16-team playoff could work. The site's annual college football playoff simulation, December Madness, "plays" a mythical tournament using 11 conference champions and five at-large selections based on BCS rank.
Governmental intervention.
According to CBSSports.com wire reports and information obtained by the Associated Press, Senator Orrin Hatch received a letter from the justice department concerning the possibility of a legal review of the BCS. The letter, received on January 29, 2010, states that the Obama administration will explore options to establish a college football playoff including (a) an anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, (b) legal action under Federal Trade Commission consumer protection laws, (c) encouragement of the NCAA to take control of the college football postseason, (d) the establishment of an agency to review the costs and benefits of adopting a playoff system, and (e) continued legislation in favor of a playoff system. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich writes, "The administration shares your belief that the lack of a college football national championship playoff ...raises important questions affecting millions..." BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock responded to the letter that the BCS complies with all laws and is supported by the participating Division I universities.
Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is moving to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In March 2011 the U.S. Justice Department sent a formal letter of notice to the NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to do every year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act of 1936. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences. 
The Fiesta Bowl scandal in particular was the catalyst that opened the BCS up to Federal interest for the first time, largely because the government is concerned not only about the BCS's stifling of fair competition, but more importantly for the Federal Government about the possibility of fraud and tax evasion, if the BCS has violated the rules governing tax exempt organizations and groups that control tax exempt organizations. If the BCS Bowls, who are each separate entities yet also part of the BCS as a whole as well were to lose their tax exempt status, they could be liable for back taxes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The Fiesta Bowl abuses – especially those regarding alleged illegal and improper political contributions, excessive executive compensation and unjustified reimbursement payments, and the making of excessive, interest free and un-repaid loans – are precisely the types of abuses that would justify the Internal Revenue Service in stripping the BCS, and each BCS Bowl and possibly even each BCS Conference school (although "that" is highly unlikely) of their tax exempt status. In the worst case scenario the BCS could also be subject to forfeiture and seizure proceedings. While the worst penalties are unlikely to be enforced, even the milder penalties, such as a determination of a cartel and trust, would have devastating consequences for the BCS and the current system. The court could also order a resolution of the current unfair competition inherent in the structure of the BCS, including ordering a playoff system and ordering the Bowls to participate as the court directs rather than as the bowls had planned in the case of the BCS's demise. Despite Big 10 Commissioner Delaney's assertion that if the BCS were to fold they would "go back to the old system" if a court ordered a solution such as a playoff the Conferences would have no choice in the matter, and would be required – especially if a determination is made that the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel – to do whatever the court says, including submitting to federal oversight of the Bowl's and Bowl teams' finances and administration, and conducting a 4, 8 or 16 team playoff, or whatever other remedy the court ordered in their holding. The structure, timing and participants in such a system would be completely out of the hands of the individuals and groups who now control those decisions, and those same individuals and groups would, in all likelihood, not be given the choice of not participating. A court ruling could require them to participate just as they are now, but they would be required to do so based on the court's rules rather than the BCS rules. This is one of the main reasons that the BCS is fighting against government intervention so strongly. The Department of Justice inquiry is far and away the most potentially dangerous legal situation that the BCS has faced to date.

Funny People

Funny People is a 2009 American comedy-drama film written, produced and directed by Judd Apatow, and starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, and Leslie Mann. The film was released on July 31, 2009 in North America, and on August 28, 2009 in the United Kingdom. "Funny People" uses considerably more dramatic elements than seen in Apatow's previous films. The film was co-produced by Apatow Productions and Mr. Madison 23 Productions, a subsidiary of Sandler's company Happy Madison. Universal and Columbia Pictures co-financed the film and it also served as a worldwide distributor. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Sandler and Rogen, the script and directing. The supporting cast features Eric Bana, Jason Schwartzman, Jonah Hill and Aubrey Plaza.
Plot.
George Simmons (Adam Sandler) is a very successful 40-something comedian and actor. However, he is self-absorbed, lonely and estranged from his family. When diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, George is offered an experimental treatment that has an eight-percent chance of therapeutic response. Believing he is about to die, he decides to return to his roots and do stand-up comedy. Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) is an aspiring stand-up comedian who shares an apartment with his two best friends in Los Angeles, Mark Taylor Jackson and Leo Koenig (Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill). Mark stars in a fictional sitcom, "Yo Teach", where he plays a teacher for a group of misfit students. Despite the obvious failings of the show, Mark constantly brags about his high income. When fellow stand-up comedienne Daisy Danby (Aubrey Plaza) visits the apartment, Mark magnanimously tells Ira that he will hold off having sex with her for ten days in order for Ira to make a play for her. At a comedy club, George takes the stage to deliver a dark routine, which Ira mocks in his follow-on act. George calls Ira the next morning and asks him to write jokes for George's upcoming gig at a MySpace corporate event.
George hires Ira as his assistant. When George tells him about his condition, Ira cares for him through the treatment. Ira implores George to tell people about his disease. George previously had called his ex-fiancée, Laura (Leslie Mann), to apologize for his infidelities when they were together, but does not tell her why he is having a change of heart. Meanwhile, Ira awkwardly asks Daisy out, but later discovers that she and Mark have slept together, and angrily cuts off all ties with her. Laura learns about George's illness, visits him at his house, and confesses that her husband, Clarke (Eric Bana), cheats on her as well. They reconcile and tentatively become friends. George′s physician tells him that the leukemia is in remission. George is happy but is unsure what to do with his life now. He decides he wants a long-term relationship and calls Laura, but does not tell her the news. George and Ira go to a gig in San Francisco, where Laura meets them there. George makes Ira tell Laura during intermission that he is free of disease. George later explains that he did not want to "jinx it". 
Laura invites George and Ira to her house in Marin County. George and Ira spend time with Laura and her two young daughters. George and Laura sneak into the guest house together to have sex; meanwhile, Ira tells both daughters that George is healthy. When Clarke unexpectedly arrives, Laura asks George to maintain the façade of being terminally ill. In the morning, Clarke bids George a tearful goodbye — which is cut short when his daughters reveal that George is actually healthy now. Clarke confronts Laura and accuses her of cheating. In response, Laura confronts him with his infidelity, and he drives off in a huff. Laura tells George that she plans to leave Clarke; George is overjoyed, but Ira tells him their affair will destroy a family. Angered, George threatens to fire him. The next day, George, Ira, and Laura watch the video of Laura′s oldest daughter, Mabel, performing the song "Memory" from the musical "Cats"; Ira and Laura find the performance moving, but George appears bored. Laura leaves for the airport to tell Clarke she is leaving him; Ira lies to George and follows her. At the airport, Clarke confesses his infidelity to Laura, and pleads with her to give their marriage another try. Laura agrees and says her affair with George was a mere "flirtation". They discover Ira following them, and goad him into admitting that he is trying to stop George and Laura from running off together. 
An enraged Clarke chases George out of his house and beats him up. George demands Laura choose between him and Clarke; she chooses her husband, and bids George a tearful goodbye. Heading back to Los Angeles, George berates Ira for his betrayal and fires him. Ira upbraids George for not learning anything from his near-death experience, and tells him that he will never be able to escape his own personal failings because of his selfish nature. Ira returns to his old job at the deli department while he starts to date Daisy. George attends Ira′s stand-up act and sees that his old assistant has become a far more confident performer. The next day, George finds Ira at work and admits that even though he is no longer sick, his attitude needs improvement. The film ends with George and Ira telling each other jokes as they laugh together and repair their friendship.
Cast.
Dave Attell, Sarah Silverman, Norm Macdonald, Paul Reiser, Tom Anderson, Charles Fleischer, George Wallace, and Andy Dick made cameo appearances as themselves in the roles of George's fellow comedians. Rapper Eminem, comedian Ray Romano, musician James Taylor, "MADtv" member Nicole Parker, and newcomer Bo Burnham also appeared in small roles. "Undeclared" alum Carla Gallo had a cameo in the film as a character on "Yo Teach!", the television show within the film that Mark stars in, while Justin Long and Apatow regular Ken Jeong have cameos in the film as characters in movies for which George is famous. Owen Wilson and Elizabeth Banks are featured on posters for fake movies in which George starred. Bryan Batt makes an appearance as George's agent. Musicians Jon Brion, Sebastian Steinberg, and James Gadson appear in the film as members of George's jam band. Comedians Rod Man, Budd Friedman, Monty Hoffman, Mark Schiff, Orny Adams, Al Lubel, and Jerry Minor appear as themselves. Comedienne/producer/writer Carol Leifer appears as herself.
Production.
Judd Apatow had expressed his desire to make a stand-up comedian mentor film loosely based on his own early experiences as a struggling performer. He could not come up with an interesting idea, however, since most of his mentors were kind to him. He then thought of making a film about a mentor facing a life crisis, and decided to have his former roommate Adam Sandler play that role. They discussed making the film almost two years prior to production.
Apatow had cast Sandler, Seth Rogen, and Leslie Mann as the three leads in March 2008. Eric Bana, Jonah Hill, and Jason Schwartzman were cast in June 2008 when the title of the film was announced. When asked about the decision to cast Bana, Apatow said that both he and Rogen are fans of his films; Rogen additionally commented they cast him as the husband because he was someone who would be considered an intimidating presence to both Sandler and Rogen. Bana mentioned that he decided to play the character with his native Australian accent so he would be more comfortable improvising. Apatow and Mann's daughters, Maude and Iris Apatow, play the young girls in the film. Both Apatow and Mann state that this casting choice allowed for more natural dialogue for the children, but the girls have not been allowed to actually see the film 
Academy Award-winning cinematographer Janusz Kamiński handled the cinematography for the film. Apatow had Sandler, Rogen, and Hill write their own material for routines. Apatow filmed them performing their routines in front of live audiences, using six cameras to capture their performances and audience reactions. Apatow filmed their entire performances, although only five to ten minutes of stand-up footage appear in the film. Hill admitted his performance was not well-received because he has never done stand-up. Additionally, Apatow filmed scenes from Sandler's character's fictional filmography, as well as scenes from Schwartzman's character's fictional television show "Yo Teach!", for the film to add realism.
Apatow used an old video of Sandler, from when the two were roommates, in which Sandler makes prank phone calls, and features a young Ben Stiller.
Marketing.
The first teaser poster for the film was released November 13, 2008. On the day the teaser poster was released, Universal Pictures and MySpace partnered together to create a contest that would allow people to have a part in the film by just writing a comment explaining why. Additionally, Apatow held a stand-up comedy concert event called "A Night of Funny People" at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles to film a scene for the movie. The event was open to the general public and featured acts by Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, David Spade, and Patton Oswalt, with Sandler, Rogen, and Ansari performing as their characters in the film. The first theatrical trailer for the film was released February 20, 2009 on the Internet, with a shortened version first appearing in theaters with "I Love You, Man". 
A website for a fictional television show-within-a-film was created on NBC.com. The sitcom, "Yo Teach!", "stars" character Mark Taylor Jackson (Jason Schwartzman), a C-list actor portraying a young teacher with a class of failing students, and includes a cameo by internet celebrity Bo Burnham.
A website for Aziz Ansari's character Randy Springs was created, along with a documentary of the character on FunnyOrDie.com. The documentary was directed by Jason Woliner.
Comedy Central aired a special, ""Inside Funny People"" on July 20, documenting the making of the film and showing clips of the stand-up. The channel also aired "Funny People: Live" on July 24, which is a live broadcast stand-up of Sandler, Rogen and Hill as part of the film's promotion.
Release.
Critical reception.
"Funny People" received some positive reviews from the critics and holds a 68% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 226 reviews, with the consensus that the film "features the requisite humor, as well as considerable emotional depth, resulting in Apatow's most mature film to date." Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 60 out of 100 under the "Mixed or Average Reviews" category, based on 35 reviews. 
Jeffrey Wells from "Hollywood Elsewhere" received feedback from sources who had seen a test screening, with one source calling it "really funny, a really sweet movie, a lot of veracity...really a brilliant film", comparing it to the works of James L. Brooks. 
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" awarded the film 3½ stars of four, calling it "a real movie. That means carefully written dialogue and carefully placed supporting performances — and it's about something. It could have easily been a formula film...but George Simmons learns and changes during his ordeal, and we empathize." It is the highest rating Ebert ever gave an Adam Sandler film, tied with his review for "Punch-Drunk Love". Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" also praised the film, writing, "Apatow scores by crafting the film equivalent of a stand-up routine that encompasses the joy, pain, anger, loneliness and aching doubt that go into making an audience laugh." Kyle Smith of the "New York Post" wrote that the film was "one of the most absorbing films of the year." 
Michael Phillips of the "Chicago Tribune" gave the film one of its mixed reviews, complaining of the film's two-and-a-half-hour running time: ""Funny People" is...an attempt by Apatow to reconcile the huge success he has become with the up-and-comer he once was. The results run an increasingly exasperating 2½ hours.". 
Manohla Dargis of the New York Times complains the film is "irritatingly self-satisfied" and describes the film as "nice" ... "but nice can be murder on comedy and drama alike".
Gene Shalit of NBC's "The Today Show" disliked the film greatly, stated that it's "A smirk of faithful characters that are making a vanity movie about themselves that keeps not ending for 2 1/2 unendurable hours. Director Judd Apatow wrote the script and it's vulgar, in fact it's ineffable, because without the letter F, he would have no script."
Box office.
"Funny People" was commercially released on July 31, 2009 in the United States and Canada. It was distributed to 3,008 theaters, and grossed $8.63 million on its opening day. At the end of its opening weekend, the film had grossed $23.44 million. "Funny People", which cost an estimated $75 million to produce, made about $71 million worldwide in theatres. In comparison, Apatow's previous directorial effort, "Knocked Up", cost $33 million to produce and made over $219 million in gross receipts, while Sandler's last three movies had all made over $100 million.
Home media.
"Funny People" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the USA on November 24, 2009. There is a one-disc "Unrated & Theatrical" cut and a two-disc "Unrated Edition". The Unrated cut of the film runs at 153 minutes. It was released in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2010, again, on DVD and Blu-ray.
Soundtrack.
Funny People: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on July 28, 2009.
Bonus tracks on iTunes release.
The film also features "Joanna" by Kool & The Gang, "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley, "Diamond Dave" by The Bird and the Bee, "Man in the Box" by Alice in Chains, "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" by Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes, "Walk Like an Egyptian" by The Bangles, "In Private" by Paul McCartney, "Cat Song" by Tomoko Kataoka and "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" by George Harrison.
The Blu-ray and 2-Disc DVD also includes Sandler performing The English Beat's "Save It for Later."
Additional songs used in the film's trailers are "We Will Become Silhouettes" by The Postal Service, "My Friend" by Dr. Dog, and "Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway (Again)" by Wilco.

Baden III b

The Baden Class III b engines were German steam locomotives designed for hauling passenger trains for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway ("Großherzoglich Badische Staatseisenbahn").
In this class the Baden state railway grouped rebuilt locomotives of former classes III and III a. 
Seventy engines of Baden classes III and III a were rebuilt between 1881 and 1891. They were all given a new, more powerful, three-ring boiler with a larger grate area. Because this was longer than the original boilers, the frame of the Class III had to be extended (on the Class IIIa it was long enough) and a buffer beam built onto the front. 
The boiler had a Belpaire firebox with a somewhat higher top surface. A larger steam dome was fitted on top of the rear boiler ring.

Tridacna costata is a newly discovered species of giant clam. It lives in the shallow waters of the Red Sea. Fossil evidence suggests the stocks of these giant clams began crashing some 125,000 years ago, during the last interval between glacial periods.
""Tridacna costata" may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation," said researcher Claudio Richter, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

Macchi M.7

The Macchi M.7 was an Italian single-seat fighter flying boat designed by Alesandro Tonini and built by Macchi. A modified version of the M.7, the M.7bis won the Schneider Trophy in 1921.
Development.
The M.7 was similar to the earlier M.5 but had a modified hull and was powered by an Isotta Fraschini V.6 engine. Due to the end of World War I, only 17 aircraft were delivered to the Italian Navy. In 1919, two each were sold to Argentina and Sweden, and in 1921, Brazil bought three. 
In 1920, Tonini designed the M.7bis a racing version of the M.7 for the Schneider Trophy. The M.7bis had a lighter structure and reduced-span wings. Five M.7s entered the 1921 competition at Venice, which was won by Giovanni di Briganti flying the M.7bis. At the 1922 competition at Naples, the M.7bis came in fourth.
In 1923, a revised variant of the M.7, the M.7ter appeared. This had a redesigned hull, revised wing configuration and a new tail unit. Three different versions of the M.7ter were built, including the M.7ter AR, which had folding wings to allow them to operate from the seaplane-carrier "Giuseppe Miraglia". In 1924, six Italian naval squadrons were equipped with the M.7ter and over 100 were built. The aircraft was also used as late as 1940 by civilian flying schools.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion

The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion ("J Sci Study Relig") is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Wiley-Blackwell in the United States of America under the auspices of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, dedicated to publishing scholarly articles in the social sciences, including psychology, sociology and anthropology, devoted to the study of religion. It is not a theology journal, as its publications tend to be empirical papers in the aforementioned disciplines, rather than papers assessing the truth or falsity, or otherwise attempting to clarify, theological doctrines. That said, the eminent theologian Paul Tillich wrote a preface to the first edition, published in 1961. A former editor, Ralph W. Hood, is a major name in the psychology of religion, having published scales to assess religious experience and mystical experience. Hood was succeeded as editor in 1999 by Ted Jelen, the first ever political scientist to edit the journal. Jelen was later succeeded as editor by sociologist Rhys Williams. The current editor of the journal is Laura Olson (Clemson University).
According to the "Journal Citation Reports", the journal has a 2011 impact factor of 1.348, ranking it 30th out of 138 journals in the category "Sociology".

St Mary's Church, Selly Oak

St. Mary's Church, Selly Oak is a Church of England parish church in Selly Oak, Birmingham, England.
Parish.
The parish of St. Mary was from part of the parish of St. Laurence, Northfield in 1862. The parish of St Stephen, Selly Park was formed from part of St. Mary's parish in 1871. The parishes were in the Anglican Diocese of Worcester until 1905, when they became part of the newly created Anglican Diocese of Birmingham.
Building.
The church is set back from the main Bristol Road (A38 road) and is approached from the south by a drive, ending at a lychgate at the entrance to the churchyard. There is also an entrance from the north in Lodge Hill Road.
St Mary's foundation stone was laid on 12 July 1860, and the Bishop of Worcester, the Right Reverend Henry Philpott, consecrated the church on 12 September 1861. The church was funded by the manufacturer George Richards Elkington (1801–65) and by Joseph Frederick Ledsam (1791–1862). Ledsam was Chairman of the London and North Western Railway and in 1848 had been High Sheriff of Worcestershire.
The architect Edward Holmes designed the building in a Gothic Revival interpretation of Decorated Gothic. It is built of coursed sandstone, enlivened both inside and out by being laid in courses of two different shades. The stone is from a quarry (now closed) at Weoley Castle. Limestone was used for quoins, window facings and internal columns. The north-west tower has a broach spire high, topped by a weathercock.
The church is cruciform, and the nave has a clerestory and north and south aisles with four-bay arcades. The clerestory windows are slightly unusual, being quatrefoils set in groups of three. Internally the walls are plastered, and the plastering is punctuated by horizontal bands of sandstone. In the transepts and nave the roof timbers are exposed and in the chancel they are gilded and painted in heraldic colours of red, blue, green, white and gold.
For St Mary's centenary in 1961 the interior was reordered and redecorated under the direction of the architect Stephen Dykes Bower. At the same time painted, sculpted rood was removed from the chancel arch and transferred to Holy Trinity parish church, Hadley, Shropshire.
Since 1982 the building has been Grade II listed In the 1980s a set of olive wood Stations of the Cross was installed.
Windows.
There are nine stained glass windows by Hardman & Co..
Bells.
At the church's consecration on 12 September 1861 the tower had only one bell. Five more were added in 1864, creating a ring of six that was first rung on 29 September 1864. In 1887 the parish commemorated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria by adding two more bells, increasing them to a ring to eight that was first rung on 20 June 1887.
In 1922 the bells were found to be unsafe to ring, and they were silent for a decade until enough money was raised for rectification work. In 1932 Gillett & Johnston of Croydon re-founded all eight bells and they were re-hung. The tenor (the largest bell) now weighs in and is tuned to the musical note G.
The Master of the Ringers for many years from the 1930s was William B. Cartwright, a local solicitor.
Inscriptions.
Two of the bells are inscribed.
Organ.
An organ was installed in 1862 for the opening of the church. In the 1870s it was moved to the south side of the chancel. In 1902 Nicholson and Company of Worcester rebuilt it, retaining much of the original pipework. Between 1925 and 1930 it was restored by Bird of Selly Park. In 1958 it was restored again, this time by Nicholson & Co, and the console was moved to the north side of the chancel. It was dedicated by the Right Reverend John Leonard Wilson, the fourth Bishop of Birmingham on 4 June 1958 at a recital by Sir George Thalben-Ball, the Birmingham City Organist. Sheffield Organs made further tonal improvements in 1996 and 1999.
Organists.
The Organist is also choirmaster and a robed choir leads the worship at the principal Sunday services. Other choral occasions include the Christmas Festival of Lessons and Carols, and a passion cantata, such as Stainer's "Crucifixion", in Holy Week. There are also occasional organ recitals and concerts.
Tower clock.
St Mary's has a tower clock that chimes the hours and quarter hours. It was installed in 1887, the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire made the clock under the supervision of the Rev. Canon Cattley. It is made on the same principle as the clock designed by Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe for the great clock at Westminster and the large clock at Worcester Cathedral. The cost was about £331 (£ as of ), and was the gift of the widow and family of the late Benjamin Walters.
The frame is cast iron, horizontal and planed. It is long, wide and deep, and is supported by beams that are built into the tower wall to preclude vibration. The wheels are of gunmetal and the pendulum beats every 1¼ seconds.
Popular culture.
St Mary's acoustics are fine and the church has been used as a concert venue, rehearsal space and recording space. The church has frequently featured in the BBC soap opera "Doctors".

Military of South Ossetia

The Military of South Ossetia is the military of the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, whose independence is recognized by Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Nauru, but which Georgia considers to be a Russian-Occupied Territory. The force numbers about 2,500 men, or 16,000, including reservists.
2008 South Ossetia war.
The South Ossetian military fought against the Georgian forces in the 2008 South Ossetia war. At the time of the major Georgian offensive, the bulk of the Ossetian force was concentrated in the settlement of Java to the north of Tskhinvali. According to Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, what thwarted the Georgian operation in the end was the resistance offered by peacekeepers and lightly armed South Ossetian units that stayed behind to defend the capital. Also Russian regular army forces entered the fighting on August 8 and drove deep into Georgia proper, occasionally accompanied or followed by South Ossetian militia who allegedly committed serious human rights violations, particularly in the Georgian villages of South Ossetia.
According one estimate, the losses of the South Ossetian military forces, militia, and volunteers in the war amounted to 150 dead. According to the 2012 statement by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, Russia had been training the South Ossetian militias as part of the Russian General Staff's 2006-2007 plan to rebuff Georgia in case of war.
Strength.
The South Ossetian military has a total of 16,000 soldiers. 2,500 soldiers are on active duty and 13,500 are reservists. 
At the beginning of the 2008 South Ossetia war, the armed forces possessed the following equipment:
After the 2008 South Ossetia War, some of the tanks that were captured from Georgia's forces have been transferred to the South Ossetian military.

Mermaid (dinghy)

The "Do-it-yourself" Mermaid is an 11 foot (3.4m) plywood sailing dinghy designed by Roger Hancock in 1962. Usually built at home, it is suitable for a crew of two or three. It can be sailed, rowed or motored and can be trailed or car-topped. The boat is gunter rigged, with one size of jib. A spinnaker is used for racing.
Design.
The DIY Mermaid broke away from the post-war tradition of building the hulls of plywood dinghies upside-down on frames fixed to the floor of a shed or garage, for the duration of the hull-construction process. The innovation consisted of building the stem to stern seating surfaces of the boat flat on the floor in such rooms as the kitchen, the spare bedroom or the garage during the minimum amount of time needed for the glue to set, for example, overnight. This allowed people living in quite small houses to build a boat at home for the first time.
The spine of the boat is an extended centreboard case running from stem to stern, which gives enormous strength to the hull structure. The gunter rig design allows the spars to be easily stored inside the boat and kept under a flat cover when not in use.
History.
The DIY Mermaid was designed as an entry for the sailboat-building competition, organised by Stanley Tools in 1961, and the first DIY Mermaid was built by the designer on the living room floor. The "Do-it-yourself" magazine started serialising the construction drawings and instructions in June 1963, whereby the DIY Mermaid could be built over several months, free of royalties and the cost of plans. For more rapid building, full sets of drawings and instructions were available. All the sails were supplied initially by Rockall and later by Arun. In 1966, "Do-it-yourself" magazine described the DIY Mermaid as "probably the only small general purpose dinghy designed specifically to be built by the amateur without the need or expense of a factory-produced kit of wooden parts".
As the "Do-it-yourself" magazine was widely distributed throughout the English-speaking world (the former British Empire or Colonies), a number of DIY Mermaids were probably built in many different countries and fitted out with locally produced sails and fittings.
Competition for choice of which small boat to build became very intense during this period of dinghy development. Consequently, in order to respond to new public demand and the new construction techniques, a stitch-and-glue version, very much lighter in weight, with a V-bottom hull, was produced as the DIY Mermaid MK II. Subsequently, a MK III version was also developed which had no rear tank, but with extended side tanks to the transom and a shortened centreboard case.
Altogether, some 1000 DIY Mermaids were built between 1962 and 1975. A Mermaid Class Association was established in 1963 and regional representatives were appointed with the aim of stimulating competition and further interest in the dinghy. Although the original design became an RYA recognised Class in 1965, with a Portsmouth Yardstick number for racing, insufficient numbers and the widespread geographical ownership resulted in Class racing gradually diminishing over the years. Another significant factor at that time was the emergence of a similar sized wooden dinghy, originally sponsored by the Daily Mirror. The evolution of these innovative class designs was the subject of a paper produced in 2005/6 for "Industry and Innovation".
One enduring success from the creation of the DIY Mermaid was the Maidenhead Sailing Club, which was originally formed from a fleet of DIY Mermaid dinghies and to this day, the club emblem is still that of a Mermaid.
Thanks to its extremely robust design, many examples of the DIY Mermaid Mk I and Mk II remain in active service today, or have an extended life due to loving restoration.
Registry.
Work is in progress to re-create a register of existing Mermaids.

1967–68 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1967-68 campaign was a mainly mediocre season for the Terriers. Town finished the season in the mid-table position of 14th under Tom Johnston. This season is most remembered by Town fans for their best ever run in the Football League Cup. They reached the semi-finals, before losing to 1st Division Arsenal 6-3 on aggregate.
Review.
Tom Johnston was beginning his 3rd full season in charge of the Terriers following a pretty impressive previous season, many were hoping that Town could possibly push for a promotion back to Division 1. After winning the first 2 games against Bristol City and Millwall, Town failed to win the next 7 games in the league and Town's league form never seemed to truly recover during the season.
Their Football League Cup campaign during the season is currently the best in Town's history. Following wins in the earlier rounds against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Norwich City, West Ham United and Fulham, Town played 1st Division Arsenal in the semi-finals of the competition. Following a narrow 3-2 defeat at Highbury in the first leg, some were thinking that a trip to Wembley wasn't out of the question. Tony Leighton gave Town an early lead in the second leg at Leeds Road, but the Gunners scored 3 further goals to secure their final berth at Town's expense. Town finished their league campaign in 14th place with only 38 points.

Palairos

Palairos () is an ancient city and a modern town in Aetolia-Acarnania, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform Palairos is part of the municipality Aktio-Vonitsa, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit Palairos was formed as an independent municipality in 1999 as a part of the Capodistrias government reform, under the name "Kekropia", which was changed to Palairos in 2004. 
History.
Palairos was a city of ancient Greece, situated in the southern part of the region of Epirus. During antiquity it was part of Acarnania, according to the "Theodorokoi". The city, ruinous for centuries, is thought to have existed during the Mycenean period, since parts of the city walls appear to date back to 2000 B.C. The construction of the walls interchanges between the square-shaped and the polygonal system and the parts belong to different periods.
It lies high in the mountains overlooking the Ionian sea and Lake Vourkaria. The city is thought to have had a population of over 10,000 people.
At nearby Actium, Mark Antony and Cleopatra were defeated in a sea battle by Octavius. According to tradition, the salt lake was the saviour of Cleopatra, who hid her ships there. 
The citadel on the eastern part of the yard is separated by a partition and is considered to be the most ancient part of the wall, probably from the Mycenean period. The ruins are close to the present-day town of Palairos.

World's End (comics)

"World's End" is a 2008-2009 comic book crossover storyline published by Wildstorm and taking place in the Wildstorm Universe. The event takes place in the issues of all of Wildstorm's Wildstorm Universe ongoing series.
Publication history.
Both flagship titles, "The Authority" and "Wildcats", were slated to be written by Grant Morrison with "Wildcats" drawn by Jim Lee and "The Authority" drawn by Gene Ha, but the pair encountered serious delays. Only one issue of "Wildcats" and two of "The Authority" ever shipped. Eventually, amid disapproving fan reaction, both series were cancelled.
Before the announcement that Morrison's series would not continue, Christos Gage filled in with '. The series shipped promptly, and Gage was hired to write a new cross-universe series '. "Armageddon" comprised six one-shots based on six of the relaunched titles, and led into successive bi-weekly limited series "" and "Number of the Beast". These culminated in the "World's End" storyline, beginning July 2008, which documented worldwide catastrophe and saw several Wildstorm titles relaunched with new creative teams and a new status quo for the universe.
Wildstorm editor Ben Abernathy described this storyline as a new direction for the Wildstorm Universe:
Plot synopsis.
The "How".
Various heroes receive a warning, purporting to be from the heroine Void, several years in the future. She shows them a post-apocalyptic world, and asks them to help prevent it from coming about.
As a result of this visitation, the Kherubim warrior known as Nemesis coerces Savant and the new Backlash to research possible endings of the world. As a result, they investigate various superhuman factions, usually violently. As a result of their investigations, Department PSI, which holds the corpse of The High, decides to place it somewhere safe, and hands it over to the NOTB Program.
The NOTB Program is a virtual-reality network built in the 1940s from Daemonite technology. Its original purpose was to "warehouse" an army of posthumans from that period, and train them to fight against the Apocalypse of Christian (notably Protestant) mythology.
However, the High's corpse had already been used by Department PSI to create the Reaper ballistic missiles, whose warheads contained cloned versions of the High. These clones were programmed to attack superhumans. When the High's presence in the NOTB program destabilized the whole scenario (since he had been present in the 1940s but had been missing from the scenario) and the escaped inmates were captured by the Authority, the Reapers were let loose to clean the whole mess up. However, denied easy access to their targets, the Reapers went berserk, fighting posthumans and superheroes all over the planet.
The Reapers were also designed to explode after use, as a plausible deniability measure. When they exploded in orbit, they wreaked havoc on the Earth, inciting warming in the arctic regions, ice ages in the tropics, stripping away key parts of the atmosphere and starting fires that generated vast smog clouds. In addition to this, the Authority's Carrier crashed into London, creating a dust cloud that blocked out the Sun across most of Eastern Europe.
The "Why".
The origins of the disaster are unclear. On the one hand, comments made by a Daemonite indicate that they originally sent the humans the technology because they intended for "some" disaster to happen, but how much of it was planned is unknown.
On the other hand, the supervillain known as Tao was clearly prepared for the disaster as well. He has been seen preventing access to time-travel and reality-altering technology and power to keep the world in its present, easily-conquerable state. He has implied that he started the whole affair, but no definite proof is forthcoming.
The "What".
The Authority are active from London. Jenny Quarx went missing trying to contain the power source for the Carrier, and the current Doctor vanished after her. The electromagnetism of the crash has disabled the Engineer's powers, the smog means Apollo can act on Earth only for brief periods (since he needs sunlight to survive), and Jack Hawksmoor, uses a wheelchair since there are no cities to sustain him. However, the heroes are active, trying to reactivate the Carrier's technology and fight off the machinations of groups who want that technology.
The WildCATs are operating from a HALO Corp building in Los Angeles. The forward planning of Hadrian, their former benefactor, means they were well placed to survive the devastation, but they cannot make any more supplies and need to be wary of over-extending. Additionally, a legion of Daemonites have moved into Los Angeles claiming homesteading rights, while Mister Majestic, unhinged by the disaster, has set up a kingdom in Hawaii based on Kherubim social mores and technology.
From their satellite headquarters, Stormwatch have inherited the original role of the Authority: to build a "finer world". However, they can only process so many refugees, and are stretched thin across an entire world. As well as this, Battalion, their leader, has grown harsh and unyielding under the pressure.
Off the radar, Gen13 stepped through a malfunctioning teleporter before the disaster, and came out a month after the disaster. They are still travelling, trying to find shelter and sustenance in the wasteland. Along the way, they must fight rabid posthumans and hard-edged survivor bands.
As this is going on, the villains make their moves. Kaizen Gamorra prepared his nation against the disaster, and is now the leader of a veritable superpower. Tao has an army with plans to use them for his own ends. Lord Defile is preparing to push the WildCATs out of Los Angeles. The Night Tribes are hunting the human population of Eastern Europe under the perpetual cloud cover. Sliding Albion has allied with the British government to preserve the British way of life. And in space, the Kherans make plans to conquer Earth.

Bernhard VII, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

Bernhard VII of Anhalt-Zerbst (17 March 1540 – 1 March 1570), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
He was born and died in Dessau, and was the third and youngest son of John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst by his wife Margaret, daughter of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg.
Life.
Bernhard inherited Anhalt-Zerbst when his father died in 1551 along with his older brothers Karl I and Joachim Ernest according to the stipulations of the family law of the House of Ascania, which mandated no division of the territories of the principality.
Upon the deaths without issue of his uncles George III of Anhalt-Plötzkau in 1553 and Joachim I of Anhalt-Dessau in 1561, Bernhard and Joachim Ernest inherited their lands, which were merged into Anhalt-Zerbst (Karl only inherited Plötzkau, because he died before Joachim I). In 1562 Anhalt-Köthen was also merged into Anhalt-Zerbst after the death without issue of its last prince, Wolfgang. Bernhard made his residence in Dessau.
Marriage and issue.
In Dessau on 28 May 1565 Bernhard married Clara (b. Gifhorn, 1 January 1550 - d. Franzburg, 26 January 1598), posthumous daughter of Francis, Duke of Gifhorn. They had only one son:
Bernhard died without surviving male heirs and was succeeded by his brother Joachim Ernest, who became sole ruler of all the Anhalt territories.

Encoding Control Notation

The Encoding Control Notation (ECN) is a standardized formal language that is part of the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) family of international standards. ECN is designed to be used along with ASN.1, and each ECN specification (a coherent set of encoding definitions) is explicitly related to a particular ASN.1 specification (a coherent set of type definitions).
The ECN standard is published by both the ITU-T and the ISO, and is officially named "ITU-T Recommendation X.692 | ISO/IEC 8824-3, Information technology – ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Encoding Control Notation (ECN)"
ECN supports the formal specification of non-standard encoding rules for ASN.1 type definitions, and is intended to be used whenever it is necessary to use encodings that differ from those provided by standardized encoding rules such as BER or PER.
Uses of ECN.
An ASN.1 type has a set of abstract values. Encoding rules specify the representation of these abstract values as a series of bits. There are applications in which special encodings, different from those obtainable through any of the standard sets of ASN.1 encoding rules, are required. 
Here are some examples of possible situations that require some smaller or larger deviations from the standard encodings:
In the above cases and in many other similar cases, the combined use of ASN.1 and ECN makes it possible to create a full, formal specification of both abstract syntax (schema) and encodings. Encoders and decoders can then be automatically generated from the combined specifications. This is a significant factor in reducing both the amount of work and the possibility of errors in making interoperable systems. Another significant advantage of ECN is the ability to provide automatic tool support for testing. These advantages are available with ASN.1 alone when standardized encoding rules suffice, but ECN provides these advantages in circumstances where the standardized encoding rules are not sufficient.
Overview of ECN.
Concepts.
To understand how ECN works, it is useful to focus on four kinds of elements of the ASN.1 language: built-in types (e.g., codice_1 and codice_2), built-in constructor keywords (e.g., codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6), user-defined simple types (e.g., codice_7, codice_8), and user-defined complex types (e.g., codice_9). There are other aspects of ASN.1 that are also reflected in ECN, but we will not discuss them here.
The ECN language also has built-in types, built-in constructor keywords, user-defined simple types, and user-defined complex types. These elements of the ECN language are similar to those of ASN.1, but their names always begin with a codice_10. Officially they are called "encoding classes" but here we will simply call them "ECN types" and "ECN constructor keywords". Examples of ECN types are: codice_11 (built-in), codice_12 (built-in), codice_13 (simple user-defined), codice_14 (complex user-defined). Examples of ECN constructor keywords are: codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, and codice_18 (all built-in).
Unlike ASN.1, ECN allows the user of the language to define synonyms of ECN constructor keywords (e.g., codice_19). Therefore in ECN there are user-defined ECN constructor keywords as well as built-in ECN constructor keywords.
From the ECN viewpoint, every user-defined ASN.1 type occurring in an ASN.1 specification has a hidden ECN type implicitly associated with it. Officially this hidden ECN type is called an "implicitly generated encoding structure" but here we will simply call it the "hidden ECN type" of the ASN.1 type. Hidden ECN types are a special kind of user-defined ECN types (their ECN definition is automatically generated from a user-defined ASN.1 type rather than being provided by the user), but they behave like other user-defined ECN types.
The hidden ECN type of an ASN.1 type is almost identical to the original ASN.1 type (but slightly simplified) and is the starting point for an encoding process, specified in ECN, which ultimately generates the series of bits representing any given value of the original ASN.1 type. An ASN.1 type (or any of its parts) is not directly referenceable for the purpose of specifying an encoding in ECN, but its hidden ECN type is. ECN types and ECN constructor keywords can be explicitly referenced within an ECN specification and are encoded by applying the rules contained in the ECN specification.
Roughly speaking, an ECN specification does two things: it says how to modify a hidden ECN type to produce a new ("colored"; see below) hidden ECN type, and it says how an ECN type (as well as each of its components if it's a complex type) is to be encoded. The latter can be applied recursively, in the sense that an encoding step for a component of an ECN type may result in a further in-place modification of the remaining part of the ECN type that is being encoded. This process can go on through any number of cycles, until the final ECN type has been completely encoded, that is, all the bits representing the value of the original ASN.1 type have been generated.
Lastly we introduce the concept of "encoding object". This is a very important element of the ECN language, and refers to each individual encoding rule that is part of an ECN specification and is applied to an ECN type or ECN constructor keyword, either built-in or user-defined, occurring in the specification.
Mechanisms.
The first step of the encoding process is the automatic generation of hidden ECN types from all ASN.1 types present in the ASN.1 specification. The hidden ECN types corresponding to complex user-defined ASN.1 types can be modified by a mechanism called "coloring", which consists in replacing the names of the types of some of their components with synonyms. It is also possible to replace the ECN built-in constructor keywords (e.g., codice_15, codice_18) occurring in a hidden ECN type with synonyms. In ECN there are a few built-in synonyms for both constructor keywords and built-in types (e.g., codice_22 is a synonym of codice_15, codice_24 is a synonym of codice_11), but a user of the language can define both user-defined types and user-defined constructor keywords as synonyms of others. The purpose of the coloring step is to prepare a hidden ECN type for the next step, which is the encoding of its components, in case it is necessary to encode in a different way different occurrences of the same ECN type or different occurrences of the same ECN constructor keyword present in the hidden ECN type. For example, a complex hidden ECN type might contain two lists (codice_17), but one list is to be encoded by inserting a count field before the first item of the list, and the other is to be encoded by inserting a terminating pattern after the last item of the list. This can be done, for example, by replacing the first codice_17 keyword in the hidden ECN type with, say, codice_28, by replacing the second codice_17 keyword with, say, codice_30, and by declaring these two names as user-defined synonyms of the ECN constructor keyword codice_17. Once these two different constructor keywords have been included in the hidden ECN type, each of the two lists can be encoded with a different encoding object.
The second step of the encoding process is the application of an encoding object to a hidden ECN type. The value to be encoded will be one of the possible values of an ASN.1 type defined in the ASN.1 specification, and the encoding process will select the hidden ECN type of that ASN.1 type and will apply the appropriate encoding object to it.
There may be further steps consisting in the recursive application of encoding objects that work by replacing an ECN type (or part of it) with another ECN type.
In ECN there are several kinds of encoding objects. Some encoding objects completely determine the actual bit-level encoding of simple ECN types and are the easiest to understand. Others apply to ECN constructor keywords rather than to ECN types, and determine some structural aspects of the encoding of the complex ECN type (or part of it) constructed by an ECN constructor keyword (but do not specify its entire encoding). Others work by replacing an ECN type (or a part of it) with another ECN type, which must then be encoded by applying a different encoding object to it. 
The most important kinds of encoding objects in ECN are listed below:

The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated.

Courts of South Africa

The courts of South Africa are the civil and criminal courts responsible for the administration of justice in South Africa. They apply the law of South Africa and are established under the Constitution of South Africa or under Acts of the Parliament of South Africa.
Despite South Africa's division into nine provinces, the country has a single national court system. The courts are funded and supported by the national Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. The ordinary courts are the district and regional magistrates' courts, the provincial divisions of the High Court, and the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Constitutional Court is the highest court for constitutional matters.
Specialist courts have been established for various matters, including Labour Courts, the Land Claims Court, Special Income Tax Courts, and the Electoral Court. African customary law is administered by chiefs' and headmen's courts, subject to the Council of Traditional Leaders.
Constitutional Court.
The Constitutional Court is the final court of appeals for all matters relating to the Constitution of South Africa, and its decisions are binding on all other courts in South Africa. It has the power to make the final decision on the constitutionality of an act of Parliament or of a provincial legislature; while a High Court or the Supreme Court of Appeals may make an order declaring an act to be unconstitutional, the order does not come into effect until the Constitutional Court confirms it.
The Constitutional Court was established by the Interim (1993) Constitution and continued under the Final (1996) Constitution. The court has eleven judges; originally the chief judge was called the President of the Constitutional Court, but that title was changed to Chief Justice of South Africa by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has its seat on Constitution Hill in Johannesburg.
Supreme Court of Appeal.
The Supreme Court of Appeal is the court of last resort in all except constitutional matters; it hears only appeals. The court sits in Bloemfontein; the chief judge is called the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal. It has its origin in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa, which was established by the South Africa Act at the formation of the Union of South Africa.
High Court.
The provincial divisions of the High Court of South Africa have general jurisdiction over their defined areas. They hear appeals from the Magistrates' Courts within their area, and act as a court of first instance for cases outside the jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Courts. The present divisions of the High Court are:
The Limpopo Division at Polokwane and the Mpumalanga Division at Nelspruit are in the process of being established; until they are, the Gauteng Division also serves Limpopo and Mpumalanga. A local seat of the Limpopo Division at Thohoyandou is already in existence.
The origins of the High Court lie in the Supreme Courts of the four colonies (the Cape Colony, Transvaal Colony, Natal Colony and Orange River Colony) from which the Union of South Africa was formed; these became provincial divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa. On receiving nominal independence the bantustans of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei established their own Supreme Courts; when they were re-integrated into South Africa on 27 April 1994 these courts were given the same status as provincial divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa.
The 1996 Constitution renamed the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa, as well as the bantustan Supreme Courts, to High Courts. Since that time some changes have been made to rationalise the areas of jurisdiction of the courts; the courts have also been renamed in accordance with the names of the new provinces. The Superior Courts Act, 2013 restructured the High Courts into divisions of a single High Court of South Africa.
Magistrates' Courts.
The whole of the territory of South Africa is divided into approximately 350 magisterial districts, with each district having a District Magistrate's Court. These courts can hear civil cases where the value of the claim is no more than R100,000, and in criminal cases can impose a sentence of up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to R100 000. The magistrates districts are arranged into regions with each region having a Regional Magistrate's Court, which handles more serious criminal cases and can impose a sentence of up to 15 years imprisonment and a fine of up to R300 000. As of 2010 Regional Magistrates Courts can also handle civil cases where the value of the claim is no more than R300 000, as well as divorce cases.
Specialist courts.
Parliament has established specialist courts to handle specific areas of law or types of case. In some cases these courts have exclusive jurisdiction and the matters are excluded from the jurisdiction of the High Court and the magistrates' courts.
The Labour Court, which has status similar to a High Court division, deals with labour law and the relationship between employer, employee and trade union, in particular cases arising under the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Equity Act. The Labour Appeal Court has status similar to the Supreme Court of Appeal, and hears appeals from the Labour Court. There is no further appeal except on constitutional matters, in which case appeals may be heard by the SCA and the Constitutional Court.
The Land Claims Court, which has status similar to a High Court division, handles claims for restitution, or compensation in place of restitution, to people or communities dispossessed of land under racially discriminatory laws. It also deals with certain other cases involving agricultural labour tenants and other people who do not have secure rights to the land on which they live.
The Electoral Court, which has status similar to a High Court division, handles matters related to elections, and in particular appeals against decisions of the Independent Electoral Commission.
Tax Courts handle disputes between taxpayers and the South African Revenue Service over tax assessments.
Military courts.
Members of the South African National Defence Force are subject to the Military Discipline Code and the jurisdiction of the military courts. Minor military offences are dealt with in a disciplinary hearing by the commanding officer, who may impose penalties like fines, confinement to barracks, or extra duty. For serious offences, SANDF members are tried in a Court of a Military Judge or a Court of a Senior Military Judge. These courts consist of a legally-trained officer as judge and two officers or warrant officers as assessors. The judge decides questions of law, while the judge and assessors decide questions of fact by a majority vote. Certain offences (murder, rape, treason, culpable homicide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) may only be tried in the ordinary civilian courts.
Appeals from the military courts are to the Court of Military Appeals, which consists of a civilian judge or magistrate (or in some cases three civilian judges), a legally-trained military officer, and another officer with command experience. Rulings on this court may be taken on review to the civilian High Court (and subsequently to the Supreme Court of Appeal and Constitutional Court) only on the grounds of procedural unfairness or constitutional invalidity.

Jonas Variakojis (May 5, 1892 near Rinkuškiai, Lithuania – October 31, 1963 in St. Charles, Illinois, United States) was a Lithuanian army officer.
Variakojis was studying law at the University of St. Petersburg when he was mobilized into the Russian army and sent to the Austrian front during World War I. In December 1918 he returned to Lithuania and joined the newly organized Lithuanian army, preparing to defend Lithuania against the Red Army during the Lithuanian–Soviet War. Variakojis was ordered to organize defense of Panevėžys district. On February 7, 1919, he led the first Lithuanian battles against the Soviets near Kėdainiai. The Soviet advance was stopped, preventing them from capturing Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania.
Variakojis and his unit, which later evolved into the 4th Infantry Regiment, continued to combat the Soviets. They were also deployed against Poland during the Polish–Lithuanian War. For his distinguished services during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, he was awarded several military orders, including the Order of the Cross of Vytis. In 1926, he retired from active military duty. Between 1928 and 1930, he briefly served of Minister of Communications and Minister of Defense. At the end of World War II, he retreated to Germany and then immigrated to the United States, where he died in 1963.

Ganapur

Ganapur is a town in Banke District in the Bheri Zone of south-western Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 3,775 and had 735 houses in the town.
Government.
The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated.

Moel Maelogan "(shown on O.S. maps as 'Maelogen', and also sometimes spelled 'Moelogan')" is a hill (summit height 424m) on the western edge of Mynydd Hiraethog (also known as the Denbigh Moors) in north Wales, and overlooking the Conwy Valley. It is known mostly as the general location of a wind farm.
The initial 3 turbines were erected in 2002, and started generating in January 2003, each turbine capable of producing 1300kW. This scheme marked erection of the UK Wind Industry's 1000th turbine and was initially welcomed, as it had been set up by 3 local farmers to boost their incomes, under the company name of Cwmni Gwynt Teg ("Fair Wind"). After commissioning, however, it was not without its opponents, not least because, although not located in the Snowdonia National Park itself, the turbines are visible from many parts of it.
Of the 3 turbines, 2 were owned and operated by the local farming co-operative, the third was owned and operated by Energiekontor. Energiekontor UK Ltd, the UK subsidiary of the German wind development company Energiekontor AG, was instrumental in the finance and construction of the wind farm.
The electricity produced goes to the local Llanrwst sub-station 4.5km away, and is sold to the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency.
Under the project name of "Ail Wynt" (Second Wind), Cwmni Gwynt Teg planned a further 11 turbines but this was rejected. Despite further opposition an amended plan for an additional 9 turbines was passed, and erection and commission of these took place in 2008 "within a more compact area and at reduced height."
Cwmni Gwynt Teg won an Ashden Award in 2003 for their work on the wind farm.

Carter Heyward

Isabel Carter Heyward (born 1945 in North Carolina) is a lesbian feminist theologian, teacher and priest in the Episcopal Church - the province of the worldwide Anglican Communion in the United States.
In 1974, she was one of the Philadelphia Eleven, eleven women whose ordinations eventually paved the way for the recognition of women as priests in the Episcopal Church in 1976.
Academic career.
Heyward holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Randolph-Macon Woman's College (now Randolph College) in Virginia, the degree of Master of Arts in the Comparative Study of Religion from Columbia University, and that of Master of Divinity in Religion and Psychiatry from Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. She was awarded a PhD in 1980 for her work on redemption in the thought of two early Christian thinkers. She taught at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1975, and was Howard Chandler Robbins Professor of Theology there until she retired in 2006. The inaugural Carter Heyward Scholars Lecture was given at the college in her honour in October 2006. She received the Distinguished Alumni/ae Award from Union Theological Seminary in 1998.
Theology - the Nature of God.
Author of a number of books and numerous articles, Carter Heyward's most distinctive theological idea is that it is open to each of us to incarnate God (that is, to embody God's power), and that we do so most fully when we seek to relate genuinely to others in what she calls relationality. When we do this, we are said to be 'godding', a verb Heyward herself coined. God is defined in her work as 'our power in mutual relation'. Alluding to mainstream Christian views of God, Heyward has stated 'I am not much of a theist'. For her, 'the shape of God is justice', so human activity can, as theologian Lucy Tatman has observed, be divine activity whenever it is just and loving. In her book "Saving Jesus From Those Who Are Right", Heyward asserts that 'the love we make... is God's own love'. In Heyward’s work, God is therefore not a personal figure, but instead the ground of being, seen for example in compassionate action, which is 'the movement of God in and through the heights and depths of all that is'.
Theology - Jesus in Carter Heyward's thought.
Again in contrast to the more traditional Christian focus (on Jesus Christ as God incarnated as a redeemer), Heyward believes that 'God was indeed in Jesus just as God is in "us" - as our Sacred, Sensual Power, deeply infusing our flesh, root of our embodied yearning to reach out to one another'. This power works to change despair, fear and apathy to hope, courage and what Heyward terms 'justice-love'. But God's Spirit is not contained 'solely in one human life or religion or historical event or moment'. God was Jesus' relational power for 'forging right (mutual) relation, in which Jesus himself and those around him were empowered to be more fully who they were called to be'. Insisting on the God-incarnating power of all, Heyward observes that 'the human act of love, befriending, making justice is our act of making God incarnate in the world'. Interestingly, in her recent work she suggests that even the non-human creation may incarnate God, commenting that 'there are more faces of Jesus on earth, throughout history and all of nature, than we can begin even to imagine'. Not unrelated to this perception, Heyward founded the Free Rein Center for Therapeutic Horseback Riding and Education at Brevard, North Carolina, where she is an instructor
The task of theology.
A consequence of this dynamic view of God and Christ is that truth is evolving, not static. A hint of this can be seen in Heyward's approval of Dorothee Soelle’s remark that God's Spirit works through ‘revolutionary patience'. This leaves a certain openness to the church's work of proclaiming the truth of Christ: there is an insistence that 'we who currently constitute the Christian church are the temporary authors and guardians of "Christian truth". It is ours to determine and ours to tend'. So the theologian's task involves 'a capacity to discern God's presence here and now and to reflect on what this means', and is part of a communal effort and struggle to enable the flourishing of love and justice in a world where the potential for relationality is broken, often violently. The project of 'godding', or relationality, then, is an alternative to an authoritarian understanding of social/relational power, both inside and outside the church. Mutual relationship entails a willingness to participate in healing a broken world, and so is not (Lucy Tatman notes) a private or individualistic task.
Heyward sees her own task within this broader programme as working particularly for the expansion of the church to include people who have historically been left out. In short, the theologian's task is to help bring a greater measure of redemption to the world. Though that task is always concrete, the precise shape it takes depends on the exact ‘shape of the evil from which people need to be redeemed'. As a theological educator, Heyward's passion was to enable students to 'do theology at its roots' - connecting their everyday lives with those of others, past and present, like and unlike them, in order to bring about transformed lives capable of 'creating, liberating and blessing the world'.
Bibliography.
Heyward is the author of some eleven books, and has edited/contributed to a further three. She is the author of numerous scholarly and more mainstream articles. An appreciation of Heyward's work can be found in chapter five of Lucy Tatman's 2001 book "Knowledge That Matters: A Feminist Theological Paradigm and Epistemology" (London: Sheffield Academic Press).
Heyward was also the author of "When Boundaries Betray Us", which is notable for its focus upon how she fell in love with her psychologist, and her subsequent emotional disappointments.

Man's First Word

"Man's First Word" is a children's book illustrated by Carl Chaiet and written by Lynn Kearcher which was published in 2007. The reader follows Telford, a renowned lexicographer, and Earnest, his talking bird-butler, as they travel through the Atlas Mountains of Morocco in search of the origin of language.
Plot summary.
The story begins with Telford receiving a phone call from Billiam Pinch-Penny, an anthropologist at the local museum, regarding the discovery of a tablet of stone with Hieroglyphic carvings. It is unique in the fact that the people depicted have open mouths and appear to be attempting to speak. The tablet is a slab of Iguanastone, found only in the Atlas Mountains. Earnest notes that a piece has broken off, and Telford, Earnest and Billiam pack their bags for Morocco.
After a trip which leads them through London, France, and Spain, the trio eventually find themselves in Tangiers, where a local basketweaver suggests that they look for the broken piece in a small village in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains called Yackama. There, Earnest literally trips over what they are looking for, and they arrive at an answer to their question.

Australian State Coach

The Australian State Coach is an enclosed, six horse-drawn carriage used by the British Royal Family. The coach was presented to Queen Elizabeth II of Australia and the United Kingdom as the official gift on the occasion of the Australian Bicentennial on 8 May 1988. The coach was a gift from the Australian people and was designed and made by renowned coach builder W.J. Frecklington who subsequently built the State Coach Britannia for Queen Elizabeth II as a private initiative. The Australian State Coach is sometimes used at the British State Opening of Parliament and other state occasions involving the Australian or foreign royal families, such as the visit of Queen Margrethe of Denmark in 2000. As one of the most modern of the royal carriages, the coach is fitted with electric windows, heating and hydraulic stabilisers; it is therefore regularly used for such occasions. The Australian State Coach is usually kept at the Royal Mews, where it can be viewed by the public. 
The Australian State Coach was used to convey HRH The Prince of Wales, HRH The Duchess of Cornwall and Mr & Mrs Middleton from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace following the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge on 29 April 2011.
On 5 June 2012, the Australian State Coach was to be an alternative coach for the carriage procession back from Westminster Hall to Buckingham Palace for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, in case of rain. However Her Majesty decided that the weather was fit enough for the open top 1902 carriage to be used to carry The Queen, The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall.

Unfinished Business (song)

"Unfinished Business" is a song released by UK band White Lies on 28 April 2008 on 7" vinyl. It was limited to 500 copies. A re-recorded version of the song appears on their debut album "To Lose My Life...". The most obvious difference is that the album version does not feature the high-pitched backing vocals by bassist Charles Cave during the final chorus.
The single's B-side, "You Still Love Him", shares its chorus melody and lyrics with the song "One Night Friend". "One Night Friend" had previously been recorded by the band under their previous incarnation, Fear of Flying. During their 2009 European tour, White Lies began playing "You Still Love Him" live for the first time.
"Unfinished Business" was written in under fifteen minutes, and directly led to the band's later name change. Lyrically the song concerns a man trying to reconnect with his estranged girlfriend, only to realise that she has already killed him, and he is in fact now a ghost. He nevertheless still tries to "dance like we used to" before the "light in the distance" comes for him. 
"Unfinished Business" was notably covered by Mumford and Sons on Australian radio station Triple J on their segment 'Like a Version' and features on the sixth album of the segment's cover versions, alongside artists such as Regina Spektor, OK Go & Alexisonfire.
Music video.
Directed by Simon Green and recorded in Sheffield on 9 April 2008, the music video for "Unfinished Business" features the band performing the song on a dark stage while a silhouette of a pair of scissors passes slowly over them. The scene is interjected with black and white footage of a young woman acting out a dream sequence. The latter is shot in reverse.

<doc id="19079549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19079549" title="The Republic (Zeno)">
The Republic (Zeno)

The Republic () was a work written by Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoic philosophy at the beginning of the 3rd century BCE. Although it has not survived, it was his most famous work, and various quotes and paraphrases were preserved by later writers. The purpose of the work was to outline the ideal society based on Stoic principles, where virtuous men and women would live a life of simple asceticism in an equal society.
Content.
Written, it would seem, in conscious opposition to Plato's "Republic", Zeno's "Republic" ("politeia") outlined the principles of an ideal state written from the point of view of early Stoic philosophy. The work has not survived; but it was widely known in antiquity and more is known about it than any of his other works. Plutarch provides a summary of its intent:
It is true indeed that the so much admired "Republic" of Zeno, first author of the Stoic sect, aims singly at this, that neither in cities nor in towns we should live under laws distinct one from another, but that we should look upon all people in general to be our fellow-countryfolk and citizens, observing one manner of living and one kind of order, like a flock feeding together with equal right in one common pasture. This Zeno wrote, fancying to himself, as in a dream, a certain scheme of civil order, and the image of a philosophical commonwealth.
It is not obvious from Plutarch's remarks whether he had read the work himself. One person who had read it was an otherwise unknown figure known as "Cassius the Skeptic", whose polemic written against Zeno's "Republic" is paraphrased by Diogenes Laërtius:
Some, indeed, among whom is Cassius the Skeptic, attack Zeno on many accounts, saying first of all that he denounced the general system of education in vogue at the time, as useless, which he did in the beginning of his "Republic". And in the second place, that he used to call all who were not virtuous, adversaries, and enemies, and slaves, and unfriendly to one another, parents to their children, brethren to brethren. and kinsmen to kinsmen; and again, that in his "Republic", he speaks of the virtuous as the only citizens, and friends, and relations, and free men, so that in the doctrine of the Stoic, even parents and their children are enemies; for they are not wise. Also, that he lays down the principle of the community of women in his "Republic", and ... teaches that neither temples nor courts of law, nor gymnasia, ought to be erected in a city; moreover, that he writes thus about money: that he does not think that people ought to coin money either for purposes of trade, or of travelling. Besides all this, he enjoins men and women to wear the same dress, and to leave no part of their person completely covered.
Further on, Laërtius makes some further remarks which also seem to be from the same work by Cassius:
They say too, that the wise man will love those young men, who by their outward appearance, show a natural aptitude for virtue; and this opinion is advanced by Zeno, in his "Republic". And they also teach that women ought to be in common among the wise, so that whoever meets with any one may enjoy her, and this doctrine is maintained by Zeno in his "Republic", and by Chrysippus in his treatise on the "Republic", ... and then, they say, we shall love all boys equally after the manner of fathers, and all suspicion on the ground of undue familiarity will be removed.
These paraphrases by Cassius are not a neutral summary of the "Republic", his purpose seems to be to describe all the doctrines in the work which he found shocking. These include Zeno's denouncement of general education; his exhortation that only the virtuous can be regarded as true citizens; his view that men and women should wear the same clothes; and the idea that "women should be held in common," which in practice seems to have meant "recognizing no other form of marriage than the union of the man who lives freely with a consenting woman."
A few other statements from the "Republic" are preserved by other writers. We learn from Laërtius that Zeno stated that the wise man will marry and produce children, and several writers mention Zeno's view that there is no need to build temples to the gods, "for a temple not worth much is also not sacred, and nothing made by builders or workmen is worth much." Athenaeus also preserves a quote on the need for a city to be built on the principle of love:
And Pontianus said that Zeno of Citium thought that Love was the God of Friendship and Liberty and the author of concord among people, but nothing else. Hence, he says in his "Republic", that "Love is a God, who cooperates in securing the safety of the city."
Reception.
Zeno's "Republic" seems to have been viewed with some embarrassment by some of the later Stoics. This was not helped when Chrysippus, Zeno's most illustrious successor as the head of the Stoic school, wrote his own treatise "On the Republic" (probably a commentary on Zeno's work), in which (among many other things) he defended both incest and cannibalism. It is unlikely that Chrysippus urged the adoption of such behaviors; Chrysippus was probably responding to criticisms that in a society practicing free love, in which people often did not know who their relatives were, rare instances of incest would unintentionally occur; his discussion of cannibalism is probably connected with the Stoic contempt for dead bodies as an empty shell. Nevertheless, these points provided extra ammunition for those people who wished to attack both Zeno and Stoicism in general. Some blamed the influence which Crates of Thebes, the famous Cynic philosopher and teacher of Zeno, may have had when he wrote the "Republic": it was joked that Zeno "had written it at the tail of the dog." By the 1st century BCE, there was an attempt among the Stoics to downplay the involvement which Cynic philosophy had played in the development of early Stoicism; it was said that Zeno had been "young and thoughtless" when he wrote his "Republic". It was also said that "by Zeno things were written which they Stoics do not readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philosophers." Regardless of these views, it is clear that Zeno was one of the first philosophers in a long tradition begun by Plato of depicting an ideal society in order to understand ethical principles.

Although the song is, like the first single "Cynical", more grunge driven, it is one of the only songs on the record with some funk rock elements and influence.
As the band tried to fit into the grunge scene by changing their musical style, the album and the two singles released from it were commercial failures.

Dukinfield baronets

The Baronetcy of Dukinfield of Dukinfield, Cheshire was created in the Baronetage of England on 16 June 1665 for Robert Dukinfield, son of Colonel Robert Dukinfield.
The Dukinfield family were seated at Dukinfield, Cheshire from the early 14th century. Dukinfield Hall was demolished in about 1950.
Colonel Robert Dukinfield served in the army of the Commonwealth of England during the English Civil War and was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1625 and 1648 and Governor of Chester in 1650. Despite his father's loyalties, his son Robert was raised to the Baronetcy following the English Restoration and served as High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1675. His son the 2nd Baronet married the niece of Sir Samuel Daniel who bequeathed his estate at Over Tabley, Cheshire to William, 3rd Baronet, who by Act of Parliament changed his name to Dukinfield-Daniel. On his death the 3rd Baronet left all his estates to his daughter, through whom they passed to John Astley (1724-1787). The Baronetcy passed to the 3rd Baronet's cousin, 4th Baronet, and later to his cousin, the 5th Baronet.
Latterley the seat of the Baronetcy was at Stanlake House, Berkshire. The Baronetcy was extinct on the demise of the 7th Baronet.

Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith

Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith, born Hester Maria Thrale (17 September 1764 – 31 March 1857), was a British literary correspondent and intellectual. She was the eldest child of Hester Thrale, diarist, author and confidante of Samuel Johnson, and Henry, a wealthy brewer and patron of the arts. She became the second wife of George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith.
Childhood and education.
Johnson gave Hester Maria her lifelong nickname "Queeney" (after Queen Esther) early in her childhood, and was a regular correspondent of the little girl as well as of her mother. Queeney Thrale was born in Southwark, where her father's brewery was situated, and grew up mainly at the family home, Streatham Park in South London, which was the focus of an important coterie of political, artistic and literary figures known as the Streatham Worthies. She showed early signs of a good memory and sharp intellect, and by age six she was regarded as a greater prodigy than her intelligent and accomplished mother. She studied Latin with Dr Johnson, working alongside the novelist Fanny Burney, another family protegée, and also Italian and Hebrew. She was painted by Zoffany at 20 months, and she and her mother were the joint subjects of a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1781, as were other members of the Streatham park circle.
Queeney's early life and accomplishments were recorded in "The Family Book" and Thraliana, which Hester Thrale began on her eldest daughter's second birthday. "The Family Book" records Queeney's childhood and education, her grasp of languages, astronomy, geography and other subjects. Thraliana details her liking for the notorious Mad Jack Fuller, whose proposal of marriage was later rejected by her sister Susannah. Queeney's father died in 1781, and in 1784 Hester married her children's Italian music teacher, Gabriele Mario Piozzi, a Roman Catholic, causing public scandal and leading to a rift with her children. Hester Piozzi and her husband went abroad for more than two years after the marriage, and between July 1787 and March 1793 there was no communication between her and Queeney, who went on to make an independent London life for herself with a respectable widowed friend as chaperone.
Marriage and children.
On 10 January 1808, aged 44, Queeney Thrale married the widowed Admiral Lord Keith, a distinguished and celebrated senior Naval officer 19 years her senior who had amassed a considerable fortune from prize-money during the Napoleonic wars. They had met in 1791, four years after the death of Lord Keith's first wife, and corresponded for 16 years before their marriage. Lord and Lady Keith were a prominent and well-connected society couple: they had one daughter, the Hon Georgina Augusta, born in December 1809, and the baby's sponsors were the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Clarence, both future kings of the United Kingdom.
After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, Lord Keith retired from the Navy and the family lived mainly on their large estate at Tulliallan, where they had a magnificent castle constructed which is now the Scottish Police College. Left a wealthy widow when their daughter was 13, Lady Keith lived another 34 years, dying in Picadilly, London on 31 March 1857, aged 92. She is buried in the Keith family mausoleum with her husband and daughter.
The "Queeney letters", a large collection of letters addressed to Queeney by Johnson, Fanny Burney and her mother Hester was published in 1934.

Baden VI c

The first steam locomotives of the Baden Class VI c were delivered in 1914 by the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe for service in southwestern Germany with the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway ("Großherzoglich Badische Staatsbahn").
Design.
Their design benefited from experience with the Baden VI b steam engines, but they were a fundamentally different class with a superheater, new running gear with larger wheels and a longer, fixed wheelbase. The boiler was pitched higher, and the double steam dome was done away with along with its connecting pipe.
Service.
The Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway procured a total of 135 of these engines between 1914 and 1921 in nine batches. After the end of the First World War, 15 locomotives had to be given away to France and 13 to Belgium as part of the reparations required under the terms of the Versailles Treaty. The remaining 107 went to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The lighter units of the first seven series were grouped into DRG Class 75.4, the heavier vehicles with a reinforced locomotive frame of the last two series were designated as DRG Class 75.10-11. 
After the Second World War 66 Class VI c engines went into the Deutsche Bundesbahn, where they were stationed at various locomotive depots including Freiburg, Offenburg, Radolfzell, Singen, Waldshut, Karlsruhe and Villingen. In 1967 the last one serving with the Bundesbahn, number 75 1118, was retired. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany still had some of these engines working at that time.
Preserved.
Number 75 1118 is operated today by the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde ('Ulm Railway Friends') on the branch line from Amstetten to Gerstetten about 20 kilometres northwest of Ulm.

2009 World Championships in Athletics – Women's pole vault

The Women's Pole Vault event at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany was held between 15 August and 17 August 2009. Yelena Isinbayeva was the strong favourite prior to the competition, a position enhanced further by the withdrawal of 2008 Olympic silver medallist Jennifer Stuczynski. Anna Rogowska was the only athlete to beat Isinbayeva in the build up to the event. Fabiana Murer and Monika Pyrek had both registered strong season's bests but had suffered from indifferent form. European Indoor medallists Yuliya Golubchikova and Silke Spiegelburg rounded out the list of the season's highest jumping athletes.
In the qualifiers, the automatic progression mark of 4.60 m was not needed, as eleven athletes reached 4.55 m and Kristina Gadschiew progressed with 4.50 m. All four Russian athletes reached the final, as did all three vaulters of the host nation's team. Veteran American athlete and former world record holder Stacy Dragila closed her major championship career with a jump of 4.25 m, as she announced her intention to retire at the end of the season.
On the final day of the event, European Indoor champion Golubchikova was the first to experience disappointment, as a fall in the warm up left her unable to compete in the final. The Brazilian and British champions, Murer and Kate Dennison failed at the 4.65 m mark. Pyrek and American Chelsea Johnson passed that height on their first attempt, while Rogowska and home favourite Spiegelburg completed it on their second try. Rogowska was the only athlete to vault 4.75 m, at which point reigning champion Isinbayeva entered the competition. The Russian failed to clear the height and, after raising the bar, failed twice more and finished last in the competition.
Given that Isinbayeva had a season's best of 4.80 m, an opener of 4.75 m was a risky decision that back fired for the athlete, resulting in her first major championship loss since 2003 and her first ever non-medalling performance in international competition. Rogowska, who had beaten her at the London Grand Prix a month earlier, won her first gold medal at a major championships, breaking Isinbayeva's dominance of the event. Pyrek repeated her form of the 2005 Championships to take a silver medal along with Chelsea Johnson, a relatively unknown athlete competing at her first major championships. For the first time in history of World Championships in Athletics, two Polish athletes took gold and silver medal in the same event.

Environmental impact of nanotechnology

The environmental impact of nanotechnology is the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of nanomaterials will affect organisms and ecosystems.
Nanotechnology's environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment.
Nanopollution.
Nanopollution is a generic name for waste generated by nanodevices or during the nanomaterials manufacturing process. Ecotoxicological impacts of nanoparticles and the potential for bioaccumulation in plants and microorganisms is a subject of current research, as nanoparticles are considered to present novel environmental impacts. Of the US$710 million spent in 2002 by the U.S. government on nanotechnology research, $500,000 was spent on environmental impact assessments. 
The capacity for nanoparticles to function as a transport mechanism also raises concern about the transport of heavy metals and other environmental contaminants. Two areas of concern can be identified. First, in their free form nanoparticles can be released into the air or water during production, or production accidents, or as waste by-product of production, and ultimately accumulate in the soil, water, or plant life. Second, in fixed form, where they are part of a manufactured substance or product, they will ultimately have to be recycled or disposed of as waste.
Scrinis
raises concerns about nano-pollution, and argues that it is not currently possible to “precisely predict or control the ecological impacts of the release of these nano-products into the environment.” A May 2007 Report to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs noted concerns about the toxicological impacts of nanoparticles in relation to both hazard and exposure. The report recommended comprehensive toxicological testing and independent performance tests of fuel additives. Risks have been identified by Uskokovic in 2007. Concerns have also been raised about Silver Nano technology used by Samsung in a range of appliances such as washing machines and air purifiers.
Life cycle responsibility.
To properly assess the health hazards of engineered nanoparticles the whole life cycle of these particles needs to be evaluated, including their fabrication, storage and distribution, application and potential abuse, and disposal. The impact on humans or the environment may vary at different stages of the life cycle.
The Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that “manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure” (p.xiii). Reflecting the challenges for ensuring responsible life cycle regulation, the Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards has proposed standards for nanotechnology research and development should be integrated across consumer, worker and environmental standards. They also propose that NGOs and other citizen groups play a meaningful role in the development of these standards.
Environmental benefits of nanotechnology.
Energy.
Nanotechnology could potentially have a great impact on clean energy production. Research is underway to use nanomaterials for purposes including more efficient solar cells, practical fuel cells, and environmentally friendly batteries. The most advanced nanotechnology projects related to energy are: storage, conversion, manufacturing improvements by reducing materials and process rates, energy saving (by better thermal insulation for example), and enhanced renewable energy sources. 
Current commercially available solar cells have low efficiencies of 15-20%. Research is ongoing to use nanowires and other nanostructured materials with the hope of to create cheaper and more efficient solar cells than are possible with conventional planar silicon solar cells. It is believed that these nanoelectronics-based devices will enable more efficient solar cells, and would have a great effect on satisfying global energy needs.
Another example for an environmentally friendly form of energy is the use of fuel cells powered by hydrogen. Probably the most prominent nanostructured material in fuel cells is the catalyst consisting of carbon supported noble metal particles with diameters of 1-5 nm. Suitable materials for hydrogen storage contain a large number of small nanosized pores. 
Nanotechnology may also find applications in batteries. Because of the relatively low energy density of conventional batteries the operating time is limited and a replacement or recharging is needed, and the huge number of spent batteries represent a disposal problem. The use of nanomaterials may enable batteries with higher energy content or supercapacitors with a higher rate of recharging, which could be helpful for the battery disposal problem.
Water filtration and remediation.
A strong influence of nanochemistry on waste-water treatment, air purification and energy storage devices is to be expected. 
Mechanical or chemical methods can be used for effective filtration techniques. One class of filtration techniques is based on the use of membranes with suitable hole sizes, whereby the liquid is pressed through the membrane. Nanoporous membranes are suitable for a mechanical filtration with extremely small pores smaller than 10 nm (“nanofiltration”) and may be composed of nanotubes. Nanofiltration is mainly used for the removal of ions or the separation of different fluids. 
Magnetic nanoparticles offer an effective and reliable method to remove heavy metal contaminants from waste water by making use of magnetic separation techniques. Using nanoscale particles increases the efficiency to absorb the contaminants and is comparatively inexpensive compared to traditional precipitation and filtration methods.
Some water-treatment devices incorporating nanotechnology are already on the market, with more in development. Low-cost nanostructured separation membranes methods have been shown to be effective in producing potable water in a recent study.
Nanoscale iron particles have also shown potential as a detoxifying agent for cleaning environmental contaminents from brownfield sites.

Bentley Wildfowl and Motor Museum

The Bentley Wildfowl and Motor Museum is a visitor attraction at Halland, East Sussex, England. The site has a wildfowl collection a motor museum and the house and formal garden are all open to the public.
History.
The house at Bentley was bought by Gerald and Mary Askew in 1937 and following the Second World War the couple developed the house and garden and started a wildfowl collection. Two large Palladian rooms were added to each end of the original house. Following the death of Gerald Askew in 1970, Mary gave the nucleus of the estate to the people of East Sussex. Mary continues to live in part of the house and the site was developed as a tourist attraction. In 2004 due to increasing running costs the East Sussex Council offered to sell the property back to the Askew family for £1.25m or it would sell the property on the open market. Fortunately the Askews purchased the estate and placed it in the hands of a trust in order to ensure it remains open to the public for the foreseeable future.
Glyndebourne Wood.
The woods in the area a very important part of the park. The pigs live in sties here in the winter and several Iron Age huts have been constructed using timber from the surrounding trees and authentic traditional methods. There is a woodsman who maintains the ecosystem and annually a fantastic wood fair is held, where many woodland crafts, such as fire-making, are displayed. Craft days are often held and children's parties can be arranged. In the autumn carthorses are brought in to help with bringing in the timber. The forest is an important habitat for robins and many other songbirds, woodpeckers, common pheasants, deer and grey squirrels. The surrounding fields are a good habitat for moles (who leave behind a lot of hills) and rabbits. In order to reach the woods one can walk or take the small trains from the mini railway that links up the park to Glyndebourne Station.
Gardens.
The quiet, peaceful gardens are quite secretively located behind the house and include well laid ponds and statues of sphinxes. Songbirds and moorhens live in the gardens.
Wildfowl.
In 1962 influenced by the Sussex artist Philip Rickman and a visit to the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge the Askew's started a collection of wildfowl. A pond was dug in a nearby field which was poor agricultural land and the collection was started. The collection now has examples of 125 of the 147 species of wildfowl.
Motor Museum.
In 1982 a Motor Museum was opened on the site. It is not a collection as most of the vehicles are owned by private individuals and are on loan to the museum.

Societal impact of nanotechnology

The societal impact of nanotechnology are the potential benefits and challenges that the introduction of novel nanotechnological devices and materials may hold for society and human interaction. The term is sometimes expanded to also include nanotechnology's health and environmental impact, but this article will only consider the social and political impact of nanotechnology.
As nanotechnology is an emerging field and most of its applications are still speculative, there is much debate about what positive and negative effects that nanotechnology might have.
Overview.
Beyond the toxicity risks to human health and the environment which are associated with first-generation nanomaterials, nanotechnology has broader societal implications and poses broader social challenges. Social scientists have suggested that nanotechnology's social issues should be understood and assessed not simply as "downstream" risks or impacts. Rather, the challenges should be factored into "upstream" research and decision making in order to ensure technology development that meets social objectives
Many social scientists and organizations in civil society suggest that technology assessment and governance should also involve public participation
Some observers suggest that nanotechnology will build incrementally, as did the 18-19th century industrial revolution, until it gathers pace to drive a nanotechnological revolution that will radically reshape our economies, our labor markets, international trade, international relations, social structures, civil liberties, our relationship with the natural world and even what we understand to be human. Others suggest that it may be more accurate to describe change driven by nanotechnology as a “technological tsunami”. Just like a tsunami, analysts warn that rapid nanotechnology-driven change will necessarily have profound disruptive impacts. As the APEC Center for Technology Foresight observes:
If nanotechnology is going to revolutionize manufacturing, health care, energy supply, communications and probably defense, then it will transform labour and the workplace, the medical system, the transportation and power infrastructures and the military. None of these latter will be changed without significant social disruption.
Those concerned with the negative impact of nanotechnology suggest that it will simply exacerbate problems stemming from existing socio-economic inequity and unequal distributions of power, creating greater inequities between rich and poor through an inevitable nano-divide (the gap between those who control the new nanotechnologies and those whose products, services or labour are displaced by them). Analysts suggest the possibility that nanotechnology has the potential to destabilize international relations through a nano arms race and the increased potential for bioweaponry; thus, providing the tools for ubiquitous surveillance with significant implications for civil liberties. Also, many critics believe it might break down the barriers between life and non-life through nanobiotechnology, redefining even what it means to be human.
Nanoethicists posit that such a transformative technology could exacerbate the divisions of rich and poor – the so-called “nano divide.” However nanotechnology makes the production of technology, e.g. computers, cellular phones, health technology etcetera, cheaper and therefore accessible to the poor.
In fact, many of the most enthusiastic proponents of nanotechnology, such as transhumanists, see the nascent science as a mechanism to changing human nature itself – going beyond curing disease and enhancing human characteristics. Discussions on nanoethics have been hosted by the federal government, especially in the context of “converging technologies” – a catch-phrase used to refer to nano, biotech, information technology, and cognitive science.
Possible military applications.
Societal risks from the use of nanotechnology have also been raised. On the instrumental level, these include the possibility of military applications of nanotechnology (for instance, as in implants and other means for soldier enhancement like those being developed at the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies at MIT as well as enhanced surveillance capabilities through nano-sensors.
There is also the possibility of nanotechnology being used to develop chemical weapons and because they will be able to develop the chemicals from the atom scale up, critics fear that chemical weapons developed from nano particles will be more dangerous than present chemical weapons.
Intellectual property issues.
On the structural level, critics of nanotechnology point to a new world of ownership and corporate control opened up by nanotechnology. The claim is that, just as biotechnology's ability to manipulate genes went hand in hand with the patenting of life, so too nanotechnology's ability to manipulate molecules has led to the patenting of matter. The last few years has seen a gold rush to claim patents at the nanoscale. Academics have warned that the resultant patent thicket is harming progress in the technology and have argued in the top journal "Nature" that there should be a moratorium on patents on "building block" nanotechnologies. Over 800 nano-related patents were granted in 2003, and the numbers are increasing year to year. Corporations are already taking out broad-ranging patents on nanoscale discoveries and inventions. For example, two corporations, NEC and IBM, hold the basic patents on carbon nanotubes, one of the current cornerstones of nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of uses, and look set to become crucial to several industries from electronics and computers, to strengthened materials to drug delivery and diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are poised to become a major traded commodity with the potential to replace major conventional raw materials. However, as their use expands, anyone seeking to (legally) manufacture or sell carbon nanotubes, no matter what the application, must first buy a license from NEC or IBM.

The United States' essential facilities doctrine may be of importance as well as other anti-trust laws.
Potential benefits and risks for developing countries.
Nanotechnologies may provide new solutions for the millions of people in developing countries who lack access to basic services, such as safe water, reliable energy, health care, and education. The United Nations has set Millennium Development Goals for meeting these needs. The 2004 UN Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation noted that some of the advantages of nanotechnology include production using little labor, land, or maintenance, high productivity, low cost, and modest requirements for materials and energy.
Many developing countries, for example Costa Rica, Chile, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia, are investing considerable resources in research and development of nanotechnologies. Emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India and South Africa are spending millions of US dollars annually on R&D, and are rapidly increasing their scientific output as demonstrated by their increasing numbers of publications in peer-reviewed scientific publications.
Potential opportunities of nanotechnologies to help address critical international development priorities include improved water purification systems, energy systems, medicine and pharmaceuticals, food production and nutrition, and information and communications technologies. Nanotechnologies are already incorporated in products that are on the market. Other nanotechnologies are still in the research phase, while others are concepts that are years or decades away from development. 
Applying nanotechnologies in developing countries raises similar questions about the environmental, health, and societal risks described in the previous section. Additional challenges have been raised regarding the linkages between nanotechnology and development.
Protection of the environment, human health and worker safety in developing countries often suffers from a combination of factors that can include but are not limited to lack of robust environmental, human health, and worker safety regulations; poorly or unenforced regulation which is linked to a lack of physical (e.g., equipment) and human capacity (i.e., properly trained regulatory staff). Often, these nations require assistance, particularly financial assistance, to develop the scientific and institutional capacity to adequately assess and manage risks, including the necessary infrastructure such as laboratories and technology for detection.
Very little is known about the risks and broader impacts of nanotechnology. At a time of great uncertainty over the impacts of nanotechnology it will be challenging for governments, companies, civil society organizations, and the general public in developing countries, as in developed countries, to make decisions about the governance of nanotechnology. 
Companies, and to a lesser extent governments and universities, are receiving patents on nanotechnology. The rapid increase in patenting of nanotechnology is illustrated by the fact that in the US, there were 500 nanotechnology patent applications in 1998 and 1,300 in 2000. Some patents are very broadly defined, which has raised concern among some groups that the rush to patent could slow innovation and drive up costs of products, thus reducing the potential for innovations that could benefit low income populations in developing countries.
There is a clear link between commodities and poverty. Many least developed countries are dependent on a few commodities for employment, government revenue, and export earnings. Many applications of nanotechnology are being developed that could impact global demand for specific commodities. For instance, certain nanoscale materials could enhance the strength and durability of rubber, which might eventually lead to a decrease in demand for natural rubber. Other nanotechnology applications may result in increases in demand for certain commodities. For example, demand for titanium may increase as a result of new uses for nanoscale titanium oxides, such as titanium dioxide nanotubes that can be used to produce and store hydrogen for use as fuel. Various organizations have called for international dialogue on mechanisms that will allow developing countries to anticipate and proactively adjust to these changes.
In 2003, Meridian Institute began the Global Dialogue on Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks (GDNP) to raise awareness of the opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for developing countries, close the gaps within and between sectors of society to catalyze actions that address specific opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for developing countries, and identify ways that science and technology can play an appropriate role in the development process. The GDNP has released several publicly accessible papers on nanotechnology and development, including "Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks - Closing the Gaps Within and Between Sectors of Society"; "Nanotechnology, Water, and Development"; and "Overview and Comparison of Conventional and Nano-Based Water Treatment Technologies".
Social justice and civil liberties.
Concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations. The majority of nanotechnology research and development - and patents for nanomaterials and products - is concentrated in developed countries (including the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and France). In addition, most patents related to nanotechnology are concentrated amongst few multinational corporations, including IBM, Micron Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This has led to fears that it will be unlikely that developing countries will have access to the infrastructure, funding and human resources required to support nanotechnology research and development, and that this is likely to exacerbate such inequalities. 
Producers in developing countries could also be disadvantaged by the replacement of natural products (including rubber, cotton, coffee and tea) by developments in nanotechnology. These natural products are important export crops for developing countries, and many farmers' livelihoods depend on them. It has been argued that their substitution with industrial nano-products could negatively impact the economies of developing countries, that have traditionally relied on these export crops.
It is proposed that nanotechnology can only be effective in alleviating poverty and aid development "when adapted to social, cultural and local institutional contexts, and chosen and designed with the active participation by citizens right from the commencement point" (Invernizzi et al. 2008, p. 132).

James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange

James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange (1716–1771) was commonly known by that title, though neither he nor his father had any claim to it. He was the eldest son of Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby, whose predecessor's heirs had used that courtesy title, but the right to two successive baronies Lord Strange (being baronies by writ) had descended to daughters, when the earldom had passed to the heir male. 
James Stanley married Lucy daughter and coheir of Hugh Smith of Weald Hall, Essex, and took the additional surname Smith on his marriage. This marriage produced Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby and several other children, including Thomas Stanley (1753–1779). He died before his father, so that the earldom passed straight to his son. 
He attended Westminster School where he was friends with the future soldier and politician John Burgoyne who later married his sister.
Political Service.
Lord Strange was a Member of Parliament for Lancashire from 1741 until his death. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the ministry of Lord North from 1762 and became a Privy Councillor at the same time.

The IKE Group is a research group at the Department of Business Studies, Aalborg University, Denmark and is central part of the Danish Research Unit for Industrial Dynamics (DRUID) founded in 1995 by the IKE Group and scholars from the Department of Industrial Economics and Strategy, Copenhagen Business School. The coordination of this research group has been in the hands of Bengt-Åke Lundvall.
More recently, the IKE Group has been the main architect behind GLOBELICS - a network of scholars who apply the concept ‘systems of innovation and competence building’ as their analytical framework. The groups is also among the central members in the DIME Network of Excellence funded by the European Commission.
The IKE Group does research on economic, technical and institutional change. The main research themes include economic evolutionary modelling, theory of the firm, national systems of innovation, international trade and competitiveness and the interplay between economic and ecological issues.
Research Themes.
The focus of the research group is on innovation, knowledge and economic dynamics at different levels of aggregation. Common for the approach is that economic development is seen as knowledge driven and that knowledge creation and innovation are seen as reflecting processes of interactive learning within systemic frameworks. The group has made major contributions to the innovation system and the learning economy concepts. The main four research themes are:
1. Knowledge, innovation and regional dynamics
2. Economic development in the globalising learning economy
3. Competition, organisational change and economic transformation
4. Economics of knowledge, innovation and evolution
Certain issues such as financing of innovation, innovation indicators and innovation policy are central to the research program as a whole and cut across the themes.
Teaching.
Besides research is the IKE-group involved in teaching in the following English spoken master programs:
1. Msc. Innovation, Knowledge and Economic Dynamics (MIKE-E)
2. Msc. Innovation, Knowledge and Entrepreneurial Dynamics (MIKE-B)
3. The European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology ESST

State-transition matrix

In control theory, the state-transition matrix is a matrix whose product with the state vector formula_1 at an initial time formula_2 gives formula_1 at a later time formula_4. The state-transition matrix can be used to obtain the general solution of linear dynamical systems. It is also known as the matrix exponential.
Overview.
Consider the general linear state space model
The general solution is given by
The state-transition matrix formula_8, given by
where formula_10 is the fundamental solution matrix that satisfies

While the state transition matrix φ is not completely unknown, it must always satisfy the following relationships:
And φ also must have the following properties:
If the system is time-invariant, we can define φ as:
In the time-variant case, there are many different functions that may satisfy these requirements, and the solution is dependent on the structure of the system. The state-transition matrix must be determined before analysis on the time-varying solution can continue.

<doc id="19079805" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19079805" title="Biblical Creation Society">
Biblical Creation Society

The Biblical Creation Society (BCS) is a United Kingdom-based creationist organisation founded in 1977 by Scottish minister Nigel M. de S. Cameron and a group of evangelical students, who were concerned about the popularity of theistic evolution among conservative Christians, but were repelled by the "wholly negative" attitude of the Evolution Protest Movement. Although inspired by the scientific creationism of John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris (authors of "The Genesis Flood"), it refused to limit its membership to only Young Earth creationists, and in its name rejected American attempts to separate scientific creationism from its Biblical roots (a separation rendered unnecessary by the lack of constitutional barriers to teaching creationism in the United Kingdom). The organisation is based in Rugby, Warwickshire.
Overview.
The Society's formal doctrinal basis is the same as that of Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF). However, it has published a manifesto setting out further teachings about creation which the society holds as essential in order to be faithful to the Bible.
The Society's website states that it offers "a range of articles on very diverse subjects - but all seeking to show that the Bible provides a solid foundation not only for our understanding of origins but also for every aspect of life." The BCS publishes a journal, "Origins" (formerly "Biblical Creation"), two or three times a year.
The British Centre for Science Education, which opposes the teaching of creationism in UK schools, acknowledges that the Biblical Creation Society "appears to be the second largest of the UK's dedicated creationist organisations" and "has some very highly educated members and associates".
Prominent members.
Its first president was Edgar H. Andrews, Emeritus Professor of Materials at Queen Mary, University of London, where he was a long-serving head of department and later Dean of Engineering. He is described by historian of creationism Ronald Numbers as the United Kingdom's "most respected creationist scientist of the late twentieth century", a Reformed Baptist, and a convert to since the 1960s. However, he rejected some elements of their views, particularly dogmatic acceptance of a young Earth (even going so far as to suggest that the first day of creation "might be of indefinite length").
Another prominent member, David C. Watts (Professor of Biomaterials Science at the University of Manchester), went even further in diverging from the American view, described giving primacy to the question of the age of the Earth a "great mistake" and admitted the possibility that life existed before the Edenic creation. His views slowly moved to progressive creationism.
Debates on the creation–evolution controversy.
The Society or its officers have been invited to represent the creationist case when the Creation–evolution controversy is debated in the UK. In the 1986 the Society's President, Edgar Andrews, represented the BCS in a debate at the Oxford Union, seconded by A. E. Wilder-Smith. Their proposition was "That the Doctrine of Creation is more valid than the Theory of Evolution". They lost the debate, to Richard Dawkins and John Maynard Smith who opposed this proposition, by 198 to 115 votes.
David Tyler represented the Society in a live television debate with journalist Francis Beckett on "BBC Breakfast," on the teaching of intelligent design in school science lessons, in February 2005.
Disagreements with other Christian groups.
The Society has supported conferences organised by evangelical churches. However, not all evangelicals or Christians agree with their position. Some members of the Research Scientists' Christian Fellowship (who do not individually or collectively identify themselves as "creationist" but which, as one of the professional groups of the UCCF, held to the same Doctrinal Basis as the BCS) met with members of the BCS to identify their points of disagreement. This meeting resulted in the publication of eight questions to the BCS on the application of Biblical authority to the question of evolution.
In 2006 the prominent creationist group Answers in Genesis posted a page disputing the 'Recolonisation Theory' and accusing its supporters of "compromison the truth of Scripture". The Committee of the BCS responded stating that the accusation was against "several members of BCS (who are also contributors to "Origins")", that BCS "donot take a collective position on the Recolonisation Model", but that labelling them as "compromisers" was unjustified, and that placing it "alongside 'articles on compromises of Scripture such as the Gap Theory, the Framework Hypothesis, Theistic Evolution and Progressive Creation' is totally unwarranted."

I'm That Chick

"I'm That Chick" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, included as a track on her eleventh studio album, "E=MC²" (2008). Written by Carey, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor E. Hermansen, Johntá Austin, Rod Temperton, and produced by the former three, the song draws influence from soul, pop and disco music genres. "I'm That Chick" features a strong bass-line, and heavy disco-flavored production, and incorporates a sample of Michael Jackson's "Off the Wall". The song's lyrics finds the protagonist describing a relationship with their lover, as well as all the good qualities they can offer him. Additionally, the song features Carey wooing her significant other with a positive description of herself, while repeating 'I'm that chick you like'.
At the time of the album's release, "I'm That Chick" was met with acclaim from music critics, and was considered one of the album's highlights. Several reviews complimented the song's strong disco-driven melody and sample, while others concentrated on Carey's lyrics. The song charted due to strong digital downloads in the United States during the debut week of "E=MC²", and as a result, peaked at number 82 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Though not released commercially as a single, Carey performed the song live a select number of times, notably on "Good Morning America", as part of a three-piece outdoor concert, the 2008 Fashion Rocks ceremony, the "The Hills" season premiere party, and "Canadian Idol".
Composition.
"I'm That Chick" is a fast-paced song, which features a "care-free feel", and draws influence from soul, pop and disco music genres. The song incorporates a sample from Michael Jackson's "Off the Wall", and features a strong thumping bass-line and hand claps. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described it as a "late-night disco-bass groove", and highlighted its production as the album's finest. The song was written by Carey, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor E. Hermansen, Johntá Austin, Rod Temperton, and produced by the former three. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by W.B.M. Music Corporation, "I'm That Chick" is set in common time with a tempo of 79 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C-sharp minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Bm7–Am7–Gmaj7 Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist describing a relationship with their lover, as well as all the good qualities they can offer him, while repeating 'I'm that chick you like". Critic Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News described the song's production and lyrics in detail:
'I'm That Chick' ups the ego ante, but as she demonstrates with some silly lyrics ("la da da ooowee") and a funky disco beat (benefiting from an 'Off the Wall' melody sample), she's not taking any of it seriously. At least we hope she's not serious when she compares herself to Tupac and Biggie, then ice cream and the lottery, as she softly taunts, 'You're fiending to blaze up and taste me'. 
Reception.
"I'm That Chick" garnered positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented its disco influence, as well as the inclusion of the "Off the Wall" sample. Writing for the "Idaho Statesman", Jeffrey Ross described the song as a "sinewy stomper", while "The Advocate"s Sara Levy called it "irresistible". Rashon Ollison from "The Baltimore Sun" complimented the song's production and vocals, writing " a warmly melodic midtempo number with a smart, understated vocal from Carey." Journalist for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), Svein Terje Torvik wrote "'I'm That Chick' is well-oiled discopop and one of the few tracks that give a certain pulse." "The News & Advance"s Melissa Ruggieri described "I'm That Chick" as "a soul-disco thumper that will play equally well in the skating rink or a downtown club", while Sarah Rodman from "The Boston Globe" credited it as "the album's best track". Joey Guerra from the "Houston Chronicle" felt the "Off the Wall" sample helped the track "come to life", and described its production and incorporation of the sample as "breezy". Nick Levine, writing in for Digital Spy described "I'm That Chick" as "irresistible disco candy", while Anne Donahue of Reuters felt it was a "fun song". During its opening week, "I'm That Chick" charted at number 82 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Live performances.
On March 25, 2008, Carey was featured as the special guest performer at "The Hills" season premiere party, an event marking the start of a span of ten episodes airing in between season three and four. Carey, dressed in a black dress and gold jacket, performed "Touch My Body", "I'm That Chick" and "We Belong Together", before exiting the stage to a standing ovation. After the performance, Carey received strong praise from the program's cast members, with Lauren Conrad saying "I've always been a huge Mariah fan, and she's just so beautiful and talented', while Whitney Port and Audrina Patridge referred to Carey as "an amazing singer", while claiming to have listened to her music from a young age. On April 25, 2008, Carey opened the "Good Morning America" "Summer Concert Series" with a live performance in Times Square. Carey, wearing a pink mini-skirt, began the set with "Touch My Body" in front of thousands of fans. During the song, Carey's backing vocals began to malfunction, causing it to repeat phrases and play during her main vocal moments. In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem, she substituted part of the lyrics for "stop singing my part now baby", and completed the final chorus. She continued on with "I'm That Chick", and completed the three-song set-list with her follow-up single, "Bye Bye". 
After marking the album's stateside launch with her appearance on "Good Morning America", Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs. She began with an interview on the British radio station, BBC Radio 1, and continued onto a live rendition of "Touch My Body" and "I'm That Chick" on "T4". On July 22, 2008, Carey was announced as one of the performers at the 2008 Fashion Rocks ceremony. At the event on September 6, 2008, the event opened with a live performance of "Just Stand Up", a charity single in which Carey partook alongside several notable female musicians such as Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé and Rihanna. After the ladies completed the song, Carey came onto the stage wearing a long silver and black gown, and performed "I'm That Chick" alongside several male dancers, opening the song with a spontaneous a cappella of the track's chorus to positive critical response. A writer from "Marie Claire" complimented the performance, describing the rendition as "true glamtastic Mariah style". A few days later, Carey reprised her performance of "I'm That Chick" on "Canadian Idol", alongside previous chart-topping single, "We Belong Together".
