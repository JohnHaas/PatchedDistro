It is also noted for a collection of rare fossilized animals, similar to horses, that were found in a farmer's field in 1999, and subsequently transferred to one of Jaszcew's only public buildings and main sources of income, the local café/post office.

Back Home (Merle Travis album)

Back Home is the original LP reissue of Merle Travis's first album, "Folk Songs of the Hills" (1947), with four previously unreleased tracks and a new cover. This seminal album marked a new turn in Travis's career, bringing his Kentucky-style fingerpicking and down-home vocal stylings to the attention of a broad public of country and folk music enthusiasts at the onset of the American folk music revival. Together with another Capitol release the following year, "The Merle Travis Guitar", it introduced the style of guitar playing that came to be known, in simplified form, as Travis picking. The album includes a selection of traditional country songs such as "John Henry", "Muskrat", "Lost John (from Bowling Green)", "Barbara Allen", and Travis' signature gospel song, "I Am a Pilgrim". Also included are the original compositions "Dark as a Dungeon" and "Sixteen Tons". All songs are introduced by a spoken narrative.
This was Travis' first LP to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, rather than electric. The cover shows a grist mill powered by a water wheel, a main source of energy "back home" before the arrival of electricity.
In his autobiography Johnny Cash says about this album: “If I had to answer that old but still interesting question, ‘What music would you want with you if you were stranded on a desert island?’, I’d say the Freewheelin’ would have to be on the list. So would Merle Travis’s Down Home, which has “Sixteen Tons” and all those other great songs on it and was the first country concept album (Ride This Train was the second).” Although Cash can’t remember the exact title of the album, it’s clear that he talks about "Back Home".

Up the Creek (1958 film)

Up the Creek is a 1958 British comedy film written and directed by Val Guest which starred David Tomlinson, Peter Sellers, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries.
Plot synopsis.
Lieutenant Humphrey Fairweather, a well-meaning but accident-prone naval officer with a passion for rockets, is posted where he can (so the navy hopes) cause no further damage. He is given command of a mothballed Royal Navy vessel, HMS "Berkeley", which has had no Commanding Officer for several years. She is moored at a wharf on the Suffolk coast near the (fictional) village of Meadows End.
He discovers that the ship is woefully under strength and is forced to contend with the schemes of his bos'n, Chief Petty Officer Dogerty (Sellers). He and the crew are running several profitable businesses, including a same-day laundry, selling naval rum and cigarettes to the local pub, the "Pig and Whistle", and making pies and pastries for sale to the villagers. They also keep pigs and hens.
After the naive Fairweather is innocently drawn into the enterprises, he is politely blackmailed into covering for them. But when an Admiral makes a surprise inspection, the story eventually comes out. Whilst angrily haranguing them, Admiral Foley accidentally launches Fairweather's experimental rocket, and the ship is sunk.
Because of Fairweather's impeccable connections at the Admiralty, and because the Berkeley was Admiral Foley's first command, Fairwather is not court-martialed. Instead, he is promoted to Lt-Commander and posted to Woomera to continue his rocketry research, accompanied by Susanne, the attractive French girl he has met at the pub. The ship's crew are posted to another ship, HMS "Incorruptible".
Much of the film was shot at Weymouth harbour.
According to an interview with Val Guest (included on the DVD issue of the film), "Up the Creek" was the first starring film role for Sellers, at the time known only for radio and short television sketches. Guest was only able to obtain his services by also including established comedy film star, David Tomlinson.
A sequel "Further Up the Creek" was released later in the same year, with Frankie Howerd replacing Peter Sellers.

Nowa Słupia

Nowa Słupia is a village in Kielce County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Nowa Słupia. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has an approximate population of 1,600.
Nowa Słupia, which in the past was known as Słup and Słupia Nowa, has a long and rich history, and used to be a town from 1351 to 1869. The village is located in the Swietokrzyskie Mountains, at the foothills of Lysa Gora, the second highest peak of the mountains. Nowa Słupia borders Swietokrzyski National Park. The village, which is a junction of three regional roads (751th, 753rd and 756th), is a starting point of several tourist trails.
In the 13th and 14th centuries, Nowa Słupia belonged to the Święty Krzyż Benedictine Abbey, and at that time the village was called Słup. In 1351, due to efforts of Benedictine abbots, King Kazimierz Wielki granted town charter to Slup. The new town’s name was changed into Słupia Nowa, to distinguish it from the nearby village of Słupia, which now is called Stara Słupia. Słupia Nowa developed as a center of services for pilgrims, who headed to Swiety Krzyz. Among the pilgrims, was King Wladyslaw Jagiello. In 1405, Słupia received a privilege for weekly fairs. The town prospered in the period known as Polish Golden Age, and in 1578 it had 21 workshops with a mill.
Until the Partitions of Poland, Nowa Słupia remained within Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town then briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1819, the Swiety Krzyz Abbey was closed, which resulted in decline of the town. In 1869, following the January Uprising, Nowa Słupia was reduced to the status of a village, together with several other locations in northern Lesser Poland. Before World War II, the village had the population of 3,350, and was part of Kielce Voivodeship. In 1929, almost whole village burned in a fire. During the war, Nowa Słupia was an important center of the Home Army and other anti-German organizations. In July 1943, Germans pacified the village, murdering 200 residents.
Currently, Nowa Słupia is a tourist center, with Mieczyslaw Radwan Museum of Old-Polish Steel Mills, opened in 1960. Every year, a festival called Dymarki Swietokrzyskie (Holy Cross Bloomeries) is organized here in mid-August, at an open air museum, Archeological - and Cultural Center. One of major local points of interest is the so-called Stone Pilgrim (Kamienny pielgrzym), a stone figure of a kneeling man, located near main entrance to the National Park. According to a legend, the figure once was a vain knight, who went on a pilgrimage to the abbey. Upon hearing the sound of the bells, he stated that they tolled in his honor, for which he was punished and turned into stone. The figure moves towards the summit at a pace of one grain of sand a year, and it will reach the top at the end of the world. Nowa Słupia also has the St. Lawrence parish church (1678).

History.
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). 
IHS initially served the aerospace industry. Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products.
In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. 
IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. 
In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.

Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association

The Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) is an organization that represents teachers in publicly funded Roman Catholic schools in Ontario, Canada. It is an affiliated with the Ontario Teachers’ Federation, the Canadian Teachers’ Federation and Education International. While the CTF in general is not affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress, OECTA directly affiliates itself with it as well as the Ontario Federation of Labour.
OECTA has more than 45,000 members . Its mandate includes both the support of its members through the promotion of Catholic values, advocacy, collective bargaining, professional development & protection, and advocacy for the common good.
OECTA holds an annual meeting to elect officers, pass resolutions, and to amend its constitution, by-laws, policies, and procedures. The Provincial Executive meets on a monthly basis to administer the Association between annual meetings and to coordinate relations with the Ontario Teachers' Federation. A Council of Presidents representing all OECTA units meets three times per year (additionally at the call of the Provincial President) to advise the Provincial Executive, approve the association's bargaining objectives, and set the association's budget.
History.
"Source: OECTA website, October 2013"
OTF and OECTA are Born
In 1943 there were four provincial teachers' organizations: the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF), organized in 1919; the Federation of Women Teachers' Associations of Ontario (FWTAO), organized in 1918; the Ontario Public School Men Teachers' Federation (OPSMTF), organized in 1921, and L'Association des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO), organized in 1939. The Ontario Teachers' Council established by the first three groups had for some time been studying the possibilities of a teaching profession act which would require that all teachers in tax-supported schools belong to a provincial professional organization to be known as the Ontario Teachers' Federation. A draft of the proposed act was drawn up and circulated among the teachers of the province. The Ottawa Catholic teachers' executive found that the draft gave the province's Catholic teachers the choice of becoming members of OTF through one of the three groups in the Ontario Teachers' Council or of forming a new group. 
The Department of Education sent out ballots to all Catholic teachers asking them to vote on the two alternatives. Ottawa consulted the executive of AEFO, and the two decided it would be advisable for both to join the Ontario Teachers' Federation, representing all Catholic teachers in the province.
Fearing that many English Catholic teachers might not know of the proposal to form an English Catholic teachers' association, the Ottawa organization sent explanatory letters to principals and teachers, urging them to vote for a Catholic teachers' group. The result of this vote was conclusive and convinced the Department of Education that in addition to OSSTF, FWTAO and OPSMTF, the proposed act would have to make provisions for all teachers in Ontario's separate schools.
Expansion Begins
A meeting of diocesan delegates took place on February 18, 1944, in Ottawa, attended by teachers from Windsor, London, Belleville, Kingston, Toronto, Peterborough, Pembroke, Cornwall, Alexandria and Ottawa. Dr. F. J. McDonald and Inspector C. P. Matthews of Kingston were present to lend their support and Reverend Vincent A. Priester, executive director of the Ontario English Catholic Education Association, represented that group. Delegates decided unanimously that an English Catholic teachers' association should be formed with membership open to all English speaking Catholic teachers, those without Ontario certificates to be classed as associate members. A provisional executive was chosen to hold office until Easter when a provincial meeting would be held. The first executive consisted of Margaret Lynch of Windsor, president; Mother Marie Therese, IBVM of Toronto, first vice-president; F. J. McElligott of Pembroke, second vice-president; Brother Stanislaus of London, third vice-president, and Cecilia Rowan of Ottawa, secretary.
Establishing the provincial executive was a timely step: a few weeks later the Department of Education asked OECTA to send a delegate to a Toronto meeting to discuss a fourth unit. The president, Margaret Lynch, delegated Reverend L. K. Poupore, OMI of St. Patrick's College, Ottawa, to attend representing the English Catholic teachers of the province. He was also commissioned to hold talks with the representative of L'Association desenseignants franco-ontariens, Mr. Roger St. Denis. They finally agreed to join OTF as two independent Catholic groups, AEFO and OECTA, since the members of AEFO did not wish to lose their identity as bilingual teachers. 
Until 1968, OECTA and AEFO each had only five governors on the OTF board, unlike the other three affiliates who each had 10, for a total of 40 governors. In 1968, the English Catholic and French teachers increased their representation to 10 governors each as a result of expansion in their school systems in the late sixties.
These successful negotiations led Father Poupore to serve as chairperson of the legislation committee of OECTA from 1944 to 1952, as chairperson of the OTF legislation committee during the first year of its existence and for a second time in 1951-52. The Teaching Profession Act passed in June1944, did not mention OECTA because it had not yet been incorporated: that was achieved on September 8, 1944.
OECTA's first provincial meeting was an outstanding success: more than 600 English Catholic teachers crowded the Royal York Hotel in Toronto for two days at Easter. The large attendance, the keen interest of delegates, and their spirit of co-operation proved that all English Catholic teachers in Ontario agreed on the need for a provincial organization. Margaret Lynch had guided the preparation of OECTA's first constitution. Copies were mailed out before the meeting to just over 20 people - the total mailing list. 
At the general meeting, delegates adopted the constitution which has formed the basis of all further revision and amendments. They ratified the temporary appointments and created the office of treasurer to which they elected Mary Prunty of Toronto. On the second day, delegates agreed to the creation of 19 districts and set their boundaries. During the next 18 years, only four districts were added and few changes were made to the original boundaries.
The Early Years
The association was fortunate in its choice of first president. Margaret Lynch's organizing ability, legal mind and sound judgment carried the infant organization through its first trying year. It was also a demanding year for the secretary, Cecilia Rowan. At the time of the first general meeting there were only three Catholic teacher organizations, in Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor. The lay teachers of Toronto were well organized and most of the women had affiliated with the FWTAO. Only lay teachers in Windsor were organized. The Ottawa local had existed for many years but was also composed only of lay teachers, and was not affiliated with any outside group.
During 1946-47 Father B. W. Harrigan was elected president of OTF. He had attended the first OECTA meeting and had always taken an active part in proceedings at annual conventions and at meetings of the board of directors. In 1951-52 OECTA again provided OTF with a president, Dorothea McDonell. In 1950 Eva Deshaw was elected to represent all separate school teachers on the Superannuation Commission. When Sister Mary Lenore became president of OECTA and later assumed the presidency of OTF, it settled a thorny question once and for all: a sister could be elected to high office in her professional organization.
OECTA officially came of age in 1949 when a full-time secretary, Marion Tyrrell, was appointed. A year later, the association moved to Federation House on Prince Arthur Avenue in Toronto. Then in June 1960, the office, with a staff of five, rented space at 1260 Bay Street.
OECTA Matures
The OECTA's silver anniversary year witnessed a membership of approximately 14,000, a secretariat staff of six and an office staff of 13. To mark the silver anniversary, the provincial association provided certificates of recognition for presentation at the district level to all retired members and to all those with 25 years or more of teaching experience.
In 1973 the Association's second full-time director, Mary C. Babcock retired. OECTA paid a special tribute to her at its annual meeting, as did His Holiness by way of the Bene Merenti Papal Medal in recognition of her significant contribution to Catholic education. Her successor, Frank Griffin, assumed the directorship in a period characterized by the large number of serious issues faced by all members of the association.
In July 1975, after a period of unprecedented turmoil marked by mass resignation, The School Boards and Teachers Collective Negotiations Act (Bill 100) became law, providing legislation for the negotiations process and giving teachers the right to strike. As the 70s concluded and the 80s began, a myriad of issues - economic restraints, declining enrollment, surplus of teachers, back-to-basics trends, aging teacher population, teacher stress and burnout - were the focus for much association activity.
At the end of 1981, OECTA's third full-time director, Frank Griffin retired after making a memorable contribution to the Association. In his 16 years he witnessed tremendous growth not only in membership, but in professional maturity and scope of involvement. Among the achievements of the period which gave him most satisfaction were Bill 100 giving teachers the right to strike, the creation of the Qualifications Evaluation Council of Ontario (QECO), the establishment of the religious education courses and the provision in Bill 82 for Catholic schools to teach students with developmental disabilities.
Father J. Frank Kavanagh, OMI, assumed the executive director's position in 1981. A former president of OECTA and OTF, Father Kavanagh had worked effectively for years on committees developing the Catholic community's position on extension of the separate school system to Grade 13. Under his leadership, the Association grew in membership and faced new issues of increasing complexity. In 1984, the celebration of the organization's 40th anniversary was a time to reflect on the past, and to contemplate and be challenged by the future.
Completion Achieved
On June 12, 1984, after opposing the extension of public funding to Catholic schools for more than a decade, Ontario Premier William Davis announced: "Therefore, it is the Government's intention to permit the Roman Catholic school boards to establish a full range of elementary and secondary education and, as part of the public system, to be funded accordingly." Bill 30 would extend funding to Grade 13 in the separate schools of the province. The extension of public funding received the support of the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals and the New Democrats.
The Challenge Continues
One of the first acts of Bob Rae's New Democratic Party government, elected in 1990, was to create the Teacher Pension Partnership between OTF and the Government of Ontario. 
In the fall of 1990, James Carey left his position with OTF to become OECTA's general secretary when Father Kavanagh retired. A provincial past president of OECTA, he assumed leadership of an organization of just over 30,000 members. He was "on deck" in 1990 when Mary Babcock, retired OECTA director, became the first woman and teacher to receive the Medal of Honour from the Catholic Education Foundation of Ontario for outstanding contributions to Catholic education in Ontario.
Although the 90s saw the beginning of financially difficult years, OECTA continued to serve the separate school teachers of Ontario. In 1991, an agreement signed by OECTA and the Ontario Catholic Occasional Teachers' Association allowed occasional teachers to become members of OECTA, whose membership then rose to over 35,000. Collective bargaining strategists were asked to find "creative" solutions as the provincial government and school boards cried poor. For the first time in many years, the council of presidents in June 1992 considered major cutbacks as it faced the task of striking a balanced budget.
At the end of the 1992-93 school year, Premier Bob Rae introduced the "Social Contract" to reduce government debt. OECTA entered into discussions to protect the negotiated settlements of local units and the teachers' pension plan. As late as June 1995, negotiators throughout the province still faced uphill battles as they tried to recover the financial ground lost through government's freeze of teachers' salary increments.
Despite these hardships, members discovered reserves of energy and hope to celebrate the association's 50th anniversary in 1993-94. There was much to celebrate. Although the struggle for fair funding of separate schools continued, the association now boasted 60 units and 88 branch affiliates with some 32,000 statutory members. AGM 1994, held in Ottawa, OECTA's birthplace, provided the occasion for a gala celebration recognizing half a century of devotion to the welfare of Catholic teachers in Ontario.
To complete its golden anniversary year, the association moved to acquire a permanent home. At AGM 1992, delegates had voted to establish a building fund by diverting money from the reserve fund in order to purchase a permanent home for OECTA within five years. Several units had also purchased buildings. A special council of presidents meeting on December 3, 1994 voted to buy the premises at 65 St. Clair East which the association now occupies. The official blessing by the Most Rev. M. F. Ustrzycki, DD took place on February 3, 1995.
New Government - New Challenges
The election of a majority Conservative government on June 8, 1995 presented the association with a new set of challenges. Led by Mike Harris, the provincial government promised to preserve funding for education in the classroom while reducing costs by eliminating the so-called fat in the system. Teachers did not have long to wait to understand the scope of proposed government cuts. Junior Kindergarten, Grade 13 (OAC), Adult Education were among threatened programs. Teachers in all publicly funded schools across the province feared for the future of the educational system and for their jobs.
As the extent of the government's debt reduction plans became clearer, the education sector and the labour movement forged new links to fight sweeping lay-offs and cuts to social programs. OECTA organized a Rally for Education at Queen's Park on January 13, 1996 which attracted some 37,000 demonstrators in an historic peaceful display of opposition to the government's policies and its vision for Ontario. Successful days of protest organized by the Ontario Federation of Labour, which OECTA had joined in 1995, started in London on December 11, and moved on to Hamilton on February 23-24 when 100,000 turned out for the largest demonstration in Canadian history, to Kitchener on April 19, and Peterborough on June 24. As the 1995-96 school year drew to a close, members had become aware of the magnitude of the struggle to change the direction of government policies. Led by Claire Ross, who succeeded James Carey as general secretary on January 1, 1996, the association was gearing up for the fight.
The 1997 Political Protest
The rallying cry "We won't back down" from a song by Tom Petty which punctuates the video produced by OECTA to continue the momentum of its successful Queen's Park Rally became the theme of 1996-97. The Conservative government's second year in power challenged OECTA and the other affiliates of the Ontario Teachers' Federation with a constant barrage of "crises" demanding quick yet thoughtful responses.
Throughout the province, the effort to regain ground lost during the three years of the Social Contract absorbed the energy and attention of most units. Although only the Brant elementary branch affiliate was forced to resort to a full strike, many units achieved new contracts only on the eve of walk-outs. By June 30, 1997 all OECTA branch affiliates with settlements had managed to buy back the increment through grueling negotiations.
At the provincial level, OECTA worked with traditional and new partners against the provincial government's attacks on the public sector and on labour. Late in April, after a filibuster failed to prevent the passage of Bill 103 creating the "Megacity" of Toronto, the Conservative government rammed through Bill 104, the Fewer School Boards Act, which amalgamated the 129 school boards in the province, creating 66 regional boards. Opposition to the new law flooded in from all sides - from school boards, trustees, parent organizations and all affiliates of OTF. Despite the groundswell of anger roused by the bill, the government majority ensured its passage. The Education Improvement Commission created by the new law immediately set to work to effect changes in the province. OTF and all affiliates except AEFO launched a court challenge of the commission's claim of jurisdiction in areas usually reserved for collective bargaining.
Rumours about the provincial government's plans to overturn teachers' collective bargaining rights multiplied throughout the spring and summer, as the Harris government postponed the introduction of this legislation from month to month. However, another piece of legislation, Bill 136, the Public Sector Transition Stability Act, showed which way the wind was blowing by proposing to wipe out the bargaining rights of public employees whose workplaces are merged. As a member of the Ontario Federation of Labour, OECTA joined other unions from the private and public sectors to mount a Common Front against Bill 136. At the same time, the association, along with OTF devoted considerable resources to planning the response to what was anticipated to be an attempt to turn back the clock on teachers' hard-won bargaining rights.
Local presidents, called to a special meeting of OECTA's council of presidents barely a week after the start of the 1997-98 school year, were in no doubt that the Harris government was set to launch an all-out attack on teachers and the education system. At the end of the summer, the Ministry of Education and Training had revealed to OTF and the five affiliates its legislative plans - Bill 160 - to control every aspect of teachers' working conditions and to centralize power over education spending at Queen's Park. As Marshall Jarvis, who had succeeded Marilies Rettig as OECTA president on July 1, 1997, told the council, "The government attack on our profession will set in motion the greatest mobilization of teachers in the history of this province."
While education minister John Snobelen proclaimed, "I don't believe there's a possibility of a strike," the affiliates and OTF continued to organize their membership for a province-wide shut-down of schools if the government did not retreat from the position set out in the new legislation. By September 19, under pressure from the teaching profession, labour and concerned citizens, the government had promised some significant changes to its plans, including retaining principals and vice-principals within the federations, maintaining the existing teacher federation structure, and teachers' right to strike. However, Bill 160, the so-called Education Quality Improvement Act remained a devastating attack on Ontario's education system. By repealing Bill 100, the School Boards and Teachers Collective Negotiations Act, by stripping school boards of their power to tax, by seizing control of local spending and opening collective agreements, the provincial government was intent on extracting hundreds of millions of dollars from the education system - even if it meant reducing it to narrow mediocrity.
Over the next few weeks, tens of thousands of teachers rallied to the fight against Bill 160. From Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, to Hamilton's Copps Coliseum, to Red Lake, Moosonee and Sault Ste. Marie, rallies and all-affiliate meetings everywhere drew crowds of educators, and growing numbers of parents and other Ontarians opposed to the Harris government's policies which many were calling anti-democratic.
By the third week in October, it was obvious that the province would not change key elements in Bill 160. A cabinet shuffle earlier in the month had replaced John Snobelen as education minister, but his successor, Dave Johnson, was proving just as obdurate. On Wednesday, October 23, word went out to all OTF members in the province: a province-wide political protest shutting down all schools would start on Monday, October 27, if last-ditch talks with the minister failed.
The talks went nowhere, despite Justice Charles Dubin's attempt to mediate. Picket lines were in place early Monday morning, and with few exceptions, 126,000 teachers in Ontario's publicly funded schools joined the political protest, the largest work-stoppage in North American history. Spirits were high as public backing for teachers grew, despite the closed schools. Support from Ontario's bishops, from the Ontario Federation of Labour and its many member unions, from parent groups and from the general public inspired OECTA members and their OTF colleagues to keep up the struggle. The decision by Justice James MacPherson not to grant the government's request for an injunction to stop the protest encouraged teachers to renewed efforts. MacPherson refused to say the protest was illegal, noting that the issues raised by Bill 160 are very serious, placing it "on a plane very close to the Charter."
With no end to the protest in sight, the government reacted vindictively. Just six weeks after announcing that principals and vice-principals could stay within teachers' federations, it reversed itself, declaring they were out as of January 1, 1998. During negotiations held at a secret location, government officials rejected teachers' proposals on key issues such as instructional time and class size. Talks broke down on Tuesday night, November 4. Faced with the government's total unwillingness to compromise on any issue, OECTA members remained committed to the protest, flooding their provincial office with thousands of phone calls insisting that schools stay closed.
On November 6, FWTAO, OPSTF and AEFO announced that their members would return to work on Monday, November 10. Local presidents of OECTA and OSSTF decided over the weekend that their members too would return to work on November 10.
Thousands of teachers rallying at Queen's Park in the fall of 1997 were dismayed by government's lack of respect for the teaching profession.
Teachers' return to school did not mean an end to the campaign against Bill 160. The protest had exposed the real agenda behind the bill: to facilitate government efforts to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from education. The revelation that the performance goals of the deputy minister of education included additional cuts of $667 million to elementary and secondary schools convinced many doubters that financial motives were driving the government's reform plans.
The political protest had won unprecedented backing from the public, despite the inconvenience of closed schools. In order to build on this public support, OECTA immediately developed a range of new strategies to fight the Harris government. In an attempt to influence the Legislature, the association promised a constitutional challenge of the new funding provisions in the bill, and committed itself to joining OTF's court challenge of the provisions affecting principals and vice-principals. Members supported parents' apple-green ribbon campaign for publicly funded education and continued to picket the constituency offices of Conservative MPPs. Despite all these efforts, the Conservative majority at Queen's Park ensured the passage of Bill 160 on Monday, December 1.
New Political Action
The ferment of political activity continued nevertheless. OECTA set its sights on the next provincial election, in the hope of ensuring a pro-education legislature. In a campaign it dubbed "Seize the Day," the association encouraged members to join a political party and work to elect pro-education candidates in their areas. The campaign included forging links to a wide variety of groups including labour councils and social justice organizations. Political action was to take many forms, including flying picket squads, a boycott of businesses supporting only the Tories, and a report card to track cuts to education.
Although perhaps less visible than its political activities in 1997-98, OECTA's work on behalf of the professional and personal interests of its members continued apace. Government initiatives such as secondary school reform, standardized testing, the province-wide elementary school report card, and the introduction of new curricula kept the association on its toes. The work of relatively new players in education such as the Ontario College of Teachers, the Education Improvement Commission and the Evaluation Quality Assessment Office challenged the association to develop productive relationships with these institutions in order to protect teachers, their students - the whole education system.
The 1998 Annual General Meeting confirmed members' support for the policies and actions of their provincial leaders. Soon after, however, these leaders faced new hurdles which set the tone for the association's efforts over the next few months. The courts upheld the government's removal of principals and vice-principals from their federations, a judgment OTF soon decided to appeal. Then, on March 25, Minister of Education and Training Dave Johnson released the long-awaited new funding model for education. It confirmed OECTA's worst fears by placing all education funding in provincial hands, and imposing cuts in many areas including junior kindergarten, adult education, school administration and maintenance. School boards throughout the province quickly began to sound the alarm over financial shortfalls. Many boards signaled their intention to strip teachers' collective agreements in order to cope with the budgetary constraints imposed by the new funding formula.
OECTA'S Constitutional Challenge of Bill 160
The hearings into OECTA's legal challenge of the Education Quality Improvement Act (Bill 160) began June 17, 1998 in Toronto. OECTA argued that Bill 160 contravenes the Constitution Act of 1867 which guarantees Roman Catholics the right to exclusive management and control of separate school boards, by abolishing the right of Roman Catholic school boards to tax separate school supporters and by transferring the power to control and direct separate school expenditures to the Minister of Education and Lieutenant Governor-in-Council.
The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently upheld the right of separate schools to tax their supporters as part of the bundle of protected rights and privileges under s.93(1) of the Constitution Act. By depriving separate school boards of their governance rights, the government has undermined separate school supporters' right to govern their own schools.
Now, local boards have lost their decision-making authority and are limited to implementing directives from Queen's Park. The provincial government alone sets the mill rate, fixes the spending ceiling, allocates funds to boards on a line by line basis, and controls curriculum. As a result, separate school boards are effectively managed by non-Catholic outside majority interests.
On July 22, 1998, Justice Peter Cumming of the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) ruled that Bill 160 violates the constitutional right of the Roman Catholic community to tax with respect to denominational schools. The Court agreed that "Inherent to the right of a separate school system is the right of management and control." The Court further held the right to tax is a stand-alone right protected by s.93 which is necessary to guarantee the autonomy of a separate, denominational school system by preserving the independent right to finance the system.
The guarantees to proportional funding and enhanced funding provided by Bill 160 are not sufficient to meet the Government's constitutional obligations, said Judge Cumming. "The Government's approach makes the Roman Catholic community hostage to the provincial government as to the extent of financing of the separate school system. Theoretically, the provincial government could slash funding substantially to the point that the Roman Catholic community held the view that there was inadequate funding in providing the educational opportunity sought by them for their children. However, so long as there was proportional funding and consequential equality of educational opportunity with the public system there would be no independent means to enhance the financial resources of the separate school system."
As a result of Mr. Justice Cumming's ruling, Bill 160 was declared unconstitutional and of no force and effect to the extent that it relates to or affects separate school supporters' right to raise taxes with respect to denominational schools. OECTA immediately called for substantial changes in the Ontario government's education reforms in both publicly funded school systems.
However, OECTA did not oppose the request made by the provincial government on August 13, 1998 to delay restoring education powers to the Catholic community while the province appealed the court decision. The association recognized that a piecemeal implementation of the court's decision would not serve the best interests of the students or the entire system.
During four days of hearings in November 1998, the Ontario Court of Appeal listened to the government's arguments that funding equity as provided by Bill 160 satisfies the constitutional requirements of s.93 of the Constitution Act. OECTA continued to argue that, while equity is important, the right to tax is essential to protect the core constitutional value granted in 1867 - the right to separateness - and that it makes real the right of separate school trustees to manage and govern their educational system. The hearings before the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded on November 19, 1998.
On April 27, 1999 the judges of the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the ruling by Mr. Justice Peter Cumming that Bill 160 violated the rights of Catholics in Ontario. In essence, the Appeal Court said that what counts is not the ability to raise taxes, but the fact that separate schools are being funded fairly by the province under Bill 160. Catholics never had the right to tax, just the right to fair funding, the judges said.
In OECTA's opinion, the ruling meant that the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association which had sided with the government in defending Bill 160, had lost the long-term battle to protect Ontario's Catholic school system. The trustees' pact with the government based on their having 'put in abeyance' their right to tax in exchange for equitable funding now had no legal foundation, since the court had declared that the right to tax was non-existent.
OECTA immediately decided that it must seek leave from the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal the Court of Appeals ruling. "If the Appeal Court decision is allowed to stand, a Catholic mini-system could be all that's left of our present separate school system," said OECTA president Marshall Jarvis. "The mini-system is the core protected value, not the system as a whole. The government could decide that if religious education courses are offered together with certain other Catholic trappings such as school chaplains, the obligation of government to meet its constitutional test is satisfied."
Bargaining Under Bill 160
During the fall of 1998, OECTA faced major bargaining challenges as a result of Bill 160 and the government's inadequate funding formula for education. Catholic school boards took a very aggressive approach to bargaining, unilaterally changing terms and conditions of employment. OECTA refused to work under such changes. As a result, three units went out on strike while another four were locked out for refusing to bend to the will of the employer. For the first time in OECTA's history, the provincial government intervened in collective bargaining, legislating teachers back to school under Bill 62.
Under the back-to-work legislation, unresolved matters were referred to government-appointed arbitrators compelled by law to consider boards' self-described ability-to-pay when they made their decisions. In all cases that went to arbitration, the arbitrator decided in the boards' favour. The arbitrators described themselves as constrained by the new system to give the employers what they wanted. As a result, regressive working conditions were imposed. OECTA members in these Catholic school boards struggled under heavy workloads while major curriculum reforms were occurring at both the elementary and secondary levels.
Not surprisingly, school boards that had imposed the heaviest workloads in the province began to see an exodus of secondary teachers from their schools as members found jobs in boards offering more favourable working conditions. In the case of the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board this led to discussions which produced an agreement in late March 1999 that secondary teachers there would return to their desired 6/8 workload in September 1999, stemming the outflow of teachers to other boards. However, across the province bargaining continued to be an uphill battle, although teachers' increased mobility under the Ontario Labour Relations Act and the teacher shortage slightly eased the struggle to preserve working conditions that OECTA had negotiated over several decades.
Election Fever Hits Ontario
Ontarians who heard the Conservatives promise tax cuts and increased spending on education and health care in the budget presented on May 4, knew they were witnessing the kick-off of an election campaign. So they were not surprised the next day when Premier Mike Harris announced an election for June 3.
Since the publication of its political action strategy, Seize the Day, in March 1998, OECTA had vigorously engaged in creating new alliances with labour, anti-poverty groups and parent organizations. Along with other labour groups and the Ontario Teachers' Federation, the association adopted a strategic voting policy designed to topple the government of Mike Harris. They targeted the ridings of vulnerable Tory incumbents in order to elect a Liberal or New Democrat, parties seen to be pro-people and pro-education. OECTA committed substantial human and financial resources to campaign activities, including television, radio and billboard advertising across the province. On June 3, 1999 Ontario residents gave Premier Mike Harris a second straight majority government. 
Harris Continues Anti-Education Agenda
OECTA president Jim Smith, who had taken office on July 1, 1999, welcomed members back to work in September with the message that the labour peace prevailing among teachers in Catholic schools would help them focus on their students. He described the mood as one of "cautious optimism," noting that the new Minister of Education, Janet Ecker, had sent positive signals about building a constructive relationship with teachers. For their part, hundreds of OECTA members who had taken advantage of the newly created Summer Institutes, a partnership between OTF and the province offering professional development opportunities, returned to their classrooms with renewed (and contagious) vigour.
Optimism quickly turned to dismay, however, when Premier Mike Harris reaffirmed his election promise to impose a written test of competence on all teachers, starting in June 2000. The struggle against "teacher testing" permeated the whole year. Opposition to the provincial government's plan united stakeholders in the English Catholic educational community who endorsed a framework for professional learning developed by OECTA which included voluntary professional development and ongoing classroom evaluation of teachers by their boards. OECTA vigorously lobbied the Ontario College of Teachers and the Ministry of Education on behalf of this framework. In April, when the college released its report, Maintaining, Ensuring and Demonstrating Competency in the Teaching Profession to the Ministry of Education, the association was relieved to see that it too recommended performance review rather than testing of certified teachers. By mid-April, a showdown over teacher testing seemed inevitable, with the Harris government lined up against the teaching profession's governing body in addition to OTF and all its affiliates.
Cuts to Education Funding
Dismay turned to outrage in November when a leaked cabinet document revealed how the provincial government planned to cut a further $800 million from the education system. Premier Mike Harris refused to deny the possibility of further cuts, citing administrative fat and the need for "more resources in the classroom."
Against this backdrop of growing disillusionment, units and provincial collective bargaining staff undertook negotiations which delivered some positive results. Secondary school teachers in Hamilton, Dufferin-Peel and Huron-Superior endorsed agreements which, among other provisions, provided wage increases while maintaining the 6/8 workload.
Unfortunately, OECTA's successes in collective bargaining did not go unnoticed at the Ministry of Education. Before the AGM in March, when high school teachers in the Brant Haldimand-Norfolk Catholic District Board ratified a settlement that also gave them 6/8, ministry officials pressured trustees not to ratify the deal negotiated by board negotiators. Soon after, OECTA filed charges against the Government of Ontario and the school board under the Labour Relations Act, alleging that government representatives interfered directly in the negotiations process, and that the board had not bargained with teachers in good faith.
The week before AGM found Minister of Education Janet Ecker in Durham, where she told a meeting of parents and school board officials that before the next school year, she intended to ensure students' right to extra-curricular activities and to define more narrowly the meaning of instructional time. Elsewhere in the province, Premier Harris mused out loud that extra-curricular activities should be compulsory for teachers.
Those provocative comments caused teachers' rumblings of dissatisfaction and anger to boil over during the first minutes of AGM. An overwhelming majority of delegates voted to tell the minister of education, who was scheduled to address the meeting later that morning, to stay away.
In the first week of April, the provincial government followed up its vague threats with the publication of Program/Policy Memorandum 125, narrowly defining instructional time in secondary schools. The new definition was designed to eliminate teaching positions from the secondary panel by ensuring only regular, credited programs were counted in each teacher's weekly 1250 minutes of instructional time. On-calls and unscheduled time spent on remediation or advising students, were out.
Despite PPM 125, OECTA and the public secondary school teachers' federation decided it was business as usual in bargaining. Their success at the table convinced the ministry only weeks after the introduction of PPM 125, that this administrative measure was unequal to the task of thwarting the unions' negotiators. As a result, the ministry introduced Bill 74, the Education Accountability Act, on May 10.
The new legislation changed the Education Act to require that secondary school teachers teach 6.67 eligible courses a year; that school boards provide co-instructional (usually called extra-curricular) activities and teachers be required to participate. The new act gave principals the authority to assign the so-called co-instructional activities, "on school days and on days during the school year that are not school days; during any part of any day during the school year; on school premises and elsewhere." It gave the province more authority to ensure board compliance, including the so-called Henry VIII clause which deprives those targeted of their right to recourse to the courts.
Bill 74 provoked anger and opposition from a wide variety of groups in- and outside education circles. The Ontario Association of Social Workers, the Ontario Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of London questioned the motivation and the lack of democratic principle underlying the bill. OTF called for its withdrawal, while the Canadian Teachers' Federation condemned it. Trustees, principals and supervisory officers said it would damage the education system. Even the Toronto Sun, a newspaper usually sympathetic to the Harris government, thoroughly criticized the law.
Surprised, perhaps, by the broad dissatisfaction with Bill 74, the minister of education introduced amendments to soothe some of the sting of its most controversial clauses. Under these amendments, the regulations on compulsory extra-curricular activities for the elementary and secondary panels are now separate, and will receive royal assent only when the government requests it when a group of teachers opts for work-to-rule as a collective bargaining strategy. In addition, the hours devoted to extra-curricular activities by a teacher must be consistent with those previously volunteered.
Describing the amendments as "a sword over teachers' heads," OECTA president Jim Smith and other opponents of Bill 74 continued to demand its withdrawal. Meanwhile, the province continued to interfere in bargaining, rejecting a staffing plan put forward by the Toronto secondary teachers who remained convinced it met government standards.
Bill 74 was adopted by the Ontario Legislature on June 20. Jim Smith warned that OECTA would not tolerate contract-stripping by boards tempted to take advantage of the new legislation by imposing changes not required by law. As the summer began, the prospects for peace between teachers and the Harris government had never seemed dimmer.
In many schools across the province, extra-curricular activities disappeared as teachers faced with increased workloads chose to forego these voluntary activities. The Education Improvement Commission (EIC) acknowledged the widespread unrest in its final report, released in December. The commission identified a positive climate for learning as a key to students' success and recommended that the minister of education set in motion an appropriate strategy to resolve the labour unrest.
The provincial government responded on January 11, 2001 by creating an advisory group consisting mainly of Tory supporters who were asked to recommend measures to ensure students had improved access to extra-curricular activities. Much to the surprise of most observers, the group took an independent tack in its recommendations. It agreed that extra-curricular activities should remain voluntary, urging the government to withdraw the un-proclaimed sections of Bill 74 that make teachers' participation in these activities mandatory.
Promising to restore extra-curricular activities, the minister of education announced new initiatives to give school boards greater flexibility to address teachers' concerns. The measures included more money for school boards' local priorities, permission to vary class sizes at the secondary level and a redefinition of instructional time. Unfortunately, as details of the government's strategy began to emerge, it became clear that the changes proposed would not lighten the workload enough to make a difference.
To cap off the year, the minister of education introduced Bill 80, the Stability and Excellence in Education Act. This omnibus bill, which also instituted the new teacher testing scheme, made it compulsory for teachers and school boards to sign three-year contracts. Meanwhile, the province insisted it would only provide education funding one year at a time. The teacher re-certification portion of Bill 80 requires teachers to complete 14 courses in each five-year cycle to maintain their right to teach. After passage of the bill, the details of the testing program - for example, the cost and location of the courses - remained to be fleshed out, although 40,000 randomly selected teachers were supposed to start the first five-year cycle in September 2001. As the school year ended, there were rumblings from a number of teacher federations that their members might refuse to comply with the new re-certification policy.
OECTA Loses Constitutional Challenge
During the fall, lawyers for OECTA prepared for the Supreme Court hearing of the Association's constitutional challenge of Bill 160. At the hearing which took place on November 8, 2000, OECTA argued that Bill 160, the Education Quality Improvement Act, threatens minority denominational rights because it gives exclusive control over funding for the separate school system to the Ontario cabinet. On March 8, 2001 the Supreme Court released its ruling which stated that the Harris government acted within its rights when it centralized power over education through Bill 160. The bill does not violate the constitutional rights of Ontario Catholics to control their own school system, said the court. While disappointed in the ruling, OECTA reaffirmed the commitment of Ontario's Catholic teachers to protecting the denominational integrity of their school system.
Harris Government Introduces Bill 80
To cap off the year, the minister introduced Bill 80, the Stability and Excellence in Education Act. This omnibus bill, which also instituted the new teacher testing scheme, made it compulsory for teachers and school boards to sign three-year contracts, while the province insisted it would only provide funding one year at a time. In order to postpone having its own members fall under the new three-year rule, the Association began round-the-clock bargaining until midnight, June 30.
As Bill 80 came into effect, over 95 per cent of members had collective agreements in place for the next year or two years. The teacher re-certification portion of the bill requires teachers to complete 14 courses in each five-year cycle to maintain their right to teach. After passage of the bill, the details of the testing program remained to be fleshed out, although 40,000randomly selected teachers were supposed to start the first five-year cycle in September 2001.
OECTA began sounding the alarm on re-certification in August, advising members to continue with their individual professional development plans rather than hasten to comply with the College of Teachers' Professional Learning Plan. At a special meeting of unit presidents on September 29, the Provincial Executive and local leaders affirmed their opposition to re-certification. They decided that OECTA would not apply for provider status, while at the same time continuing to develop an array of high quality professional development activities.
The elements of a protest began to take shape, with members advised to return to the college their notice of membership in the first cohort while continuing their personal PD. OECTA also committed itself to backing members who might experience difficulties down the road as a result of their stand against re-certification.
At the November Council of Presidents, the Association launched a Solidarity Campaign in order to involve all members in the protest against re-certification, not just those in the first cohort. As part of the campaign, members wrote thousands of letters of protest to the college, the Minister of Education and the leaders of the official opposition parties. The Association lobbied school boards, faculties of education, public and private sector organizations, asking them either not to apply or to renounce provider status at the college. A special council meeting held on December 1 reaffirmed OECTA's resistance.
While opposition to re-certification grew, the province provided a companion piece to the Stability and Excellence in Education Act, introducing Bill 110, the Quality in the Classroom Act on October 15, 2001. The bill included the Qualifying Test for new graduates of faculties of education, which OECTA judged unnecessary and inequitable, informing the Ministry of Education that members would not help with developing or marking the test.
In the new year, the faculties of education became a central focus of OECTA's activities. The Association tried to convince them to give up provider status in return for OECTA's support for the faculties' stand against the Qualifying Test. When its threat of a boycott of student teachers failed to sway the faculties, OECTA directed members to refuse to accept these students in their classes. At AGM 2002, delegates affirmed their support for OECTA's actions against re-certification, in addition to approving a boycott of AQ courses in targeted faculties of education.
Ernie Eves Replaces Harris
This activity on the education front took place in the context of the provincial Conservatives' leadership race. Premier Mike Harris had surprised the province by announcing his resignation on October 10. A number of candidates quickly stepped forward, anxious to fill his shoes. Ernie Eves, the former finance minister in the Harris government, won the leadership on March 23, 2002 by proposing a more centre-right vision of the province. He named Elizabeth Witmer, a former teacher and school trustee as Minister of Education. OECTA immediately invited the new minister to begin a dialogue. The minister accepted an invitation to address the June Council of Presidents, which was sufficiently impressed by her conciliatory tone to impose a moratorium on the student teacher boycott
Another promising signal came in the Speech from the Throne when the government announced the creation of a task force to review “ways to improve fairness, certainty and stability” in the funding formula. In addition, the minister wrote to the presidents of the teachers federations inviting them to provide input into the re-certification plan by the end of July.
It seemed to many in OECTA that much of the 2002-03 school year was spent in waiting – waiting for the provincial government to set an election date (it never happened); waiting to hear Dr. Mordechai Rozanski's report on fairness in the education funding formula, and then waiting to learn if the Conservative government would boost school funding. Although OECTA had kicked off September 2002 by announcing the success of its own summer PD program, the Association could not record any progress in the struggle against re-certification.
As OECTA and the OTF affiliates continued to press for repeal of re-certification, the College of Teachers jacked up its membership fee to pay for the expanding bureaucracy needed to administer the PLP. Teachers already cynical about the so-called “arms-length” role of the college could only shake their heads at this rise that, combined with a previous fee hike, added up to a 34 per cent increase since the college opened its doors in 1996. Despite widespread disenchantment with its operations, the college pressed ahead with the election of its third governing council. Members voted on-line between March 3 and April 4, 2003, with a lacklustre voter response rate of 4.4 per cent. Here too, teachers continued to pin their hope for reform on a change in the governing provincial party.
Teachers already stressed by the demands of the PLP faced an exacting new system of performance appraisal that took effect in September 2002. The Quality in the Classroom Act (Bill 110) began requiring principals or vice-principals to review teacher performance in three-year cycles, taking into consideration a long list of competencies and “look fors.” As part of the process, school boards must also survey parents and students concerning teacher communication effectiveness. The system's potential to undermine teachers' right to due process meant that OECTA negotiators began immediately to address performance appraisal at the bargaining table, while the number of grievances filed because of the new process promised to explode as teachers questioned how they had been rated by their supervisors. Implementation of the new requirement for a criminal record check of all teachers further complicated their lives.
Rozanski Report
The task force on education funding headed by Dr. Mordechai Rozanski released its findings on December 10, 2002. The report confirmed what teachers, parents and much of the general public had believed for several years: that education in Ontario had been systematically under-funded since 1995. Adjusted for inflation and enrolment, education funding levels for 2002-03 were actually $2.2 billion less than in 1994, Rozanski reported. He recommended that an additional $1.8 billion be injected into the school system over the following three years.
Dr. Rozanski also advised that the ministry update the benchmark costs for all components of the funding formula (the Foundation Grant, the Special Purpose Grants, the Pupil Accommodation Grant) to reflect costs through August 2003, and that mechanisms be developed for annually reviewing and updating the benchmarks and for conducting a more comprehensive overall review every five years. The government's response was scattershot, with boosts to funding for transportation and teachers' salaries announced soon after Dr. Rozanski's report was made public in order to quell rising criticism of the funding formula. However, by the end of the school year there had been no movement on key issues raised by the task force, such as a review of the benchmarks. The government's education policies suffered another blow, in January, when a team of OISE/U of T researchers – Kenneth Leithwood, Michael Fullan and Nancy Watson – released "The Schools We Need", which gave a failing grade to provincial education policies. 
On the collective bargaining front, Simcoe-Muskoka elementary and secondary, Windsor-Essex elementary and Toronto Elementary were OECTA hot spots this year. Teachers in all four units ended up on the picket line after months of uphill bargaining failed to produce settlements. The Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board locked out its elementary teachers on May 5, after they initiated a work-to-rule campaign on April 27. Fortunately the dispute was short-lived as the mediator led the parties to a settlement in talks on May 8-9. In the case of Toronto Elementary, the school board chose to lock out teachers when they did not bend to the board's wishes. The Toronto Catholic District School board then refused to re-open schools until after the government passed back-to-work legislation on June 4. Once students had returned to class, both parties agreed upon an arbitrator and four days of arbitration hearings were set to start on July 17, with a decision expected no later than September 10. In the arbitration Toronto Elementary members were successful in achieving the first ever cap on elementary supervision in the province.
New Era of Genuine Consultation
Premier Eves announced on September 2, 2003 that Ontarians would go to the polls on October 2. OECTA and its partners in education, labour and the social justice community were primed and ready to go with advertising campaigns and literature advocating the election of a new government, one that would be education-friendly and that would reverse the us-against-them policies of the Conservatives that had devastated the province's social and physical infrastructure. The Association devoted unprecedented financial resources to the campaign, money that had been set aside in a political action fund by decision of the Annual General Meeting in 2002.
The results on October 2 surprised even the most hopeful. Voters gave an overwhelming majority to the Ontario Liberals led by Dalton McGuinty. The Speech from the Throne on November 19 set the tone for the new government, with promises to end re-certification, revitalize the College of Teachers, repeal the tax credit for private schools and the seniors' education tax credit, and create real partnerships with the province's education stakeholders. In December alone the province saw new money for school boards (partial fulfillment of the Rozanski recommendations), a moratorium on school closures, the Fiscal Responsibility Act that repealed the private school tax credit as well as the seniors' exemption from the education portion of the property tax, and, on the 19th, a letter from the Minister of Education announcing the end of re-certification. The premier announced his plan to cap class sizes on April 22, 2004. On May 13, when Gerard Kennedy stood in the Legislature to introduce the Professional Learning Program Cancellation Act, teachers could only heave a sigh of relief that the struggle against 'teacher testing,' waged so diligently since 2001, was over. The solidarity demonstrated by members of OECTA and all the OTF affiliates had paid off, with a minimal PLP compliance rate and the Liberals' fulfillment of their election promise to cancel the program. The new era of genuine consultation with the government included the Education Partnership Table, designed to obtain broad insights from all education stakeholders, which met for the first time on March 6.
The new government also acted in areas that touch “the common good,” the focus of so much of OECTA's political action campaign. They provided a slight increase to the minimum wage and the corporate income tax rate, boosted tobacco taxes, allocated $56 million for affordable housing, and froze college and university tuition. 
Politics were not OECTA's only focus in 2003-04. In February, the Association's first annual conference for beginning teachers, “OECTA: The Next Generation,” attracted 330 members in their first five years of teaching. With 26 workshops, ample time for socializing, an expert panel on educational issues and an open forum, 'OECTA is listening,' the conference received rave reviews. Recognizing the event as an important step towards meeting the needs of beginning teachers, the Association committed to organizing a second conference in February 2005.
The PLP finally became history on December 16, when the act cancelling the program received royal assent. It had taken a deal among the House Leaders in the Ontario Legislature to end weeks of procedural wrangling that had stalled the legislation. OECTA lobbied tirelessly to ensure the bill's final passage. 
In fulfillment of the government's ambitious education plans, the minister peppered the year with announcements — funding for smaller classes, creation of the Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat; new focus on boys' literacy challenges; $280 million to repair, expand or replace schools; a new policy on school closures; $70 million for French-language schools; dedicated funding for school libraries; a fresh focus on safe schools including anti-bullying policies; removal of junk food from elementary schools' vending machines; $20 million to open up schools to non-profit community groups; the Parent Voice in Education Project to find new ways for parental involvement in education; "re-shaping" the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO), and much more. According to the government, 2004-05 saw the "second full year of an extraordinary $8.3 billion four-year investment" in publicly funded JK to 12 schools.
At the Association's second annual conference for beginning teachers in February some 300 members in their first five years of teaching attended workshops on topics such as communicating with parents and classroom management. They welcomed as keynote speaker former Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis, the United Nations' special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, who launched an impassioned plea for aid to help the millions suffering in sub-Saharan Africa. In the field, members continued to benefit from preventive workshops focusing on resolving conflict, teacher liability, and appropriate and professional relationships. At the same time, the Association provided assistance to thousands of members in difficulty with, for example, long-term disability appeals or defense against charges arising from their work.
Against this backdrop, collective bargaining remained a constant. By February 2005, talks at the local level were progressing very slowly or not at all. Only four of 80 OECTA local bargaining units had settled contracts covering the 2004-05 school year. The situation was similar in all OTF affiliates except for AEFO, which had settled all its agreements in the fall. Meanwhile, the government introduced Bill 167 changing the mandatory term for collective agreements from three to either two or four years.
The log jam broke in April when ETFO held a news conference to announce it had settled on a provincial negotiating framework with the public school boards that would see its members agree to four-year contracts (September 1, 2004 - August 31, 2008) in return for incentives. OSSTF came to a similar agreement that it did not make public. The frameworks were to be given concrete expression through local negotiations with a June 1 deadline. The incentives would mean more teachers in the classroom and more help for students. Improved student performance was to be the end result, along with "peace and stability" in the education system.
After local bargaining unit presidents convened in a special session in Toronto gave the go-ahead for OECTA to bargain its own framework, the Association opened talks with the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association. When many all-nighters failed to produce the desired accord, the Association pushed ahead at local bargaining tables, supported by memos to Catholic school boards from the minister and the deputy minister outlining bargaining policy for four-year deals. A major sticking point was OECTA's insistence that members achieve salary parity with coterminous public boards effective August 31, 2004. When this was assured and the other incentives were in place, local negotiators supported by provincial staff began to reach settlements. OECTA met the June 1 deadline, with 43 bargaining units settled with four-year agreements. The few bargaining units that already had two-year agreements in place concluded additional two-year deals to qualify for incentives, as did all but one group of teachers employed by school authorities. Because negotiations for occasional teacher locals had been delayed by the intense activity required to meet the June deadlines, these talks continued into the summer. The vast majority of members could return to the classroom in September with their employment conditions established for the following three years.
With agreements largely settled, the Association in 2005-06 turned its collective mind to the teaching environment. Along with the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, OECTA commissioned a survey of bullying in the workplace. Phase one focused on bullying by students, showing that almost 40 per cent of Ontario teachers and education workers are subjected to bullying from that quarter. This conduct is characterized by a pattern of repeated disrespectful behaviour, vandalism of personal belongings, threats of physical assault, ongoing verbal abuse, racial and sexual slurs or intimidation. The teachers' associations called on faculties of education, school administrators and boards, parent and community groups and government at all levels to help develop resources for parents to learn to recognize, address and prevent bullying behaviour; offer training for administrators, teachers and support staff; and develop Ontario schools as "bully-free" environments.
In the second phase of the survey, 30 per cent of teachers and education workers reported being bullied by a parent or guardian, 24 per cent by a superior, and 15 per cent by a colleague or co-worker. Recognizing that psychological harassment and bullying are not just school-based phenomena, the federations recommended amendments to Ontario's Employment Standards Act to mirror innovative sections of Quebec legislation that protect all workers against these behaviours, as well as the inclusion of bullying and harassment in Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act. Lobbying and discussions with government continued throughout the year.
Autumn 2005 saw the provincial government introduce a number of new programmes that posed challenges for members. Where was one to slot the daily requirement of 20 minutes of physical activity into an already-overloaded curriculum? The Association applauded the cancellation of the Ontario Teachers' Qualifying Test (OTQT) for new graduates of the faculties of education. On the other hand, the induction program designed to replace it with compulsory mentoring and professional development tied to the teacher performance appraisal process ran counter to a fundamental OECTA position. The Association always emphasizes teachers' voluntary participation in programs they judge will support their professional responsibilities. Under the Student Success Strategy, teachers were introduced to a new vocabulary. "Student success" teachers, "board-wide leaders" and "light-house programs" not recognized in collective agreements raised stress levels as some boards hurried to implement programs without consultation.
With the introduction of Bill 78, the omnibus Student Performance Act, which proposed substantial amendments to the Education Act and the Ontario College of Teachers Act and other statutes, the Association learned the extent of government intentions. The New Teacher Induction Program (NTIP) to replace the OTQT remained substantially unchanged, despite the Association's lobbying. The government announced its intention to add two PD days, for a total of six annually. And a long silence in the College of Teachers portfolio ended with the announcement that in order to win the confidence of members, the number of teacher representatives on the Governing Council would be increased by six, providing a majority of one classroom teacher. This change was overshadowed, however, by new conflict of interest provisions that will prevent council members from retaining a full-time role at the provincial or local level of the teacher federations. In addition, while giving teachers a majority on the council, the bill provided for the creation of a Public Interest Committee of non-OCT members to advise on matters of public interest — a slap in the face to all council members.
Most disturbing in the long-term was the extent to which Bill 78 proposed to downgrade matters from the level of statute to regulation. This provision promised to give the Minister of Education new powers in wide-ranging areas including collection of personal data, class size, instructional time, the College of Teachers, teacher training and evaluation, and teachers' professional activity days. As OECTA cautioned in its brief to the Standing Committee on Social Policy, "Bill 78 will centralize more control over education behind closed doors at Queen’s Park. As long as a government that believes in the value of a strong public education system governs Ontario, believes that many changes proposed in Bill 78 will be acceptable. However, we worry that without the checks and balances of parliament and public debate, a hostile government could quietly undermine the education system through regulatory change. OECTA believes the needs of the students, teachers and communities are better served when the planning, decisions and collective bargaining affecting our schools are made openly and locally, where community needs and issues are best understood and debated." Bill 78 received royal assent on June 1, 2006.
During the 05-06 school year, OECTA was also active in a number of areas more distant from its core concerns. The Association went to bat with financial and moral support for the British Columbia Teachers' Federation when they took job action to obtain smaller classes and more input into class composition. Student Vote received funds to support National Student Vote 2006 during the federal election campaign to encourage students to take a greater part in the democratic process. Lobbying continued until Parliament was dissolved for the federal election to obtain amendments in copyright legislation to protect teachers' and students' free access to the internet. After the election of the Conservative government, OECTA added its voice to the campaign to preserve the child care agreements signed by the previous federal government.
The year wound down in June with a host of announcements from the Ministry of Education designed to reinforce the government's education-positive image. These included more funding for special education reform and for teachers' professional development, revisions to the Education Funding Formula and increased investments to reduce primary class sizes and boost high school graduation numbers, and additional funding for French-language schools. There was little doubt that government was setting the stage for the final year of its mandate and the campaign leading up to the next provincial vote on October 4, 2007.
Focus on Social Justice
OECTA’s changing demographics led the Association to find ways for newer members to play a more active role.
In that vein, OECTA sponsored Educating for the Common Good, a conference organized by the Professional Development department that featured human rights activist, author and former teacher Sally Armstrong, Toronto Star political columnist Linda McQuaig and theologian Gregory Baum, all of whom encouraged teachers to continue nurturing a society that speaks out and agitates for what it is right for the common good. It was OECTA’s first curriculum conference since the suspension of the Christian Curriculum Development Conference in 1997.
Craig Kielburger, international child rights activist and founder of Free The Children, emphasized the transformative power of the teacher in his address to the February 2007 Beginning Teachers Conference. The Association's popular event aimed at OECTA members with less than six years of teaching experience attracted some 450 members interested in learning more about their profession, their union and education in the broadest sense of the word. 
Concern for the common good theme was also evident when OECTA members joined with other unions and organizations during Action Against Poverty Week. OECTA’s message in the province-wide campaign to raise public awareness and demand action through social programs and job creation to address needs of thousands of children and their families was conveyed through a billboard “Investing in Children Pays Big Dividends,” and letters to municipal and provincial governments. 
For more than 40 years OECTA’s Education Aid program has granted two per cent of the Association's net revenue from member fees to teacher and community organizations worldwide. Priority is given to requests from Association members or former members; affect children, teachers, schools (in that order), and have a Christian/Catholic dimension. During the 2006-07 year, OECTA approved a motion to provide amounts of money to sustain projects over a longer time period. One organization benefiting from that decision is KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives, a church-based social justice movement that unites churches and religious organizations to advocate for social change. 
Pension Contributions Rise
The Government of Ontario and the Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF), the partners in the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, reached agreement in June 2006 to increase the contribution rate of the teachers and the government to deal with a funding shortfall in the plan. The first phase of the increase took effect on January 1, 2007, with members' contributions moving to 9.3 per cent on the first $43,700 of earnings and 10.9 for earnings beyond $43,700. Retirement benefits were unchanged. 
Teachers are majority on OCT
For the first time since the Ontario College of Teachers was established in 1997, Ontario’s classroom teachers were entitled a majority of positions on the College’s Governing Council as a result of a legislative change. All candidates endorsed by OTF won their positions.
Commitment to Literacy
OECTA’s June 2007 Council of Presidents made a multi-year commitment to the summer literacy camps for Aboriginal youth launched by the Honourable James Bartleman during his years as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. Council voted to donate $28,000 to the project, in addition to the $5,000 annual grant made through the Educational Aid Fund. The funding resulted in the sponsoring of a literacy camp in partnership with Frontier College at Onigaming First Nation in Northwestern Ontario.
New Professional Development Initiatives
In March 2006, the province provided the teachers’ federations with a two-year grant to help promote professional development related to two government focuses – literacy and numeracy, and differentiated instruction, as well as initiatives that address student success. The Association used its $4.75 million share to expand existing programs including our summer workshops in 2006, and to provide many new PD opportunities for our members in 2006-07. OECTA developed three-day literacy, numeracy and differentiated instruction workshops that focus on differentiated instruction through developmentally appropriate practice in primary and junior mathematics and literacy. In addition, the 2006 Summer Program was expanded to include five workshops designed specially to meet these concerns.
Grant money was also spent on initiatives that addressed student success, through the following opportunities for teachers: Action Research Projects and Book Study Groups; local PD funds ($21 per member); Teachers as Leaders Symposium (March 2007); OECTA Summer Program; Kindergarten Matters Symposium (July & August 2007), Media Literacy Symposium (November 2007), Anti-bullying Symposium (April 2008) and Courage to Serve retreat (May 2008).
New President and General Secretary
James Ryan, a teacher from Toronto Elementary Catholic Teachers (TECT) Unit, began his two-year term as president on July 1, 2009. Ryan taught in both the elementary and secondary panels, worked as a special education resource teacher and has also taught in the adolescent psychiatric division at Sunnybrook Hospital. Before being elected to OECTA Provincial, Ryan was a member of the Toronto Elementary Catholic Teachers’ North York Sub-unit executive. From 1997 to 2000, he served as an OTF Governor and was elected as a councillor to the OECTA provincial executive in 2002. Keenly interested in social justice and labour rights, Ryan has served as co-chair of the Ontario Coalition for Social Justice, and as a member of CTF’s Human Rights and Diversity Committee, the Ontario Federation of Labour’s Education is a Right Committee, the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund (Canada) Steering Committee, and the Canadian Labour Congress’ Human Rights Committee.
One of Ryan’s first official engagement’s as OECTA president was a visit to Onegaming First Nation near Nestor Falls, Ontario, to spend a day at the Aboriginal Summer Literacy Camp that OECTA has sponsored for two years. Over half of the 130 students participated in the summer literacy camp, which is operated by Frontier College. Aboriginal knowledge, customs, cultures and history are reflected in the design and delivery of the program, with an overarching theme that emphasizes the fun of reading and writing. 
Marshall Jarvis began his term as OECTA General Secretary on February 17, 2009. Jarvis brang local, provincial and national experience to his role. His face and name became familiar to many Ontarians during his term as OECTA president from 1997 to 1999. Just weeks into that term, the Harris government introduced the Education Quality Improvement Act (Bill 160), that cut almost $2 billion from Ontario’s education budget and triggered an unprecedented province-wide conflict. A former high school math and science teacher at Sacred Heart Catholic High School in York region, Jarvis served in various capacities on the Executive and on the Board of Governors of the Ontario Teachers’ Federation (OTF) between 1993 and 2005. He first joined the OECTA staff as an Executive Assistant in the Contract Service Department in 2005. Prior to becoming General Secretary, Jarvis was an Executive Assistant in OECTA’s Counselling and Member Services Department.
Full-Day Learning – Kindergarten Lobby
Promised by the Liberals in 2007 and officially announced in 2009, the Early Learning Kindergarten Program (ELKP) for four-and five-year-olds will cost Ontario taxpayers $1.5 billion when fully implemented in 2015.
OECTA has a great deal to be proud of regarding the ELKP. In a 2009 report Dr. Charles Pascal, who was appointed by MGuinty to study and report on how to best implement a full day of learning, Dr. Pascal recommended an extended day of learning for classes of 20 four-and five-year-olds staffed by a full-time early childhood educator (ECE) and a half-time teacher. 
The Association challenged Pascal’s recommendation, insisting to government that every classroom be led by a full-time certified teacher because research clearly shows that teacher qualifications have a critical influence on the achievement of students in full-day programs. OECTA’s lobby was successful. The government acknowledged the skills and importance of having certified teachers at all times. 
OECTA Leadership Training Program
With a vision of building strong teacher advocates and activists to enable OECTA to take action at all levels as a union of professionals, the Association launched its new Leadership Training Program in November 2009. The program’s goal is to develop teacher leaders who have a broad-based sense of advocacy in the classroom, and who are equipped with specific knowledge and skills to provide service and leadership at all levels of the Association.
Led by OECTA’s provincial office staff, the Level 1 workshops provided participants with foundational knowledge and skills in grievance arbitration, communication, professional relationships, the principles of teacher leadership and the legislative framework for teacher collective bargaining. After completing eight modules of study, they received a Certificate of Foundational Training. Specialized certificate training began in 2010–2011. A new group of participants was accepted to begin leadership training in the fall of 2010, for completion of foundational training in 2011.
In-House Legal Counsel
In the fiscal year 2008-09 the Association spent over $3 million on legal fees to counsel members. Adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Association's annual legal bill was the new 13 per cent harmonized sales tax (HST), which took effect July 1, 2010. After a review of the nature and pattern of OECTA's legal expenditures, it was determined an in-house Counsel would benefit the Association, and the Provincial Executive approved the employment of an in-house legal counsel on a two-year trial basis. 
Local Collective Bargaining Training
The four-year collective agreements signed in 2008 have required the Association to engage local units and school boards in finalizing and monitoring contract details. The Association held annual Collective Bargaining Regional Workshops to support locals in implementing their agreements, and monitoring to prepare for 2011–2012 collective bargaining. 
Provincial Election Readiness Campaign
The Association developed its political action campaign to elect an education-friendly legislature on October 6, 2011. The “Speak for Children” public relations campaign included a fact-based Plan for a Stronger Ontario positioning OECTA’s key policy recommendations, social media (Twitter and Facebook), a YouTube video, a highly visible community billboard and media advertising campaign, and local unit-based MPP lobbying with a call to action of members to speak for children and vote on election day. As anticipated, a minority Liberal government was elected.
Full-Day Early Learning Kindergarten Program
OECTA held an ELKP Conference in May, “Everyone Learns the Kindergarten Program”, for teachers delivering the program in September 2010 to discuss workload, curriculum, classroom space, professional learning, and working in partnership with ECEs. Following the Conference, OECTA invited ELKP teachers to join a social media community network to continue the conversation by participating in discussion forums, sharing resources and lending teacher-to-teacher support during the 2010–2011 school year.
Information gathered from surveys allowed OECTA to provide useful and insightful feedback to the Ministry of Education on the continued development of the program.
Leadership Training Program
Reflecting OECTA’s commitment to training strong teacher activists, OECTA launched the program in 2010, starting with broad-based foundational training in areas of membership service. The program was expanded with the introduction of concurrent specialist training in four areas: collective bargaining, conflict management, grievance officer, and leadership skills & organizational development later in the year. Through the LTP program, participants gain a broad sense of advocacy as well as specific knowledge and skills that will prepare them to provide service and leadership at the local and provincial level to ensure the next generation of OECTA leadership are prepared.
Spirit Horse Northern Ontario Tour
OECTA and ETFO collaborated to offer an enriching Arts experience to teachers and schools in the northern reach of the province. The Spirit Horse play by Roseneath Theatre is used as a catalyst for professional development in dance, drama, music and visual arts. The joint northern Arts Native Studies project provides elementary school audiences with an opportunity to "reflect upon, respond to, and analyze" the theatre experience while supporting classroom teachers with the revised Ontario Arts Curriculum.
Re-branding 
July 1, 2011 marked the official launch of OECTA’s new wordmark, official colours, and document standards, including fonts. These were first introduced at AGM 2011, in the presentation to unit presidents of new flags bearing the wordmark and colours, as well as distribution of Report to Members 2011, which illustrated various aspects of the new visual brand. 
2011 Provincial Election
During the summer of 2011, leading up to the fall provincial election, OECTA re-launched its Speak for Children campaign. The non-partisan, issues-based campaign celebrated Ontario’s education system as being among the best in the world, promoted positive education policies and encouraged voters to become informed about the issues and vote for pro-education candidates. 
OECTA’s Key Campaign Messages:
• invest in people to prepare for a new economy
• maintain investments in publicly funded education
• ensure our schools are safe and inclusive
• strengthen the social safety net, which will strengthen the economy
Throughout September Speak for Children ads ran in local community newspapers, on local radio stations, on billboards, public transit and in shopping malls and hockey arenas across Ontario. Even Toronto’s Union Station was dominated by Speak for Children messaging for several weeks. photo 
Many OECTA members volunteered to help elect education-friendly candidates in their communities. Thanks in large part to the efforts of teachers, 63 of 88 locally endorsed candidates were elected and the Liberals were returned to Queen’s Park to lead a minority government. 
2011 Provincial Election
During the summer of 2011, leading up to the fall provincial election, OECTA re-launched its Speak for Children campaign. The non-partisan, issues-based campaign celebrated Ontario’s education system as being among the best in the world, promoted positive education policies and encouraged voters to become informed about the issues and vote for pro-education candidates. Thanks in large part to the efforts of teachers, 63 of 88 locally endorsed candidates were elected and the Liberals were returned to Queen’s Park to lead a minority government.
Teachers Teaching Teachers
Project Overseas is a joint endeavour of the Canadian Teachers’ Federation and its member organizations. Teams of teachers, including OECTA are selected each year to provide professional assistance to teachers in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East. OECTA members volunteer their time and talents to assist in raising the academic and professional qualifications of teachers, peer to peer. 
Education International
OECTA’s president, general secretary, past president and first vice-president attended Education International’s 6th World Congress held in Cape Town, South Africa in July 2011. They were part of the Canadian Teachers’ Federation delegation to the congress. Resolutions addressed a wide range of topics, including copyright and education, sustained funding for education in the economic crisis, teacher migration and mobility, and child labour. OECTA fought to have the congress consider its motion calling for support for the rights of constitutionally protected minorities (including religious groups) to publicly funded school systems. In the end, the Association’s recommendation became part of a compilation motion that included the key element — the recognition of the existing rights to education of minorities such as religious, linguistic and ethnic groups. This motion did not hit the floor at the congress, however, it was adopted by EI’s Executive Board in November 2011. 
Reach Every Student - Equity and Inclusivity in Ontario Schools
The Catholic education system gained media attention this year when, under the direction of the Archdiocese, school boards refused to allow students to form Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) clubs to help combat homophobia and build acceptance in their schools. The issue culminated in November with the government’s introduction of Bill 13, the Accepting Schools Act, 2011. OECTA supports any variety of measures, including students clubs (regardless of name), that have the intended goal of building respect and understanding and making our schools safer for everyone. OECTA supported the implementation of Bill 13, and then President O’Dwyer spoke in favour of the Bill to the Legislative Committee. 
At its 2012 Annual General Meeting in March, OECTA delegates reaffirmed their support for inclusive and respectful schools by passing two resolutions dealing with GSAs and inclusive learning and working environments for LGBTQ individuals. 
In May, OECTA, in cooperation with the Catholic Principals’ Council of Ontario (CPCO), hosted a conference for classroom teachers and administrators on supporting marginalized and LGBTQ students in Ontario's Catholic schools. Titled Reach Every Student, Know Their Story, the conference was a first of its kind for Ontario’s Catholic educators. Participants heard from keynote speakers and attended workshops that provided valuable insight on how to use our shared Catholic values to build welcoming, inclusive environments in which all individuals, including those who are LGBTQ, are safe and respected.
Public sector reform expected to curb province’s $16 billion deficit
In an effort to address some of its fiscal problems, the Ontario government appointed former TD Bank chief economist Don Drummond to spearhead the Commission on the Reform of Ontario’s Public Services. OECTA submitted briefs to the government and the Drummond Commission encouraging them to look at the increasing expenditures in school board administration lines, the size of government bureaucracy at the Ministry of Education (such as the Student Achievement Division) and the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) as areas where efficiencies could be realized, without impacting classroom learning. Read OECTA’s brief to the Minister of Finance. OECTA also called for a cancellation of the governments irresponsible corporate tax cuts.
When the spring 2012 budget was released, opportunities for savings were not mentioned. Instead, the government took a very ‘unbalanced’ approach to the budget – ignoring valid opportunities for savings while implementing measures that disproportionately impacted teachers. 
Collective bargaining begins
In February 2012, OECTA entered into the bargaining process intent on negotiating the parameters of an agreement with the government.
The previous two rounds of bargaining with the provincial government resulted in two consecutive four-year agreements (2004-08 and 2009-12), and brought improvements to working conditions, compensation and an increase in specialized teachers. The Liberals created the “provincial dialogue table” (PDT) to discuss province-wide issues and establish consistent compensation and benefit standards across the province. However, some school boards resisted by delaying entitlements established at the PDT. For example, professional development funds allocated to local units, and some benefit enhancements, were maliciously delayed. 
By January of 2012 it was very clear that the "education friendly" McGuinty government had turned on the teaching profession and the entire education sector. In the 2012 round, the government directed OECTA to meet with the Ontario Catholic School Trustees’ Association (OCSTA) to come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties. OECTA President Kevin O’Dwyer opposed the idea. “The trustees have no authority in this matter,” added O’Dwyer. “The bottom line is that it is the government that created the proposal, controls the funding, and are the owners of this PDT process, therefore they are the party with whom we need to be engaged in a discussion.” 
The McGuinty government was intent on removing over $500 million from the education budget. On July 5, 2012 OECTA and the Ministry of Education reached a Memorandum of Understanding which contained serious contract strips including the ending of retirement gratuities, a new sick day regime, a salary freeze, a delay in grid increment payments, and three unpaid days. The MOU included a two gains including a fair hiring policy for occasional teachers and a teacher professional judgment provision for diagnostic testing. The agreement also contained language on the Association taking over long term disability plans from school boards and for the consideration of provincial benefits in the next round of bargaining. While the OECTA bargaining team had done great work in mitigating some of the damages Education Minister Laurel Broten was seeking to impose, it was a great set back.
That summer the McGuinty government attempted to gain the majority that had been denied to them in the general election by winning the seat vacated by Ontario PC Elizabeth Witmer in Kitchener-Waterloo. OECTA endorsed and supported the only education friendly candidate in the Kitchener-Waterloo by-election Katherine Fife who was elected. McGuinty was denied his majority and later resigned as premier.
Prior to his resignation McGuinty's Liberals, supported by Tim Hudak's PC's enacted Bill 115 which was the most anti-teacher piece of legislation since Mike Harris' Bill 160. The bill stripped teachers on their 2012 collective bargaining rights and imposed the terms of the OECTA MOU on the entire education sector.
In January of 2013 the Ontario Liberal Party selected Kathleen Wynne as its new leader who has promised to repair the fractured relationship between the government and the education sector.

1961 Chatham Cup

The 1961 Chatham Cup was the 34th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.
Other teams known to have taken part in the final rounds included Otangarei United (Whangarei), Hamilton Technical Old Boys, Kahukura (Rotorua), Eastern Union (Gisborne), Moturoa, Napier Rovers, Wanganui United, Kiwi United (Manawatu), and Timaru Thistle.
The 1961 final.
Northern won the cup for a second time, having previously been champions in 1959; North Shore United made their third consecutive finals appearance, having won the cup in 1960. The match was thus both a match between the two previous winners and also a rematch of the 1959 final, with the same team winning on both occasions. Seven Northern players and six North Shore players played in both finals, these six latter players - among them England and New Zealand international Ken Armstrong - also having played in the winning side of 1960. The final was a free flowing affair, but no goals came until the half hour mark, when Northern took the lead through George Little. The score remained 1-0 until two minutes from the end of the match, when Bruce Campbell doubled Northern's lead.

Dumbwaiter (elevator)

Dumbwaiters are small freight elevators (or lifts) intended to carry objects rather than people. Dumbwaiters found within modern structures, including both commercial, public and private buildings, are often connected between multiple floors. When installed in restaurants, schools, kindergartens, hospitals, retirement homes or in private homes, the lifts generally terminate in a kitchen.
The term seems to have been popularized in the United States in the 1840s, after the model of earlier "dumbwaiters" now known as serving trays and lazy Susans. The mechanical dumbwaiter was invented by George W. Cannon, a New York inventor. Cannon first filed for the patent of a brake system (US Patent no. 260776) that could be used for a dumbwaiter on January 6, 1883. Cannon later filed for the patent on the mechanical dumbwaiter (US Patent No. 361268) on February 17, 1887. Cannon reportedly generated a vast amount of royalties from the dumbwaiter patents until his death in 1897.
Description.
A simple dumbwaiter is a movable frame in a shaft, dropped by a rope on a pulley, guided by rails; most dumbwaiters have a shaft, cart, and capacity smaller than those of passenger elevators, usually 45 to 450 kg (100 to 1000 lbs.) Before electric motors were added in the 1920s, dumbwaiters were controlled manually by ropes on pulleys.
Early 20th-century codes sometimes required fireproof dumbwaiter walls and self-closing fireproof doors and mention features such as buttons to control movement between floors and locks on doors preventing them from opening unless the cart is stopped at that floor.
A legal complaint about a Manhattan restaurant's dumbwaiter in 1915, which also mentions that food orders are shouted up and down the shaft, describes its operation and limitations as follows:
is ... great play between the cart of the dumb-waiter and the guides on which it runs, with the result that the running of the cart is accompanied by a loud noise. The rope which operates the cart of the dumb-waiter runs in a wheel with a very shallow groove, so that the rope is liable to and does at times slip off. ... The cart has no shock absorbers at the top, so that when it strikes the top of the shaft or wheel there is a loud report. ... ropes of the dumb-waiter strike such wall at frequent intervals with a loud report. ... [The dumb-waiter is often negligently operated, by running it faster than necessary, and by letting it go down with a sudden fall.
More recent dumbwaiters can be more sophisticated, using electric motors, automatic control systems, and custom freight containers of other kinds of elevators. Recently constructed book lifts in libraries and mail or other freight transports in office towers may be larger than many dumbwaiters in public restaurants and private homes, supporting loads as heavy as 1000 pounds.
Regulations governing construction and operation.
Building codes have regulated the construction and operation of dumbwaiters in parts of North America since the 19th century. Modern dumbwaiters in the United States and Canada must comply with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) codes and, therefore, have features similar to those of passenger elevators. The construction, operation and usage of dumbwaiters varies widely according to country.

Rogelio Frigerio

Rogelio Frigerio (November 2, 1914 – September 13, 2006) was an Argentine economist, journalist and politician.
Background and early career.
Rogelio Frigerio was born in Buenos Aires in 1914 to Gerónimo Frigerio and Carmen Guanzaroli. One of eight brothers, he grew up in the quiet residential neighborhood of Villa del Parque and enrolled at the prestigious University of Buenos Aires.
Pursuing higher studies at the university's School of Economics, he helped found "Insurrexit", a Marxist student association and, as one of its leaders, he edited the group's newsletter, "Claridad". Graduating in 1935, he soon distanced himself from the Argentine left, however, believing them to harbor an elitist disposition.
Establishing a wholesale distributorship with diversified interests in lumber, textiles, leather and minerals, in 1940 he married Noemí Blanco, with whom he had five children. A talented businessman, Frigerio nonetheless remained politically active, involving himself in intellectual circles and establishing a newsweekly in 1946, "Qué pasó en siete dias" (""What Happened in Seven Days""). Alienated by the magazine's staunch opposition to the new populist Administration of Juan Perón, however, Frigerio left its editorial board shortly before Perón had the magazine shuttered in 1947.
Though he did not seek public office during the Perón era, Frigerio became a highly visible proponent of accelerated industrial growth and social progress, a combination of policies he described as developmentalism. Inspired by recent efforts in that direction such as Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas' "Estado Novo" and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Frigerio's concern that Perón's similar policies might be reversed following the populist leader's violent 1955 overthrow led him to re-open his former newsmagazine in 1956, naming it simply "Qué". "Qué" soon attracted prestigious contributors from Argentine intellectual life such as Arturo Jauretche, Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz, Jorge Sabato and Arturo Frondizi. Frondizi, the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR)'s 1951 Vice Presidential nominee, soon developed a close friendship with Frigerio.
Developmentalism and Arturo Frondizi.
Frigerio, in 1956, secretly arranged a meeting with Perón and his closest adviser at the time, John William Cooke, an erstwhile Communist who, imprisoned for his prominence in the Perón government, had recently escaped his remote Patagonia prison cell. 
Exiled in Venezuela and subjected to numerous assassination attempts ordered by the new regime in Argentina, Perón continued to exert considerable political influence in his homeland; as Argentine voters geared for the 1958 elections, the exiled leader's Justicialist Party was barred from fielding even local candidates (the mere mention of Perón's name was illegal). Following the secret meeting in Caracas, however, Perón endorsed Arturo Frondizi, instructing his supporters to vote for their former opponent and forego casting blank ballots, as a number of Peronists were advocating. Failing to secure the UCR nomination, Frondizi ran on a splinter ticket, whose party he named the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI). Enjoying Perón's support, Frondizi's UCRI handily defeated the mainstream UCR candidate, Ricardo Balbín, by about 1.5 million votes out of 9 million cast.
Arturo Frondizi was inaugurated President of Argentina on May 1, 1958 and designated Frigerio Secretary of Socio-Economic Affairs, a secondary post in the critical Economics Ministry the new president was forced to offer Frigerio due to steadfast opposition from the Argentine military and the U.S. Embassy, both of whom saw Frigerio as a veiled Marxist because of his activities as a young man. President Frondizi, even so, gave Frigerio informal say over a broad swath of economic policy. 
Frondizi and Frigerio inherited a difficult economic situation: following a 1946-48 boom, GDP had grown by a modest 3% a year in the decade since. Declining exports and a growing need for costly imported motor vehicles, machinery and fuel, moreover, had caused Argentina to run trade deficits in seven out the past ten years. Unable to finance these easily, Frondizi's two predecessors, Perón and Pedro Aramburu, resorted to "printing" money to cover the nation's yawning current account deficits, causing prices to rise around sixfold. Frigerio, whom U.S. interests in Argentina suspected of being a Communist, believed that the only sustainable remedy for this was the encouragement of foreign direct investment into Argentina, particularly in energy and industry the sectors accounting for most of the country's trade deficits.
Almost upon his appointment, Frigerio drafted the Law of Foreign Investment, promptly signed by the president. This law gave incentives and tax benefits to both local and foreign corporations willing to develop Argentina's energy and industry sectors and created the Department and Commission of Foreign Investments, which was designed to give foreign investors more legal recourse. Frigerio's plans were ambitious, calling for greatly expanded public lending for homebuilders and local industry, and public works investment.
Frigerio also promulgated large petroleum exploration and drilling contracts with foreign oil companies. These gave interested participants a generous share of the profits from such activities, provided these were carried out in conjunction with the Argentine state oil concern, YPF. As a consequence of investments initiated during the next four years, the profile of a number of sectors in the Argentine economy were revolutionized by the early 1960s:
The availability of consumer durables like washing machines, refrigerators, ovens, appliances and television sets all also increased sharply, as local and foreign investors soon broke ground on factories making all these goods and many more. One fourth of all foreign direct investment into Argentina between 1912 and 1975 took place in the Frondizi years, and the nation's chronic trade deficits, for their part, vanished by 1963.
Partly the victim of bad timing, these policies did not earn either Frondizi or Frigerio the respect of the most powerful institution in Argentina at the time: the armed forces and in December, Frondizi was forced to remove Frigerio from his post. One of the policy makers behind this was a relatively unknown defense contractor named Alvaro Alsogaray, whose austerity plan Frondizi was forced to implement, causing a sudden doubling of consumer prices and, consequently, a fall in GDP and widespread protest. Alsogaray made frequent television appearances publicizing his plan; during the first of these, he declared that the Argentine people "must go through winter." 
Relegated to informal adviser to the president, Frigerio opposed Alsogaray's belt-tightening measures and increasingly unpopular, Alsogaray's influence quickly waned; in early 1961, he resigned. Again influencing economic policy from his informal role, Frigerio's close working relationship with the president continued until, on March 28, 1962, Arturo Frondizi was deposed while attending a Western Hemisphere summit in Montevideo, Uruguay in hopes of mediating the conflict between the U.S. and Fidel Castro's Cuba. Arrested upon his return to the Casa Rosada the following morning, Frondizi defiantly pronounced that he would ""not resign, nor commit suicide, or leave the country,"" the president was imprisoned and Frigerio, exiled in Uruguay.
Frigerio and politics.
Returning to Buenos Aires in 1963, Frigerio was reunited with Arturo Frondizi, now free. Believing that their past economic accomplishments had made a return to politics possible, the two friends founded the Integration and Development Movement (MID). MID was barred from the 1963 elections due to military opposition and serious differences over strategy resulted in an open enmity between UCRI candidate Oscar Alende (the progressive former governor of the Province of Buenos Aires and Frondizi ally) and the MID, which opted to encourage its supporters to cast blank ballots. but Many of Frigerio's policies were reinstated by the newly elected President Arturo Illia. Policy differences over Frondizi-era oil contracts, which Illia rescinded, led the MID to actively oppose him, however. Many of their policies endured following the 1966 coup, particularly during the 1970-71 tenure of Economy Minister Aldo Ferrer. Frigerio became a significant shareholder in Argentina's largest newsdaily "Clarín" following a 1971 deal made with the newsdaily's owner, Ernestina Herrera de Noble, whose late husband, "Clarín" founder Roberto Noble, had supported Frondizi. Perón's return from exile imminent, the MID opted to endorse the aging leader for the 1973 elections, believing Perón would give them a meaningful say in the nation's economic policy. 
Given little say by the new Peronist government, which, instead saw its policy shift from populism to erratic crisis management measures, Frigerio initially supported the 1976 coup against Perón's successor (his hapless widow, Isabel Perón); what ensued, however, was unlike the last military regime in that this dictatorship adopted policies largely anathema to Frigerio's. Freezing wages for prolonged stretches, deregulating financial markets and encouraging a flood of foreign debt and of imports, these policies all helped undo much of what Frondizi and Frigerio had accomplished twenty years earlier. Though Frigerio and his supporters were not targeted in the way left-wing dissidents were, the MID's opposition to the regime's chief economist, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz and his policies earned a number of party officials death threats and forced exile.
Allowing elections in 1983, the dictatorship left an insolvent Argentina, its business and consumer confidence almost shattered and its international prestige damaged following the 1982 Falklands War, an invasion Frigerio opposed. Taking up the MID's nomination for President in his first campaign for high office, Frigerio, however, refused to condemn the regime's human rights atrocities, something which deprived his longshot 1983 MID candidacy of needed support. Rogelio Frigerio fared poorly on election night, October 30, 1983 and, elected by an ample margin, UCR leader Raúl Alfonsín left Frigerio out of the economic policy discussions he held before taking office on December 10. Frigerio succeeded Frondizi as President of the MID in 1986.
Lacking representation in Congress, the MID maintained a considerable following in a number of Argentine provinces. In the Province of Formosa, where voters had fond memories of the Frondizi Administration's development projects, Frigerio leveraged this influence into an agreement with Justicialist Governor Floro Bogado for his support of developmentalist policies and a MID candidate for Congress in exchange for the MID's alliance with them in Formosa and in nearby Misiones Province, helping the Peronists wrest control of the Misiones Governor's office from the UCR in 1987. Frigerio negotiated something similar in the other end of the country, the Province of Santa Cruz; electing two MID councilwomen to the Río Gallegos City Council, Frigerio advised them to support Peronist candidates. These two city districts gave Justicialist Mayoral candidate Néstor Kirchner the deciding margin of victory in local elections in 1987 and Mayor Kirchner went on become governor and, in 2003, President of Argentina. 
Having written thirty books and numerous articles concerning the Argentine economy, he was sidestepped by the Administration of Raúl Alfonsín and his policies were only partly adopted by the Administration of Carlos Menem and by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, whose reforms attracted foreign investment and helped lead to a sorely needed modernization of Argentine industry; Menem-era privatizations, however, yielded very mixed results and the combination of downsizing and higher productivity led to an increase in unemployment after 1992 that Frigerio felt was not being addressed. He became distanced from the MID leadership, though he continued to contribute as a commentator (particularly in "Clarín", Argentina's leading newsdaily). Frigerio lost his friend, Arturo Frondizi, to Parkinson's disease in 1995, and his own health declined subsequently. Many of his ideas became national policy after a profound economic crisis bottomed out in 2002. 
Possessing an affable, self-effacing personality, he was known for his taste for whisky and broccoli and affectionately referred to as the "tapir", for his robust, compact frame. The Buenos Aires City Legislature, on August 31, 2006, voted to bestow on him the title of Illustrious Citizen of the City for his contributions to national development, the public discourse and the common cause. Scheduled to receive the recognition later that month, Rogelio Frigerio died in his Belgrano neighborhood home on September 13, 2006, at the age of ninety-one. His widow, Noemí, and his son, Octávio, accepted the recognition the following day and the renowned economist's body lay in state at the City Legislature.

United States presidential election in California, 1964

In the 1964 United States presidential election, the state of California voted for the incumbent Democratic President, Lyndon B. Johnson, in a landslide over the Republican nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona.
As Johnson won nationally in a massive landslide, taking 61.05% of the vote nationwide, and dominating many Northeastern and Midwestern states by record landslide margins, California actually weighed in as about 4% more Republican than the national average in the 1964 election. Johnson dominated in more liberal Northern California, breaking 60% in many counties and even breaking 70% in Plumas County and the city of San Francisco. However the Western Conservative Goldwater, from neighboring Arizona, did hold some appeal in Southern California, where Johnson failed to break 60% in a single county and Goldwater even won two heavily populated Southern California counties, Orange County, and San Diego County, holding Johnson below the 60% mark statewide. 
Although California has become a strongly Democrat state in recent elections, this was the only presidential election between 1952 and 1992 where the state was carried by a Democrat. Johnson is also the last Democrat to carry the counties of Calaveras, Colusa, Glenn, Inyo, Kern, Modoc and Tulare, and the last to win the majority of the vote in Butte, El Dorado, Mariposa, Siskiyou and Tuolumne counties (Although some Democrats since have won a plurality in those counties).

Pierzchnica

Pierzchnica is a village in Kielce County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) of Gmina Pierzchnica. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 870.
In the late Middle Ages, Pierzchnica was a royal village, first mentioned in documents from 1336. It is not known when it was granted a town charter – it happened between 1359 and 1397, during the reign of either Kazimierz Wielki or Wladyslaw Jagiello. The name of the town was spelled as either Pyrzsznycza or Pyersnicza (1579). According to Jan Dlugosz, the town remained a royal property, with its wooden church. In 1497, King Jan Olbracht allowed Pierzchnica to organize markets on every Tuesday. In 1512, the Magdeburg rights town charter for Pierzchnica was confirmed, after the original document had burned in a fire. Nevertheless, Pierzchnica remained a small and poor town, with 50 houses in 1621, much smaller than Szydlow. Furthermore, it was burned to the ground during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1656).
Until the Partitions of Poland, Pierzchnica remained in private hands, and was part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1789, the town had a wooden town hall, with 70 houses (65 Catholic and 5 Jewish). In 1798–1800, while part of the Habsburg Empire, the former Voivode of Sandomierz Maciej Soltyk funded a new, stone church of St. Margaret, which replaced the wooden complex. In 1815, Pierzchnica became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1827, it had 111 houses and the population of 641, which grew to almost 1,000 by 1862. Its residents actively supported the January Uprising, for which Pierzchnica was stripped of its town charter in 1869.

2008 Summer Paralympics torch relay

The torch relay for the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games was held between August 28 and September 6 in eleven cities, and also included the tomb of Yellow Emperor.
Planned Route.
In 2007, the BOCOG announced the torch relay route, composed of three parts:
Change of the route.
In June 2008, the Beijing Games' Organizing Committee announced that the planned four international torch relay cities and four national cities for the Paralympic Games had been cancelled. The Committee stated that the relay was being cancelled to enable the Chinese government to "focus on the rescue and relief work" following the Sichuan earthquake. The torch relay was held exclusively within China.
Despite the officially stated reason for the cancellation, "The Guardian" attributed it to China's wish to avoid "a repeat of the protests" which had occurred in a number of cities around the world during the Olympics torch relay. Similarly, "The Times" wrote: "China has cancelled the international leg of the Paralympic torch relay, which was due to pass through London, in an apparent attempt to avoid similar protests to those that dogged the Olympic torch’s global tour." Reuters reported simply: "China, whose Beijing Olympic torch relay was dogged by protest overseas, on Wednesday cancelled the international leg of the Paralympic torch relay, giving the devastating Sichuan earthquake as the reason."
The route.
The relay started from Tiantan on August 28 and then divided to two parallel lines before coming together in Beijing:
Final Relay in Main Stadium.
Chinese athletes with disabilities carried the torch in Beijing National Stadium during the Games' Opening Ceremony. Jin Jing carried the torch into the stadium, before it was passed on to Paralympic gold medallists Wu Yunhu, Zhang Hongwei, Zhang Haidong, Sun Changting and Hou Bin. Hou then pulled himself up on a rope to the top of the stadium to light the Paralympic flame.

Roger Dale Stafford

Roger Dale Stafford (November 4, 1951 – July 1, 1995) was a convicted spree killer and serial killer sentenced to death and executed for the 1978 Lorenz-Sirloin Stockade murders.
Crimes.
Stafford began his killing spree by killing 20 year old Jimmy Earl Berry, a student at The University of North Alabama, working as an assistant manager at the McDonalds restaurant in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Stafford, 27 years old at time, was charged with shooting Berry four times and robbing the restaurant of $1400.00. The crime referred to as "The McDonalds murder", remained unsolved until four years after the incident, when Stafford was implicated by his wife Verna. It was believed by Muscle Shoals police that his brother Harold was also involved. He was never extradited to Alabama to stand trial because of the Oklahoma murder convictions. He continued on with his murder spree along with his wife, Verna, and brother, Harold, on June 22, 1978. His wife flagged down the Lorenz family on the side of Interstate 35 near Purcell, Oklahoma, when Melvin Lorenz, 38, his wife, Linda, 31, and their son Richard, 12, were traveling to North Dakota for the funeral of Melvin Lorenz's mother. After the Lorenz family stopped to help, Stafford then robbed and murdered the entire family.
Three weeks later, he murdered six employees at a Sirloin Stockade restaurant in Oklahoma City during a robbery.
Capture and trial.
Six days after the Sirloin Stockade robbery, Harold Stafford died in a motorcycle accident in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Police traced a woman who went to see his body at a local funeral home to Chicago, Illinois, where they found and arrested Verna Stafford. They soon apprehended Roger Stafford as well. He was tried and convicted of all nine murders, and sentenced to death. His wife Verna testified against him, and divorced him while he was on death row. (She was sentenced to two life terms for her part in the crimes.) He remarried while awaiting execution.
Execution.
Stafford was executed in Oklahoma by lethal injection on July 1, 1995. In his last words, he proclaimed his innocence and his love for the wife he married in prison.

Last Seen Wearing (Dexter novel)

Last Seen Wearing is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the second novel in the Inspector Morse series.
The novel was dramatised by Thomas Ellice for the television series, first transmitted in 1988. In 1994, it was dramatised by Guy Meredith for BBC Radio 4.
Synopsis.
A man, later known to be Donald Phillipson, goes for an interview in Oxford to be headmaster of a school, later known to be the Roger Bacon Comprehensive School in Oxford. At the bus stop a girl gets into conversation with him and later seduces him. She turns out to be a girl from the school, Valerie Taylor, and a year later she goes missing.
Two years after that Inspector Morse picks up the case following a road accident in which Chief Inspector Ainley was killed. A mysterious letter arrives apparently from Valerie, but Morse is convinced Valerie must be dead and tries to find out what happened on the day she disappeared. She went home from school for lunch and was last seen by a lollipop man carrying a bag. Morse discovers she was pregnant and suspects she had been sent off for an abortion.
The plot thickens when Reginald Baines, another teacher at the school, is found murdered at his house near Oxford Station. Three suspicious characters had been near his house—Mrs Phillipson, Valerie Taylor’s mum, seen wearing her distinctive cherry coloured coat, and David Acum, a French teacher who had taught Valerie’s last lesson. Morse also suspects Acum’s wife, but rejects this when he discovers she is living in North Wales and does not drive.
Radio play.
In 1994 the BBC Radio 4 play "Last Seen Wearing" dramatised from the novel by Guy Meredith had John Shrapnel playing Morse and Robert Glenister as Lewis, with Miles Anderson as Donald Phillipson, Melinda Walker as Sheila Phillipson, Donald Sumpter as George Taylor, Frances Jeater as Gwen Taylor, Terence Edmond as Reginald Baines, Tamsin Greig as Valerie Taylor, John Hartley as Chief Supt. Strange, and Emily Woof as "Versatile Vera". The play was directed by Ned Chaillet.

Edward Thornton (1766–1852)

Sir Edward Thornton (22 October 1766 – 3 July 1852) was a British diplomat, and father of Sir Edward Thornton (1817–1906). 
He was born in London, the third son of an innkeeper, but orphaned at an early age. He was educated at Christ's Hospital and at Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1902 Christ's Hospital named one of its boarding houses after him. 
He became British vice-consul in Maryland in June 1793 and was ambassador to the United States from 1800 to 1804. He was then posted to Sweden as minister-plenipotentiary in December 1807 with the objective of forming an alliance against Napoleon, returning to England in November 1808. In October 1811 he went again to Sweden (until 1817) on a special mission in HMS Victory and he successfully negotiated treaties of alliance with both Sweden and Russia. This was the first stage in the creation of an alliance of Northern European States against Napoleon. He negotiated the Treaty of Kiel for the United Kingdom and was present with the prince royal of Sweden (Jean Baptiste Bernadotte) when the allies entered Paris in 1815. 
He became a member of the Privy council in 1816. He was appointed minister to Portugal in July 1817 and joined the Portuguese court in Brazil. He was ambassador to Portugal from April 1819 to March 1821, when he returned to England. He returned again to Portugal as an ambassador from August 1823 to August 1824 during which time he invested the King of Portugal with the Order of the Garter and assisted the King during the insurrection. Thornton was created count of Cassilhas in the Portuguese nobility by the King of Portugal.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1810, appointed GCB in 1822 and retired in August 1824. He had married in 1812 Wilhelmina Kohp of Hanover with whom he had one daughter and six sons. In retirement he lived in Wembury House, Plymouth, Devon, where he died in 1852.

2009 Coca-Cola 600

The 2009 Coca-Cola 600, the longest race of the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup season in terms of distance, was the twelfth race of the thirty-six race season. It was also the 50th running of the race, and in celebration thereof Lowe's Motor Speedway painted the outside retaining walls gold. This race was originally scheduled to be held on May 24, 2009 at 5:30 PM US EDT at the Lowe's Motor Speedway in the Charlotte, North Carolina suburb of Concord. However, an evening-long rain postponed the event until 12 noon US EDT May 25. Fox televised and radio was handled by Performance Racing Network (over-the-air) and Sirius XM Radio (satellite).
The race was the shortest Coca-Cola 600 in history by distance, running only 227 laps.
Firsts.
David Reutimann won his first race in the Sprint Cup Series. It was also the first win for Michael Waltrip Racing in the Sprint Cup Series and the first for Michael Waltrip as an owner. This was the first win for a car with the number 00 in Sprint Cup history and the first win for Toyota at Lowe's Motor Speedway in the Cup series. Also, due to the rainout, this marked the first time the actual race was held on Memorial Day.
Pre-Race festivities.
Air Force Tops In Blue sang the national anthem. Bobby Allison, the race's grand marshal, gave the command to start engines. (It was not televised on Monday, instead it was preempted by commercials.)
Race.
Ryan Newman and Kyle Busch started at the front row followed by Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin in the second row, and Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne in the third row. Newman decided to start the race from the outside, switching positions with Kyle Busch.
At 12:12pm EDT, the green flag waved marking the start of the 50th running of the Coca-Cola 600.
After lap 1, Ryan Newman led the first lap with Kyle Busch in second and Mark Martin in third. Two laps later, Kyle Busch took the lead from Newman out of turn 4. On lap 7, the caution flag was waved for light rain. Before the caution, Brian Vickers was in fifth place after starting in eighth and Denny Hamlin was in eighth after starting in thirteenth place. Dale Earnhardt, Jr., starting in 27th, was in 31st place. Eleven drivers entered pit road. Among them were Earnhardt Jr., Kevin Harvick, Michael Waltrip, Greg Biffle, and Matt Kenseth.
For the restart on lap 12, Kyle Busch was in first followed by Newman, Martin, Kahne, and Vickers. Shortly after, Harvick and Sam Hornish, Jr. made contact on the backstretch. On lap 17, Harvick made contact with the outside wall entering turn 1 causing damage to his car and bringing out a caution. Kyle Busch reported an electrical fire problem with his car.
On lap 19, the race restarted, with Kyle Busch, Newman, Martin, Kahne, and Gordon in the top five. By lap 35, Kyle Busch had opened a two-second lead over second place Mark Martin. Tony Stewart, starting in 28th, was in 15th. During the pit stops on lap 42 after a competition caution, Johnson exited in first place (gained sixteen positions), followed by Kyle Busch and Martin. Newman had to come back to pit road for a lugnut replacement. Mike Bliss drove his car to the garage.
The restart was on lap 45 with Johnson, Kyle Busch, Martin, Kurt Busch, and Denny Hamlin in the top five. On lap 51, Kyle Busch regained the lead from Johnson with Martin in second. By lap 55, Johnson, with a loose car, had fallen to the sixth position. Rain returned by lap 71, resulting in yet another caution. On the pit stops that followed, Carl Edwards gained ten positions, Jamie McMurray gained sixteen spots, Reutiman gained seven spots, and Martin Truex, Jr. gained thirteen positions. Vickers lost six spots. The crew of Mark Martin lost a tire from their pitbox resulting in a penalty for Martin. Robby Gordon stayed out and led a lap. Waltrip and Scott Riggs also stayed out. Approximately 55 minutes after the start of the race, the red flag was waved on lap 74 for rain. Robby Gordon, Waltrip, Riggs, Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards, Reutimann, McMurray, Joey Logano, Kahne, and Juan Pablo Montoya made up the top ten at that time.
This red flag period lasted 54 minutes before caution laps resumed. Robby Gordon, Waltrip, and Riggs made pit stops under the caution. Each of the three had a led at least a lap. The restart on lap 79 with Kyle Busch, Edwards, Reutimann, McMurray, and Logano in the top five. Martin was served a penalty from the last pit stop and dropped to 37th place. By lap 87, Kyle Busch opened a two-second lead over second place Reutimann. On lap 93, McMurray dropped from fourth to 10th and Reutimann fell two spots from second after making contact with the outside wall of turn 4. Meanwhile, Dale Earnhardt Jr. continued to fight an ill-handling car and on lap 111, leader Kyle Busch placed Earnhardt, Jr. a lap down. On lap 120, Vickers took the lead from Kyle Busch. As of lap 122, Joe Nemechek, Waltrip, Harvick, and Max Papis, running 38th through 41st respectively, were a lap down. Green flag pit stops began at that point. On lap 129, Montoya took second from Kyle Busch. Logano led lap 131. Reutimann and David Gilliland were deemed too fast on pit road and served penalties. Meanwhile, Dave Blaney led two laps under green flag pit stops. Blaney's stop on lap 134 ended the cycle and Kyle Busch regained the lead, followed by Vickers, Montoya, Kahne, and Johnson. Vickers took the lead on lap 146, and by lap 161, he had opened a 2.2 second lead over Montoya.
Historic moment of silence.
On lap 163, race officials threw the red caution flag, and ordered the cars to shut down the engines on the front stretch for a moment of silence in honor of those who died in the service of America's military. This moment took place at 3:00 pm EDT; the time was chosen because it coincides with that traditionally set aside by American tradition on Memorial Day. Members of pit crews and fans stood in observance, while drivers quietly reflected by their cars. Although this moment was not originally planned - and indeed would not have occurred if the race had not been postponed the day before - it reportedly met with praise from drivers, crews and fans.
Pit stops and resumption of race.
During the pit stops, Edwards gained six spots, Jeff Gordon gained twelve spots, Montoya lost three positions, and Vickers lost nine spots. Rain came and delayed the waving of the green flag. On lap 177, the red flag was waved for rain for the second time in the race three hours and eight minutes since the start. Kyle Busch, Kahne, Johnson, Edwards, Montoya, Logano, Kenseth, Jeff Gordon, Hamlin, and Vickers are in the top ten when the red flag waved.
The field restarted on lap 180 at 3:42 p.m. EDT. Twenty six cars were on the lead lap as they took the green flag. On lap 182, Logano took fifth from Montoya and Johnson took second from Kahne. Seven laps later, Montoya, running in 7th, reported his car has tighten up. Kurt Busch, running in 15th, entered pit road for a two tire change on lap 193 because of vibrations. Kurt Busch re-entered the race in 38th, one lap down. On lap 208, seven laps after halfway, Kyle Busch had a 2.4 second lead over Kasey Kahne. Kyle's brother, Kurt, advanced four spots from 38th since the pitstop for vibrations. On lap 213, Kenseth, running in 7th, reported his car has tightened up. 
Eight laps later, rain hit the track again and forced another yellow flag for rain. On the ensuing stops, Edwards gained two spots, Vickers five spots, and Labonte seven spots. Johnson lost four spots. Reutimann, Newman, and Robby Gordon stayed on the track.
On lap 227, third red flag of the race was waved with Reutimann, Newman, Robby Gordon, Edwards, Vickers, Kyle Busch, Kahne, Montoya, Logano, and Kenseth in the top ten. Hours later the race was called official giving Reutimann his first Cup series win in 76 starts. Newman, the polesitter, finished in second in his Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Robby Gordon finished third, his first top 5 finish since the 2007 Watkins Glen race Carl Edwards had the highest finishing Ford in fourth place. Kyle Busch had led the most laps (173), finished sixth. Kasey Kahne, the defending winner, had the highest finishing Dodge in seventh. Rookie Joey Logano finished ninth. Bill Elliott, in his 800 career start, finished 15th. Marcos Ambrose, the last driver on the lead lap, came in 26th.

Ethylvanillin

Ethylvanillin is the organic compound with the formula (C2H5O)(HO)C6H3CHO. This colorless solid consists of a benzene ring with hydroxyl, ethoxy, and formyl groups on the 4, 3, and 1 positions, respectively.
Preparation.
Ethylvanillin is a synthetic molecule, not found in nature. It is prepared via several steps from catechol, beginning with ethylation to give "guethol" (1). This ether condenses with glyoxylic acid to give the corresponding mandelic acid derivative (2), which via oxidation (3) and decarboxylation gives ethylvanillin (4).
Application.
As a flavorant, ethylvanillin is about three times as potent as vanillin and is used in the production of chocolate.
The molecule revolutionized both the design and aesthetics of olfactory art; artist Aimé Guerlain used it in "Jicky" (1889), one of the earliest uses of the synthetic molecules that freed scent artists from the limits of natural materials.

George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau

George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau ( – Dessau, 21 September 1474), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau.
He was the second son of Sigismund I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Judith, daughter of Gebhard XI, Count of Querfurt.
Life.
In 1405, after the death of his father, George inherited the principality of Anhalt-Dessau alongside his older brother Waldemar IV and his younger brothers Sigismund II and Albert V. By 1435, he adopted the style "Lord of Zerbst and Dessau" and styled himself "Lord of Köthen" from 1460.
In 1468 he inherited the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg, then three years later (in 1471) signed a succession contract with the Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, that named him as "Mitherr" (co-ruler) with rights to half of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. George renounced his rights, however, in favor of his eldest son Waldemar VI, who became the new co-ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen.
The deaths of George's brothers between 1417-1469 without male heirs left him as the sole ruler of Anhalt-Dessau until his own death.
Marriages and Issue.
After 1413, George married Matilda (d. Coswig, bef. 1432), daughter of Otto III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. The spouses were related to each other as direct descendants of Henry I, Count of Anhalt, through his sons Bernhard I of Anhalt-Bernburg (ancestor of Matilda), and Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst (ancestor of George). The marriage was childless.
In 1432 George married for a second time to Euphemia (b. ca. 1404? - d. 27 November 1442), daughter of Konrad III the Old, Duke of Oleśnica and widow of Albert III, Elector of Saxony. They had six daughters:
After 1442, George married for a third time to Sophie (d. 1451), possibly a member of the House of Hohnstein. They had three children:
Before 25 July 1452 George married for a fourth time to Anna (b. ca. 1430 – d. Lippehne, 9 July 1513), daughter of Albert VIII, Count of Lindow-Ruppin. They had nine children:

Please Turn Over

Please Turn Over is a 1959 British comedy film written by Norman Hudis and directed by Gerald Thomas. It featured Ted Ray, Julia Lockwood, Jean Kent, Joan Sims, Leslie Phillips, Charles Hawtrey, Lionel Jeffries and Victor Maddern. An English village is thrown into chaos when the daughter of one of the residents publishes a book detailing the supposed secrets of the inhabitants. It was based on the play "Book of the Month" by Basil Thomas.
Plot.
In the quiet suburbs of an English town, seventeen-year-old Jo Halliday lives a fairly boring life working as a hairdresser and living at home, with her nagging mother, pompous father, and fitness obsessed Aunt. Her father, an accountant, continually wishes that his dreamy, untidy daughter could be more like his secretary Miss Jones.
One morning the local newspaper reveals that she has authored a book - The Naked Revolt - which is an instant bestseller. It tells the story of a young girl who discovers the truth about her family and neighbours, and flees to London to become a prostitute.
Unfortunately the town's residents believe the book to be a true reflection of the family. Her father finds himself under suspicion at work, as his colleagues believe he has been stealing money, and her mother is regarded as a harlot who has been conducting a twenty-year affair with a retired army officer who gives her driving lessons. Her local Doctor is painted as a philanderer who is sexually involved with a number of his patients while ignoring the desperate advances of his drunken assistant, Jo's Aunt.
In fact none of these things are true, her father is scrupulously honest and in love with her mother. The local Doctor is a shy man, and the former army officer is simply a driving instructor. Jo has left town for London with a young playwright who is interested in turning her book into a play. After discovering they are kindred spirits, the two become engaged.
When they return home Jo is confronted by her angry family and neighbours. The Doctor is threatening to sue, and her father and mother have even begun questioning each other's fidelity.

Maurice Warwick Beresford, MA, FBA, (6 February 1920 – 15 December 2005) was an English economic historian and medieval archaeologist.
Academic career.
Born in Sutton Coldfield, Beresford was educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School and Jesus College, Cambridge (MA). He was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, doing social work in Birmingham and London. 
Beresford became a Lecturer at the University of Leeds in 1948 and was appointed Professor of Economic History at Leeds in 1959, a post he was to hold until his retirement in 1985 when he was given the title Emeritus Professor.
Beresford was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1985.
Research interests.
In 1945, while working as a warden at an adult education centre, Beresford discovered the remains of the abandoned village of Bittesby. Thus began a lifelong interest in the subject. Together with John Hurst he conducted archaeological excavations at the deserted village of Wharram Percy. This work became an important impetus for medieval archaeology in Britain and Europe.
As an undergraduate, he wrote a paper on parkland in Sutton Coldfield, the beginning of his interest in the interaction between the physical landscape and documents such as maps. This interest led to his 1957 publication, "History on the Ground".

Todd Rogers (electronic sports player)

Todd Rogers is an American video game competitor living in Brooksville, Florida who gained fame in the early 1980s for his many world record high scores and for his expertise on Activision games. He appears in several feature films: ', "The King of Kong", "King of Chinatown", "FRAG", "High Score", "The King of Con!", and '.
Biography.
Born on December 1, 1964 in Chicago, Illinois, Rogers gained local fame in 1982 at Burbank Haunted Trails for his world record on the arcade game "Gorf". On November 24, 1982, he scored 653,990 points, a world record that stood for over 26 years on the Twin Galaxies scoreboard. John P. McCann would later eclipse Rogers record on March 20, 2009. Another of Todd's accomplishments was on a home console game by Activision called Dragster. Rogers is currently recognized for being the only person to have beaten a time on this game where the computer was programed to do a certain run of a quarter mile. The computer's Dragster time was of a 5.54 and Todd beat the computer's time by 3 hundredths of a second with the quarter mile run of a 5.51. Rogers has held the Dragster world record title since December 1, 1980.
Gaming career.
Rogers was the video game industry's first player to be hired for his playing skills. During 1980-1992, Rogers appeared at The International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) as well as other gaming expositions in order to demonstrate games to the attendees. Rogers was featured in many well-publicized "Beat The Champ" contests that pitted his skills against those of the public. Rogers is recognized for being the first paid pro video gamer and has represented over 40 major software publishers. One of the first publications that Todd was featured in was a paper back book called "How To Master Home Video Games" by Tom Hirschfeld because of his Dragster skills. Rogers has been featured in an assortment of other prominent publications such as Money Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and Joystik Magazine. Rogers's publicity page on IMDB lists over 100 interviews and mentions in the media. On July 25, 1983, Walter Day founded the U.S. National Video Game Team, in 1986 Todd was accepted into this prestigious group of gamers. It was a select team of the best video game players from that era. They competed against anyone who would challenge them and traveled throughout the country showcasing their exceptional gaming skills. He went on to also promote and beta test several popular arcade games. Wacko was one of the games that he tested for the Marvin Glass company. Nintendo acquired his skills in 1986 to help shuttle the new line of Mario Brothers games. Shortly after that Sega wanted Todd to promote several contests that they were running. Rogers also helped promote games with celebrities on the games that they were featured in. These celebrities included Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Marina Sirtis, Robert Culp, Barbie Benton, and Bruce Jenner. On October 3–5, 2008 Todd joined the "Five Kings of Gaming" at the "E for All" Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Ctr to feed the homeless people of Los Angeles. Billed as "The League of Legendary Gamers," the "Kings" include some of the greatest names in gaming history, representing many different genre. The "Kings" are: Todd Rogers, Johnathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel, Billy Mitchell, Isaiah TriForce Johnson and Justin Wong. Games were supplied on each of the champions platforms the public was charged a perishable food donation to have the chance to play one on one against these champions. Also at the same venue Todd was involved in a promotion with All Games Network presenting the “Meet, Greet, and Beat the Champs” where Todd played Dragster against the public blindfolded. The prize offered to anyone who could beat him while he was blindfolded was $100.00. Todd is also an avid player of Wizard101 and is currently in the works of talking with KingsIsle to make the game Wizard101 an amazing game. Todd's character is a Necromancer named Valkoor CrowFinder.
Twin Galaxies 1999 - 2012.
Twin Galaxies has been around since 1981 as a data tracking company for high scores on video games and pinball games. Todd only had one entry into their data base in that time era; that was on "GORF", the game that he held that title record for over 26 years. He had many more world records at that time, But they were not recognized by Twin Galaxies due to the fact that Activision didn't have any involvement with the Twin Galaxies company. Todd traveled the country receiving payment for his gaming skills, while Walter Days group of gamers "U.S. National Video Game Team" even though they were the best at what they did, never got paid on a monthly basis like Todd did. Todd’s involvement with Twin Galaxies back then was only listed for that GORF game. Then in 1999, he was offered the opportunity to work hand in hand with Walter Day, doing monthly columns for the Twin Galaxies site entitled "On the home front." Todd also verified and consulted with Twin Galaxies on and off as needed when sensitive gaming issues came up. In 2000 Todd was asked to become an official Twin Galaxies referee so that he could have on the spot interaction with the current gamers at live gaming venues. In 2006 Todd's status with Twin Galaxies was upgraded to Senior Referee and once again he set the template for how game settings were tracked and recorded. In 2009 Pete Bouvier became the new owner of the Twin Galaxies Company turning the Twin Galaxies brand in a new direction focusing on many of the newer gaming titles. In 2010 Todd's title once again changed with Twin Galaxies as Walter Day stepped down as the Chief Evangelist of classic gaming, passing that title on to Todd. In the latter part of 2012, Todd resigned from Twin Galaxies. With the new administration in place Todd felt that his valued interest and shared ideals in the company was no longer needed.

Saints is a 2001 album of solo guitar recorded by Marc Ribot. It features several interpretations of compositions by Albert Ayler, as well as traditional spirituals, jazz standards, showtunes, and a song by The Beatles.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Alex Henderson states, "Ribot approaches avant-garde jazz in a very different way. "Saints" is full of discernible melodies; typically, Ribot will warmly embrace a melody before he ventures outside. And that inside/outside contrast serves him well throughout this excellent and very unpredictable CD".

Patricia Fennell

Patricia A. Fennell created the Fennell Four Phase Model for understanding and treating chronic medical and mental health conditions, trauma, and the effects of crime. Jeffrey Turner, in his book "American Families in Crisis: A Reference Handbook", considers her a nationally recognized expert in the care of chronic illnesses, trauma, forensics, and hospice care. Fennell has written several books and articles published in the media and professional press, and is CEO of Albany Health Management Associates, Inc., in Albany, New York. Her company offers counseling, case management, and training based on her model. She also lectures on these topics at professional conferences, and community meetings.
Education and experience.
Fennell graduated from The College of Saint Rose in New York State with an undergraduate sociology degree, and received her graduate degree in social work from the State University of New York at Albany.
She began her career in social work in the hospice setting. She determined that the excellent care given to the dying could be applied to individuals with chronic illnesses. In the course of time she concentrated on working, supporting, and creating a new treatment approach for chronic syndromes. Her clinical experience with individuals in managing chronic illness, other works, and publications, have earned her a reputation as an expert in the field according to a review of Fennell's book; "Managing Chronic Illness", published in "Psychiatric Services". Fennell is CEO of Albany Health Management, Inc. Her company provides counseling, consulting, professional education, and doctoral training for the State University of New York. She also engages in collaborative international research using her empirically verified "Four-Phase Model".
Four Phase Model.
Fennell created the Four Phase Model as a framework to help clinicians comprehend and manage the integration of the experiences of patients with chronic illnesses. The four phases are crisis, stabilization, resolution, and integration. She explains that her model allows for therapeutic intervention in a flexible phase-specific manner so that individuals may integrate their illness into a meaningful life despite physical limitations. An integrated systems approach is uilized to include all aspects of an individual’s chronic illness; physical/behavioral, psychological, and social/interactive. The model recognizes a patient’s needs early in chronic illness may differ from the needs in later years, and may affect various responses to treatment, be it medical or psychosocial. Study results suggest that Fennell's model accurately describes the phases of illness adaptation that persons with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) experience, and that phase models may help researchers understand disparate results seen in CFS research studies. The model may also be a useful tool for lifestyle modification in age management. Physicians, nurses, psychologists, and social workers are instructed in her courses on how to apply her approach to patients.
Certification program.
Fennell offers a certification program through The Advocate Program/American Association of Community Justice Professionals; it teaches people to apply her teachings to trauma survivors.

Icon of Evil

"Icon of Evil: Hitler's Mufti and the Rise of Radical Islam" is a 2008 book by David G. Dalin and John F. Rothmann initially published by Random House; the 2009 version of the book by Transaction Publishers has an introduction by Alan Dershowitz. It is a biography of Haj Amin al-Husseini (1895-1974), who was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem during the British Mandate period. Some reviewers were critical of its "overtly propagandistic" style, citing numerous factual errors and criticizing its thesis that a direct line can be drawn from the Mufti to modern-day Islamic leaders as unconvincing and lacking evidence. Other reviewers praised the book, one describing it as "the first serious biography of the mufti to appear in 14 years".
Summary.
The book portrays Husseini, a member of an important Jerusalem Arab family, as an anti-Semite and a key figure in infusing the modern Arab world with anti-Semitic attitudes. It asserts that Husseini's views were the "casus belli" for virtually all modern Middle Eastern terrorism - "an unbroken chain of terror from Adolf Hitler, Haj Amin al-Husseini, Sayyid Qutb, and Yasser Arafat to Hamas' founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, Sheikh Omar Abd al-Rahman, and Ramzi Yousef, who planned the World Trade Center bombings of 1993, to Osama bin Laden and Mohamed Atta, to Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the Pakistani Muslim terrorist who planned the kidnapping and murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl, and to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad."
Reviews.
"Icon of Evil" received a strongly critical response from some reviewers. Simon Maxwell Apter, writing in the "San Francisco Chronicle", describes the book as "cursory and apparently hastily written" and "bereft of any nuance or counterargument" for its insistence on blaming the mufti for "anything and everything Islamist". Acknowledging that Husseini had indeed played an important role in inciting anti-Jewish violence, Apter concludes that "Icon of Evil" presents a distorted simplification of history: "To claim that "Icon of Evil" paints a black-and-white view of history does the book too much justice; it's an entirely black - or entirely white - story told here." 
The Israeli historian Tom Segev, writing in the "New York Times", criticized the book as "of little scholarly value, and may be potentially harmful to Middle East peace prospects." Segev highlights the authors' consistent failure to provide solid evidence, for instance asserting on the basis of rumors that Husseini owed his position to a "passionate homosexual relationship" with a senior British official, and the degree to which the authors "blur the terms radical Islam, anti-Semitism and Nazism" and group together numerous Arabs and Muslims as "disciples of the mufti." He concludes: "[The book is worth noticing, as it belongs to a genre of popular Arab-bashing that is often believed to be 'good for Israel.' It is not. The suggestion that Israel's enemies are Nazis, or the Nazis' heirs, is apt to discourage any fair compromise with the Palestinians, and that is bad for Israel."
Benny Morris, an Israeli historian, commends the authors for "putting their finger on important affinities" but criticises the quality of their work, describing 'Icon of Evil" as a "bad book": "they decidedly over-reach, and, given the poverty of their scholarship, they often fail to persuade, leaving the reader with the bad taste of propaganda." He comments that they "suffer not from pedantry but from overtly propagandistic aims. They are constantly beating an ideological drum. Their adjectives are a giveaway. Every anti-Semite or anti-Semitic text is 'virulent' or 'notorious.'" The book "abounds with errors of fact", and Morris describes as "obscene" the authors' digression into a counterfactual history in which the Nazis won the Second World War and exterminated the Jews of Palestine with Husseini's assistance. Despite this, Morris allows that "much of what book says is soberingly truthful and to the point" 
James Srodes of "The Washington Times" describes "Icon of Evil", as "another attempt to take a valid avenue for historical exploration and hype its sales" by drawing questionable links between Islamism and Hitler. Srodes comments that Husseini's story "is important enough without embroidering it with swastikas", noting the role that Husseini played in fomenting anti-Jewish riots and murders in British-ruled Palestine. However, he criticizes the authors' rendering of the story as "shameful hype" that "merely confuses the larger story ... try[ing to draw a direct line from Adolf Hitler to al-Husseini and then to his distant cousin Yasser Arafat, let alone to Saddam Hussein." 
"Kirkus Reviews" is similarly critical, noting that although the authors had done extensive archival research "their book is not a piece of sophisticated scholarship" and takes "reflexively pro-Israel positions". The book starts out as "insightful examination of a rarely studied aspect of World War II — the collaboration of Islamic political parties and Middle East regimes with the Nazis — [but quickly evolves into a brief for the neoconservative worldview." The authors present "questionable broad-brush analysis" and "more speculation than is usually found in history books".
"Book News" notes that the book's discussion of Husseini's fascist activities is "relatively uncontroversial". It criticizes the authors for choosing interpretations that paint the mufti in a bad light whenever multiple interpretations are possible, and states that the thesis that Husseini can be connected to modern day opponents of Israel and the US in the Middle East is "significantly weaker".
Other reviewers viewed the book favorably. Martin Sieff of "The Washington Times" write that 'the authors tell this story soberly and well", and describes the book as "valuable" and "the first serious biography of the mufti to appear in 14 years". His main criticism is that the book is too short, and does not include materiel from German archives, which he proposes that the authors be encouraged to remedy with an expanded 2nd edition. 
Writing in the "Jerusalem Post", Jonathan Schanzer takes a more positive view, describing "Icon of Evil" as an "exceptional" history that "paints a stark picture of Husseini's ties to the Nazis and his dangerous role in the Third Reich" and identifies "numerous parallels between the murderous Nazi ideology of the 1940s and the murderous jihadist ideology that dominates headlines today." However, like Morris he criticises the authors' detour into counterfactual history, calling it "an unnecessary tangent."
Jonathan S. Tobin of The Jewish Exponent also commends the authors for seeking to shine "a spotlight on a figure who deserves far greater attention than he has received in recent decades", but is critical of their "lack of original research", "sometimes uninformed guesses" and "egregious speculation that adds little of value to the existing literature on the subject", in particular the "especially annoying" use of counterfactual history. Nonetheless, he concludes: "Despite its flaws, Dalin and Rothman's book is on target when it concludes that Husseini was a seminal figure not only in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, but in the culture of the Muslim world."
The British writer David Pryce-Jones notes that "Icon of Evil" relies entirely on English sources, "ignoring the extensive literature in German and Arabic" including Husseini's own memoirs. The book is "long on indignation, more a brisk polemic than anything else." It engages in speculation, with "the tell-tale phrases 'one can imagine,' 'there can be little doubt' and 'it is not implausible to speculate' all appear on the same page."
John R. Bradley, a writer on Middle Eastern affairs, comments in "The Straits Times" that the book "makes a convincing case that Al-Husseini even had knowledge of and encouraged the Final Solution and should have been tried as a war criminal at Nuremberg." However, the second half of the book is "an absurd and self-contradictory effort" that is "undermined still more by truly shoddy scholarship." He suggests that the authors' motivation is "to link all criticism of Israel to anti-Semitism, and so implicitly damn all criticism of Zionism as effectively offering support for Al-Qaeda and its affiliates" and concludes that "Icon of Evil" is "most useful as an example of how history is distorted by those who use it only to promote a crude ideological agenda."
Marvin Olasky, editor of the American magazine "WORLD", interviewed the authors Dalin and Rothmann about their book, in particular their claim of al-Husseini’s "lifelong sponsorship of terrorism" and their claim that Al-Husseini became part of Hitler’s “inner circle in Berlin, working closely with the top Nazi leaders, including von Ribbentrop, Himmler, and Eichmann” and agreed with their claims and conclusions.

Zachełmie Quarry.
A former limestone quarry is located near the village. The rocks are part of the Świętokrzyskie (Holy Cross) Mountains, once on the southern coast of Laurasia, and have yielded 395-million-year-old fossil footprints of tetrapods. These are believed to be the oldest tracks of four-legged animals known to palaeontologists, pushing back their estimated evolution by more than 18 million years. The finding also suggests that the first vertebrates to walk on land may have evolved in marine tidal flats or lagoons, likely dining on animals washed up with the tides, rather than in freshwater habitats.

Piskorowice (, "Pyskorovychi") is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Leżajsk, within Leżajsk County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It lies approximately south-east of Leżajsk and north-east of the regional capital Rzeszów.
In Piskorowice and outlying villages a massacre of between 160 - 400 ethnic Ukrainians led by members of the National Military Organization of the "Wolyniak" group, aided by Polish civilians, took place on April 16, 1945 sometimes referred to as part of the wider Pawłokoma massacres. 
[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PiskorowiceMemorial.JPG]
A personal report translated from the Ukrainian Wikipedia:
"On the night of April 17 to April 18, 1945 Polish armed bandits of the National Military Connection led by Józefa Zadzierskiego (pseudonym "native of Volyn") conducted a massacre at the school with nearly 200 Ukrainian residents of Pyskorovych and surrounding villages. Under the protection of several Red Army soldiers they were expected to transport the villagers for "Voluntary" resettlement to the USSR. It is estimated there were nearly 700 citizens of Ukrainian nationality from Pyskorovych and surrounding settlements who fell victim to Polish underground military units in the years 1944-1947.
In the village of Piskorovychi/Piskorowice in the cemetery there are monuments to the victims of the Polish slaughter, the burial place of 5-10 named people, and in one grave inscription is hidden 386 Ukrainians destroyed in 1945, where a monument has been erected by Ukrainian Canadians. It is not known how many people perished in the San river, where armed bandits waited for people crossing from Leżajsk that were returning home from Germany and elsewhere. It was said the river was red with human blood. In the village school were gathered the people for resettlement. On that evening the NKVD guard was recalled to Yaroslav, and militia of 10,000 Poles led by the nickname "native of Volyn" and "hairy" surrounded all the villages on the river San and made their final action. On the rest of the villages there is little information, we write only about Piskorovychi here because there was killed my mother's sister and brother Bazylevych Mykhailin and Paul (Mykhailin was a widow, and Paul escaped the field near the village, for some days crows pecked his body). People were off on the second floor of the school so crowded that then the corpses could not be pulled out. It was packed, and they were fired upon from the bottom of the first floor with machines guns. Blood flowed on the walls and the first floor was filled with blood. "
Village Pyskorovychi along with s. Pawlokoma (366 victims), p. Gorajec (198 victims), p. Birch (180 victims), p. Malkovich (154 victims), and c. Bahiv (90 victims) was a symbol of cruelty of the Polish armed groups against civilians of the Ukrainian population during the Polish-Ukrainian War 1943-1948 biennium
December 2, 2007 at the school premises with. Pyskorovychi a memorial table in Polish and Ukrainian languages following text: "In memory of the inhabitants of Ukrainian nationality Pyskorovych and neighborhoods murdered in this house in April 1945."

Moloch (film)

Moloch () is a 1999 Russian biographical drama film directed by Alexander Sokurov. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Yuri Arabov and Marina Koreneva. It portrays Adolf Hitler as a humanized figure, living life in an unassuming manner during an abrupt journey to the Bavarian Alps. The film stars actors Leonid Mozgovoy, Yelena Rufanova, Vladimir Bogdanov, and Leonid Sokol in principal roles. "Moloch" explores companionship, intimacy and dictatorship.
A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by a number of studios including; Arte, Fabrica, Fusion Product, Goskino and Lenfilm Studio. It was commercially distributed by Koch Lorber Films. Following its release, the film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and won other awards selections, including those from the Russian Guild of Film Critics Awards. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews before its initial screening in 1999.
Plot.
During the spring of 1942, a few months before the notorious Battle of Stalingrad, Adolf Hitler (Leonid Mozgovoy) retires to his secluded Berghof Retreat nestled on a remote hilltop, within Berchtesgaden in Bavaria to unite with his long-time female companion Eva Braun (Yelena Rufanova). At the residence, Braun spends her spare time with trivial pursuits such as whimsically dancing in the nude, humming to military style marching band music, and rummaging through Hitler's personal belongings. Later, Braun is thrilled to learn that her beloved ""Adi"", as she affectionately calls him, will be joining her for a visit. Hitler is accompanied by guests Joseph Goebbels (Leonid Sokol), Magda Goebbels (Yelena Spiridonova), Martin Bormann (Vladimir Bogdanov) and a priest (Anatoli Shvedersky) for conversation and playful banter.
During his stop-over, Hitler raves and rants on topics ranging from food, health and climate change to wartime politics during interactions with his immediate personnel. After roaming through the mountainous landscape, Hitler voices triumph upon hearing of Germany's strategic victorious military sieges, as well as in a scene of political satire, he also claims to have never heard of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Towards the conclusion of Hitler's trip, Braun reminds him that no one can escape death or is infallible; trying to expose a hidden weakness within him as he embarks with his motorcade to continue Nazi Germany's military campaign.
Production.
Filming.
Directed by Russian filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, the film is the first in Sokurov's biographical trilogy. It was succeeded by "Taurus" (2000), about Vladimir Lenin, "The Sun" (2005), involving Japanese emperor Hirohito, and "Faust" (2011), based on the old German legend Faust. For production, Sokurov employed Russian actors from Saint Petersburg to shoot the film, but their voices were later dubbed by German theater actors from Berlin.
Reception.
Critical response.
Critical reaction to the film was mixed. Among reviews, Derek Elley of "Variety" noted, "There are no new revelations in this portrayal of an arrogant madman and his sycophants, and though impressive at first, Sokurov's glacial treatment, with its deliberately soft-focus look, pales after a while." More enthusiastically, Jim Hoberman of "The Village Voice" wrote, ""Moloch" is lurid without being commercial. Evoking the German romantic landscape he synthesized for Mother and Son, Sokurov places his characteristic understatement at the service of borderline kitsch." Likewise, Jason Anderson of "Eye Weekly" gave the film a five-star rating, commenting, "Though he hopes to extract the man from the mythology, he doesn't merely humanize a figure in any conventional sense, as "Downfall" did to Hitler with troubling results."
Accolades.
The film won four awards at the Russian Guild of Film Critics Awards 1999, including; Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Script. At the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, the film won the Best Screenplay Award. It was also chosen as Russia's official Best Foreign Language Film submission at the 72nd Academy Awards, but did not manage to receive a nomination.

The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn

The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the third novel in Inspector Morse series.
Synopsis.
The Oxford Foreign Examinations Syndicate runs school exams in the Persian Gulf and other places with a British connection. The Secretary Dr Bartlett and Mr Roope, a chemistry don and a member of the committee, disagree about the appointment of a new member of staff. Roope gets his way and Nicholas Quinn, a deaf man who lipreads, gets the job.
When Quinn is found murdered in his maisonette all the staff are under suspicion. There is Bartlett, his deputy Ogleby and the attractive Monica Height, who has liaisons with some of the others - especially young Donald Martin. Strangely, nearly all of them, including Quinn, appear to have tickets for The Nymphomaniac at Studio 2 in Walton Street on the afternoon of the murder. When later Ogleby is himself found murdered, a neat drawing of Quinn’s ticket is found in his diary.
Morse tries to deduce which of the others is the murderer but keeps getting it wrong. An intrigue involving wealthy Arabs and prior knowledge of exam papers is clearly the cause, and Quinn had found out about it and paid for it with his life.
Colin Dexter's stylistic device of introducing each chapter with either a genuine or fabricated literary quotation was first used in this book and was maintained throughout the rest of the series.
Television adaptation.
The novel was adapted as the second episode of the Inspector Morse TV series in 1987, guest starring Barbara Flynn as Monica Height, Michael Gough as Philip Ogleby, Clive Swift as Dr Bartlett, Anthony Smee as Roope, Roger Lloyd Pack as Donald Martin and Phil Nice as Nicholas Quinn. The adaptation remained faithful to the source material, the only noticeable changes being the omission of much of the material prior to Quinn's murder (the television version begins with him already employed by the syndicate), a subplot concerning Bartlett having a schizophrenic son, and the film the characters viewed being changed to Last Tango in Paris.
Radio play.
In 1996 the BBC Radio 4 play "The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn" (dramatised from the novel by Guy Meredith) had John Shrapnel playing Morse and Robert Glenister as Lewis, with Richard Pasco as Dr Bartlett, Meg Davies as Monica Height, Stephen Critchlow as Donald Martin, David Timson as Philip Ogleby, John Hartley as Dr Roope and Chief Supt. Strange, Lyndam Gregory as Sgt Dixon, and Roger May as Nicholas Quinn. The play was directed by Ned Chaillet.

SS Princess Helene

SS "Princess Helene" was a historic Canadian passenger and freight ferry operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).
"Princess Helene" was built in 1930 at Dumbarton, Scotland. She was custom designed for CPR’s Bay of Fundy service connecting the CPR's eastern mainline railway terminus at Saint John, New Brunswick with the port of Digby, Nova Scotia, which was served by a CPR subsidiary, the Dominion Atlantic Railway.
Replacing the older and smaller DAR steamer SS "Empress", "Princess Helene" could carry 500 passengers and 50 automobiles as well as large amounts of freight. Special side-loading doors moved vehicles and freight to large wharf elevators at Digby and Saint John to cope with the tidal range in the Bay of Fundy. "Princess Helene" was part of a chain of CPR's transportation system that “spanned the world” and as such she was outfitted in the style of the company's "Duchess" ocean liners. She had 43 state rooms complemented by beautiful interior fittings that exceeded the usual standards of Canada's regional ferries. Crew uniforms were modeled on the Royal Canadian Navy and each time she passed the DAR's Digby Pines Hotel, bellboys would dip the hotel's flag and salute.
Nicknamed the "Digby Boat", "Princess Helene" made her crossings without fail across the turbulent and foggy Bay of Fundy and through the dangerous waters of Digby Gut. She steamed 168,400 miles during 33 years of service, including precarious crossings during World War II where she was often escorted by Royal Canadian Navy warships and Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft because of the danger of attack by German U Boats. "Princess Helene" was replaced April 27, 1963 by the SS "Princess of Acadia", formerly the CPR’s British Columbia ferry "Princess of Nanaimo". The new ship had greater capacity for automobile and truck traffic but lacked her predecessor's grand ocean liner charm and would be replaced by another newly built vessel carrying the same name MV "Princess of Acadia" within 7 years.
Hugh "Sam" Macdonald was the longtime Chief Engineer of the SS "Princess Helene." His nephew, Donald Stovel Macdonald was a member of Pierre Trudeau's Cabinet and served as President of the Privy Council, Minister of National Defence, Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and Minister of Finance.
"Princess Helene" was sold to Chandris Lines of Greece, extensively rebuilt, and renamed "Carina II". She operated budget cruises until 1972 when she was laid up and subsequently sold for scrap several years later. A large builder’s model of "Princess Helene" is preserved today at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.

James Tramel

James Tramel (born c. 1967) is an Episcopal priest who was ordained while serving prison time for murder, and the first convict ever ordained in the Episcopal Church while still in prison. Soon after being paroled from prison in 2006, he became rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in San Francisco. He has been a public spokesman for prisoners' rights, testifying in favor of parole for juvenile offenders and supporting prisoner-victim reconciliation programs.
Tramel was 17 years old and attending Northwestern Preparatory School, a private military preparatory academy in Santa Barbara. He had been nominated to the United States Air Force Academy by Senator Barry Goldwater. On August 3, 1985, Tramel participated in the fatal stabbing of a 29-year-old transient in a park in Santa Barbara, mistaking his identity for that of a rival gang member. Tramel and his then-roommate were both sentenced to a mimimum of 15 years in prison for second-degree murder. While in prison he took correspondence courses, earning an undergraduate degree in business and a master's degree in theology. He was ordained in 2005, while still an inmate at Solano State Prison, by Bishop William E.Swing.
Swing harshly criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2004 when the governor denied Tramel's parole, calling Schwarzenegger "a 90-pound moral weakling". In March 2006, Schwarzenegger reversed his decision and paroled Tramel.
Immediately upon his parole, Tramel began serving as an assistant pastor at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Berkeley, California. On the following February he left to become rector of Trinity Church.
In July 2008, he was suspended for two years from his ministry for alleged sexual misconduct with a parishioner.

Captain Beeble

Captain Beeble is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up 16-bit cartridge game for Atari 400 and Atari 800, created by programmer Bob Connell for Inhome Software and published in 1983. This cartridge is now considered very rare.
The player moves Captain Beeble through a series of tunnels and caves by directing the thrust of his jet-pack, similar to the control in Asteroids (video game). A light gravity effect is the only external force moving Captain Beeble. 
In each level the player must pilot the captain through labyrinthine caves, dealing with Space Invaders-like "bugs" and moving blocks along the way, to retrieve a crystal and return it to the "C.P.U." -- Crystal Processing Unit -- where he began. Beeble's task is complicated by limited jet pack fuel and the volatility of the crystal. If he carries the crystal too long it explodes. Scoring is based on points, with 100 points earned for every bug killed, and 1000 points for each completed level (i.e. returned crystal).
Levels get progressively harder with the introduction of more obstacles, narrower tunnels, more bugs, and poisonous walls that cause Beeble to explode on contact.

Paolo Virno

Paolo Virno (born 1952) is an Italian philosopher, semiologist and a figurehead for the Italian Marxist movement. Implicated in belonging to illegal social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, Virno was arrested and jailed in 1979, accused of belonging to the Red Brigades. He spent several years in prison before finally being acquitted, after which he organized the publication "Luogo Comune" (lit. truism in Italian) in order to vocalize the political ideas he developed during his imprisonment. Virno Currently teaches at the University of Rome.
Biography.
Virno was born in Naples, but spent his childhood and adolescence in Genoa. He had his first political experiences when joining the social movements of 1968, - the association between personal fulfillment and anti-capitalism, typical of the "critique artiste" of the 1960s, which then constituted one of the key reasons for his political philosophy. He moved to Rome with his family at the beginning of the 1970s, where he studied philosophy in university.
Simultaneously, Virno was involved in the labour movement and campaigned in the organization "potere operaio," a Marxist group involved in the recruitment and mobilization of industrial workers; "potere operaio," unlike political communists of the Soviet Union and China, who sought to combine the student bodies with the workers unions, Potere Operaio focused mainly in factory and industrial workers in a program stemming from the dogma's of Marx's theory criticising the organization of work. Virno participated in the movement, organizing protests and strikes in northern Italian factories, until its dissolution in 1973.
In 1977 Virno presented his doctoral thesis on the concept of work and the theory of consciousness of Theodor Adorno, while actively participating in the ‘movement of ‘77’’, which was organized around the precariousness of workers. The Metropolitan magazine, which he founded along with Oreste Scalzone and Franco Piperno, was revered as the body of the intellectual movement at the time. Two years later, the editorial board of metropolitan France was jailed on charges of belonging to the Red Brigades.
The three-year period of custody was a time of intense intellectual activity for Virno and others involved. After being sentenced in 1982 to 12 years in prison for "subversive activities and which constitute "banda armata" (though the charges of belonging to the Red Brigades did not materialise), Virno appealed and was released pending trial in the second instance; in 1987 he would eventually be acquitted, along with Piperno. His experience during years were fed into the organization of the "Luogo Commune" publication, devoted to analysis of life forms in the social situation of Postfordism.
In 1993 Virno left his post as editor of "Luogo Commune" to teach philosophy at the University of Urbino. In 1996 he was invited to talk at the University of Montreal,and upon his return, he held the chair of philosophy of language, semiotics and ethics of communication at the University of Cosenza (Calabria).
Theories.
The early works of Virno were directly linked to his political participation, but after years of imprisonment, which along with his fellow prisoners, he conducted intensive studies of philosophy, and his focus on theoretical research has become more ambitious, covering political philosophy, linguistics and the study of mass media.
On the one hand, studies pertaining to philosophy of language have led to the confrontation of the classic themes of philosophy-like the analysis of subjectivity - with the limits imposed under linguistics. On the other hand, Virno has explored the ethical dimension of communication. The juncture of these fields was found to be a materialism that encompasses the processes of language and thought as a working link, keeping in line with the traditions of Adorno and Alfred Sohn-Rethel, the interrelationship between work, thought, language, society and history is the nexus of its philosophical thought.
The philosophical concepts, however, maintained a close link with theory and action-related policies; notions of "world", "power", "potential" or "history", which have been the focus of many of his works, were in fact conceived in key by Marx. Virno, along with many of his contemporaries like Antonio Negri, has abandoned and argued against the hegemony of the dialectic tradition in Marxist philosophy.
Virno maintains the status of historical and linguistic concepts as being political-state, sovereignty, obedience, legality, legitimacy, which are accepted in social theory and philosophy as invariant, although polemically are considered to have been invented in the 17th century, with very specific and controversial political objectives. The reinvention of the concepts of society is part of the political task that has been proposed, regarding the concept of exodus - perhaps the best example of this joint, where the personal experiences of emotion are understood as an act of resistance toward established power and status quo. The assumption by the personality of the flight as a reaction to the social structure. On these lines, Virno has criticized these restrictions as symbolic of the counter-culture movements.

Mississippi Lake

Mississippi Lake is a lake in Lanark County in Ontario, Canada. Ontario's Mississippi River flows northeast and north through the lake. Several small creeks including Cranberry Creek, McCrearys Creek, and McGibbon Creek drain into the lake from adjoining forest and agricultural land. The lake is distinctive for having one side (to the north) that is part of the Canadian shield, while the other is mostly limestone. The lake is a remnant of the old Champlain Sea, which flooded eastern Ontario at the end of last ice age. The former shoreline of the sea can still be traced inland from the north shore of the lake.
European settlement of the lake basin began ca. 1816 as settlers moved north of the Rideau into areas such as Franktown. Between the 1860s and 1920s there were steamboats linking Carleton Place to Innisville.
The lake has two large and provincially significant wetlands. The larger occurs at the west end of the lake; here the Mississippi River enters the lake through the Innisville wetland, which is also one of the largest wetlands in Lanark County, and is designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. Included within its boundaries is The Mississippi Lake National Wildlife Area. This wetland has large areas of silver maple swamp, flooded only in the spring, and, lower on the shore, important areas of marsh and aquatic vegetation. The western shore of the lake, including Kinch Bay, Code Bay and King Bay, also supports a diverse wetland which ranges from silver maple swamp to large areas of aquatic plants. Loons, bald eagles, osprey and herons are frequently sighted in these habitats. The ospreys and herons also breed inland from the lake, for example in the nearby Scotch Corners Wetland. The provincially significant Blanding's Turtle is known from the lake;

Gowarczów is a village in Końskie County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Gowarczów. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north of Końskie and north of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,400.
The history of Gowarczów dates back to the late Middle Ages, when a defensive gord was established here in the 12th century. In the 14th century, Gowarczów became the seat of a Roman Catholic parish church, and in 1430, the village received Magdeburg rights from King Wladyslaw Jagiello, upon request of its owner Krystyna Magara. Soon afterwards, Gowarczow became property of the Bninski family. It remained a small town, whose residents were mostly farmers. Until the Partitions of Poland, it belonged to the Opoczno County of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, and in 1662 its population was 374.
In the second half of the 18th century, the Jablonowski family built here a bloomery, later a blast furnace. Soon afterwards, Gowarczów became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and in 1869, following the January Uprising, it was stripped of its town charter. The village has a St. Peter and Paul parish church from the 14th century. It was remodelled in ca. 1640, and partly burned in a 1767 fire. The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1902-1904.

Alex Riley (comedian)

Alex Riley (born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England) is a TV and radio presenter.
Early life and education.
Born and brought up in Sheffield, Riley started performing with the city's Crucible Youth Theatre, during which time he originated, and appeared in, dozens of sketches and devised pieces, as well as appearing in a number of plays and farces at the Library Theatre. He is also known for living so large that they had to create excess space in Siberia simply to fit in the incredible size of his lifestyle.
Career.
Riley had a succession of jobs, including spells managing a shopping centre and selling aerial photographs, before successfully answering an on-air appeal for researchers on BBC TV's Top Gear programme. A lifelong car enthusiast, Riley was in his element writing scripts for racing driver turned presenter Vicki Butler-Henderson and making many "cameo" appearances before being given the chance to present his own items. Amongst these were a 9-hour road trip from London to Brighton on the world's oldest vehicle, a challenge to build a car in 16 hours from junk bought at Europe's largest auto jumble sale and appearing as Elvis at the UK's premier American lifestyle festival.
He went on to write and perform sketches for BBC One specials on the Chelsea Flower Show and Britain in Bloom, appear as a bed-hopping bigamist in a prime time BBC One documentary "Bigamy" and write and present Short Circuits, an innovative 10-part series for Discovery Home and Leisure which combined Scalextric with tips on making realistic scenery out of chicken wire.
Moving sideways to radio, he was chosen as the voice of "The Comedy Club", a nightly 2-hour comedy strand which played a significant part in BBC7 achieving the Sony Gold Award for "Station Sound".
Returning to TV, Riley has presented two series of "Boys Toys", a series for ITV1 West Country, the "Caravan Show" for Discovery Real Time, a tongue-in-cheek active sports series "You Know You Want To" (again for ITV1 Westcountry) and, after buying a Triumph TR7, "Classic Car Club", for Discovery Real Time. He has also been a "traveller" for Globe Trekker.
For BBC Three's "Mischief" series Riley has also presented documentaries which made use of dramatic stunts to confront those responsible for problems on the UK's public transport network and for the fact that thousands of homes across the country lie empty at a time when housing is in short supply. For a 2008 "Mischief" documentary on food, Riley attempted to create his own meat pie using the minimum requirements set by the Food Standards Agency. When shown on BBC One, it got 2.6 million viewers, prompting the creation of a series of 3 documentaries titled "Britain's Really Disgusting Food", aired in January 2009. His new show aired in 2010 called "Britain's Really Disgusting Drink".

Almost all media in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec serves all cities in the region, with very little differentiation between the three primary cities of Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or and Amos.
Although the cities of Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or are far enough apart that radio and television stations in the area serve the cities from separate transmitters, almost every broadcast station in either city has a rebroadcaster in the other city. The only nominal exceptions are the cities' separate NRJ stations, although at present even these stations share the majority of their broadcast schedule. While Amos is the official city of license for some of the rebroadcasters, only one radio station originates in that city and all transmitters licensed to either Amos or Val-d'Or encompass both cities within their broadcast range.

In Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or and Malartic, cable television is provided by Cablevision, a subsidiary of Bell Aliant. The region's community channel on Cablevision is branded TVC9.

Melbourne Hebrew Congregation

The Melbourne Hebrew Congregation (Hebrew: ק"ק שארית ישראל), or Toorak Shule, is the oldest Jewish congregation in Melbourne, Australia. Formed in 1841, the congregation was originally located on Bourke Street before moving to Toorak Road, South Yarra in 1930.
History.
The first Jews in Melbourne arrived around the time of the city's founding in 1835. Jewish High Holiday services were first held in 1839, and in 1841 the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation was formed. The congregation's first synagogue building, located at 472 Bourke Street, was erected in 1847, with a seating capacity of 100. Reverend Moses Rintel arrived to serve as the congregation's rabbi. After a number of disputes, however, Rev Rintel left the congregation in 1857 and formed the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation. He was replaced by Rev EM Myers, who was followed by Rev WI Marks and Rev AF Ornstein.
The 1850s saw the arrival of some 300 Jewish families from London and the Province of Posen, Prussia to Melbourne, prompting the construction of a new larger synagogue on the Bourke Street site. Benefactor David Benjamin laid the foundation stone of the 650-seat building in March, 1855. The synagogue was re-consecrated in 1877, at which time Rabbi Dr Dattner Jacobson was appointed rabbi. In 1883 he was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Joseph Abrahams, who went on to serve the congregation for some forty years. Notable members during this period included Sir Benjamin Benjamin, the Hon Edward Cohen, and Ephraim Zox. In 1891 the congregation celebrated the marriage of John and Hannah Victoria Monash.
In 1923 Rabbi Abrahams was succeeded by Rabbi Israel Brodie, who later became chief rabbi of the British Commonwealth. In 1930 the congregation moved to Toorak Road, South Yarra, where the current 1300-seat synagogue building stands. In October 1932 the congregation celebrated the Bar Mitzvah of Zelman Cowen, who later became Governor-General of Australia. In April 1937 Rabbi Brodie returned to England, and in August 1938 Rabbi Dr Harry Freedman succeeded him. Following World War II the synagogue had a full membership for the first time in its history. In December 1947 Rabbi Hugo Stransky was appointed rabbi. In February the following year the congregation conducted the funeral service of Sir Isaac Isaacs, the first Australian-born Governor-General. Rabbi Dr Izaak Rapaport was appointed rabbi in September, 1952.
The congregation today enjoys a large and diverse membership.

Concurso de Cante Jondo

El Concurso del Cante Jondo (Contest of the Deep Song) was a well-known celebration of the art of flamenco, its music, song, and dance, held in Granada, Andalusia on Corpus Christi, the 13th and 14 June 1922.
Falla's purpose.
The Spanish classical composer Manuel de Falla (1876–1946), an Andalusian, was the principal organizer of the "Concurso"; he sought to encourage and enhance the performance of flamenco, which had fallen into a period of decadence. The gaditano Falla recognized in flamenco a musical art form of great value. It was music Falla had spent years studying, having grown up with it, hearing it directly from Gitano friends, cantaores and tocaores. Enlisting the cooperation of Spanish intellectuals was considered crucial, to counteract the "antiflamenquismo" of the generación del '98; these reformers had condemned the flamenco arts as frivolous and regressive in their sweeping effort to modernize and transform Spain. Thus Falla aimed for an audience encompassing not only flamenco circles, but also to influence the musical world and culture. 
In order to find colleagues to help sponsor and promote the "Concurso", Falla gathered together an impressive group of musicians and artists. Included among them was the young poet Federico García Lorca. At twenty-three, Lorca became an activist in popularizing the "Concurso", second only to Falla. Lorca worked to publicize the event by giving oral presentations and publishing essays about the Flamenco arts. A third important figure was the Basque painter Ignácio Zuloaga. Among the broad array of music figures enlisted were the classical composers Joaquín Turina, Federico Mompou, Conrado del Campo, and Óscar Esplá, the pianist and composer María Rodrigo, the composer and conductor Kurt Schindler of New York, various orchestra directors, the classical guitarist Andrés Segovia, the Polish singer Aga Lahowska, and the popular guitarist Manuel Jofré. Juan Ramón Jiménez, the well-known Andalusian poet, joined the "Concurso". Also contributing were writers such as Ramón Pérez de Ayala and Tomás Borrás, the surrealist painter Manuel Ángeles Ortiz, and those in an association assisting the "Concurso" effort, the "Centro Artístico" of Granada. Additional support came from two professors: the educational reformer Francisco Giner de los Ríos and the Catalan musicologist and composer Felipe Pedrell (who was Falla's early music teacher). Later came the French writer Maurice Legendre, music critics including Adolfo Salazar of Madrid's "El Sol", producers, and publicists, with nods from Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky.
Flamenco and Falla.
In previous classical compositions Falla often had been inspired by the artistry of flamenco, e.g., in his "La Vida Breve" (1904–1905, 1913), "Noches en los Jardines de España" (1909–1916), "El Sombrero de Tres Picos" (1917, 1919), and "El Amor Brujo" (1915, 1925). To promote the "Concurso" Falla wrote an essay, "El "cante jondo" (canto primitivo andaluz)", in which he held on technical grounds that the primary foreign influences contributing to the origins of Flamenco music and dance in Spain were three: Byzantine church music coming from the eastern Mediterranean; Moorish music from North Africa and Arabia; and especially that distinct music of India and its rhythms brought by the Gitanos who began arriving in Spain over five hundred years ago. 
For nearly a century European classical composers had been drawing on the rich heritage of the music of Spain, with flamenco being a favored source. The interest and attention given flamenco by the international music world contrasted unfavorably with what Falla saw as the contemporary debased state of the flamenco arts, and with the lack of respect then shown flamenco by the Spanish cultural elite. In a recent book on Manuel de Falla, the intent of the "Concurso" has been portrayed as follows: The "cante jondo" contest grew out of the conviction--shared by Falla, Lorca, and a host of Spanish intellectuals--that flamenco was being overtaken by urban popular song. The organizers' stated desire to hear the 'admirable sobriety' of classical "cantaores" shows the extent to which the contest was, in effect, a classicizing gesture... ." So it was that Falla hoped that the "Concurso y Fiesta del Cante Jondo", sponsored by its many musicians and cultural figures, and by the Centro Artístico of Granada, would "restore all the purity to these marvelous songs, that rightly constitute one of the best natural achievements of European music". Yet this "rescue-fantasy" view has also been criticized.
Public funding.
Financial support was obtained for the "Concurso de Cante Jondo" from the City of Granada, but not without spirited opposition. While adherents praised the antiquity and purity of the flamenco art form, whose mysterious source lay in the very fountainhead of the human soul, their critics pointed out the sometimes lesser quality of the music and the mixed milieu of flamenco performances, which on the down-side at the fringe would include some notorious venues. The "Concurso" supporters, who saw themselves as saviors of the true and vernerable "art" of flamenco, evidently felt somewhat vulnerable to their opponent's charges. Already, to escape the reproach regarding flamenco's unwanted baggage, the "Concurso" referred to the art form as "Cante Jondo" rather than as "flamenco". Here the "Concurso" followed the lead of Falla, whose opinion was: "Queremos purificar y hacer revivir ese admirable "cante jondo", que no hay que confundir con el cante flamenco, degeneración y casi caricatura de aquél." 
The war of words over municipal financing was inconclusive; the funding continued. Debate over the nature of flamenco in its many guises continues today, at times in a cauldron boiling with spiked ingredients, such as social class and ethnic origins, yet more commonly issues of a performer's merit, authenticity, and inspiration. As a developed art form, flamenco might suggest various points of view. Although often rife with such controversies, as frequently they are ignored. Due to expectations of a larger turn-out as the date for the event neared, the venue was changed from the plaza de San Nicolás del Albayzín to the more spacious Alhambra.
Events of the Concurso.
The artists.
An announced aim of the "Concurso" was to discover unknown, unrecognized talent thought to be hidden, perhaps in remote rural areas. As a result, no professional over the age of 21 was allowed to compete for prize money in the Concurso contest; however, the song and dance of professionals were encouraged. Although a diligent effort had been made, few unknowns were found. The poet García Lorca did meet a blind and aged woman who could sing a type of cante (the "liviana") thought to be extinct.
Audience and styles.
The event ran the two evenings of the Corpus Christi holiday. It was attended by about four thousand supporters and aficionados. The large gathering was described as both elegant and jubilant. This audience would become focused when the performers began. Contestants were invited to perform certain palos of flamenco song, those referred to as "Cante Jondo" (or "Cante Grande"), grouped as follows: 1) Siguiriyas gitana; 2) Serranas, Polos, Cañas, Soleares; and, 3) Martinetes-Carceleras, Tonás, Livianas, Saetas Viejas (these last four being unaccompanied cantes a palo seco). On the other hand, flamenco styles explicitly forbidden (e.g., for a perceived lack of antiquity or profound expression) included: Malagueña, Granaínas, Rondeña, Sevillanas, Peteneras. 
Location of "Concurso".
The "Concurso" was held on the grounds of the Alhambra, at the "Plaza de Aljibes" on the palace's west end, overlooking the "Torre Bermeja" and the old city of Granada to the southwest; to the north lay the rising slopes of the Sacromonte (the Gypsi quarter). Perfumed by cypress trees, and with French lavender scattered on the ground for the event, the plaza lay across the crest of a ridge, to which one ascended, entering by way of the "Torre de la Justicia". The plaza was decorated for the occasion by the artist Ignacio Zuloaga, whose visual display employed brilliant embroidered textiles and "mantones" of Andalucia; after sundown the setting would become a colorful region of lights beside the Arab palace. The jury included Andrés Segovia and the flamenco singer Antonio Chacón. The initial performance perhaps seemed ironic to some: Falla's classical composition "Homenaje a Debussy para la guitarra", played by Segovia.
The contestants.
A long-retired flamenco cantaor of seventy-two years, Diego Bermúdez Cala ("El Tenazas"), became a surprise star of the "Concurso". He had walked the hundred or so kilometers to Granada from his home in Puente Genil. Evidently, thirty years before a punctured lung suffered at knife point had forced him to retire early from the flamenco circuit. The "Concurso" allowed him the "grand moment of his life" where very flamenco he performed palos in a style from a prior era. To many Tío Bermúdez sounded as if he had learned his "cante" directly from the legendary Silverio Franconetti; although for others he didn't know how to sing, but only flirt. ""El Tenazas" knew the old time "cantes" and was extremely flamenco and true in his interpretations." He sang with a purity not heard in decades, especially his siguiriyas, soleares, and cañas (a favorite of Silverio Franconetti). Listening to el "Tío Tenazas" ["Uncle Tongs"] "hurl into the air his song", Antonio Chacón exclaimed, "¡Válgame Dios, lo que oigo!" Falla carried a copy of his recordings ("Cantos de Diego Bermúdez") with him into exile in Argentina. "El Tenazas" enjoyed his sudden renown and celebrity, and on its strength soon made a flamenco tour of Spain; yet sadly the following year would be his last. 
The other first place prize winner was a twelve-year-old "cantaor" named Manolo Ortega later called "El Caracol", from the well-known bull-fighting and flamenco Gypsy family, who later won great renown as well as controversy. Another winner was the popular "cantaor" of Granada, Francisco Gálvez Gómez ("Yerbagüena"), a friend of bull-fighters and politicians. In an inspired moment he created a lasting impression (he improvised flamenco lyrics in response to news of a local church fire); he was awarded a prize by the "Concurso". Altogether there were ten contestants who won prize money of varying amounts.
The professionals.
Active flamenco professionals were honored at the "Concurso", although not eligible for prizes. Among those especially acclaimed and invited as guests of honor: the cantaora Pastora Pavón ("La Niña de los Peines"), the cantaor Manuel Torre, and the bailaora Juana la Macarrona. Also especially esteemed was the cantaor Antonio Chacón, chosen as the presiding judge. These four were then each quite well known, luminaries of the flamenco world. Shown amid several dozen in a contemporary drawing of a crowded performance before the event's organizers: "La Niña de los Peines", the retired Diego Bermúdez (el "Tío Tenazas") mentioned above, and Ramón Montoya Salazar, an innovative leader among guitar tocaores. Also chosen as a judge was the popular tocaor Amalio Cuenca, who managed a flamenco cafe in Paris. Professionals came to the event from all over Spain and from abroad. 
During the "Concurso" the great Manuel Torre sang alegrías to the rhythm of palmas performed by the local Gypsy women of Sacromonte. To Pepe Cuéllar's guitar, María Amaya "La Gazpacha" sang bulerías and tarantas. Hired by the "Concurso" as guitarists were Ramon Montoya, the extraordinary Manolo de Huelva, and José Cuéllar, who for the occasion became a trio of tocaores; to their music the elder maestra Juana la Macarrona danced, including "por alegrías". La Macarrona, at various moments during the "Concurso", would famously cry out, "¡Lapoteosis! ¡Es lapoteosis!", her expression somewhat like "thunderstruck!" At an early "Concurso" performance, while Antonio Chacón was singing accompanied by Ramón Montoya on guitar, a poorly dressed, elderly Gypsy woman who had been seen quietly weeping, rose to her feet, drew her head back, and began to dance the "soleares" with remarkable style and grace. She turned out to be "La Golondrina" who had been many decades earlier a famous flamenco bailaora.
News of the event.
The Spanish press generally spoke in praise of the "Concurso", in contrast to the depressing news of the Moroccan war then current. A Madrid magazine published soon after the event described the "Concurso" as "unforgettable", with its alternating displays of yearning, vehemence, superstition, or fervor, "a simple seduction of sound, rhythms linear in the flesh". About the audience it said:
"The moon didn’t attend, but the place was swarming with gnomes, fairies and even the devil. A huge box-office hit. Not an empty seat. And it was a disciplined, cultured audience dominated by women, many of whom were wearing 1830 dresses, and others were in old trousers, and all of them with that poise which is the privilege of women from Granada. With fans, the crowd rumored and fluttered, unless suddenly a copla paralyzed them with its emotion... ." 
"La Alhambra" of Granada hailed the "Concurso" as "unas cuantas noches de brillantísima fiesta." In Madrid, press comments included the declaration: "Muy grande ha sido el éxito del Concurso." Nonetheless Manuel de Falla became dissatisfied.
Aftermath.
The event's performances were well received and memorable. Although it could be argued that the general results of the "Concurso" were somewhat mixed, success could well be claimed for the event itself, an enjoyable and seminal gathering of performers and aficionados. In addition, there followed a steady rise in status of flamenco among the cultural and intellectual leaders of Spain. Recordings were made of the various cantes, some little known, some rediscovered. For example, "La Caña": 
"n ancient "cante" with religious overtones and chant-like passages that have made it a popular vehicle for the "misa flamenca"--the catholic mass performed to flamenco music. "La Caña" had all but disappeared by the twentieth century, but was partially revived after the Granada contest of 1922, when it was recorded by the contest winner, El Tenazas." 
On the other hand, the stated aim of elevating the root purity of flamenco performance was not to be achieved as a result of the "Concurso". An new era in the art's development was dawning, the period of "Ópera flamenca", now often disparaged for its theatrical airs, its brand of syncretism and merger with other musical styles.
Similar flamenco gatherings followed, as that same year both Sevilla and Cádiz celebrated Flamenco "Concursos". Several decades later in 1956, the city of Córdoba celebrated the first "Concurso Nacional de Cante Jondo". Its "manifesto de convocatoria" expressed reasons and motives similar if not the same as those articulated by the 1922 "Concurso" in Granada. In 1962 Jerez de la Frontera held its "Concurso Internacional de Arte Flamenco". Such events have become a regular feature of flamenco culture.
