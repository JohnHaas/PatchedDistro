Palaeophragmodictya

Palaeophragmodictya is a Precambrian sponge-grade organism from the Ediacaran Period.
Originally interpreted as a hexactinellid sponge, the organism also bears some coelomate characteristics, including bilateral symmetry.
Morphology.
The organisms take the form of a round bag, 7–68 mm in diameter, with an uneven margin. Radial grooves define sac-like compartments within the bag. The radial pattern has an element of bilateral symmetry. A stalk emerges from the central point of some specimens, at the top of the organism; in life, it probably extended into the water column. Ray-like filaments radiate outwards from the edge of the bag. Some structures in the organism have been interpreted as spicules.
Ecology.
The organisms have been interpreted as tall suspension feeders, reaching 10 cm or more up into the sea water above them.
Original description.
The genus was originally considered to be a member of the Dictyospongiidae family (hexactinellia), and was among the first Precambrian sponges to be described.
Distribution.
First found in the Pound group of Australia, fossils have also been recovered from the White Sea region of Russia.

Itaipu is a Brazilian district within the municipality of Niterói, in Rio de Janeiro state. It is located at the Oceanic Region of Niterói, which means that its beach is outside the Guanabara Bay.
In the colonial time, Itaipu had a strong economy, based on providing agricultural products to the city of Rio de Janeiro. Remains of that period are the church of São Sebastião de Itaipu and the convent of Santa Teresa (now, the Archeological Museum of Itaipu). But there was an economic decline and a consequent population decline. On the turn of the century 20 to the 21, Itaipu began to grow again, with the implantation of sewerage and the construction of many condominiums.
Today, the neighborhood has plenty of wild life, seafood restaurants, inns and historical sites. 
Typical species are the Ipê, the Sagui and the Urubu.

Professor Steven E. Hyman, MD, is Director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The goal of the Stanley Center is decrease the burden of serious neuropsychiatric disorders through research. Scientists within the Center use large scale platforms in genetics and other areas of biology and chemistry to gain better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders and most critically to develop new directions in therapeutics after a long period of stagnation. Hyman is also Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. He was Provost of Harvard University from 2001 to 2011. As Provost, he was instrumental in the development of cross school and regional interdisciplinary initiatives, especially in the sciences. In 2009 he initiated an extensive process of reform of the Harvard libraries, the world's largest university library system with major goals that included support for technical innovation in research and teaching and for open access to academic work. He has been important in the creation of an open access mandate at Harvard.
From 1996 to 2001 Hyman was the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a group of agencies that fund and perform biomedical research. NIMH supports neuroscience and the knowledge needed to understand, diagnose, and treat brain disorders. He has worked, more recently to open psychiatric classifications, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases, Mental and Behavioral Disorders to fundamental rethinking including the incorporation of neuroscience and genetics the recognition that many mental disorders are quantitative deviations from health rather than categorically different.
He is a member of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the US National Academies where he serves on the governing Council, is a member of the board of health science policy and chairs the neuroscience forum. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.

Walton Heath Golf Club

Walton Heath Golf Club is a golf club near Walton-on-the-Hill in Surrey, England, that was founded in 1903.
The club comprises two 18-hole golf courses, both of which are well known for having heather covering many of the areas of rough. The "Old Course" was the first to open in 1904, and (as of 2009) has a championship length of 7,462 yards. The "New Course" was initially opened as a 9-hole course in 1907, but was later extended to 18 holes, which were completed by 1913, and (as of 2009) has a championship length of 7,026 yards. Both the courses were designed by Herbert Fowler, who would later design a number of other courses in both the United Kingdom and United States.
Walton Heath has had a long association with royalty and politics, with Edward, Prince of Wales having been the club's first captain in 1935, and former United Kingdom Prime Ministers David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Andrew Bonar Law and Arthur Balfour all having been members. The club has also only ever had three club professionals, including five time British Open champion James Braid who held the post until 1950.
Both courses at Walton Heath have been consistently rated in the UK's top 100 courses, with the Old Course also being rated as one of the top 100 in the world.
Tournaments.
Walton Heath is the venue of a number of national amateur tournaments and championships. It has also hosted several high profile professional events including the 1981 Ryder Cup, when it stepped in as a replacement venue after construction at The Belfry had not been completed in time. The club also hosted five editions of the European Open, a European Tour event, between 1978 and 1991.
Since 2005, Walton Heath has been the venue for the U.S. Open European qualifying tournament. In the first year, New Zealander Michael Campbell qualified at Walton Heath, and went on to win the Open at Pinehurst.
Walton Heath hosted The Senior Open Championship, one of the five majors recognised by the Champions Tour, the world's dominant tour for golfers 50 and older, from 21–24 July 2011. The event was eventually won by Russ Cochran

J. N. Adam &amp; Co.

The J.N. Adam & Co., commonly referred to as J.N.'s was a department store located in Buffalo, New York. It was founded in 1881 by James Noble Adam, a brother of Robert B. Adam, a founder of AM&A's, another Buffalo based department store. The co-founder of the store was William H. Hotchkiss who, in 1905, negotiated the purchase of rival store Hengerer's. Both stores continued to operate and, in 1916, became initial parts of the Associated Dry Goods Corporation.
The downtown store was initially located at 292 Main Street. They later moved to the corner of Main and Eagle Streets, where over a span of thirty years they built a massive 600,000 sq. ft. downtown store. The flagship store was designed by architects Starrett & van Vleck, who also designed the Downtown Athletic Club and the flagship stores of Lord and Taylor, Bloomingdales, and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City. In 1937, a branch opened at 114-120 Falls Street in Niagara Falls, New York.
J.N.'s closed in 1960, and the Buffalo store became the new home for the downtown location of AM&A's. The flagship store operated as a Bon Ton until 1995. The store is currently threatened with demolition. On February 20, 2009, the former store complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the J.N. Adam-AM&A Historic District.

Hedwig von Trapp

Hedwig Maria Adolphine Gobertina von Trapp (28 July 1917 – 14 September 1972) was the fifth child of Georg and Agatha (née Whitehead) von Trapp. She was a member of the Trapp Family Singers, whose lives were the inspiration for the play and movie "The Sound of Music". She was portrayed as the character "Brigitta".
Biography.
Hedwig was named after her paternal grandmother. Hedwig had brown hair and grey eyes. She grew up in Zell am See during World War I with her siblings: Rupert (1911–1992) Agathe (1913–2010), Maria Franziska (1914-2014), Werner and Johanna (1919–1994). The last sister, Martina von Trapp (1921–1951), was born in Klosterneuburg (Austria). The Von Trapp family moved from Zell-am-See to Klosterneuburg, when their home, the lake hotel "Kitzsteinhorn", was flooded. Before living in the "Kitzsteinhorn", the von Trapp family lived on a farm called "Erlhof" near Agathe Whitehad von Trapp's mother and her sisters. 
In 1922, her mother died of scarlet fever and was buried in Klosterneuburg. Hedwig was then five years old. In 1925, the Von Trapp family moved to Salzburg-Aigen, and she entered the Ursuline convent as a student, together with her sisters. In 1927, her father, Georg Ludwig von Trapp, married Maria Augusta Kutschera (1905–1987), the teacher of her sisters (Maria Franziska and Johanna). Georg and Maria Augusta had three children together: Rosmarie (born 1928 or 1929), Eleonore (born 1931), and Johannes (born 1939). 
The family left Austria in summer of 1938 and went to America. Hedwig was now in her early twenties. She sang alto in the family chorus and alpine yodels, standing behind an open grand piano to achieve an alpine-like echo effect. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1948. After the Trapp Family Singers disbanded, she started her teaching career in Honolulu directing a children's choir, teaching handicrafts, carpentry, and cooking. She later taught music at St. Anthony School in Kailua, throughout the 1960s, living in a small cottage next to the school grounds and continued to wear her traditional German/Austrian clothing (tracht) every day. 
She went to visit her aunt in Zell am See in 1972 and died there at the age of 55 from asthma. She was buried at the Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, next to her father, her stepmother and her siblings, Rupert, Werner, and Martina.

Dolceola

A dolceola is a musical instrument resembling a miniature piano, but which is in fact a zither with a keyboard. It is used in traditional holy blues and has an unusual, angelic, music-box sound. Dolceolas were made by the Toledo Symphony Company from 1903 to 1907.
Performers.
Paul Mason Howard accompanied Lead Belly on doceola on some of his 1944 Capitol Records sides. A listen to those recordings, collected under the title "Grasshoppers In My Pillow", reveals the characteristic clatter of the dolceola's three-level keyboard action.
Although the gospel musician Washington Phillips was thought to have played the dolceola on several of his recordings, he was actually playing a compound instrument he fashioned out of two East Boston Phonoharp Company celestaphones.

2006 Connecticut Sun season

The 2006 WNBA season was their 8th season and their 4th in Connecticut. The Sun attempted to return to the postseason for the fourth consecutive season and were successful. Before the season started, many thought the Sun would make their third consecutive trip to the WNBA Finals, but lost to the eventual champion Detroit Shock in 3 games.
Schedule.
Playoffs.
In the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Sun had to face the Washington Mystics. Since the Sun had the better record, the series would be played with game 1 at Washington, game 2 at Connecticut, and game 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. The Sun swept the Mystics and game 3 was not needed.
In the second round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Sun had to face rival Detroit Shock. Again, the Sun had the better record and the series would be played with game 1 at Detroit and games 2 and 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. Even though the Sun had a better record in the regular season, Detroit had managed to beat Connecticut in all four of the season meetings. Surprisingly, the Sun won game two of the series but went on to lose game three on their home court. Detroit advanced to the WNBA Finals. Had Connecticut advanced, it would have been the third consecutive season the Sun had made it to the WNBA Finals.

Tillman Gerngross

Tillman Gerngross is a Professor of Bioengineering at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and an Adjunct Professor in the departments of Biology and Chemistry at Dartmouth. Gerngross has been an active inventor and to date his work has resulted in the founding of two companies (GlycoFi, Inc. and Adimab LLC.) and over a dozen U.S. and international patents.[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=gerngross%2Btillman&FIELD1=INNM&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PTXT][http://www.wipo.int/tools/en/gsearch.html?cx=000395567151317721298%3Aaqrs59qtjb0&cof=FORID%3A11&q=tillman+gerngross&sa=Search#1287]
Academic background.
Gerngross received a M.S. (Dipl. Ing.) in Chemical Engineering (1989) and later a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. Following his studies in Austria he became a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Arnold Demain (1989–91) and later joined the laboratory of Anthony Sinskey and JoAnne Stubbe at MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate from 1991 to 1993. From 1993 till 1998 he headed the fermentation and process development group at Metabolix Inc., a small startup company in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
In 1998 he left industry to join the faculty at Dartmouth where he focused his research on protein engineering, glycoprotein engineering in yeast, and life cycle analysis of competing manufacturing technologies. In addition to this work, Gerngross’ lab also developed a novel protein expression system based on the industrial fermentation organisms "Ralstonia eutropha", formerly "Alcaligenes eutrophus". With certain model proteins, this expression system has shown to outperform "E. coli", the well proven workhorse of prokaryotic protein expression. The work on "Ralstonia eutropha" was later expanded in collaboration with Prof. Wood at Princeton University to combine recombinant expression of proteins with the ability to purify them in vivo.
In the late 1990s Gerngross became one of the first vocal critics of biobased processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.
Arguably, Gerngross' most important biotechnological contribution consisted of humanizing the glycosylation machinery in yeast to produce human therapeutic proteins, including antibodies, with fully human carbohydrate structures. Much of this work was conducted at Glycofi, Inc., a Lebanon, New Hampshire biotechnology startup company that was acquired in 2006 by Merck in a record-setting $400 million transaction.
His work has been frequently cited in the popular press including "The Times" (London), CNN, "Scientific American", BBC, "The Guardian", "The Economist", "New Scientist", "Nature Biotechnology" and the "Los Angeles Times".
Industry experience.
In 2000 Gerngross co-founded Glycofi, Inc. and served as the company’s Chief Scientific Officer until its acquisition by Merck & Co. in the spring of 2006. In the fall of 2006 Dr. Gerngross joined SV Life Sciences as a venture partner where he advises on investments in the bio-therapeutics area. SV Life Sciences manages five investment funds with an aggregate capital of about $1.6 billion. In 2007 Dr. Gerngross co-founded Adimab LLC. with Prof. Dane Wittrup at MIT and technology entrepreneur Errik B. Anderson to develop a novel platform for the discovery of human antibodies in yeast. To date the company has raised five rounds of venture financing from Polaris Ventures, SV Life Sciences, Google Ventures, OrbiMed Advisors and Borealis Ventures and employs about 70 people in Lebanon, New Hampshire.
Awards and recognition.
2004: GlycoFi is awarded "Scientific American’s" Top 50 Award for the most innovative manufacturing technology.
2006: The readers of "Nature Biotechnology" select Gerngross amongst the most remarkable and influential biotechnology personalities of the decade.
2007: Gerngross and Glycofi co-founder Charles Hutchinson are named New Hampshire Entrepreneurs of the Year to honor their success with GlycoFi.

Attorney general.
He was appointed Minister of Justice on 26 July 2007. He was a member of a sub-committee to review the report of Justice Mohammed Uwais committee on electoral reform. The sub-committee assisted in producing a white paper which sparked controversy because it reversed some recommendations of the Uwais committee. It recommended that the President continue to appoint the chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), among other changes.
He opposed sacking Maurice Iwu, chairman of INEC, despite criticism of Iwu's conduct of the 2007 elections. He objected to the dissolution of local governments in Ondo State by Olusegun Mimiko, the new governor, although a High Court in Ondo supported the action.

HMS Antigua (1804)

HMS "Antigua" was a French frigate launched in 1779. She became a privateer that the British captured in 1804. She served the Royal Navy as a prison ship from 1804 to 1816, when she was broken up.
French service.
"Antigua" began her career as the "Galathée"-class French frigate "Railleuse". She was built in Bordeaux to a 32-gun design by Raymond-Antoine Haran and launched in 1779. She underwent repairs at Rochefort several times, in January to April 1783, in May 1790, and in 1794. In 1791 she was coppered. In 1797 the French navy disposed of her. She became the French privateer "Egyptienne", a 36-gun ship with a crew of 120 based at Bordeaux.
In December 1800, the hired armed cutter "Nimrod" recaptured the "Skene", Crawly, master, which had been sailing from Dublin to London when the privateer "Egyptian" captured "Skene". "Nimrod" sent "Skene" into Falmouth on 30 December.
A letter from Madeira dated 22 February 1804 reported that the 36-gun privateer "Egyptienne" was cruising to the south of the island. Another privateer, this one of 20 guns, was also in the area. "Egyptienne" was next reported to be off the windward coast of Africa on 8 March.
"Egyptienne" msut have then sailed to the Caribbean as on 19 March she captured the "Denault", Ball, master, which had been sailing from London to Demerara, and sent her into Guadeloupe. "Egyptieene" then intercepted the "Ranger", Williams, master, "Favourite", Holman, master, and "Wadstray", Way, master, which were sailing in company, also from London to Demerara. "Egyptienne" captured the "Wadstray", which however the frigate recaptured, and sent into Jamaica.
Capture.
On 23 March 1804, the British 18-gun sloop "Osprey" gave chase to four ships which turned out to be a frigate and three merchant ships. "Osprey" badly damaged the frigate "Egyptienne" in a close, 80-minute action near Barbados before "Egyptienne" used her superior speed to escape. "Osprey" lost one man killed and 16 wounded in the action and her hull and rigging were badly damaged. 
On the 25th, "Osprey" and the British 18-gun sloop "Hippomenes" recaptured the "Reliance", one of several prizes that "Egyptienne" had taken. From the prize master the British found out the identity of the vessel that "Osprey" had fought.
On 25 March 1804 or 27 March 1804 "Hippomenes" captured the damaged "Egyptienne" after a 54-hour chase followed by a three-hour, 20-minute single-ship action. "Egyptienne" was under the command of M. Placiard and had a crew of 255 men. After "Hippomenses" captured "Egyptienne", the British found out that she had lost eight men killed and 19 wounded in the fight with "Osprey". "Hippomenes" had only one man slightly wounded.
British service and fate.
The British took "Egyptienne" into service as HMS "Antigua" as there was already an "Egyptienne" in the Royal Navy. Because "Egyptienne" was twenty-five years old, and battered, the Navy decided against sending her to sea again. Lieutenant James Middleton commissioned her in December 1808 and commanded her until 1815. From December 1808 "Antigua" served as a prison hulk until scrapped in 1816.

Development.
The Phönix D.I was the second design developed by the Phönix Flugzeug-Werke based on Hansa-Brandenburg designs which it has produced under licence. The D.I was a single-seat biplane fighter with improvements over the original Hansa-Brandenburg design which included more efficient wings, a more powerful engine and structural improvements. A prototype was first flown in 1917 and proved to be fast but difficult to handle but because of the urgent need for fighters the D.I entered production. To improve the problems a modified variant, the D.II was introduced with balanced elevators and balanced ailerons on the upper wings. A further development was the D.III which had balanced ailerons on both wings and a more powerful 230 hp (172 kW) Hiero in-line engine. The last of 158 aircraft of all three types was delivered on 4 November 1918.

Oille

"L'oille" is a French "potée" or soup believed to be the forerunner of pot-au-feu composed of various meats and vegetables.
It has been suggested by some authorities that the derivation of the word "oille" is from the Spanish "olla podrida" but it seems more likely that it is derived from "oule", which is used in south-west France to describe an earthenware pot in which the dish is prepared. There are many examples of pot-à-oille (tureens) on display in museums, some of them very ornate indicating that this dish was enjoyed by people from all social classes, ingredients varying greatly.
There are three kinds of "oilles":
An old recipe for this dish contains chicken and pigeons, all stuffed and trussed, beef, veal, onion, parsnips, carrots, turnips, leeks, purslane, orach and chard. All are simmered for five hours. At the end of this time, slices of lightly toasted bread are placed in the bottom of a tureen and this is heated until the bread starts to stick to the bottom. The birds are removed from the soup and placed on the bread and the rest is strained over them. The remaining meat and vegetables are discarded.

Nicky Stevens

Nicky Stevens (born Helen Thomas in Carmarthen, Wales, 3 December 1949) is a singer, famous as a member of pop group Brotherhood of Man. She is the only Welsh person to have won the Eurovision Song Contest.
Early career.
Nicky Stevens began singing at an early age. At the age of four she was singing in a chapel in Carmarthen, and following lessons eventually joined the Hywel Girls Choir. She also studied classical music as a singer and pianist. At the age of 15 she toured the Continent as a singer, performing in night clubs. Following this she went on to tour South Africa as well as clubs around the UK. She also held a residency in Swansea's Townsman nightclub. One of her early appointments was as a supporting act to Little and Large in 1970. Stevens worked mainly performing popular songs and found it a struggle at first to adapt her vocals from her classical roots. During this period she also took on a job as a telephone operator. This lasted for nine months and is the only job she has ever had outside the entertainment business.
Brotherhood of Man.
In 1972, while working as a session singer, Stevens came to the attention of Tony Hiller, who was looking to recruit new members for his group Brotherhood of Man. Hiller was manager and songwriter for the group, but they had recently disbanded and keen to keep the name alive, which was still in demand for television work, he recruited Stevens alongside Martin Lee and Lee Sheriden. In 1973, signed to Deram Records, they released their first single, "Happy Ever After".
Later in the year another female singer was added to the group, Sandra Stevens (no relation) and as a four-piece, Brotherhood of Man went on to enjoy great success around the world. Scoring their first hit in 1974 and first No.1 the year after, the group entered and won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Save Your Kisses for Me". To date, she is the only Welsh person to win Eurovision. For the next three years, the group regularly hit the chart and scored two more No.1 singles in the UK, "Angelo" and "Figaro".
In addition to singing, Stevens is an amateur pianist, and performed the piano accompaniment to an otherwise a cappella recording of "Send in the Clowns" in 1978, which was featured on the band's "Twenty Greatest" album.
In 1988, while still with the group, Stevens recorded some songs with Dutch singer Albert West. In the early 1990s she also recorded some songs with British rock band Aslan1 as the lead singer.
Stevens still performs with Brotherhood of Man today in its original line-up, taking in UK tours and television appearances throughout Europe. In November 2013, Stevens was the subject of a documentary "Time of Your Life" on ITV Wales talking about her career and early life growing up in a musical environment in Camarthen.
Personal life.
In June 1976 Stevens married the group's guitarist, Alan Johnson. They have since divorced. In the 1990s, Stevens lived in Sturminster Marshall, but as of 2011 lives in Corfe Mullen, both in Dorset.
1 Not to be confused with the Irish rock band of the same name.

Pamela Girimbabazi Rugabira, born January 10, 1985, is an Olympic swimmer from Rwanda. She swam for Rwanda at the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympics; and was the country's flagbearer in 2008. 
During that time, she "never had a formal swim lesson or regular coach". She was disqualified during the Sydney Games due to technical rules that she was unaware of, and subsequently taught herself the rules by consulting the Internet. Later, she also taught herself from a book about swimming belonging to fellow Rwandan swimmer Jackson Niyomugabo. She trained in a hotel pool 25 metres in length. Her personal best in the 50 metre freestyle prior to the Beijing Olympics was 35 seconds. She failed to improve on that time in Beijing, finishing third out of four in her heat, and 88th overall, with a time of 39:78.
Girimbabazi has been described as a "minor celebrity" and "an icon of pure sport spirit, an athlete who competes for the love of the game, not for the thrill of victory or the fame and riches that might follow".

Kelvin Keith Chapman (born June 2, 1956 in Willits, California, the United States) is a retired Major League Baseball player. He played his entire Major League career with the New York Mets.
Early career.
Kelvin Chapman attended Santa Rosa Junior College. He was signed by the Mets organization as an amateur free agent on December 3, 1975. His first season as a professional was with the Met's Rookie League team, Marion Mets of the Appalachian League in 1976. That season he played 62 games and had a batting average of .269, a slugging percentage of .347, and an on-base percentage of .342.
The following year he was promoted to the Mets A-league team, the Wausau Mets of the Midwest League. In 127 games his batting average improved to .306, his slugging percentage improved to .456 and his on-base percentage improved to .378.
This performance led to another promotion to the Mets AA-league team, the Jackson Mets of the Texas League for the 1978 season. The team featured several other future New York Mets players, including Mookie Wilson, Neil Allen and Jeff Reardon. Chapman played 131 games for Jackson, 129 of which were at second base. He posted a batting average of .266, a slugging percentage of .383, and an on-base percentage of .347.
Major League debut.
Although he had never played AAA baseball, and although his performance at Jackson was not outstanding, Chapman had an excellent spring training in 1979 for the Mets and earned a spot as the Mets starting second baseman to begin the season. He replaced strong fielding but light hitting Doug Flynn, who was the Mets regular second baseman in 1978. Chapman's major league debut occurred on April 5, 1979 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. He got 2 hits in 5 at-bats in his debut. However, Chapman only batted .150 for the Mets in 80 at bats that season, relinquishing the starting second base job back to Flynn by late April. He was sent to the minors in May, returning to the Mets only in September after the minor league season ended.
Chapman played for the Mets AAA-league team, the Tidewater Tides of the International League for most of the 1979 season. He played 106 games as second base for the Tides, with a batting average of .241, a slugging percentage of .318 and an on-base percentage of .341.
From 1980 through 1983 Chapman played in AAA without getting back to the Major Leagues. He played with Tidewater in 1980, 1982 and 1983, and with the Syracuse Chiefs in 1981. During that time he played primarily second base, but also played a few games at third base, shortstop and outfield. He batted poorly in 1980 and 1981 but improved in 1982 and 1983. He also played for Tidewater at the beginning of 1984.
Return to the Major Leagues.
The Mets regular second baseman in 1984 was Wally Backman, a switch hitter who was much better when batting lefty. The Mets needed a right-handed hitting second baseman to platoon with Backman. After Chapman got off to a strong start with Tidewater in 1984, he was recalled to the Mets in May, more than 4 years after his previous Major League game in 1979. His first game for the Mets in 1984 was on May 6. Chapman played 75 games for the Mets in 1984, finishing with a batting average of .289, a slugging percentage of .401 and an on-base percentage of .356, helping the Mets finish 2nd in the National League East. Chapman also posted a league average fielding percentage in 57 games at second base of .979 that season, also playing 3 games at third base for the Mets.
In 1985, Chapman continued to platoon with Backman as the Mets second basemen. However, he did not hit as well as he did the prior season. With a batting average of just .174, Chapman was sent back to the Tidewater Tides after playing his last Major League game on July 24, 1985. Chapman batted just .185 with Tidewater in 1985 and was released by the Mets after the season on November 13, 1985.

Ray Lake

Ray Lake is a lake located in Wells Gray Provincial Park, east-central British Columbia, Canada. It is fed by and drained by Falls Creek which flows into the Clearwater River at its outlet from Clearwater Lake.
Naming.
Ray Lake and Mount Ray to the west are named for John Bunyan Ray who homesteaded near The Horseshoe on the Clearwater River in 1911. He cleared land and built a small cabin beside what is now called Alice Lake. A larger cabin was built in 1929 which still stands today. In 1932, after 21 years of a solitary lifestyle, at the age of 54, he married Alice Ludtke who was only 20. They raised three children on their remote farm, Nancy, Doug and Robert. The Ray family left their farm in 1946 so the children could benefit from a school education. A year later, John was still moving equipment and the family's belongings out to Clearwater on the long trail south through the Clearwater Valley. His last trip to the farm was in December 1947 and he died there of a heart attack. Alice died in 1959 at age 47 from cancer. Their graves are near the house. 
Access.
Visits to Ray Lake are very rare due to difficult access. The nearest trail is the overgrown Kostal Lake Trail, over to the south. Falls Creek is impassable for boats. Float planes and helicopters are not allowed to land at Ray Lake. 
Geology.
Mount Ray, west of Ray Lake, erupted about 20,000 years ago when glacial ice just covered the mountain. Soon the eruption melted through the ice. This formation is called a tuya. The ice covered the mountain again after the eruption ended. Mount Ray has a distinctly red summit and can be seen from Clearwater Lake. 
Dragon Cone, just east of Ray Lake, erupted about 7,500 years ago and the lava, called the Dragon's Tongue, flowed down Falls Creek Valley. Ray Lake was dammed and enlarged by this lava. The toe of this lava flow dammed the Clearwater River and raised the level of Clearwater Lake by about . A hiking trail from Clearwater Lake Campground gives access to the Dragon's Tongue where it consists of piles of jagged aa lava.

Diezani Alison-Madueke

Diezani K. Alison-Madueke (born 6 December 1960) became Nigeria's minister of transportation on 26 July 2007. She was moved to Mines and Steel Development in 2008, and in April 2010 was appointed Minister of Petroleum Resources.
Background.
Diezani K. Agama was born on in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Her father was Chief Frederick Abiye Agama.
She studied architecture in England and then at Howard University in the United States.
She graduated from Howard with a Bachelor's degree on 8 December 1992.
She returned to Nigeria and joined Shell Petroleum Development Corporation that year.
In 2002, she attended Cambridge University for her MBA.
In April 2006, Shell appointed her its first female Executive Director in Nigeria.
Since 1999 she has been married to Admiral Allison Madueke (retired), one-time Chief of Naval Staff who was at various times governor of Imo and Anambra State.
In September 2011 Alison-Madueke was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Management Sciences by the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna.
Federal cabinet positions.
Diezani Alison-Madueke has held three significant positions in the Nigerian federal government. She was appointed Transport Minister in July 2007. 
On 23 December 2008, she was named as Minister of Mines and Steel Development. 
After Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan became acting President in February 2010, he dissolved the cabinet on 17 March 2010, and swore in a new cabinet on 6 April 2010 with Alison-Madueke as Minister for Petroleum Resources.
Minister of Petroleum Resources.
As Minister of Petroleum Resources, Alison-Madueke has pledged to transform Nigeria's oil and gas industry so that all Nigerians benefit.
In April 2010, President Goodluck Jonathan signed the Nigerian Content Act, which aims to increase the percentage of petroleum industry contracts that are awarded to indigenous Nigerian businesses - a reaction to the domination of the sector by foreign operators.
One of the most controversial policies introduced under Alison-Madueke is the government's plan to remove state subsidies on fuel prices. Alison-Madueke has supported the discontinuation of the subsidy on the grounds that it "poses a huge financial burden on the government, disproportionately benefits the wealthy, encourages inefficiency, corruption and diversion of scarce public resources away from investment in critical infrastructure."
Firsts.
Alison-Madueke is the first woman to hold the position of Minister of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria, and in October 2010 she became the first woman to head a country delegation at the annual OPEC conference. She was also the first female Minister of Transportation, and the first woman to be appointed to the board of Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria.
On working in male-dominated sectors, Alison-Madueke said she warned the young women she mentored while at Shell to "change their mode of thinking."
Controversy.
In June 2008 Alison-Madueke was subject to a Senate probe after it emerged that as Transport Minister she had paid 30.9 billion naira ($263 million) to contractors between 26 and 31 December 2007. 
However, she has never been charged or tried for these allegations and has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
In September 2008 there was an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap Alison-Madueke at her house in Abuja.
In October 2009, the Senate of Nigeria indicted Diezani Alison-Madueke and recommended prosecution for the alleged transfer of 1.2 billion naira into the private account of a toll company without due process and in breach of concession agreement. 
However, the allegations have never been taken to law, and the Minister maintains her innocence.

Brett Lawrie

Brett Russell Lawrie (born January 18, 1990) is a Canadian professional baseball third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball.
Minor League career.
While playing high school baseball for the Langley Blaze of the B.C. Premier Baseball League, Lawrie was selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. The selection of Lawrie was the fourth-highest a Canadian player has ever been drafted, behind only Jeff Francis, Adam Loewen, and Phillippe Aumont and the highest a Canadian position player has ever been drafted (Loewen was drafted as a pitcher, but now is a position player with the Toronto Blue Jays organization on a minor league contract).
Lawrie was a member of the Canadian Junior National Team at the 2008 World Junior Baseball Championship where he led the tournament with a .469 batting average, 3 home runs and 16 RBI. He was also selected to play for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Lawrie represented Canada once again during the 2009 World Baseball Classic at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario. His only appearance during Canada's brief run in the tournament came during a 6–5 loss to the United States where he pinch-ran for Joey Votto in the 9th inning.
Although he was used primarily as a catcher for the Blaze, Lawrie transitioned to second base when he was assigned to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League to begin the season. He was selected to play for the World Team at the 2009 MLB All-Star Futures Game at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. He was promoted to the Double-A Huntsville Stars in mid-August. On June 23, Lawrie was selected to the 2010 Futures Games, his second selection.
Lawrie finished the 2010 season with a .285 batting average, 8 home runs, 63 RBI, 90 runs, 16 triples and 30 stolen bases in 135 games with Huntsville. For his efforts he was named to the Southern League Post-Season All-Star team on September 1, 2010. Considered by many to be one of Milwaukee's top prospects, he was traded on December 6, 2010 to the Toronto Blue Jays for starting pitcher Shaun Marcum. Despite already having switched positions from catcher to second base after the Brewers drafted him, the Blue Jays moved Lawrie to third base.
On May 31, Lawrie was hit in the hand by a pitch and left the game with what was initially believed to be a broken hand. X-rays were negative and he was considered day-to-day, until it was later revealed by CAT scan that there is a non-displaced fracture, and he was expected to miss 2–3 weeks.
After a brief stint in Single-A Dunedin ending with a game where he was hit by a pitch twice, Lawrie was promoted back to Triple-A Las Vegas on July 18, 2011.
He was named the third baseman on "Baseball America"'s 2011 Minor League All Star team.
Major League career.
2011–2012.
On August 4, 2011, Lawrie was called up to the Blue Jays. Travis Snider was optioned to Triple-A to make room for Lawrie. He made his debut on August 5 against the Baltimore Orioles. In his first career at-bat, he recorded his first career hit and RBI. He finished 2–4 with 1 RBI and a fielding error. Two games later, he hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of starter Alfredo Simón. In his second game at home on August 10, Lawrie recorded his first career grand slam, off of Oakland reliever Craig Breslow. The grand slam was also his first hit at the Rogers Centre. In the following series against the Los Angeles Angels, Lawrie recorded his first career triple and stolen base. On September 5, Lawrie hit his first career walk-off home run, a solo shot in the 11th inning off reliever Dan Wheeler to defeat the Boston Red Sox 1–0.
Lawrie's first season ended prematurely when, on September 21, he fractured the middle finger on his right hand while fielding during batting practice. He finished his first season with a batting average of .293, 9 home runs, 26 runs scored, 7 stolen bases and 25 RBI in 161 plate appearances.
Lawrie made the 40-man roster for the Toronto Blue Jays 2012 season.
On May 1, 2012, Lawrie hit a game-winning, walk-off solo home run in the bottom of the 9th inning to give the Blue Jays an 8–7 win against the Texas Rangers.
In a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 15, Lawrie was ejected from a game after objecting to being called out on two consecutive strikes by umpire Bill Miller. The two pitches in question were proven by replay and through computerized strike zone analysis to not be in the strike zone. After both pitches, Lawrie started down the baseline, only to hear the strike call. Upon the strikeout call, Lawrie turned and yelled, prompting Miller to eject him. Lawrie threw his helmet on the ground, which then bounced and made contact with Miller. Manager John Farrell was also ejected after arguing with Miller. Lawrie was suspended for four games by Major League Baseball, and initially appealed the suspension but dropped the appeal on May 17. After a 7–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox on June 2, Lawrie was present at the Toronto Eaton Centre when a shooting took place. Lawrie, who was unharmed, posted on Twitter about the incident and was credited by some news outlets with breaking the story. Lawrie was awarded the Wilson fielding award for his defensive play at third base on November 4.
2013–present.
Lawrie was named to Canada's 2013 World Baseball Classic team, and took part in two pre-tournament games against the Milwaukee Brewers and the Cincinnati Reds. Lawrie exited the game against the Reds due to discomfort, and was later determined to have strained his ribs. He stayed with the team, but did not appear in the tournament due to this injury. Lawrie began the season on the disabled list, and made his season debut on April 16 against the Chicago White Sox, going 0-3 with an RBI. Lawrie was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 29 after spraining his ankle sliding into second base in a game on May 27. General manager Alex Anthopoulos said on June 24 that Lawrie would begin a rehab assignment on June 26 with the Class A-Advanced Dunedin Blue Jays. Lawrie started the June 26 game at third base for Dunedin. Lawrie continued his rehab with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats on July 6. His rehab assignment was changed to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on July 9. He played second base against the Syracuse Chiefs on July 9, and was recalled by the Blue Jays on July 13 to play against Baltimore. 
Lawrie started at second base for the first time in his major league career on July 13, and finished the game 0–4.

Dusk Till Dawn (Ladyhawke song)

"Dusk Till Dawn" is a song by New Zealand recording artist Ladyhawke, released on 15 September 2008 in the United Kingdom as the third single from her self-titled debut album, "Ladyhawke". It was co-written by Phillipa Brown (aka Ladyhawke), Pascal Gabriel, Alex Gray and Hannah Robinson, and produced by Gabriel. The song was featured on the third episode of "Gossip Girl", "Poison Ivy", originally aired 3 October 2007.
Background and writing.
According to co-writer Hannah Robinson, "Dusk Till Dawn" was written at the same session as "My Delirium", their first and only together. The lyrics came about from brainstorming the ideas they had. At the time Ladyhawke had just landed off a flight from New Zealand and was feeling very jet-lagged.
Critical reception.
Mike Orme wrote for Pitchfork Media that "Dusk Till Dawn" "marches along to the beat of both the urban white chic of Gwen Stefani and the coke-nosed disco rock of Franz Ferdinand." Emily Tartanella of PopMatters described the song as a "hybrid between Franz Ferdinand and Madonna", and Ben Norman of About.com stated that it "sounds like a (better) Ting Tings number."
Chart performance.
The single debuted at number seventy-eight on the UK Singles Chart for the issue dated 21 September 2008, spending only one week on the chart.
Music video.
The video opens with Ladyhawke in a bed with a man. She looks out of the window at a ghost, next she runs downstairs, where she starts to get haunted by monsters. She then gets circled by monsters, each wearing a mask with a corresponding T-shirt. She tries to awake her boyfriend, but as it fails, she tries to call someone but is tracked down by the monsters and runs away. She then starts to dance with the monsters. She then wakes up and pulls the cover off her boyfriend and realizes in fear that he is dead. She goes into the bathroom, washes her hands and then leans down and when she arises she has a mask which resembles her face and a T-shirt which says "Ladyhawke", she then starts dancing again. The video finishes when she wakes up in the daytime.
Ladyhawke made an alternate homemade video where she appears in front of a webcam performing the song, along with friends such as Sia, Peaches and JD Samson. She shows her geeky side from the start, when she is seen playing with a Kermit the Frog toy dressed as Luke Skywalker and a Mr. Potato Head toy as Darth Vader. Sia appears with her face being drawn with a marker in a style similar to the her 2008 "Buttons" video. The video was directed by Keith Schofield.

Red Riding Hood (1989 film)

Red Riding Hood ("officially:" Cannon Movie Tales: Red Riding Hood, "alternatively:" Caperucita roja in Venezuela, Cappuccetto Rosso in Italy, Le petit chaperon rouge in France, Pieni Punahilkka in Finland and Rotkäppchen in West Germany) is a 1989 American/Israeli fantasy film by Golan-Globus based on the fairy tale of the same name and part of the film series Cannon Movie Tales. The taglines were: "CANNON MOVIE TALES: Lavish, feature-length new versions of the world's best-loved storybook classics!" and "Rediscover the magic".
Plot.
The story opens with Linet (Amelia Shankley) chasing something she believes to be an elf fairy. Meanwhile a Wolf tracks her. Linet climbs a tree over a river and nearly falls. She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land. As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter who scolds her for being foolish. As they walk back, Peter asks Linet why she can't stay home and be a good little girl. Linet answers how good little girls hardly ever see the world. (Lost in the Woods) 
When they arrive at the house, Lady Jean (Isabella Rossellini)raises an eyebrow at Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to actually seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey has taken over and no one in the castle is safe; hence the reason why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves.
Godfrey (Craig T. Nelson)notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war and it has been seven years since. He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival. Godfrey wonders, as Percival's exact twin, how Jean could not love him when it is clear she doesn't. He offers her riches and beauty, which she refuses, but Godfrey loudly proclaims she WILL be his wife. 
Later in the castle, Godfrey imprisons a farmer, Allen Owen for back taxes. As he is led away, Allen yells how Godfrey has no heart, something that enrages Godfrey. He orders Allen whipped and storms out. Godfrey goes to his chambers where the same Wolf from the beginning is lounging on a sofa. Godfrey orders "Wolf into Man, as fast as you can." The Wolf then transforms into his human form, Dagger.(Rocco Sisto) Godfrey repeats how Allen said he had no heart, and wonders aloud if the truth is really known, how he gave up his heart and soul to possess Dagger, the Power of the Wolf. Godfrey asks Dagger what the people are saying about him. Dagger say that the people are afraid of him, but not all. He remarks how Linet, has no fear. Godfrey replies that soon she will, like everyone else. After he leaves, Dagger sings how he's good at only one thing,(Good at Being Bad). He then goes into the village to spy around, and villagers speaking about Godfrey rapidly become quiet in his presence.
Linet awakens from a nightmare about her running through the woods and being chased by a large wolf. Lady Jean comes to comfort her and tell her there is nothing to fear. Linet asks how when there are things to fear. Jean tells her that the night will pass ('You Won't Be Here in the Morning')
The next day, Lady Jean takes a loaf of bread and goes to beg Godfrey for Allen Owen's life. Godfrey cruelly agrees, but still has Allen whipped while Jean watches. Lady Jean's servants carry him out of the castle, and Jean speaks about sending for her mother, Nanny Bess. 
Linet skips down the road and arrives at Nanny Bess's country house. She tells Nanny Bess about Allen's wounds, and Nanny gathers some ointments and sneaks a red bundle into her basket. As they walk, they are watched by the Wolf. Nanny makes Linet wait outside, promising her a surprise later. Nanny and Lady Jean attend to Allen while Dagger watches from a window. Linet tries to site still but sees a goose out of its pen. She chases it near Dagger, causing him to fall into some mud. He tries another window, but falls into the river trying to avoid Linet. She goes back into the house as Nanny massages in the ointment which miraculously removes Allen's pain. 
Nanny then holds a 'ceremony' involving a circle of rocks, and adorning Linet with a beautiful hooded cloak; saying it will protect her, and help her see a fairy. The next day Linet and Lady Jean bring bread to a healed Allen and farm workers. Refusing the food, Allen laments to Linet about working so hard only to gain so little, referring to the poor harvest and telling her how the land was fertile ('Green in the Blue') Everyone joins in singing and dancing but the mood changes suddenly when Lord Godfrey appears. In an attempt to quell the situation, Lady Jean speaks to Godfrey, who repeats his marriage request. Jean speaks again of her love for Percival, to which Godfrey declares is dead. Linet speaks up to her uncle, saying her father is alive; causing Godfrey to yell. He tells Jean this will be the last time he asks. As he rides away, Linet chases him on foot saying her father is alive, before running into the woods. 
At first she ignores her mother's calls, but eventually Linet returns to Jean and they sadly walk home. Meanwhile, a very much alive Percival (also Craig T. Nelson), travels the road on foot and sings 'You Won't Be Here in the Morning'. He arrives at Nanny Bess's house and they exchange banter before she warmly welcomes him home. Over dinner, he tells her how he has seen the fear in people's eyes, but he did not reveal his identity. Nanny Bess warns him how Godfrey has used black magic to gain power. Percival refuses to believe his brother is that cold and cruel, but Nanny explains how Godfrey gave up his heart for power and is incapable of loving anything or anyone. 
Meanwhile in the castle, Godfrey sings how Jean cannot break his heart, since he was without one ('Man Without a Heart'). He and Dagger briefly talk about love before he mentions how Allen had been healed. Dagger doesn't understand how that is possible, and Godfrey postulates someone in the village is capable of magic. He sends Dagger to find out the source of the magic and to eliminate it. He also says Lady Jean will be his and Linet is becoming a nuisance.
Dagger tries first to talk to Lady Jean, but she knows of his connection to Godfrey and avoids the subject. He then tries to talk to Badger Kate, the maid and Allen's brother, but she pushes him into the wash bin. Frustrated, he follows Kate and transforms in the Wolf. She spots him and screams for help. The villagers chase the Wolf and shoot bows and arrows. Peter joins the chase and throws his axe. When he catches up he sees Dagger in human form with a sleeve pinned to a tree by the axe. Dagger sends Peter off in another direction, and grimaces. 
Percival and Nanny Bess watch Linet from afar, and Nanny Bess keeps him back, warning of Godfrey's spies. They meet up with the villagers looking for the wolf, and Peter recognizes Percival and they embrace in friendship. Peter is happy that Percival has returned to lead the people, but all Percival wants is to see Jean and Linet. Nanny Bess warns that Godfrey watches Jean too closely, but she will send for Linet to come to her house. 
Jean gives Linet a basket to take to Nanny Bess. Linet promises to go straight there, but of course gets distracted when she runs into Dagger. They talk about people and how they tend to lie and mislead others, ('Never Talk to Strangers') Afterwards, Linet does reveal it was Nanny Bess who healed Allen. Dagger distracts her into picking flowers and goes ahead to Nanny Bess. He arrives at the house and tries to attack her, but she escapes. Dagger then hears Linet approaching, so he darts inside and dons Nanny Bess' cap and nightgown. 
Linet arrives at the house, Dagger, disguised, convinces her to drink a potion. She does and it blurs her vision, while she dreamily goes into the bedroom. Linet looks at Dagger in the nightcap and gown and starts the famous "What big eyes you have." When she notes the big teeth, Dagger says "The better to eat you with, and bites Linet's hand. Linet backs away in fear as Dagger transforms into the Wolf and pounces on her. 
Percival is talking to the villagers and reveals a secret entrance that Godfrey doesn't know about. They start to plan their attack when Nanny Bess runs up to him, screaming for help. Meanwhile, castle guards lead Lady Jean, her wrists tied, to a waiting Godfrey on horseback. He reminds her that he said he was done asking, before taking the rop and leading her back to the castle.
Percival and the villagers return to the house and see in the bed a half wolf/half human form with a bloated stomach. Percival raises his bow, but Nanny Bess stops him when she sees something moving inside the Wolf's stomach. She orders Percival to cut open the stomach, and when he does Dagger/Wolf dies; and an unharmed Linet emerges from within. She see Percival and timidly asks, "Father?" and both father and daughter embrace. 
Percival leads the angry villagers towards the castle. Godfrey pulls Lady Jean along, and screams for Dagger. As Percival enters the castle gates, Godfrey reacts in fear; and his guards and Lady Jean shrink away in horror. The villagers storm the castle and Percival and Jean are reunited. Everyone finds Godfrey, cringing and groaning on his throne. He is twisting in pain and starting to take an animal-like appearance. Percival throws at Godfrey the Wolf's skinned hide, and orders him to leave. 
As he staggers past the stunned villagers, Godfrey grimaces in pain. He eventually changes into a wolf and runs out of the castle gates. 
As Nanny Bess, Percival, Lady Jean and Linet walk home, Linet is distracted by pretty flowers. As she picks them and sings, a fairy appears. They look at one another for a moment, but when Linet turns to answer her father, the fairy disappears. Linet smiles and runs to catch up to her family.

Martina von Trapp

Martina von Trapp (17 February 1921 – 25 February 1951) was a member of the Trapp Family Singers and was the seventh child of Georg von Trapp and his first wife, Agatha Whitehead von Trapp. She was a member of the Trapp Family Singers, whose lives were the inspiration for the play and movie "The Sound of Music". She was portrayed as the character "Gretl".
Early life.
Named after the house she was born in, the "Martinsschlössel", Martina von Trapp had brown hair and brown eyes. She grew up in Klosterneuburg, and later in Salzburg with her siblings Rupert (1911–1992), Agathe (1913–2010), Maria Franziska (1914-2014), Werner (1915–2007), Hedwig (1917–1972), and Johanna (1919–1994). The family moved from Zell-am-See to Klosterneuburg after their home in Zell-am-See, a hotel called "Kitzsteinhorn", was flooded. They also lived at one time on a farm called Erlhof near their maternal grandmother and aunts. When Martina was one and a half years old, her mother Agathe died of scarlet fever during an epidemic. Three years later, Georg von Trapp moved his family to the Aigen district of Salzburg. 
In 1926, her older sister Maria Franziska became ill and was unable to attend school. During her recovery her father arranged for a teacher from a local convent to tutor her; the novice, Maria Augusta Kutschera, married Georg von Trapp the next year. Georg and Maria Augusta had three children together: Rosmarie (born 1928 or 1929), Eleonore (born 1931), and Johannes (1939). In the 1930s Georg suffered serious financial losses. Maria Augusta, who had taught the children to sing, organized a series of concerts in order to pay the bills. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1948. 
Career.
The family left Austria in the summer of 1938 after they declined an invitation to sing for Hitler at his birthday celebration at Berchtesgaden, Germany. They embarked on a concert tour of the US and never went back. von Trapp was nearly seventeen years old at the time. She sang second soprano in the family chorus together with her sister Maria Franziska. 
Personal life/death.
Aged 28, Martina wed French-Canadian Jean Dupire in 1949. She remained home for the 1950–1951 tour as she was expecting her first child. While the family was touring the western United States in the winter of 1951, she gave birth to a stillborn daughter (Notburga), and died the same day from complications of the Caesarean section she had undergone. She had just recently turned 30 years old.
She was buried at the von Trapp's lodge in Vermont, next to her father and with her baby in her arms. Her stepmother and three of her siblings — Rupert, Werner, and Hedwig — were later buried next to her.

<doc id="18895211" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18895211" title="Church of Fiães">
Church of Fiães

The Church of Fiães, is a Romanesque and Baroque era Portuguese religious building located in the municipality of Melgaço, in the northern district of Viana do Castelo. Originally a Roman-Cistercian church, it was remodeled during the 17th and early 18th century in the Baroque style, but still exemplifies many of the characteristics of the early building (typifying the Galician Cisterian monasteries and Minhota churches of the time). The beginning of 17th century remodeling began with images of the patron saints and coat-of-arms on the frontispiece, but later extended into the lateral altar (Mannerist) and the chancel retable(Baroque).
History.
Records from 815, as suggested by J. Augusto Vieira, already indicated that a convent existed on the site during the era of Ramiro II of León and D. Paterna. By 870, the church was constructed (as stated in the chronicles of Father António da Purificação).
By the 11th century, there were rare references to a religious building in Fiães, usually referring to a Benedictine monastery who received several donations and active business (exchanges and purchases). In 1142, Fernando Tedão was a principal orator and eventually left behind many of his property to the church. Afonso Henriques also donated property and chattel that he owned in Melgaço (most notably in the area of Chaviães), which included the lands of Senhora da Orada, but which were later occupied by King Sancho in 1199.
Maur de Chocheril, in 1194, recorded that the clergy at the convent adopted the Cistercian religious order, aligning themselves to their brethren at the abbey of São João de Tarouca. In 1210 João Raimundo and his mother donated lands in Doma, on the frontier with Cristóval, and later supported the Order's public works the following year with donations to their projects. The wealth of the Convent of Fiães was so great that a popular refrain existed that ""after the King, there was no one as rich as the abbot of Fiães"". An accord between the convent and municipality of Melgaço in 1245 established a cost-sharing agreement for the maintenance of the wall around the city. The clergy at the time could afford to be generous, records from 1320 showed that the convent produced 400 pounds from lands rents.
In the 14th century, the tomb of Fernão Anes de Lima was installed at the church. 
In 1490, a fire in the archives, resulted in an unmeasurable damage to many of the church's records.
The first record of a restoration dates to around 1530, when abbot João de Cós ordered the restoration of the Church, the abbey's residences, cloister and meeting hall. These renovations were important, for in January 1533, the convent was visited by the abbey of Claraval, Edme de Saulieu and his secretary, Cláudio de Bronseval. Yet, many of the early projects were left uncompleted at the time of their arrival, including the cloister (which was in ruins). Successive restoration or expansion were completed in the 17th and 18th century, including the restoration of the interior and frontispiece and the opening of two great windows on the northern facade, as well as the construction of the belltower. 
By the end of the 16th century, there were 20 abbots represented at the convent.
In 1730, Colonel Francisco Ayres de Vasconcelos ordered recruitment of soldiers on the grounds of Fiães "couto" (a privileged area immune from taxes and royal justice), which was seen as an afront to the religious orders. The site was also the stage for a later royal order from King John V of Portugal, who summoned all the governors to the plaza to show their respect to the privileges of the grounds. Yet, in 1777, the convent complained to the Captain-Major of Valadares that generals and governors of the local fortifications used carts of parishioners for public works projects in the fortresses.
With the extinction of the Religious Orders (1834), the convent was sold to the public and the temple became a parochial church. The remaining dependencies slowly slid into ruins, with little attention paid to these shelters. On 6 November 1836, the "couto" was extinguished and the lands incorporated into the municipality of Melgaço. A cross was erected on the grounds in 1875. By 1903, the right facade of the convent still remained intact. The original 1910 decree was intended to classify the churchyard as a National Monument (), but was elaborated in 1977 to include the Church, its contents and any of the remnants of the ancient convent.
The abbot travelled to France (1955) to visit former parishioners, and to collect donations to purchase bells for the convent, conclude the public works on the parochial residence and build a tower to the Chapel of Adedele.
The first organized interventions made on the church and remnants of the convent began with the 1958 restoration of the roof and consolidation of the walls, completed by the DGEMN "Direcção-Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais" ("General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments") in 1958. This was followed by formal restoration in 1959-1960; reconstruction of the sacristy and western/southern walls in 1961–1962; and finally the reconstruction of the southern wall and frontispiece in 1963. A new phase of restoration and consolidation began in the 1970s with the southwest corner and roofing, and weathering problems caused by a storms in 1972, which were supported in 1974 by new roofing of the central nave. Minor replacements of doors and windows throughout the church progressed in the intervening years, along with other projects, culminating in the drainage of the posterior facade in 1977. Conservation projects began in 1982, 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1989 to benefit its historical and touristic importance, with a general review of elements in granite, pavement, structural and decorative elements, the cleaning of many of the interior and exterior decoration, treatment of the main beams, the revision and installation of electrical outlets and improvements on the exterior of the building, which included the consolidation of the exterior wall and the construction of an access-way staircase in Portuguese-style "calçada".
Following the re-roofing of the church, new restorations were accompanied by archaeologists from the University of Minho, under a protocol with the DGMEN. During the opening of drainage perimeter, the archaeologists discovered an older dis-activated channel system, that ran along the principal facade of the church along with an older "calçada" pavement, which was conserved, eliminating the need for further drainage projects.
Architecture.
The Church of Fiães is situated in an isolated rural environment, along the flanks of the Serra da Peneda, at about 700 metres above sea level. The ample churchyard includes a cross, and is inserted within a small agricultural tract encircled by oak and chestnut trees.
The church is composed in a longitudinal plan, with three naves and four sections, with three rectangular chapels, inset rectangular bell-tower crowned with pinnacles (on the north facade) and sacristy (in the southern facade) with the articulated spaces covered in tile. Typically, the Cistercian Romanesque churches had three square chapels with vaulted ceilings and local marks. Analysis by Carlos A. Ferreira suggest that some remnants from the nave indicate the original architects/designers intended to vault the entire nave, but was never realized.
The frontispiece (surmounted by a cross over a plinth) is divided by reinforced spaces, with narrow windows on the lateral spaces, while an arched portico dominates the central space. Above this doorway are three niches with the images of Nossa Senhora da Assunção, São Bernardo and São Bento, surmounted by three narrow windows and a coat-of-arms. These upper sections of the principal facade were remodeled in the 17th century, with the windows and images of the saints added in this period. The dependencies of the convent were also altered, but these were lost by 1533. The only remnant of this period is a fragment of double capital, decorated in a vegetal form with crochet. The lateral facades include cornices, with two doors on the southern facade and one on the northern facade. The southern apse chapel dominates the opposite facade to the entrance, with a supported chancel with windows and cornice similar to those along the nave. 
The interior naves are separated by arched columns on squared pillars. On one of these is a gilded pulpit, while a collateral altar is located to the right of the main altar. Opposite this is tomb. The naves are supported by wood beams and divided into four sections, while the chancel is crossed by two beams. The apse chapel is broken by arches over pilasters, surmounted by windows and frescoes; its two sections and vaulted ceiling, illuminated by two frescoes, has been considered "a programmed realization of the best aspects of the Cistercian spirit"".
A similar conclusion was reached from the analysis of other parts of the architectural design. One of them was the space's decoration, characterized by an almost complete lack of ornamental design, which characterize the principal values of the Cistercian Order: "simplicity, austerity and pragmatism". Although the Galician influence of Benedictine churches helped to begin a period of construction, the Cistercian influence inaugurated a new road that would influence 13th century architecture. The chancel which includes vaulted ceiling and broken by a gilded retable. Of the convent, which extended from the southern, nothing remains, although there exist elements associated with its construction including a small space with arches over pilasters and Doric columns, that were part of the convent structure.

Reception.
"Variety" wrote a negative review of "Shamus" stating that the film is "confusing...scripter Barry Beckerman drags in an assortment of mostly-unexplained characters but some dandy rough work - and finales in a fine fog. Perhaps something was lost in translation to the screen." Roger Greenspun wrote that the film "is full of appealing New York locations and much inventive action, ultimately amounts to little more than the kind of situation melodrama that the movies these days offer for excitement. On this level it is workmanlike, well-paced, modest, sometimes scary, and sometimes genuinely funny".
Sequel.
Robert M. Weitman produced a TV movie about the same character, "A Matter of Wife... and Death" (1976) with the role played by Rod Taylor. It was a pilot for a prospective series that did not eventuate.

Stan Storimans

Stanislaus N.I.M. (Stan) Storimans (January 8, 1969 Tilburg – August 12, 2008 Gori, Georgia) was a Dutch RTL TV veteran cameraman. He had planned to publish a book describing his 20 years of reporting from hotspots like Afghanistan, Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Iraq, Sri Lanka, the former Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the former Yugoslavia, among others. He was killed in a Russian airstrike on the Georgian city of Gori during the 2008 South Ossetia War.
Death.
Storimans was killed during Russian bombing of the Georgian city of Gori during the war in Georgia. Seven others were injured in the attack, including a Dutch correspondent for RTL, Jeroen Akkermans, while the Israeli journalist Zadok Yehezkeli was seriously wounded and evacuated to Israel for treatment after surgery in Tbilisi. A Georgian journalist and his driver were also reported killed, as were at least two other people (the International Federation of Journalists identified the killed journalist as Grigol Chikhladze). The bomb hit an area near the media centre that had been set up on the roof of the city's television and radio centre. Human Rights Watch has reported it found the evidence that cluster bomb has been used by the Russians in the attack which killed Storimans. The initial Reuters report that their analysis of the footage from the scene shows that the explosions may have come from mortar fire.
Sandra E. Roelofs, the Dutch-born wife of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, offered to attend the funeral, but his family declined the offer as they didn't want to politicise the ceremony. Storimans was buried on August 21, 2008, at the burial site "Vredehof" in Tilburg. Dutch ministers Ronald Plasterk and Maxime Verhagen were present during the memorial service at the St. Lucaskerk.
Investigations.
The Dutch member of parliament and Foreign Affairs spokesman Harry van Bommel said that Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen summoned the Russian ambassador for clarification regarding reports of alleged use of cluster bombs by Russian forces in Georgia; he also urged the Dutch government to persuade the Russians to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The Director-General of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura, also condemned the killings and recalled the obligation under international law to respect the civilian status of reporters. He called on the authorities to investigate and take appropriate action.
On October 20, 2008, Dutch government announced its investigation has found that Storimans was in fact killed by a Russian cluster munition after the withdrawal of the Georgian army from the city. The investigative team sent to Georgia to gather forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts concluded Storimans was killed by a munition "propelled by a type of rocket that is only found in Russia's military arsenal". Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen called the findings "very serious" and said in a statement he had "made that clear to the Russian authorities. Cluster munitions must not be used in this way. There were no troops present in Gori and innocent civilians were killed." Verhagen said the Netherlands plans to raise the matter with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Father Ray Foundation

The Father Ray Foundation is a charitable organisation located in the Thai resort town of Pattaya. 
It currently cares for more than 850 underprivileged, orphaned, abused, neglected and abandoned children and students with disabilities.
History.
It was in 1974 that Father Ray Brennan C.Ss.R., an American priest of the Redemptorist order, first accepted an unwanted baby into his care.
That one act of kindness would be the start of a life of devotion to help the underprivileged in Thai society. 
He opened an orphanage, a pre-school facility for deaf toddlers, a vocational school for people with disabilities, a home for street kids and a school for blind children.
Father Ray died on the morning of 16 August 2003 and since then the Father Ray Foundation has continued his work in his vision and continues to live by its motto that ‘we never turn a needy child away’. 
Since 2003 the Father Ray Foundation has opened several new projects including a children’s village, a drop-in center for street kids, a facility for children with special needs and a day care center for toddlers from the poorer slum areas of Pattaya.
Projects.
The Father Ray Foundation helps children through the following projects:
The School was opened in 1984 and offered part-time courses in Computer Science. 
It was in 1987 that the school accepted its first full-time students, offering free accommodation, food and medical help to young adults living with a disability.
Students study for two years and courses available include -
Since the school opened its doors more than 2500 students have successfully graduated and are now able to, in the words of Father Ray, 'earn their own rice'. 
Established in 1986, the purpose of the school is to give an education at primary and secondary levels to those children who are blind or severely partially sighted. In the first twenty five years since the school opened more than 400 students have graduated.
The aim of the Home is to provide assistance to under-privileged children who lack proper care from their own families. At the Home the children live in a safe environment, free from harm and with access to education, medical assistance and a nutritious diet. 
As in all programs where there is a family breakdown, it is the goal of the Father Ray Foundation to re-unite the family and assist them to maintain their family life. 
The Home offers scholarship to children living in the local community with the aim of keeping the family together but ensuring the child can continue with their studies. 
This project is the smallest, but one of the most important of all the Father Ray Foundation projects.
It is a temporary place of residence where children and teenagers can find a safe environment to live, one where they will be free from risk of any type of harm. 
Children from broken families, those who have been abused, orphaned or neglected or those who have run away from home will find a safe haven while a more suitable and permanent location to live is found. 
Many of the children living at the Father Ray Children's Home and the Children's Village first arrived at the Drop-In Center.
The outreach team also work in the slum areas of Pattaya, offering help and support to families where children are at risk of harm or at risk of becoming street kids.
Located on the same site as the Drop-In Center, the Half Way House is where teenage boys live while they are seeking work, in employment or continuing their education.
They learn to live independently, while knowing support is nearby if they need it. 
When the Father Ray Day Care Center opened in 2008 the aim was to provide kindergarten education for children from the poorer slum areas of Pattaya. 
Children from the age of three to seven spent their days in a safe environment while their parents are working or seeking work. 
In 2012 the age of the children accepted into the Center was changed. Several local schools and local education authorities throughout the city of Pattaya now offer kindergarten facilities. Children who were attending the Father Ray Day Care Center enrolled at facilities located nearer to where they live, therefore the Center decided to accept children from the age of one to three. 
No other organisation in the Pattaya area if offering care facilities to children of this age group. 
Opened in 2008 the Children's Village is based on the SOS Children's Villages that were founded in 1949 to provide a home to children who had been orphaned during World War II.
Children live at the Father Ray Children's Village is houses with five to eight other children. They live as part of a family, with their new bother and sisters and the lady who will take care of them, cook for them, support them, love them and who they will call mother.
In 2007 a mother arrived seeking help for her son who is living with cerebral palsy. 
As word spread of the help that was on offer parents from all over the Pattaya area arrived, all seeking help for their child.
The Center offers physiotherapy, occupational therapy and an education to the children while supporting the family and educating they in the condition their child is living with. 
However, a lack of space, equipment and specialist staff means the Center can not give as much support as the children need. Major changes to the Center will be made later in 2013.
Food.
The Father Ray Foundation provides nutritious meals to its children and students every day. 
Rice, the staple food of Thailand, is served at almost every meal and more than 75,000 kg of rice are cooked each year.
On World Food Day, in mid October each year, the Father Ray Foundation appeals to the people of Pattaya to help feed the children and students. 
During the annual SOS RICE Appeal, taking place each year over one weekend in early December, the children, students and foreign volunteers ask shoppers at all major supermarkets to buy and donate a bag of rice. 
Each year more than 10,000 kg of rice is donated and almost 1 million Baht in cash is donated to buy rice. 
The Father Ray Foundation has several initiatives to become more self-sufficient in providing food.
At the Father Ray Children's Village the agriculture farm is providing fruits and vegetables, grown without pesticides. 
At the Father Ray Children's Home the residents take care of two chicken houses, which between them are providing almost 500 eggs each day.
The children also take care of several mushroom huts. The children harvest the crop before washing, weighing and distributing the mushrooms to the Central Purchasing department. The mushrooms are also sold at local food markets.
Health.
It is essential that all the children and students under the care of the Father Ray Foundation have access to medical assistance if they need it.
Each project managed by the Father Ray Foundation has a designated health care professional who is able to deal with any minor health problems that may occur. 
Serious injuries or ailments are treated at local hospitals.
Funders and supporters.
The Father Ray Foundatibon receives support from the following organizations and companies:
Volunteers.
For many years the Father Ray Foundation has welcomed foreign volunteers who want to come and help improve the lives of the children and students of the Foundation. 
Volunteers stay for a minimum of 6 months and work in the various projects. Work includes teaching English at the vocational school, helping the nannies at the Day Care Center and organising educational activities for the blind children.
On the weekends they teach English at the Children's Village while over at the Children's Home they organise arts & crafts, sports activities and provide English and Chinese lessons. 
Accommodation and three meals each day is provided free of charge. However the volunteer must pay for their own flight, medical insurance and pocket money
Volunteers arrive in late April or in late October, ready for the new school terms

Charles Gumery

Charles-Alphonse-Achille Guméry (14 June 1827 – 19 January 1871) was a French sculptor working in an academic realist manner in Paris. Several of his figures ornament the Opéra Garnier most notoriously the group "La Danse", which was commissioned from him after the group by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux was found unacceptable.
Though he was born in the "quartier" of Vaugirard in Paris, Charles Guméry was from a middle-class Savoyard family established by his father at Passy.His father, Nicolas Guméry, was a schoolteacher. 
A student of Armand Toussaint (1806–1862) at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, in 1850 he received the Prix de Rome, the "sine qua non" for an official career as a French sculptor. He became a prominent sculptor of the Second Empire, who was awarded the Legion d'Honneur, 29 June 1867. 
When, on the morning of 29 August 1869 it was discovered that ink had been thrown over Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux' marble "La Danse" in the façade of the Opéra Garnier, it was thought to have been a scandalized gesture by a member of the public because of the nudity of Carpeaux' figures. Charles Garnier, who had already commissioned from Gumery two gilded groups for the cornice of the Palais Garnier, asked Gumery to sculpt a replacement figure of "La Danse" to replace the disfigured Carpeaux group. With the Franco-Prussian War of the following year, followed by the Paris Commune, during which Gumery died in Paris under obscure circumstances during the privations of the Siege of Paris, when many starved, and then the death of Carpeaux in 1875, the scandal was forgotten: the Carpeaux group remained in place and Gumery's "La Danse" is conserved in the Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers. 
Gomery is buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre, where his gravestone is surmounted by a bust sculpted by his pupil Jean Gautherin.

Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben

Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben (died 24 July 1315) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and the last ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben.
He was the last child and only son of Otto I, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben, by his wife Hedwig, daughter of Henry III the White, Duke of Breslau.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1304, Otto inherited his principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben.
Otto participated in the political feuds typical of his era. In 1307 he supported the House of Wettin. After years of maintaining close ties with his cousin Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, Otto broke with him and became a vassal of King Eric VI of Denmark in 1315. He died shortly after; the last male of his family, the line of Anhalt-Aschersleben became extinct upon his death.
The Bishopric of Halberstadt took over his principality and lands (including Aschersleben) as payment for debt after his death. The presiding Anhalt prince at this time, Bernhard II of Anhalt-Bernburg, recognized the validity of the bishop's claim to this territory and the transfer was agreed upon in acontract signed in December 1316. Unfortunately, the rights to the Principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben were disputed and argued over for centuries. In 1648, the prince/electors of Brandenburg took over the Bishopric of Halberstadt and all its possessions, including all of the land and rights once possessed by Prince Otto II.
Marriage and issue.
On 24 August 1309, Otto married Elisabeth (d. aft. 2 May 1347), the only daughter of Frederick Clem, the youngest son of Henry III, Margrave of Meissen. They had two daughters:

Skullduggery (1970) is a science fiction film directed by Gordon Douglas, starring Burt Reynolds, Susan Clark, and Edward Fox, and produced by Saul David.
The screenplay is based on the French novel "Les Animaux dénaturés" (1952)—variously titled in English as "You Shall Know Them", "Borderline", and "The Murder of the Missing Link"—by Jean Bruller ("Vercors").
Plot.
On an expedition in Papua New-Guinea a tribe of apelike creatures is found. They are named the Tropis. Quickly they are being used as slaves by humans.
Then one of the Tropis is allegedly murdered. The following murder trial centers round the question: are the Tropis a form of humans or a form of animals? The question is a form of the Sorites paradox.

Telescope Array Project

The Telescope Array project is an international collaboration involving research and educational institutions in Japan, The United States, Russia, South Korea, and Belgium. The experiment is designed to observe air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic ray using a combination of ground array and air-fluorescence techniques. It is located in the high desert in Millard County, Utah (USA) at about above sea level.
Overview.
The Telescope Array observatory is a hybrid detector system consisting of both an array of 507 scintillation surface detectors (SD) which measure the distribution of charged particles at the Earth's surface, and three fluorescence stations which observe the night sky above the SD array. Each fluorescence station is also accompanied by a LIDAR system for atmospheric monitoring. The SD array is much like that of the AGASA group, but covers an area that is nine times larger. The hybrid setup of the Telescope Array project allows for simultaneous observation of both the longitudinal development and the lateral distribution of the air showers. When a cosmic ray passes through the earth's atmosphere and triggers an air shower, the fluorescence telescopes measure the scintillation light generated as the shower passes through the gas of the atmosphere, while the array of scintillator surface detectors samples the footprint of the shower when it reaches the Earth's surface.
At the center of the ground array is the Central Laser Facility which is used for atmospheric monitoring and calibrations.
Surface detector.
The surface detectors that make up the ground array are activated when ionizing particles from an extensive air shower pass through them. When these particles pass through the plastic scintillator within the detector, it induces photo electrons which are then gathered by wavelength-shifting fibers and sent to a photomultiplier tube. The electronic components within the detectors then filter the results, giving the detectors comparable accuracy to the AGASA experiment.
The surface detectors are evenly distributed across a 762 km2 grid array with 1.2 km between each unit. Each surface detector has an assembled weight of 250 kg and consists of a power supply, two layers of scintillation detectors and electronics. Power is generated by a 120W solar panel and stored in a sealed lead-acid battery. The system has the capacity to operate for one week in complete darkness. Each scintillation detector layer is made of extruded plastic scintillator that is 1.2 cm thick and has an area of 3m2. The photo multiplier tube is connected to the scintillator via 96 wavelength-shifting fibers.
FD station, telescope, and camera.
The Telescope Array has three fluorescence detector (FD) telescope stations. As in the previous Fly's Eye and High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiments, these detectors work by measuring the air fluorescence light emitted by an extensive air shower. Each FD telescope consists of a primary mirror (made up of 18 smaller hexagonal mirror segments) and a camera. The cameras are made up of 256 PMTs (photomultiplier tubes) which are sensitive to the ultra violet light generated by a cosmic ray air shower.
The stations are located on a triangle about 35 km apart from one another. Each station has 12-14 telescopes viewing the range from 3 to 33 degrees in elevation. The three sites are named "Black Rock Mesa" (BRM), "Long Ridge" (LR), and "Middle Drum" (MD). By combining the data from the three sites, it is possible to determine the primary energy, the arrival direction, and the maximum
point of longitudinal development for an air shower.
Cosmic Ray Center.
The Lon and Mary Watson Millard County Cosmic Ray Center was dedicated on March 20, 2006. The center is located at 648 West Mail Street in Delta. The building serves as a headquarters and data processing center for the Telescope Array Project.
In October 2011, a new visitor center was opened at the Cosmic Ray Center. It features displays about the history of cosmic ray research in Utah and about the Telescope Array, which is spread across the desert west of Delta. The center also includes a display about the nearby Topaz internment camp, where U.S. citizens of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II.
TALE.
TALE is the Telescope Array Low Energy extension. It is designed to observe cosmic rays with energies between 3×1016eV and 1019eV. TALE adds 10 new telescopes to the Middle Drum observatory site (24 total telescopes) extending the vertical field of view so that it now extends from 3 to 59 degrees in elevation. This allows the station to see the shower development including shower maximum for lower energy events. This is critical when trying to determine the chemical composition of the incident cosmic ray particle.
The TALE project also has a graded infill array of scintillator stations spaced 400m and 600m apart. It then connects to the main Telescope Array scintillator array where the scintillator detectors are 1200m apart. These stations measure charged particle densities (the shower footprint) at the Earth's surface for lower energy events approaching 3x1016eV
TARA.
The Telescope Array RADAR (TARA) Project is an effort to overcome some of the problems inherent to current cosmic ray detection techniques. Due to sun, moon and weather, fluorescence telescopes are usually limited to a ten percent duty cycle. Ground arrays can run during the day, but require a large amount of land, making it necessary to build them in remote locations. The goal of the TARA Project is to develop a bistatic radar detection system that is able to maintain a 24 hour duty cycle at a fraction of the cost of conventional detection systems.
In September 2012, the W. M. Keck Foundation awarded researchers at the University of Utah a $1 million grant to develop a bistatic radar detection system. This system will be built alongside the existing Telescope Array and will use analog television transmitters and digital receivers to observe the range, direction and strength of cosmic rays in order to trace them back to their point of origin. Once completed, this new facility will be known as the W.M. Keck Radar Observatory

Swords &amp; Soldiers

Swords & Soldiers is a 2D sidescrolling real-time strategy game by Ronimo Games. It was released in Europe on May 15, 2009, and in North America on June 8, 2009. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, Wii, PlayStation 3, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.
Gameplay.
In "Swords & Soldiers", three factions (the Aztecs, the Vikings and the Imperial Chinese) are fighting each other to gain the powers of the gods. The game boasts both a single player campaign for all three factions and a skirmish mode, as well as competitive split-screen multiplayer and several other modes and minigames players can unlock by progressing through the game.
The single player campaign features 10 missions for each faction, with objectives ranging from conquering the enemy's base on the other side of the play area to surviving a full out assault from the enemy or infiltrating their defenses with a limited number of troops. Players collect gold and mana which are used to purchase units and spells. After being built, units automatically begin marching towards the enemies base and players cast spells to either strengthen their own units or directly attack their enemies. Players must make strategic decisions on what units to build and when to send them out.
Development.
"Swords & Soldiers" began development after THQ acquired the rights to its first game "de Blob". While it was originally intended to be a flash game, the developers saw potential in the title and moved it to the WiiWare service. The development team was initially made up by seven developers and a "varying amount of interns", and the team used the offices of Dutch Game Garden to develop the game. "Swords & Soldiers" began as simply a split-screen multiplayer game featuring only the Aztecs and the Vikings. The developers validated this decision using arguments such as them not being sure how well WiiWare games sell, that the project was mostly to show that they could develop a game from point A to point Z, that the multiplayer component was one of the strongest features of the game, and that beginning with multiplayer allows the developers to balance the game right away. The single player mode was added after the developers implemented a single player tutorial, which they found fun. While they intended to only put a small amount of single player content, they ended up adding 30 campaign levels, additional challenge modes, achievements, and other features. They used extensive play testing to ensure that the game, especially the single player mode, had a proper difficulty curve and that the gameplay is not complicated. They attempted to utilize it to test the game's balance, but found that testers took too long with strategies to use it accurately with testing factions' strengths. The developers cited the play testers for helping them make it as good as it is and for creating a fan following on the Internet. Several features of the game were implemented late in the development process, including the ability to change the game's pace. A major addition was added balance, which they realized was necessary after discovering that the balance was very poor in spite of believing it to be much better initially.
The developers were focused on the idea they had for the game from the beginning. The visual style and gameplay were established early in the development, motivating the developers in how simply the development process progressed. In the first months of its development, the developers had created a tool chain and approximately 90% of the gameplay functionality. Two features of the game were unclear to the developers during development; a "troop manipulation" mechanic, a common feature found in other real-time strategy video games that allows players to control the movements of their units, was a feature that the developers wanted to include. They attempted to include it by allowing players to drag units backwards or stop them by clicking on them, but felt that such a feature took away from tactical decisions and put too much emphasis on micromanagement and twitch gameplay. The developers added menus to the main gameplay late in the game. The final version was described by them as a "very polished version" of the vision they had of what they wanted.
The audio of "Swords & Soldiers" was created as a collaboration between the developers and an external audio studio called Sonic Picnic, which was located near their offices, making it very accessible to them. The developers found Sonic Picnic to be helpful, receiving an audio experience from them that matched with their vision. Due to a low budget, the developers offered Sonic Picnic royalties, which Sonic Picnic accepted due to being impressed by the prototype. Developers stated that this process kept them motivated to finish the game. The voice samples for the characters and units were created by recording the various developers and putting their voices in the game.
The developers cited the real-time strategy game "StarCraft" as a strong inspiration, citing in particular its use of factions as something that made it particularly more inspiring than other games in the genre. They add that the quality of "StarCraft"s factions comes from both the gameplay and their visual appearances. This caused them to focus on having three different factions that played differently from each other. They intended to make sure that every unit and spell was unique as well as different abilities for each faction such as how each one collects mana. The first faction, the Vikings, simply have to buy an upgrade, intending to make the Vikings the most accessible class. The Aztecs sacrifice a unit to turn its health into mana, which the developers state they did so to add "playful cruelty" to this faction. The Chinese faction has to build a Buddha statue, which generates mana until it's destroyed, requiring players to protect it. The developers intended to make the Chinese faction more complex than the other two. They intended on making each faction's miners different in how they collect gold, but found that this was too difficult to balance. The Chinese faction was originally not included in the game. The developers originally only revealed two factions - the Vikings and the Aztecs. On April Fools' Day, 2009, Ronimo jokingly announced that the yet to be revealed faction would be the Space Marines; however on April 22, 2009 it was confirmed that the third faction will be the Chinese Empire.
The developers' marketing plan began as merely releasing screenshots and videos of the game on the Internet. However, they found that this was not adequate to create buzz. Because the deadline was pushed back a half of a year, the marketing started with the original release date in mind, the developers had to fill in the space between its announcement and release with enough marketing material to maintain interest in it. They had to get a full-time artist to create videos, screenshots, logos, and high resolution materials to release, also receiving assistance from Nintendo to promote the game. According to Ronimo's Joost van Dongen, the art style for "Swords & Soldiers" was inspired by the credits of a video called "Super Moine" (i.e. ""Super Monk"" in French), and from the ability of an artist in the team.
Versions.
The PC version was renamed "Swords & Soldiers HD" and made available on Steam.
Reception.
"Swords and Soldiers" has received a positive reception from critics, garnering a score of 84 at Metacritic, and 84% at GameRankings.
IGN gave the game its Editor's Choice award, calling it "one of the best console real-time strategy games ever" while praising the production values and personality of the game, as well as its unique approach to the genre. Nintendo Life called the game an essential download, praising the visuals, music and depth of the gameplay and noting the plethora of modes for players. "Edge" called it a "a riot of colour and imagination" that "towers above everything else WiiWare currently has to offer". "Official Nintendo Magazine" called it "a colourful, vibrant and frankly brilliant console strategy title".

General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants

A large number of General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants have been produced by General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and various licensed manufacturers. The details of the F-16 variants, along with major modification programs and derivative designs significantly influenced by the F-16, are described below.
Pre-production variants.
YF-16.
Two single-seat YF-16 prototypes were built for the Light Weight Fighter (LWF) competition. The first YF-16 was rolled out at Fort Worth on 13 December 1973 and accidentally accomplished its first flight on 21 January 1974, followed by its scheduled "first flight" on 2 February 1974. The second prototype first flew on 9 March 1974. Both YF-16 prototypes participated in the flyoff against the Northrop YF-17 prototypes, with the F-16 winning the Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition, as the LWF program had been renamed.
F-16 FSD.
In January 1975, the Air Force ordered eight full-scale development (FSD) F-16s – six single-seat F-16A and a pair of two-seat F-16B – for test and evaluation. The first FSD F-16A flew on 8 December 1976 and the first FSD F-16B on 8 August 1977. Over the years, these aircraft have been used as test demonstrators for a variety of research, development and modification study programs.
Main production variants.
F-16A/B.
The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initially equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 pulse-doppler radar, Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 turbofan, rated at 14,670 lbf (64.9 kN) and 23,830 lbf (106.0 kN) with afterburner. The USAF bought 375 F-16As and 125 F-16Bs, with delivery completed in March 1985.
F-16A/B Block 1/5/10.
Early blocks (Block 1/5/10) featured relatively minor differences between each. Most were later upgraded to the Block 10 configuration in the early 1980s. There were 94 Block 1, 197 Block 5, and 312 Block 10 aircraft produced. Block 1 is the early production model with the nose cone painted black.
It was discovered that the Block 1 aircraft's black nose cone became an obvious visual identification cue at long range, so the color of the nose cone was changed to the low-visibility grey for Block 5 aircraft. During the operation of F-16 Block 1, it was discovered that rain water could accumulate in certain spots within the fuselage, so drainage holes were drilled in the forward fuselage and tail fin area for Block 5 aircraft.
The Soviet Union significantly reduced the export of titanium during the late 1970s, so the manufacturers of the F-16 used aluminum instead wherever practical. New methods were also used: the corrugated aluminum is bolted to the epoxy surface for Block 10 aircraft, replacing the old method of aluminum honeycomb being glued to the epoxy surface used in earlier aircraft.
F-16A/B Block 15.
The first major change in the F-16, the Block 15 aircraft featured larger horizontal stabilizers, the addition of two hardpoints to the chin inlet, an improved AN/APG-66(V)2 radar, and increased capacity for the underwing hardpoints. The Block 15 also gained the Have Quick II secure UHF radio. To counter the additional weight of the new hardpoints, the horizontal stabilizers were enlarged by 30%. Block 15 is the most numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. The last one was delivered in 1996 to Thailand.
F-16A/B Block 20.
Block 20 added some F-16C/D block 50/52 capabilities: improved AN/APG-66(V)3 radar with added CW mode to guide two types of BVR missiles — AIM-7M Sparrow missiles and AIM-120 AMRAAM, carriage of AGM-84 Harpoon missiles, as well as the LANTIRN navigation and targeting pod. The Block 20 computers are significantly improved in comparison to that of the earlier versions that later integrated into post 1997 Block 50/52, and also getting color MFD. The Republic of China (Taiwan) received 150 F-16A/B Block 20 aircraft.
F-16C/D.
F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat).
F-16C/D Block 25.
The Block 25 F-16C first flew in June 1984 and entered USAF service in September. The aircraft are fitted with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar and have improved precision night-attack capability. Block 25 introduced a very substantial improvement in cockpit avionics, including improved fire-control and stores management computers, an Up-Front Controls (UFC) integrated data control panel, data-transfer equipment, multifunction displays, radar altimeter, and many other changes. Block 25's were first delivered with the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 engine and later upgraded to the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E. With 209 models delivered, today the USAF's Air National Guard and Air Education and Training Command are the only remaining users of this variant. One F-16C, nicknamed the "Lethal Lady", had flown over 7,000 hours by April 2008.
F-16C/D Block 30/32.
This was the first block of F-16s affected by the Alternative Fighter Engine project under which aircraft were fitted with the traditional Pratt & Whitney engines or, for the first time, the General Electric F110-GE-100. From this point on, blocks ending in "0" (e.g., Block 30) are powered by GE, and blocks ending in "2" (e.g., Block 32) are fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines.
The first Block 30 F-16 entered service in 1987. Major differences include the carriage of the AGM-45 Shrike, AGM-88 HARM, and the AIM-120 missiles, which entered service in Sept 1991. From Block 30D, aircraft were fitted with larger engine air intakes (called a Modular Common Inlet Duct) for the increased-thrust GE engine. Since the Block 32 retained the Pratt and Whitney F-100 engine, the smaller (normal shock inlet) was retained for those aircraft. A total of 733 aircraft were produced and delivered to six countries. The Block 32H/J aircraft assigned to the USAF Thunderbird flight demonstration squadron were built in 1986 and 1987 and are some of the oldest operational F-16s in the Air Force. The Air National Guard procured many upgrades for their fleet of aging block 30/32s including the addition of improved inertial guidance systems, improved electronic warfare suite (AN/ALQ-213), and upgrades to carry the Northrop Grumman LITENING targeting pod. The standard Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) was first changed to a ring laser gyro, and later upgraded again to an Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) system which combines a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). The EGI provided the capability to use Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and other GPS-aided munitions (see Block 50 list below). This capability, in combination with the LITENING targeting pod, greatly enhanced the capabilities of this aircraft. The sum of these modifications to the baseline Block 30 is commonly known as the F-16C++ (pronounced "plus plus") version.
F-16C/D Block 40/42.
Entering service in 1988, the Block 40/42 is the improved all-day/all-weather strike variant equipped with LANTIRN pod; also unofficially designated the F-16CG/DG, the night capability gave rise to the name "Night Falcons". This block features strengthened and lengthened undercarriage for LANTIRN pods, an improved radar, and a GPS receiver. From 2002, the Block 40/42 increased the weapon range available to the aircraft including JDAM, AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) and the (Enhanced) EGBU-27 Paveway "bunker-buster". Also incorporated in this block was the addition of cockpit lighting systems compatible with Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) equipment. The USAF's Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) that added the night vision (NVIS)-compatible systems was completed in 2004. A total of 615 Block 40/42 aircraft were delivered to 5 countries.
F-16C/D Block 50/52.
The first Block 50/52 F-16 was delivered in late 1991; the aircraft are equipped with improved GPS/INS, and the aircraft can carry a further batch of advanced missiles: the AGM-88 HARM missile, JDAM, JSOW and WCMD. Block 50 aircraft are powered by the F110-GE-129 while the Block 52 jets use the F100-PW-229.
F-16C/D Block 50/52 Plus.
This variant, which is also known as the Block 50/52+. Its main differences are the addition of support for conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), a dorsal spine compartment, the APG-68(V9) radar, an On-Board Oxygen Generation (OBOGS) system and a JHMCS helmet.
The CFTs are mounted above the wing, on both sides of the fuselage and are easily removable. They provide an additional 440 US gallons or approximately of additional fuel, allowing increased range or time on station and frees up hardpoints for weapons instead of underwing fuel tanks. All two-seat "Plus" aircraft have the enlarged avionics dorsal spine compartment which is located behind the cockpit and extends to the tail. It adds 30 cu ft (850 L) to the airframe for more avionics with only small increases in weight and drag.
Poland took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 15 September 2006. The "Poland Peace Sky program" includes 36 F-16Cs and 12 F-16Ds. All 48 aircraft were delivered in 2008. The Hellenic Air Force took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 22 May 2008. The total Greek order is for 20 F-16Cs and 10 F-16Ds. The remaining 26 aircraft should be delivered by March 2010. The Israeli F-16I and its Singapore equivalent variant are based on the block 52+ aircraft. In March 2010 it was announced that the Egyptian Air Force would purchase 20 Block 52 aircraft (16 F-16Cs and 4 F-16Ds), the first of which arrived for testing in April 2012
F-16E/F.
F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat). Originally, the single-seat version of the General Dynamics F-16XL was to have been designated "F-16E", with the twin-seat variant designated "F-16F". This was sidelined by the Air Force's selection of the competing F-15E Strike Eagle in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter fly-off in 1984. The 'Block 60' designation had also previously been set aside in 1989 for the A-16, but this model was dropped. The F-16E/F designation now belongs to a special version developed especially for the United Arab Emirates, and is sometimes unofficially called the "Desert Falcon".
F-16E/F Block 60.
Based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52, it features improved radar and avionics and conformal fuel tanks; it has only been sold to the United Arab Emirates. At one time, this version was incorrectly thought to have been designated "F-16U." A major difference from previous blocks is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which gives the airplane the capability to simultaneously track and destroy ground and air threats. The Block 60's General Electric F110-GE-132 engine is a development of the -129 model and is rated at 32,500 lbf (144 kN). The Electronic Warfare system is supposed to be quite advanced and includes the Northrop Grumman Falcon Edge Integrated Electronic Warfare Suite RWR together with the AN/ALQ-165 Self-Protection Jammer. Falcon Edge, which was developed by Northrop Grumman specifically for the Block 60, is capable of showing not only the bearing of any threat but also the range. The Block 60 allows the carriage of all Block 50/52-compatible weaponry as well as AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) and the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM). The CFTs provide an additional 450 US gallon (2,045 L) of fuel, allowing increased range or time on station. This has the added benefit of freeing up hardpoints for weapons that otherwise would have been occupied by underwing fuel tanks. The MIL-STD-1553 data bus is replaced by MIL-STD-1773 fiber-optic data bus which offers a 1,000 times increase in data-handling capability. UAE funded the entire $3 billion Block 60 development costs, and in exchange will receive royalties if any of the Block 60 aircraft are sold to other nations. According to press reports quoted by "Flight International", this is "the first time the US has sold a better aircraft [F-16] overseas than its own forces fly".
Like the F-35, the Block 60 F-16 has a built in FLIR/laser targeting system rather than using a dedicated pod that would occupy a hardpoint, increase drag and RCS.
In 2014 the UAE requested an upgrade to Block 61, along with the purchase of 30 more aircraft at that level.
Major modification variants.
F-16A/B Block 15 ADF.
The F-16 Air Defense Fighter (ADF) was a special variant of the Block 15 optimized for the United States Air National Guard's fighter interception mission. Begun in 1989, 270 airframes were modified. Avionics were upgraded (including the addition of an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator with "bird-slicing" IFF antennas), and a spotlight fitted forward and below the cockpit, for night-time identification. This was the only US version equipped with the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. Beginning in 1994, these aircraft began to be replaced by newer F-16C variants. By 2005, only the North Dakota ANG was flying this variant, with these last examples retired by 2007.
F-16A/B Block 15 OCU.
Beginning in January 1988, all Block 15 F-16A/B were delivered with an Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The Block 15 OCU aircraft incorporate the wide-angle HUD that was first introduced on the F-16C/D Block 25, more reliable F100-PW-220 turbofans, updated defensive systems, the ability to fire the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AGM-119 Penguin Mk.3 anti-shipping missile developed by the Norwegian company Kongsberg, and provisions for the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Many foreign customers upgraded their aircraft to the F-16A/B Block 15OCU standard.
The first of five prototype conversions flew on 28 April 1995, and installation of production kits began in January 1997. The original plans called for the production of 553 kits (110 for Belgium, 63 for Denmark, 172 for the Netherlands, 57 for Norway, and 130 for the USAF), however, final orders amounted to only 325 kits (72 for Belgium, 61 for Denmark, 136 for the Netherlands, and 56 for Norway). The EPAFs redesignated the F-16A/B aircraft receiving the MLU as F-16AM/BM, respectively. Portugal later joined the program and the first of 20 aircraft was redelivered on 26 June 2003, with another 20 going through the update incountry at this time. In recent years, Chile, Jordan, and Pakistan have purchased surplus Dutch and Belgian F-16AM/BM for their air forces.
Development of new software and hardware modifications continues under the MLU program. The M3 software tape was installed in parallel with the Falcon STAR structural upgrade to bring the F-16AM/BM up to the standards of the USAF's Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP). A total of 296 M3 kits (72 for Belgium, 59 for Denmark, 57 for Norway, and 108 for the Netherlands) were ordered for delivery from 2002–2007; installation is anticipated to be completed in 2010. A M4 tape has also been developed that adds the ability to use additional weapons and the Pantera targeting pod; Norway began conducting flying combat operations in Afghanistan with these upgraded aircraft in 2008. A M5 tape is in development that will enable employment of a wider array of the latest smart weapons, and the first aircraft upgraded with it are due to be delivered in 2009.
F-16C/D Block 30 F-16N/TF-16N.
The U.S. Navy acquired 22 modified Block 30 F-16Cs for use as adversary assets for dissimilar air combat training (DACT); four of these were TF-16N two-seaters. These aircraft were delivered in 1987-1988. Fighter Squadron 126 (VF-126) and the Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS) (or TOPGUN) operated them at NAS Miramar, California on the West Coast; East Coast adversary training squadrons were Fighter Squadron 43 (VF-43) at NAS Oceana, Virginia and Fighter Squadron 45 (VF-45) at NAS Key West, Florida. Each squadron had five F-16N and one TF-16N, with the exception of TOPGUN which had six and one, respectively. Due to the high stress of constant combat training, the wings of these aircraft began to crack and the Navy announced their retirement in 1994. By 1995, all but one of these aircraft had been sent to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) for preservation and storage; one F-16N was sent to the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida as a museum article. As adversary aircraft, the Navy's F-16Ns were notable for their colorful appearance. Most Navy F-16N aircraft were painted in a three-tone blue-gray "ghost" scheme. TOPGUN had some of the more colorful ones: a three-color desert scheme, a light blue one and a green splinter camouflage version with Marine Corps markings. VF-126 also had a unique blue example.
In 2002, the Navy began to receive 14 F-16A and B models from the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) that were originally intended for Pakistan before being embargoed. These aircraft (which are not designated F-16N/TF-16N) are operated by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) / (TOPGUN) for adversary training and like their F-16N predecessors are painted in exotic schemes.
F-16CJ/DJ Block 50D/52D.
An unknown number of Block 50/52 aircraft have been delivered to the USAF modified to perform the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission, replacing the F-4G 'Wild Weasel' aircraft; these were unofficially designated F-16CJ/DJ. Capable of launching both the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) and AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles, the F-16CJ/DJ are equipped with a Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny laser spot tracker and the Texas Instruments AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System (HTS), with the HTS pod being mounted on the port intake hardpoint. The first F-16CJ (serial number 91-0360) was delivered on 7 May 1993.
F-16 "Özgür".
Turkey has commenced retrofitting its F-16 Block 30 fleet with an indigenous mission computer and avionics developed by ASELSAN, hence enabling Turkey to integrate non-US sub-systems and avionics onto their F-16s. The modified Turkish F-16's locally named "Ozgur" are considered to be a testing bed for Turkey's TFX next generation stealth fighter project.
F-16I "Sufa".
The F-16I is a two-seat variant of the Block 52 developed for the Israeli Defense Force – Air Force (IDF/AF). Israel issued a requirement in September 1997 and selected the F-16 in preference to the F-15I in July 1999. An initial "Peace Marble V" contract was signed on 14 January 2000 with a follow on contract signed on 19 December 2001 for a total procurement of 102 aircraft. The F-16I, which is called "Sufa" (Storm) by the IDF/AF, first flew on 23 December 2003, and deliveries to the IDF/AF began on 19 February 2004. The F-16I has an estimated unit cost of approximately US$70 million (2006).
One major deviation of the F-16I from the Block 52 is that approximately 50% of the avionics were replaced by Israeli-developed avionics, such as the Israeli Aerial Towed Decoy replacing the ALE-50 and autonomous aerial combat maneuvering instrumentation, which enables training exercises to be conducted without dependence on ground instrumentation. Elbit Systems produced the aircraft's helmet-mounted sight, head-up display (HUD), mission and presentation computers, and digital map display. Furthermore, the F-16I can employ Rafael's Python 5 infrared-guided air-to-air missile, and often uses Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI)'s removable conformal fuel tanks (CFT) for extended range. Key American-sourced systems include the F100-PW-229 turbofan engine, which offers commonality with the IDF/AF's F-15Is, and the APG-68(V)9 radar.
Special mission variants.
A-16.
The A-16 began as a late-1980s GD project to develop a close air support (CAS) version of the basic F-16 by adding armor and strengthening the wings for a heavier weapons load, including a 30 mm cannon and 7.62 mm Minigun pods. Two F-16A Block 15 aircraft were modified to this configuration. Envisioned as a successor to the A-10, the type was to have received the 'Block 60' designation; however, the A-16 never went into production due to a 26 November 1990 Congressional directive to the US Air Force mandating that it retain two wings of A-10s.
F/A-16.
A second outcome of that directive was a decision by the Air Force that, instead of upgrading the A-10, it would seek to retrofit 400 Block 30/32 F-16s as with new equipment to perform both CAS and battlefield air interdiction (BAI) missions. The new systems for this "F/A-16" Block 30 included a digital terrain-mapping system and Global Positioning System (GPS) integration for improved navigational and weapons delivery accuracy, as well as an Automatic Target Handoff System (ATHS) to allow direct digital target/mission data exchange between the pilot and ground units. This approach, however, was dropped in January 1992 in favor of equipping Block 40/42 F-16C/Ds with LANTIRN pods.
Other CAS initiatives.
In 1991, 24 F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft belonging to the 174th TFW, a New York Air National Guard unit that had transitioned from the A-10 in 1988, were armed with the 30 mm GAU-13/A four-barrel derivative of the seven-barrel GAU-8/A cannon used by the A-10A. This weapon was carried in a General Electric GPU-5/A Pave Claw gun pod on the centerline station, and was supplied with 353 rounds of ammunition. There were also plans to convert F-16C's to this configuration and to incorporate the A-10's AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny laser spot tracker. The vibration from the gun when firing proved so severe as to make both aiming and flying the aircraft difficult, and trials were suspended after two days. Although the 174th's aircraft were employed for CAS during Operation Desert Storm, they did not use the gun pods in action, and the Block 10 F/A-16 was phased out after the war.
F-16A(R).
About two dozen F-16As of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) were supplied with indigenous Oude Delft Orpheus low-altitude tactical reconnaissance pods transferred from its retiring RF-104G. Designated F-16A(R), the first example flew on 27 January 1983, and they entered service with the RNLAF's 306 Squadron in October 1984. The aircraft were common with the regular F-16's. However they were equipped with an extra panel in the cockpit to control the center line mounted pod. Under the MLU program a more standardized interface was introduced so every aircraft could be used to operate the Orpheus pod or any other pod with the standardized interface.
Beginning in 1995, the Belgian Air Force replaced its own Mirage 5BR reconnaissance aircraft with at least a dozen F-16A(R) equipped with loaned Orpheus pods and Vinten cameras from the Mirages; these were replaced with more capable Per Udsen modular recce pods from 1996–98. The F-16A(R) remained primarily combat aircraft with a secondary reconnaissance role.
F-16 Recce.
The first reconnaissance variant was a USAF F-16D experimentally configured in 1986 with a centerline multi-sensor bathtub-style pod; it was referred to as "F-16 Recce" (and not "RF-16D" as it has sometimes been misreported). The USAF decided in 1988 to replace the aging RF-4C Phantom fleet with F-16C Block 30s fitted with the Control Data Corporation's Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System (ATARS) centerline pod, which could carry a variety of sensors. Problems with the ATARS program, however, led to the USAF's departure in June 1993. During the mid-1990s, the U.S. Air Force experimented with a series of centerline recce pod designs, beginning with a prototype pod, the Electro-Optical 1 (EO-1) pod. This was followed by four "Richmond recce pods", which saw service in the Balkans. The USAF finally settled on what would become the definitive AN/ASD-11 Theater Airborne Reconnaissance System (TARS). The first F-16 flight with a prototype TARS flew on 26 August 1995, and on 27 September 1996 the USAF placed its first production order for the pods. Block 30s and Block 25s of five Air National Guard (ANG) squadrons have received the system since mid-1998. The USAF, however, does not designate them "RF-16s".
RF-16A/C.
The designation RF-16A is used, though, by the Royal Danish Air Force. In early 1994, 10 Danish F-16A were redesignated as RF-16A tactical recce aircraft, replacing the RF-35 "Drakens" withdrawn at the end of 1993. As a temporary measure they were originally fitted with the "Drakens"' optical cameras and electro-optical (E-O) sensors repackaged in a Per Udsen 'Red Baron' recce pod, which were replaced a few years later by Per Udsen's Modular Reconnaissance Pod (MRP).
Technology demonstrators, and test variants.
Flight control variants.
YF-16 CCV.
The initial YF-16 prototype was reconfigured in December 1975 to serve as the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory's Control-Configured Vehicle (CCV) testbed. The CCV concept entails "decoupling" the aircraft's flight control surfaces so that they can operate independently. This approach enables unusual maneuvers such as being able to turn the airplane without banking it. The ability to maneuver in one plane without simultaneously moving in another was seen as offering novel tactical performance capabilities for a fighter. The CCV YF-16 design featured twin pivoting ventral fins mounted vertically underneath the air intake, and its triply redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FCS) was modified to permit use of flaperons on the wings' trailing edges which would act in combination with an all-moving stabilator. The fuel system was redesigned to enable adjustment of the aircraft's center of gravity by transferring fuel from one tank to another. The CCV aircraft achieved its first flight on 16 March 1976. The flight test program ran until 30 June 1977, and was marred only by a hard landing on 24 June 1976 that delayed testing until repairs were effected. The CCV program was judged successful and led to a more ambitious follow-on effort in the form of the "Advanced Fighter Technology Integration" (AFTI) F-16.
HiMAT.
A research derivative aircraft that had strong similarities to F-16 design was the HiMAT (for "Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology"). This joint USAF and NASA remotely piloted program used canards and other research technologies like synthetic vision with a lightweight composite structure that helped it to achieve high performance goals such as "sustaining" an 8-g turn. Two vehicles were built by Rockwell International and were flown from 1979 to 1983, for a total of 26 B-52 drop-test missions at Dryden.
F-16 SFW.
General Dynamics was one of several U.S. aircraft makers awarded a contract by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1976 to develop proposals for an experimental forward-swept wing test aircraft. GD's entry, the Swept Forward Wing (SFW) F-16, had a slightly lengthened fuselage to accommodate the larger, advanced composites wing. In January 1981, DARPA selected Grumman's entry, which became known as the X-29A. Although the SFW F-16 was not chosen, the X-29 incorporated some of the F-16's features, particularly its FBW flight control system and its undercarriage.
F-16XL.
The F-16XL featured a novel 'cranked-arrow' type of delta wing with more than twice the area of the standard F-16 wing. Developed under a program originally known as the Supersonic Cruise and Maneuvering Program (SCAMP), the design was intended to offer low drag at high subsonic or supersonic speeds without compromising low-speed maneuverability. As a result, the F-16XL can cruise efficiently at supersonic speeds without use of an afterburner. In late 1980, the USAF agreed to provide GD with the third and fifth FSD F-16s for modification into single-seat and twin-seat F-16XL prototypes. To accommodate the larger wing, the aircraft was lengthened 56 in (142 cm) by the addition of a 30-inch (76 cm) plug in the forward fuselage and a 26-inch (66 cm) section to the aft fuselage just behind the landing gear bulkhead. The rear fuselage was also canted up by three degrees to increase the angle of attack on takeoff and landing. The F-16XL could carry twice the payload of the F-16 on 27 hardpoints, and it had a 40% greater range due to an 82% increase in internal fuel carriage. The single-seat F-16XL first flew on 3 July 1982, followed by the two-seater on 29 October 1982. The F-16XL competed unsuccessfully with the F-15E Strike Eagle in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program; if it had won the competition, the production versions were to have been designated F-16E/F. Following the February 1984 selection announcement, both examples of the F-16XL were placed in flyable storage.
In late 1988, the two prototypes were taken out of storage and turned over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for use in a program designed to evaluate aerodynamic concepts for improving laminar airflow over the wing during sustained supersonic flight. From 1989–99, both aircraft were used by NASA for several experimental research programs, and in 2007, NASA was considering returning the single-seat F-16XL to operational status for further aeronautical research.
F-16AT Falcon 21.
In 1990 General Dynamics proposed the F-16AT 'Falcon 21' as a low-cost alternative for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that would eventually lead to the F-22 Raptor. It was a single-engined fighter based on the F-16XL, but with a trapezoidal wing.
NF-16D/VISTA/MATV.
In the late 1980s, General Dynamics and General Electric began exploring the application of thrust vector control (TVC) technology to the F-16 under the F-16 Multi-Axis Thrust-Vectoring (MATV) program. Originally the Israel Defense Forces/Air Force was going to supply an F-16D for this effort; however, the USAF, which had initially declined to support the program, changed its mind and took over the MATV project in 1991 and Israel withdrew from it the following year (the IDF was involved later when Ilan Ramon, who later became an astronaut on the ill-fated STS-107, flew the MATV F-16 during flight testing at Edwards AFB.)
Meanwhile, General Dynamics had received a contract in 1988 to develop the Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA). The F-16 VISTA effort was funded by the USAF, the U.S. Navy, and NASA. Calspan, a subcontractor to GD, fitted a Block 30 F-16D belonging to Wright Labs with a center stick (in addition to the sidestick controller), a new computer, and a digital flight control system that allowed it to imitate, to a degree, the performance of other aircraft. Redesignated NF-16D, its first flight in the VISTA configuration occurred on 9 April 1992.
In 1993, the variable-stability computers and center stick were temporarily removed from the VISTA for flight tests for the MATV program, under which the first use of thrust-vectoring in flight was accomplished on 30 July. Thrust-vectoring was enabled through the use of the Axisymmetric Vectoring Exhaust Nozzle (AVEN). Following the conclusion of MATV testing in March 1994, the VISTA variable-stability computers were reinstalled. In 1996 a program was begun to fit the NF-16D with a multi-directional thrust-vectoring nozzle, but the program was canceled due to lack of funding later that year. Although the F-16 VISTA program was considered successful, thrust vectoring was not taken up for the F-16 by the U.S. Air Force.
F-16U.
In F-16U was one of several configurations proposed for the United Arab Emirates in the early 1990s. The F-16U was a two-seat aircraft that combined many features of the F-16XL and the delta wing of the F-16X.
F-16X Falcon 2000.
In 1993 Lockheed Martin proposed development of a new version of the venerable F-16. This F-16X 'Falcon 2000' featured a delta-wing planform like that of the F-22; together with the fuselage stretch to accommodate the new wing design, the F-16X would have 80% more internal fuel volume. The design also permitted conformal carriage of the AIM-120 AMRAAM. LM claimed the F-16X could be built for two-thirds the cost of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.
F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration.
In March 1980, General Dynamics began converting the sixth FSD F-16A to serve as the technology demonstrator aircraft for the joint Flight Dynamics Laboratory-NASA Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI) program. The AFTI F-16 built upon GD's experience with its YF-16 CCV program, and the AFTI F-16 even received the twin pivoting vertical ventral fins from the CCV aircraft, which were likewise installed under the air intake. The aircraft was also fitted with a narrow dorsal fairing along its spine to house additional electronics. Technologies introduced and tested on the AFTI F-16 include a full-authority triplex Digital Flight Control System (DFCS), a six-degree-of-freedom Automated Maneuvering Attack System (AMAS), a 256-word-capacity Voice-Controlled Interactive Device (VCID) to control the avionics suite, and a helmet-mounted target designation sight that permitted the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) device and the radar to be automatically "slaved" to the pilot's head movement. First flight of the AFTI F-16 occurred on 10 July 1982. The Air Force Association gave its 1987 Theodore von Karman Award for the most outstanding achievement in science and engineering to the AFTI F-16 team.
The AFTI F-16 participated in numerous research and development programs:
F-16 GCAS.
Due to the unavailability of the AFTI F-16 following the AGCAS effort, a Block 25 F-16D was modified for continued investigation of ground collision-avoidance system (GCAS) technologies to reduce CFIT incidents; this joint effort by the USAF, Lockheed Martin, NASA and the Swedish Air Force was conducted during 1997–98. It has recently been reported that the US Air Force had decided to upgrade the F-16, F-22 and F-35 (all Lockheed Martin-designed, fly-by-wire fighters) with the AGCAS system.
F-16 Agile Falcon.
The F-16 Agile Falcon was a variant proposed by General Dynamics in 1984 that featured a 25% larger wing, uprated engine, and some already planned MSIP IV improvements for the basic F-16. Unsuccessfully offered as a low-cost alternative for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, some of its capabilities were incorporated into the F-16C/D Block 40, and the Agile Falcon would serve as the basis for developing Japan's F-2 fighter.
F-16 ES.
The F-16 Enhanced Strategic (ES) was an extended-range variant of the F-16C/D fitted with conformal fuel tanks that granted it a 40% greater range over the standard Block 50. The F-16ES also featured an internal FLIR system, which offered the capabilities of the LANTIRN navigation and targeting system without the drag associated with external pods. Unsuccessfully offered to Israel as an alternative to the F-15I Strike Eagle in late 1993, it was one of several configuration options offered to the United Arab Emirates that would ultimately lead to the development of the F-16E/F Block 60 for that nation. An F-16C Block 30 was modified to the ES configuration to test the conformal tanks and simulated FLIR sensor turrets fitted above and below the nose of the aircraft. The F-16ES first flew on 5 November 1994 and flight testing was completed in January 1995.
F-16 LOAN.
The F-16 Low-Observable Asymmetric Nozzle (LOAN) demonstrator was an F-16C fitted in late 1996 with a prototype nozzle with significantly reduced radar and infrared signatures and lowered maintenance requirements. It was tested in November 1996 to evaluate the technology for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.
F-16D 'CK-1'.
MANAT, the Israeli Air Force's flight test center, is known to operate a specially built Block 40 F-16D delivered in 1987 as a testbed aircraft designated 'CK-1'. It is used by the IAF for testing new flight configurations, weapon systems and avionics.
Engine variants.
F-16/79.
In response to President Jimmy Carter's February 1977 directive to curtail arms proliferation by selling only reduced-capability weapons to foreign countries, General Dynamics developed a modified export-oriented version of the F-16A/B designed for use with the outdated General Electric J79 turbojet engine. Northrop competed for this market with its F-20 Tigershark. Accommodating the J79-GE-119 engine required modification of the F-16's inlet, the addition of steel heat shielding, a transfer gearbox (to connect the engine to the existing F-16 gearbox), and an 18-inch (46 cm) stretch of the aft fuselage. First flight occurred on 29 October 1980. The total program cost to develop the F-16/J79 was $18 million (1980), and the unit flyaway cost was projected to be about $8 million. South Korea, Pakistan and other nations were offered these fighters but rejected them, resulting in numerous exceptions being made to sell standard F-16s; with the later relaxation of the policy under President Carter in 1980 and its cancellation under President Ronald Reagan, no copies of either the F-16/79 or the F-20 were ultimately sold.
F-16/101.
In February 1979, General Electric was awarded a $79.9 million (1979) contract under the joint USAF/Navy Derivative Fighter Engine (DFE) program to develop a variant of its F101 turbofan engine, originally designed for the B-1A bomber, for use on the F-16 (in lieu of the standard P&W F100) and the F-14A (in place of the P&W TF30). The first Full-Scale Development (FSD) F-16A (serial number 75-0745) was fitted with the F101X DFE engine and made its maiden flight on 19 December 1980. Although the F101 performed better than the F100, it was not adopted for use; however, data from testing the F-16/101 assisted in the development of the F110 turbofan, for which the F101 would serve as the core, and the F110 would become an alternate engine for both the F-16 and F-14.
Proposed and other variants.
Vought Model 1600/1601/1602.
The Vought/General Dynamics Model 1600 was a navalized derivative of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon designed for the United States Navy's Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program. The Model 1600 lost to the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.
F-16IN.
Lockheed Martin has proposed an advanced variant, the F-16IN, as its candidate for India's 126-aircraft Indian Air Force Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition. According to Chuck Artymovich, the company's business development director for the program, "The F-16IN is the most advanced F-16 ever." Notable F-16IN features include an AN/APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, advanced electronic warfare suites, and an infrared search and track (IRST) system. If selected as the winner of the competition, Lockheed Martin will supply the first 18 aircraft, and will set up an assembly line in India in collaboration with Indian partners for production of the remainder. The program is reportedly worth up to Rs. 55,000 crore (US$14 billion). The F-16IN Super Viper was showcased in the Aero India, 2009.
India initially sent the RFI for a F-16C/D Block 52+ configuration aircraft for the ongoing Indian MRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, to replace the Indian air force's fleet of MiG-21s. On 17 January 2008, Lockheed Martin offered a customized version of the F-16, the F-16IN Super Viper for the Indian MMRCA contract. The F-16IN, which is similar to the F-16 Block 60, will be a 4.5 generation aircraft.
Lockheed Martin has described the F-16IN as "the most advanced and capable F-16 ever." Based closely on the F-16E/F Block 60 as supplied to the UAE, the features on the F-16IN include Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs); AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, GE F110-132A engine with 32,000 pounds (143 kN) of thrust with FADEC controls; electronic warfare suite and infra-red searching (IRST); advanced all-color glass cockpit with three large displays; and a helmet-mounted cueing system. Lockheed Martin's vice-president-Business Development (India) Orville Prins has said that "I can assure you, the Super Viper is much more advanced in all aspects than the 50/52+ F-16s being given to Pakistan".
In September 2009, F-16IN Super Viper completed a part of the field trials. Lockheed Martin officials stated that phase I of field trials was over and the week-long training phase was in preparation for Phase II of field trials, which began 7 September and lasted two weeks.
Eventually the F-16IN Super Viper lost out to the French Dassault Rafale fighter. It was reported 21 September 2012 that the Indian air force would finalize a contract to purchase 126 French Rafale jet fighters that year, in one of 2012's largest armament purchases. The contract for the 126 Rafale twin-engine, canard delta-wing, multirole combat aircraft is worth $20 billion, Indo-Asian News Service reported.
F-16V.
On 15 Feb. 2012, Lockheed Martin unveiled a new version of their F-16 at the 2012 Singapore Airshow. The F-16V will feature enhancements including an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an upgraded mission computer and architecture, and improvements to the cockpit – all capabilities identified by the U.S. Air Force and several international customers for future improvements. The new variant is dubbed the “Viper,” which is intended to better operate with fifth-generation fighters, and should not be confused with Lockheed’s F-16IN “Super Viper,” which was offered to India for the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft competition and showcased at the 2009 Aero India Air Show. “The new F-16V will become the new F-16 baseline,” said George Standridge, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics’ vice president of business development. The “Viper” program does not include the F-16 Block 60 features.
KF-16.
Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) produced 140 KF-16C/D Block 52 fighters under license from Lockheed Martin in the 1990s. The F/A-18 Hornet had originally won the Korea Fighter Program (KFP) competition, but disputes over costs and accusations of bribery led the Korean government to withdraw the award and select the F-16 instead. Designated the KF-16 the first 12 aircraft were delivered to Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) in December 1994. Almost 2,500 parts are changed from the original F-16C/D. Originally, the KF-16 was equipped with the F100-PW-229 Improved Performance Engine, ASPJ internal ECM, APG-68(V)7 radar, LANTIRN targeting and navigation system, AMRAAM, HARM, and SLAM anti-ship missile capabilities, and advanced IFF. JDAMs capability was added by ROKAF later on; ROKAF developed the software, successfully carried out 3 tests, and finished pilot training at the end of January 2011. The South Korean JDAMs are equipped with wing kits, which are absent from normal JDAMs, but not from the 2,000 pound JDAM Extended Range kit, which is being developed by Boeing and South Korea. The South Korean F-16s can also employ LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K radar jammer and other locally developed tactical ELINT and EO/IR targeting pods.
In late 2011, Korea kicked off the contest for KF-16's mid-life upgrade, which will incorporate, among others, a new AESA radar. The radar candidates are Northrop Grumman's Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) and Raytheon's RANGR, which won the contract. The variant to which the planes will be improved is reported to be Lockheed Martin's newly developed F-16V. The KF-16 will also be integrated with stealth cruise missiles. The proposed budget for the avionics upgrades and weapons integration of 135 KF-16 planes is $1 billion. ROKAF had requested a separate upgrade of its 35 F-16 Block 32 in 2009, which would allow the upgraded planes to employ JDAM, AMRAAM, improved data modem, secure voice capabilities, test and support equipment, and other related training and logistics support. The estimated cost of the upgrade was $250 million. BAE won the contract for $1.1 billion.
GF-16.
Small numbers of each type of F-16A/B/C are used for non-flying ground instruction of maintenance personnel.
QF-16.
The USAF plans to convert Block 15, 25, and 30 F-16s into full-scale target drones under the QF-16 Air Superiority Target (AST) program. These AST drones are used in Weapon System Evaluation Programs (WSEP) for assessing upgrades or replacements for air-to-air missiles (AAM), and they are also useful for giving pilots the experience of a live AAM shot and kill prior to entering combat. QF-16s would replace the current QF-4 drones, the last of which are expected to be expended around 2015. The Air Force's Air Armament Center hosted its first "Industry Day" for interested vendors at Eglin AFB, Florida on 16–19 July 2007. The DoD awarded the nearly $70 million QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) contract to Boeing on March 8, 2010, with the first delivery scheduled for 2014.
On 22 April 2010, the first F-16 to be converted to an aerial target arrived at Boeing's facility at Cecil Field, Jacksonville, Florida. Six F-16s will be modified during the development phase, as prototypes for engineering tests and evaluation. From 2014, up to 126 QF-16 drones will be created. The prototype QF-16 undertook its maiden flight in May 2012. In January 2013, the 576th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Squadron refit team was due to begin modification work on the QF-16 program. Davis-Monthan has 210 F-16s stocked for conversion. From that pool, the Air Force will draw airframes for its 126 planned QF-16 drones. F-16C Block 30B s/n 85-1569 was the first aircraft delivered in November 2012.
On September 19, 2013, an empty F-16 jet tested by Boeing and US Air Force, two US Air Force pilots controlled the plane from the ground as it flew from Tyndall Air Force Base, Panama City, Florida. Boeing suggested that the innovation could ultimately be used to help train pilots, providing an adversary they could practice firing on. The jet - which had previously sat mothballed at an Arizona site for 15 years - flew at an altitude of 40,000 ft (12.2 km) and a speed of Mach 1.47 (1,119 mph/1,800 km/h). It carried out a series of maneuvers including a barrel roll and a "split S" – a move in which the aircraft turns upside down before making a half loop so that it flies the right-way-up in the opposite direction. This can be used in combat to evade missile lock-ons. The firm added that the flight attained 7Gs of acceleration but was capable of carrying out maneuvers at 9Gs – something that might cause physical problems for a pilot.
Major upgrade programs.
F-16 MSIP.
In 1980, General Dynamics, the USAF's F-16 System Program Office (SPO), and the EPG partners initiated a long-term Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) to evolve new capabilities for the F-16, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure its currency against a changing threat environment. The F-16 Falcon Century program, a survey and evaluation of new technologies and new capabilities that began in 1982, was also relied upon to identify new concepts for integration onto the F-16 through the MSIP derivative development effort. Altogether, the MSIP process permitted quicker introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs, and with reduced risks compared to traditional stand-alone system enhancement and modernization programs.
The first stage, MSIP I, began in February 1980 and it introduced the new technologies that defined the Block 15 aircraft. Fundamentally, MSIP I improvements were focused on reducing the cost of retrofitting future systems. These included structural and wiring provisions for a wide-field-of-view raster HUD; multi-function displays (MFD); advanced fire control computer and central weapons interface unit; integrated Communications/Navigation/Identification (CNI) system; beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles, electro-optical and target acquisition pods, and internal electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems; and increased-capacity environmental control and electrical power systems. Delivery of the first USAF MSIP I Block 15 aircraft occurred in November 1981, and work on the first EPG MSIP I aircraft began in May 1982.
MSIP II, begun in May 1981, led to the F-16C/D Block 25/30/32. For the Block 25, it basically added the systems which the MSIP I provisions had enabled. The first MSIP II F-16C Block 25 was delivered in July 1984. The Block 30/32 take advantage of the Alternative Fighter Engine program that offered a choice between two engines for the F-16: the General Electric F110-GE-100 (Block 30) as well as the newly upgraded Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 (Block 32). To take full advantage of the higher-thrust GE engine, a larger, modular air inlet duct was fitted on the Block 30s. MSIP II capabilities introduced on the Block 30/32 also included the ability to target multiple aircraft with the AMRAAM; range, resolution and signal processor improvements to the AN/APG-68 radar; a ring laser gyroscope; ALQ-213 electronic warfare system; added cooling air capacity for the more powerful avionics suite; and employment of the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles. The first Block 30 was delivered in July 1986.
MSIP III produced the Block 40/42/50/52. Initiated in June 1985, the first MSIP III Block 40 was delivered in December 1988, and the first Block 50 followed in October 1991. Introduced in the MSIP III Block 40/42 were LANTIRN navigation and targeting pods, along with the related diffractive optics HUD; the increased-reliability APG-68V fire-control radar; an aft-seat HUD monitor in the F-16D; a four-channel digital flight-control system; GPS; advanced EW and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment; and further structural strengthening to counter the aircraft's growing weight. The Block 50/52 received uprated F100-GE-129 and F110-PW-229 engines; an upgraded programmable display generator with digital terrain mapping; an improved APG-68V5 fire-control radar; an automatic target hand-off system; an anti-jam radio; the ALE-47 chaff dispenser; and integration of AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles.
Although only three stages had been originally planned, GD proposed an MSIP IV segment (marketed as 'Agile Falcon'), but this was rejected by the Air Force in 1989. However, most of its elements – such as extensive avionics upgrades, color displays, an electronic warfare management system (EWMS), reconnaissance pods, AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared air-to-air missile integration, and helmet-mounted sights – have been introduced since that time.
Pacer Loft I & II.
F-16A/B Blocks 1 and 5 were upgraded to the Block 10 standard under a two-phase program: Pacer Loft I (1982–1983) and Pacer Loft II (1983–1984).
Falcon UP.
Although the F-16 was originally designed with an expected service life of 8000 flying hours, actual operational usage has proven to be more severe than expected and this has been exacerbated by its growing weight as more systems and structure have been added to the aircraft. As a result, the anticipated average service life of the F-16A/B had fallen to only 5500 flying hours. Beginning in the early 1990s, the Falcon UP program restored the 8000-hour capability for the USAF's Block 40/42 aircraft. Pleased with the results, the USAF extended the Falcon UP effort to provide a Service Life Improvement Program (SLIP) for its Block 25 and 30/32 aircraft to ensure 6000 flying hours, and a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for its F-16A/B aircraft to assure their achieving 8000 hours.
Falcon STAR.
Falcon STAR (STructural Augmentation Roadmap) is a program to repair and replace critical airframe components on all F-16A/B/C/D aircraft; like Falcon UP, it is intended to ensure an 8000-hour service life, but it is based on more recent operational usage statistics. The first redelivery occurred in February 2004, and in 2007 the USAF announced that it would upgrade 651 Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s; this is expected to extend the Falcon STAR program, which began in 1999, through 2014.
F-16 ACE.
Israel Aircraft Industries developed an open-architecture avionics suite upgrade for its F-16s known as the Avionics Capabilities Enhancement (ACE). It introduced the first "full-glass cockpit" on an operational F-16, and featured an advanced fire-control radar, an Up Front Control Panel (UFCP), and an option for a wide-angle HUD or a helmet-mounted display. First flight of an F-16B equipped with ACE was accomplished in May 2001. The ACE upgrade was not taken up by the Israeli Air Force, which ordered a second batch of the F-16I instead; IAI offered ACE to Venezuela, but the U.S. government blocked it and stated that it would only permit elements of ACE, not the whole suite, to be exported.
F-16 Falcon ONE.
Singapore Technologies Aerospace (ST Aero) has also developed a state-of-the-art, "glass cockpit" avionics suite as an alternative to the MLU offering. The Falcon ONE suite includes a wide-angle HUD that can display FLIR imagery, the Striker Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD), a datalink capability, and the FIAR "Grifo" radar. First revealed at the Farnborough Air Show on 25 July 2000, it has yet to find a customer.
F-16 CCIP.
The Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) is a $2 billion modernization effort that seeks to standardize all USAF Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s to a common Block 50/52-based avionics software and hardware configuration for simplified training and maintenance. Lockheed Martin received a contract to develop the first phase CCIP configuration upgrade packages in June 1998; kit production work started in 2000, and deliveries began in July 2001. In 2007, Korean Air was awarded a USAF contract for F-16 upgrades, which included both CCIP, Falcon-STAR, and Drop In Maintenance works. 100 USAF F-16s were to be upgraded and maintained by Korean Air under the contract. The upgrade program would extend the F-16's flying hours from 6,000 to 8,000 hours. The work would continue for six years until 2013.
Phase 1 of the CCIP added new Modular Mission Computers, color cockpit display kits and advanced IFF systems to domestically based Block 50/52 aircraft, and introduced the new Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). The ability of the F-16CJ/DJ to employ GPS-guided weapons was extended to the rest of the Block 50/52 fleet. Upgraded Phase 1 aircraft redeliveries began in January 2002. The second phase extended these upgrades to overseas-based Block 50/52 Falcons, and redeliveries ran from July 2003 to June 2007. Phase II also included the introduction of autonomous beyond-visual-range air-intercept capability, the Link-16 datalink, and the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS).
The ongoing Phase 3 effort is focused on Block 40/42 F-16s. Development began in July 2003 and by June 2007 Lockheed Martin had completed roughly a quarter of the USAF's Block 40/42 fleet. Phase 3 incorporates the M3+ Operational Flight Program (OFP) which extends the capabilities of the first two phases to the Block 40/42 fleet and adds Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), the new NATO-standard datalink network. Development of an M4+ OFP began in late 2002; this update will allow use of the on Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft. Northrop Grumman was awarded a contract in early 2004 to develop an M5+ upgrade kit to update the AN/APG-68(V)5 radars on the Block 40/42/50/52 Falcons to the AN/APG-68(V)9 standard; upgrading of Block 40/42 aircraft began in 2007 and is to become operational on the Block 50/52 aircraft by 2010. An M6+ OFP is under consideration, and could include integration of the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) on CCIP aircraft, which is planned to begin in fiscal year 2012.
Turkey became the first international customer for the CCIP update with the signing of a $1.1 billion contract on 26 April 2005 to upgrade an initial 80 Block 40/50 and 37 Block 30 F-16C/Ds to an equivalent of the Phase 3/M5+ OFP standard under the "Peace Onyx III" Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. This work will be performed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and is due to be completed in 2012; however, Turkey holds on option on the upgrade of the remainder of its 100 Block 40s, which could extend the program.
CUPID.
The Combat Upgrade Plan Integration Details (CUPID) effort is an ongoing initiative to bring older U.S. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command Block 25/30/32 F-16s closer to Block 50/52 specifications. CUPID focuses on adding improved precision attack capabilities, night vision equipment, datalinks, carriage of the Litening II infrared targeting pod, and laser- and GPS-guided weapons.
Derivative fighters.
The performance and flexibility of the F-16 has been an important and visible influence on aircraft development programs of three nations seeking to advance the design and manufacturing skills of their indigenous aerospace industries. These programs have partnered with Lockheed Martin to develop airframes, that while not officially designated F-16s, share design elements and a development path with the F-16.
AIDC F-CK-1A/B "Ching Kuo" Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF).
Due to U.S. refusal to supply the Republic of China (Taiwan) with either the F-16/79 or F-20, the Republic of China government tasked its Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) to develop an indigenous fighter. Preliminary design studies began in 1980, and the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) program was launched two years later. Since Taiwanese industry had not developed a sophisticated fighter before, AIDC sought design and development assistance from General Dynamics and other major American aerospace companies. With such assistance, a design was finalized in 1985. The IDF design is by no means a copy of the F-16, but it was clearly influenced by the F-16, such as the layout of control surfaces, yet it also features design elements from the F-5, like its twin-engine configuration. In December 1988 the IDF aircraft was designated F-CK-1 and named after the late President Chiang Ching-Kuo. The first of four prototypes (3 single-seat and 1 twin-seat) flew on 28 May 1989. A total of 130 "Ching Kuo" fighters (102 F-CK-1A single-seaters and 28 F-CK-1B two-seaters) were delivered from 1994–2000.
Mitsubishi F-2A/B (FS-X/TFS-X).
In 1982, Japan's Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI) initiated studies of options for an indigenous fighter design to replace the Mitsubishi F-1 strike fighter. This initiative would later be designated FS-X (Fighter Support Experimental). (The two-seat trainer version was originally designated 'TFS-X'.) Determining that an entirely indigenous development effort would be cost-prohibitive, the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) sought an off-the-shelf fighter for its FS-X requirement, but none proved entirely acceptable. As a result, the JDA sought a co-development program based on a variant of an existing fighter type, and on 21 October 1987 announced its selection of a modified version of the F-16C/D based on General Dynamics' "Agile Falcon" concept. The FS-X is larger and heavier than the F-16, has a greater wing area, and is mainly fitted with Japanese-developed avionics and equipment. The program was launched a year later and the first of four XF-2A/B prototypes flew on 7 October 1995. The Japanese Cabinet authorized production on 15 December 1995, with the designation F-2A/B being allocated to the single- and two-seat models, respectively. First flight of an F-2A occurred on 12 October 1999, and production aircraft deliveries began on 25 September 2000. Originally, 141 F-2A/B (83 F-2A and 58 F-2B) were planned, but only 130 (83/47 F-2A/B) were approved in 1995; due to high costs, in December 2004, the total was capped at 98 aircraft, and in early 2007 this was reduced to 94.
KAI FA-50 Golden Eagle (KTX-2).
Building on its licensed manufacture of KF-16s, in 1992 Samsung Aerospace began work on designing a tandem-seat, supersonic, combat-capable jet trainer to replace the BAE Hawk 67, Northrop T-38 Talon, A-37 Dragonfly, and eventually F-4 Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). Samsung worked closely with Lockheed and the basic KTX-2 design had been laid out by 1995. At this point the aerospace units of Samsung, Daewoo and Hyundai were combined to form Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to ensure sufficient industrial "critical mass" existed to successfully develop the KTX-2. The T-50 resembles an 80%-scale F-16, but has a number of differences, not least being the fact that it has an engine air intake under each wing root, instead of a single under-belly intake, as well as a leading-edge extension more similar to that on the F/A-18 Hornet. The South Korean government gave its approval on 3 July 1997, and full-scale development work got underway in October. In February 2000, the KTX-2 was designated the T-50 Golden Eagle, and the first of two T-50 flight-test prototypes flew on 20 August 2002; the maiden flight of the first of two T-50 Lead-In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) prototypes – designated 'A-50' by the ROKAF and capable of combat – followed on 29 August 2003. The RoKAF plans to acquire T-50 advanced trainers, T-50B aerobatic demonstrators, TA-50 LIFT/light attack aircraft, and FA-50 multirole fighters. Its first production contract, for 25 T-50s, was placed in December 2003 and the first pair of T-50 aircraft was delivered 29 December 2005, with the type entering operational service in April 2007. In December 2006, the ROKAF placed a second production contract for T-50, T-50B, and TA-50 variants. The development of the FA-50 to replace the remaining old fighters is ongoing .

Pacita Abad

Pacita Abad (September 5, 1946 – December 7, 2004) was born in Basco, Batanes, a small island in the northernmost part of the Philippines, between Luzon and Taiwan. Her more-than-thirty-year painting career began when she traveled to the United States to undertake graduate studies. She had over 40 solo exhibitions at museums and galleries in the U.S., Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. She also participated in more than 50 group and traveling exhibitions throughout the world. Abad's work is now in public, corporate and private art collections in over 70 countries.
Biography.
Abad earned a BA in political science at the University of the Philippines in 1967. In 1970, she went the United States intending to study law, but instead earned a degree (MA) in Asian History at Lone Mountain College (University of San Francisco) in 1972. While in California, she married a Stanford MBA student, Jack Garrity, who became an international development economist. Abad studied painting at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C. and The Art Students League in New York City. She lived on 5 different continents and worked in more than 80 countries, including Guatemala, Mexico, India, Afghanistan, Yemen, Sudan, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia and Indonesia.
Works.
Her early paintings were primarily figurative socio-political works of people and primitive masks. Another series was large scale paintings of underwater scenes, tropical flowers and animal wildlife. Pacita's most extensive body of work, however, is her vibrant, colorful abstract work - many very large scale canvases, but also a number of small collages - on a range of materials from canvas and paper to bark cloth, metal, ceramics and glass. Abad created over 4,000 artworks. She painted a 55-meter long Alkaff Bridge in Singapore and covered it with 2,350 multicolored circles. During the last five years of her life, she lived and worked in a studio house on 28 Temenggong Road in Singapore, which currently houses the Visual Arts @ Temenggong.
Abad developed a technique of trapunto painting (named after a quilting technique), which entailed stitching and stuffing her painted canvases to give them a three-dimensional, sculptural effect. She then began incorporating into the surface of her paintings materials such as traditional cloth, mirrors, beads, shells, plastic buttons and other objects.
Legacy.
The Fundacion Pacita Batanes Nature Lodge in Basco, Batanes, "was lovingly refurbished by her brother", Butch Abad.
Quote.
"I always see the world through color, although my vision, perspective and paintings are constantly influenced by new ideas and changing environments. I feel like I am an ambassador of colors, always projecting a positive mood that helps make the world smile."

Fleetwood Area School District

Fleetwood Area School District is a public school district located in north central Berks County in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. The district serves students in the community of Fleetwood as well as Richmond Township (Walnuttown, Richmond, Moselm Springs, and Virginville) to the north and Maidencreek Township (Blandon, Maidencreek, Evansville, Molltown and Kirbyville) to the south. The district offers a wide variety of academic courses, music, the arts, sports programs and extra curricular activities. The district meets state requirements across their academic areas (Annual Yearly Progress).
District Overview.
The Fleetwood Area School District serves the children of Fleetwood Borough, Maidencreek Township, and Richmond Township. The district covers over thirty-nine square miles in northeastern Berks County. As of the close of school in June 2007, the district’s enrollment was 2,694 students in grades K-12. These students are served in five buildings, including three K–4 elementary schools, a 5–8 middle school, and a high school for grades 9–12. There is one elementary school located in each of the three district municipalities. Equity of services to students has been a priority for the district. For example, both full day and half day kindergarten options are available to parents in each of the three elementary schools. The district honors parental requests for either full or half day programs to the best of its ability. The tax base for the school district is primarily residential, with a few exceptions, including the factories of East Penn Manufacturing and Giorgio Food Company.
The school district has experienced significant growth in its student population over the past fifteen years. To accommodate additional students, the district built a new high school nine years ago that was followed by renovations and an addition to its middle school. Each of the three elementary schools were renovated with additions between fifteen and twenty years ago. As a result of ongoing growth in the elementary student population, the district presently has eight modular classrooms attached to two of its elementary schools. The elementary student body continues to grow and the district is currently planning a fourth elementary building with occupancy expected for the fall of 2009. In addition to the increasing numbers of students, the district has undergone a gradual shift from primarily a small town and agricultural community to one with an increasing number of students who speak English as a second language or display
learning challenges. As a result, the district has employed additional staff to address these needs including English Language Acquisition teachers and instructors to support students with identified special education needs. Overall, 1004 students in grades K-4 are served by 85 instructional staff. There is one principal assigned to each of the three elementary buildings. There are 65 instructional staff to support 813 middle school students and there are 71 instructional staff at the high school to serve 881 students. At both the middle and high school levels, a principal and an assistant are assigned. Central administration includes a superintendent and assistant superintendent who jointly oversee the operation of the school district. The superintendent directly supervises the business operation of the school district in conjunction with the business manager and her assistant. In addition, the superintendent also supervises the director of student services whose responsibilities include special education and pupil services staff and programs. The assistant superintendent is responsible for designing and
supervising curriculum implementation district-wide and, together with the superintendent, supervises the principals.
The district is one of eighteen public school districts that comprise the Berks County Intermediate Unit (#14). The intermediate unit hosts regular meetings for leaders of its member districts including superintendents, curriculum coordinators, human resource directors, and principals. These meetings facilitate sharing best practices, addressing problems, and planning professional development initiatives.
The district collaborates with local businesses and the Chamber of Commerce. Presently, the superintendent serves as a director on the Northeast Berks Chamber of Commerce board and on the Berks Business Education Coalition board. Both of these organizations support the training of students to provide the county with a viable workforce. There is ongoing communication between the school district and local employers as to their needs and expectations for new employees.
In addition, the district has many specialized classes assisting students to not only prepare themselves for college, but also to earn college credit. The district offers advance placement courses in English, World History, US History, Calculus, US Government & Macroeconomics, Chemistry, and Biology. In addition, the district has dual enrollment agreements with the Reading Area Community College for Calculus, US History, Biology, English, Accelerated Physics, and Spanish III & IV. The district also has an agreement with Lehigh Carbon Community College for Television Production.

Papal election, 1198

The papal election of January 8, 1198 was convoked after the death of Pope Celestine III; it ended with the election of Cardinal Lotario dei Conti di Segni, who took the name Innocent III. In this election for the first time the new pope was elected "per scrutinium".
Death of Celestine III.
Pope Celestine III had been elected to the papacy in 1191 at the age of 85. In spite of his very advanced age, his pontificate lasted almost seven years. On Christmas Day, 1197 the 91-year-old Pope expressed the wish to abdicate the papacy on condition that his close collaborator Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo would be elected the new pope. The cardinals rejected the suggestion as inconsistent with the rule that papal elections must be free ones. Shortly thereafter, on January 8, 1198, Celestine III died and the cardinals present at his deathbed immediately started proceedings for the election of his successor.
List of participants.
At the death of Celestine III there were 29 cardinals in the Sacred College. However, no more than 21 were present at Rome:
Four electors were created by Celestine III, five by Lucius III, one by Alexander III and the remaining thirteen by Clement III.
Absentees.
At least eight cardinals were absent:
Election of Pope Innocent III.
On the same day that Celestine III had died the cardinals assembled in Septizonium in the voluntary enclosure. For the first time the electors voted by scrutiny ("per scrutinium"). Some cardinals were elected scrutineers; they counted the votes, recorded the result and announced it to the rest of the Sacred College. In the first scrutiny Cardinal Giovanni di Salerno received the greatest number of votes (ten), but declared that he would not accept the election to the pontificate. In the second scrutiny the cardinals united their votes in favor of 37-year old Cardinal Lotario dei Conti di Segni, deacon of SS. Sergio e Bacco, who was the youngest of all the cardinals. He accepted his election and took the name Innocent III. 
On February 22, 1198 the new pope was ordained to the priesthood and consecrated to the episcopate by Cardinal Ottaviano di Paoli, bishop of Ostia e Velletri, and solemnly crowned by Cardinal Graziano da Pisa, protodeacon of SS. Cosma e Damiano.

Back of the Van

"Back of the Van" is a song by singer-songwriter Ladyhawke. It was her first single, and was from her debut album "Ladyhawke". It was released on 1 April 2008 as a download only single from her website and MySpace. The track was re-released on 18 May 2009 as a limited edition single. The song was written by Ladyhawke and Michael Di Francesco.
Reviews.
Femalefirst gave the song a positive review and has given it a 4 out of 5 star rating using the public vote. They wrote: "The result is a refreshing blend of rock, dance and pop. As well as writing 'Back of the Van', Pip also plays the drums, guitar and synth on the track".
The BBC wrote this about the song while reviewing her debut album: "while the utterly uplifting 'Back of the Van' is a tribute to just saying how you feel. As Ladyhawke reaches nervously for her new lover's hand it's impossible not to join in her sweet, unvarnished declaration, "You set me on fire"".
Exclaim wrote: "Brown unites her retro influences (classic rock, '80s dance, '00s rehashing of everything in the past) to mould her own unique lovechild. 'Back of the Van' is one of the catchiest songs I've heard so far in 2008, evoking the spirit of Fleetwood Mac and spinning disco much better than that half-assed remix of "Dreams" by Deep Dish".
Music video.
The video starts by looking up into space and then goes down to see Ladyhawke playing her guitar. Then everything goes blue but Ladyhawke continues to play her guitar. Then things start to move and you see an eye while Ladyhawke keeps turning back to look at something. She continues to play her guitar while the people moving are now clearly dancing around. There is what appears to be fire but turns out to be her outline. While she sings you start to see more than one of her; also a light starts to shine on her. You see shadows dancing while lights shine onto them. While Ladyhawke sings you see other people run across the screen. The video ends with Ladyhawke singing and fades into the darkness.

Neil McLennan, an early Scottish-American settler of Texas, was born on the Isle of Skye in Scotland on September 2, 1777, 1778 or 1787, and died in Texas in 1867. McLennan County, Texas was named for him.
In 1801, McLennan and a large group of family and friends emigrated to Richmond County, North Carolina, later moving further south to Florida. The McLennans were Gaelic speakers and Presbyterians. Around 1820, they were invited by Yuchi Chief Sam Story to become the first white settlers in Walton County, Florida. In December, 1834, Neil and his brothers Laughlin and John, along with some of their families and friends, emigrated to Texas, sailing a self-built three-masted schooner from Pensacola, Florida, to the mouth of the Brazos River, where they arrived in March, 1835.
After a short stay at present-day Columbus, Texas, Neil obtained a grant of a league of land at McLennan's Bluff (a mile west of present-day Rosebud, Falls County) in Robertson's Colony in July, 1835, where he and his group settled. Laughlin McLennan and his wife and mother were killed in an Indian raid the following winter, and John was likewise killed in 1838, after which the McLennan group moved to the Robertson Colony's headquarters of Nashville-on-the-Brazos in present-day Milam County.
In 1845, Neil McLennan moved his family to a site on the Bosque River near present-day Waco, and he died at his home there in 1867, renowned as "the patriarch of the Bosque."

Pincher Creek (provincial electoral district)

Pincher Creek is a former provincial electoral district that existed from 1905 to 1940.
Election results.
1905 general election.
The Pincher Creek electoral district was created in 1905 when Alberta became a province independent of the Northwest Territories. The district in its original boundaries occupied the southwestern region of the province when it was first created. The first general election held in the Pincher Creek electoral district turned into a hotly contested four way race. Large portions of the population worked as coal miners in the mountains while the foothills provided prime land for cattle ranching.
The provincial Liberal candidate in the election was local rancher John Marcellus. The provincial Conservatives ran John Kemmis. The third party candidate in the race was Frank Sherman who stood as a Labor candidate representing the United Mine Workers Union. Rounding out the field was Independent candidate Charles Kettles. Kettles was well known for founding the Pincher Creek townsite in 1882 when he worked for the North-West Mounted Police and served as a Department of Indian Affairs employee. He also ran a grocery store C. Kettles & Co. He dropped out of the race in time to have his name stricken off the ballot.
On election night the race between Marcellus and Sherman seesawed back and forth. At one time during the night Marcellus had conceded his defeat as Sherman pulled ahead in first place. However the election turned as the final polls brought in favorable results for Marcellus leading him to a close victory. Kemmis ran a close third through the evening.

Marguerite of Lorraine

Marguerite of Lorraine (22 July 1615 – 13 April 1672) was a princess of Lorraine by birth and duchess of Orléans by virtue of her marriage Gaston of France, younger brother of King Louis XIII. After their re-marriage, Marguerite and Gaston had five children. She was the stepmother of "La Grande Mademoiselle".
Life.
She was born in Nancy, Lorraine to Francis II, Duke of Lorraine, and Countess Christina of Salm. One of six children, she grew up in Nancy which was the capital of her father's duchy. After losing her mother in 1627, she was brought up by her aunt Catherine of Lorraine—the Abbess of Remiremont. Two of her older brothers, Charles and Nicolas, were successively dukes of Lorraine.
Marriage.
While taking refuge from the wrath of the French prime minister, Cardinal Richelieu, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, younger brother and heir presumptive of Louis XIII of France, fell in love at first sight with Marguerite. But as France and Lorraine were then enemies, he was refused the king's permission to marry with a sister of its duke, Charles III. Nonetheless Gaston fled again to Lorraine and, in a secret ceremony in the presence of her family at Nancy during the night of 2–3 January 1632, Gaston took the princess Marguerite as his wife. Because he had not obtained the prior permission of his elder brother—one of his many acts of defiance—the couple could not appear at the French court and the marriage was kept secret.
But in November of that year the Duke of Montmorency, on his way to the scaffold, betrayed his former co-conspirator, "Monsieur" Gaston, to the king and Richelieu, revealing to them the elopement. The king had his brother's marriage declared null and void by the Parlement of Paris in September 1634 and, despite the Pope's protest, the Assembly of the French clergy affirmed the nullification in September 1635 on the grounds that a "prince du sang", especially one who is heir to the throne, could only enter matrimony with permission of the king—consistent with French sovereignty and custom. Although Marguerite and Gaston had re-celebrated their marriage before the Archbishop of Malines, a French emissary persuaded the Pope not to publicly protest the matter, and Gaston formally accepted the nullity of his marriage. It was not until Louis XIII was on his death bed in May 1643 that he accepted his brother's plea for forgiveness and authorized his marriage to Marguerite, whereupon the couple undertook nuptials for the third time in July 1643 before the Archbishop of Paris at Meudon, and the Duke and Duchess of Orléans were finally received at court and began producing lawful progeny.
By right of her marriage, Marguerite became known as "Madame" at court. After the death of his mother in 1642, Gaston was bequeathed the Luxembourg Palace, which became the couple's Parisian residence under the name "Palais d'Orléans" once they were restored to royal favour. They also sojourned at the Château de Blois, in the Loire Valley, where their first child was born in 1645.
Widowhood.
Marguerite's husband, who had played a major part in the Fronde against his nephew the young king Louis XIV (as had her stepdaughter Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, "La Grande Mademoiselle"), was exiled to his castle at Blois where he died in 1660. Some time after her husband's death, Louis XIV gave the dukedom of Orléans to his brother (and Gaston's nephew), Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, who became the new "Monsieur". As "Dowager Duchess of Orléans", Marguerite continued to reside in the "Palais d'Orléans" where she died on 13 April 1672. She was buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis.

The 1992 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships ("1992 WJHC") was the 16th edition of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and was held from December 26, 1991 until January 4, 1992. It was held in Füssen and Kaufbeuren, Germany. The Commonwealth of Independent States won gold, while Sweden won silver, and the United States took home the bronze medal.
Final standings.
The 1992 tournament was a round-robin format, with the top three teams winning gold, silver and bronze medals respectively.
The day the tournament began, the Soviet Union formally dissolved. In the week that followed the team continued to play as the Soviet Union, but on January 1, 1992, the team was renamed the Commonwealth of Independent States. The team had no new flag to fly at the tournament, and continued to use their Soviet jerseys through to its conclusion. 
"Switzerland was relegated to Pool B for 1993."
Pool B.
Eight teams contested the second tier this year in Tychy and Oswiecim Poland from December 27 to January 5. It was played in a simple round robin format, each team playing seven games. This tournament offered a rather improbable result; four of the eight teams finished tied for first. In head-to-head results, Japan and Poland had 4 points each, Norway and France 2 each, so Japan's victory over Poland on the final day gave them the tournament victory.
"Japan was promoted to Pool A and North Korea was relegated to Pool C for 1993."
Pool C.
Pool C was contested by nine teams from December 28, to January 4, in Marino and Rome Italy. In the first round the nine teams were divided into three groups of three. The second round pitted the three first place teams against each other, likewise for the second place teams. Greece was disqualified for using an ineligible player, so they did not participate in the final round.
Final Round.

Boathouse on the Lullwater of the Lake in Prospect Park

Boathouse on the Lullwater of the Lake in Prospect Park is located in the eastern part of Prospect Park on the northeast shore of The Lake, southeast of the Ravine District in Brooklyn, New York. It was built in 1905-07 to a classical design of Helmle, Hudswell and Huberty, protégés of McKim, Mead and White. 
In September 1964 the Parks Department was within forty-eight hours of demolishing the Boathouse. At the time the structure was underutilized; the boat concession only operated on weekends and the Boathouse was visited by fewer than ten people an hour, even on the busiest summer weekends.
The Boathouse shared many features with the McKim, Mead and White masterpiece Penn Station, whose recent demolition had been controversial. The resulting historic preservation movement generated public pressure to save the Boathouse. Though saved, nearly ten years would elapse before restorations would begin on the structure under Commissioner August Heckscher. Further restorations were required in the 1980s under Commissioner Gordon Davis to repair damage from a leaking roof. After twenty years as a visitors center and park ranger headquarters, the Boathouse was restored for a third time in 2000. It now houses the Audubon Center, the Audubon Society's only urban interpretive center in the United States.
The Boathouse's fortunes over the last third of the 20th century parallel the larger, and still ongoing, recovery of the park. In the 1980s, the Parks Department began forming partnerships with privately funded, non-profit organizations to help relieve shortfalls in park management. 
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
The Boathouse was seen in Scorsese's movie: "The Age Of Innocence" (1993) as the Boston park where Archer Newland(Day-Lewis) meets Ellen Olenska(Pfeiffer)

<doc id="18895641" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18895641" title="Name of Afghanistan">
Name of Afghanistan

The name of Afghanistan is believed to be as old as the ethnonym "Afghan", which is documented in a 10th-century geography book called "Hudud ul-'alam". The root name "Afghan" has been used historically in reference to the Pashtun people and the ending suffix ""-stan"" means "place of". Therefore, Afghanistan translates to the ""place of Afghans"" or ""land of the Afghans"".
Afghanization.
Afghanization (Pashtunization) has been going on in the Afghanistan-Indian subcontinent since at least the 8th century. It is a process of a cultural or linguistic change in which something non-Afghan becomes Afghan.
Afghan dynasties.
According to "Ta'rikh-i Yamini" (author being secretary of Mahmud of Ghazni), Afghans enrolled in Sabuktigin's Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th century as well as in the later Ghurid Kingdom (1148–1215). From the beginning of the Khilji dynasty in 1290, Afghans are becoming more recognized in history among the Delhi Sultanate of India. The famous Moroccan travelling scholar, Ibn Battuta, visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: "We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans. They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength, and are mostly highwaymen." The later Lodi dynasty and Sur dynasty of Delhi were both made up of Afghans.
Early references to Afghanistan.
The name ""Afghanistan"" is mentioned in writing by the 16th century Mughal rulers Babur and his descendants, referring to the territory between Khorasan, Kabulistan, and the Indus River which was inhabited by tribes of Afghans. 
The name "Afghanistan" is also mentioned many times in the writings of the 16th century historian, Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah (Ferishta), and many others.
Last Afghan empire.
Regarding the modern state of Afghanistan, Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Iranica, and many others explain that the political history of Afghanistan begins in 1709 with the rise of the Hotaki dynasty, which was established by Mir Wais Hotak who is regarded as "Mirwais Neeka" ("Mirwais the grandfather").
The Encyclopaedia of Islam states:
Afghanistan's first diplomatic foreign relations were established in 1801 with Great Britain and Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar, ruler of the Qajar dynasty of neighboring Persia. According to one historian or book writer, "the name Afghanistan is mentioned since 1801 in the Anglo-Persian peace treaty for the first time officially."

Murder of Michael Causer

Michael Causer (9 October 1989 - 2 August 2008) was a gay teenager living in Liverpool, England, who came to national attention in the United Kingdom when he was seriously assaulted because of his sexual orientation in the early hours on the morning of 25 July 2008 after a small house party.
He later died in the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery after undergoing extensive emergency surgery to his brain. He was 18 years old at the time of his death.
Michael's funeral was held on 2 October 2008 in a local church in Whiston where he lived.
Two teenage men, James O'Connor and Gavin Alker, were charged with the murder. A third man, Michael Binsteed, 19, tried to cover up the attack by helping dump Causer's body in the street and lied to police claiming he had been the victim of an attack by others. He pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Christopher Douglas was charged with witness intimidation in relation to the case.
According to evidence put before the jury, the trigger-point for the violence came when Causer's attackers found sexually explicit images of him on his mobile phone as he slept upstairs in a house where a party had been held. This prompted a sustained and brutal attack as he slept leaving him with a fractured skull and a swollen brain.
It was alleged that Alker, who had never met Causer, screamed, "You little queer faggot" and "He’s a little queer, he deserves it". During the trial, it was also claimed that Alker used a cigarette lighter to burn the hair on Mr Causer’s legs, and that threats were made to rip out his body piercings with a knife.
Alker pleaded not guilty, claiming he had acted in self-defence, and blaming the attack on O'Connor. Alker was acquitted of murder and manslaughter. James O'Connor was convicted and sentenced to serve life with a minimum of 11 and a half years before he can be considered for parole after pleading guilty to murder. Michael Binsteed was convicted and sentenced to 34 weeks in custody, suspended for two years.
A memorial fund was established, initially to support Michael's family with funeral and legal expenses. Due to the generosity of the response to this fund, it developed into the Michael Causer Foundation, whose aim is to provide supported accommodation for vulnerable LGBT young people in the north West of England. It became a UK registered charity in July 2011.

<doc id="18895691" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18895691" title="Vippetangen">
Vippetangen

Vippetangen is the southern point of the peninsula Akersneset in central Oslo, Norway, located southeast of Akershus Fortress. It is surrounded by the Oslo Fjord and has served as an important section of the port in Oslo. The area is undergoing urban renewal and will become part of the Fjord City.
The name.
The first element is "vippe" (a short form for "vippefyr"), the last element is the finite form of "tange" m 'pointy headland'. The name derives from a simpel lighthouse that formerly was located there.
History.
The place has been a military facility, stone quarry, as well as military and civilian bath. In the 1880s and 90s there was ice skating on the fjord, including the first national championships. The modern construction of docks started in 1899, and on 25 November 1905 was the landing place for King Haakon VII and his family when they arrived from Denmark on the Norwegian warship "Heimdal" to assume the Norwegian throne. The port facilities included fishing facilities and docks for the international passenger ships, as well as a grain silo. Until the 1960 grain was transport by tram via the Vippetangen Line to Nedre Foss Mill at Grünerløkka. The tram line had been built to Vippetangen by Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie in 1900, and the tram line remained in service until 1961. The area also saw the railway Oslo Port Line run through it.
Fjord City development.
Vippetangen has always been an important transport hub, and still remains the main port for passenger ferries in Oslo. This includes the Copenhagen ferry route operated by Stena Line and DFDS, and the water bus routes operated by Ruter to the Oslo Islands—these will remain after the development of the Fjord City as one of two ferry terminals in Oslo. As part of the Fjord City project Ruter is planning to build a new tram line to Vippetangen, following the peninsula around from Aker Brygge to Bjørvika.

Fireworks (30 Rock)

"Fireworks" is the eighteenth episode of NBC's first season of "30 Rock". It was written by two of the season's co-executive producers Brett Baer and Dave Finkel, and it was directed by Beth McCarthy. It first aired on April 5, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Will Arnett, Kay Cannon, Matt Dickinson, Dave Finkel, Evan Harrington, Chris Parnell, Maulik Pancholy, Maury Povich, Keith Powell, Stu Richel, Al Roker, Mahadeo Shivraj, Kissy Simmons, Jason Sudeikis and Brendon Walsh.
In this episode, Jack Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin) stages a televised firework display, in an attempt to show up his rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett). Devon, upon their first meeting, develops a crush on Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) follows Floyd (Jason Sudeikis), a colleague whom she is attracted to, into Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in an attempt to get closer to him. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) discovers that he is related to Thomas Jefferson and decides to honor his ancestor. James "Toofer" Spurlock (Keith Powell) discovers a shocking secret about one of his own ancestors.
Plot.
When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations visits from Los Angeles, Jack fears that he is trying to take his job. After having his assistant Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.
Meanwhile, Liz sees Floyd, the corporate employee who she has a crush on, go into a church on a Tuesday afternoon. The next week, she follows him in and finds that he is attending an AA meeting. Liz pretends to be an alcoholic so that she can get closer to Floyd and hear his secrets. After finding out that members of the same AA group are not allowed to date, Liz confesses to Floyd that she was never an alcoholic and that she made it up to get close to him. He gets mad and feels betrayed, so she apologizes and tells him all of her secrets to make it up to him. Floyd forgives her and they begin dating.
When it comes time for Jack's important meeting with the network and showdown against Devon Banks, Liz is too busy pursuing Floyd to help Jack with his idea. Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but his idea for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.
Tracy is served with paternity papers and insists that the child is not his. After the DNA test, Tracy learns that the child is not his but that he is a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson. The news angers Tracy and he talks to Toofer and Frank about it. Toofer learns that he is a direct descendant of Tobias Spurlock, a black Confederate soldier. Tracy and Toofer are upset about the news until Tracy has a dream in which Thomas Jefferson (portrayed by Jack Donaghy) appears to him on "The Maury Povich Show". In the dream, Jefferson takes credit for "inventing" America and tells Tracy to forget his past. Tracy decides that he wants Toofer to write a movie about their experiences and Thomas Jefferson's life. Tracy intends to play all of the parts in the movie, except he intends for the film to be a drama.
Production.
This is Jack McBrayer and Will Arnett's third time working together. McBrayer "memorably" made guest appearances as a country club waiter in "Burning Love" and "S.O.B.s", two episodes of the situation comedy "Arrested Development". Arnett, a member of the main cast of "Arrested Development", played George Oscar "G.O.B." Bluth II in that series. The plot of the "Arrested Development" episode in which McBrayer appeared revolved around G.O.B. accidentally becoming a waiter at the Bluth family's country club.
This episode was, as NBC advertises these events, a "supersized" episode meaning that the total runtime of the episode was extended from 30 minutes to 40 minutes. It also resulted in the episode airing at 8:40 pm, after "The Negotiation" which is an episode of "The Office", as opposed to 9:00 pm which was the series' usual timeslot. 
The husband and wife characters who appear in the 10-second internet sitcom, "Makin' It Happen", are played by Dave Finkel and Kay Cannon. Finkel and Cannon are both staff writers on "30 Rock". Cannon was, at the time, also married to guest star Jason Sudeikis and Finkel co-wrote this episode. A series of "Makin' It Happen" was produced and the webisodes aired on NBC.com.
"Star Wars" is frequently referenced in "30 Rock", beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of "Star Wars", saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the "Star Wars" character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of "Star Wars" herself, said that the weekly "Star Wars" joke or reference "started happening organically" when the crew realized that they had a "Star Wars" reference "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on "it became a thing where tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as "the resident expert". In this episode, "Star Wars" is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own "Star Wars" and "Tootsie" so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his hand up to Tracy and says "May the Force be with you always".
Reception.
"Fireworks" brought in an average of 5.4 million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, achieving a 2.5/7 in the key 18–49 year old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all people of ages 18–49 years old, and the 7 refers to 7% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast. Compared to the previous episode, "The Fighting Irish", which aired on March 8, 2007, "Fireworks" gained 200,000 viewers.
Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" thought that Will Arnett, who appeared as Devon Banks, was "shrewdly cast". Webb Mitovich added that this episode displayed some "good, good stuff". Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad declared "Fireworks" as "one of the best episodes so far this season" citing that "the writers juggled a handful of storylines very, very well". She wrote that the best part of the episodes were "the one-liners. They had laughing so hard that [she frequently had to pause the TiVo to recover." Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode "was another prime example of what this show is capable of". He thought that "the choice of Arnett as Jack Donaghy's nemesis was perfect, right down to their shared graveled vocal delivery", and that recurring character Chris Parnell's "short, quick hitting scenes are always nonsensical perfection".

<doc id="18895838" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18895838" title="Name of the Philippines">
Name of the Philippines

The name of the Philippines (Filipino/Tagalog: "Pilipinas" , Spanish: "Filipinas") is a truncated form of The Philippine Islands, derived from the King Philip II of Spain in the 16th century. During his expedition to the Islands, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos used the name "Las Islas Filipinas" in honour of the then-Prince of Asturias, originally referring to the islands of Leyte and Samar. Despite the presence of other names, the name "Filipinas" ("Philippines") was eventually adopted as the name of the entire archipelago.
The official name of the Philippines, however, has changed throughout the course of its history. During the Philippine Revolution, the state officially called itself "República Filipina", now referred to as the First Philippine Republic. From the period of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War until the Commonwealth, United States colonial authorities referred to the Philippines as the "Philippine Islands", a direct translation of the original Spanish. It was during the American Period that the name "Philippines" began to appear, a name that was officially adopted.
Name in other languages.
Given that it has two official languages, the country also possesses two official names as stated in the 1987 Constitution. In Filipino, it is officially called Republika ng Pilipinas, while it is named the Republic of the Philippines in English. When standing alone in English, the country's name is always preceded by the article ""the"". How ever, the definite article ""ang"" does not precede the name in Filipino contexts. The Commission on the Filipino Language and National Artist, Virgilio S. Almario urges the use of Filipinas as the country's official name to reflect its origin and history. 
Unlike Ireland which uses the name "Eire/Ireland" to identify itself in international meeting, the English name usually appears to identify the Philippines (e.g. when there are meetings in the United Nations or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in this setting. This is also the tradition even if the meeting is held within the country's boundary.
In many Philippine languages such as Tagalog, "Pilipinas" is used, while some other languages, including Ilocano, use "Filipinas".
Though the name "Philippines" is the official name that is used by the country's government for international and domestic businesses, numerous major languages of the world still use their own translation or transliteration of the name "Philippines" to refer to it.

Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade

The Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade is a community-made parade in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, England. Produced by local arts organisations Handmade Parade CIC and Thingumajig Theatre, the parade celebrates the creativity, variety and the uniqueness of Hebden Bridge and its surrounding areas. The parade happens in June each year. 
Origin.
The Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade was first proposed in 2007 by puppet and mask artist Andrew Kim who had worked as a lead in several community parades and festivals in the USA. The 2008 and 2009 Handmade Parades were co-produced by HEADS and Thingumajig Theatre. A new not-for-profit community interest company was set up in 2010 to organise the parade and the making and performance workshops beforehand. 
Workshops.
The art for the parade is created largely in open public workshops in the weeks leading up to the parade. These workshops, led by a team of professional parade artists and volunteers, provide ideas, skills and materials for children and adults to make their own parade costumes, banners, puppets and carryable parade art. This workshop structure is styled after In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre's MayDay Parade.
Guidelines.
To keep this parade a community-based, non-commercial handmade parade, the Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade has two rules: no written words or logos and no motorised vehicles. These rules are based on the rules for the Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant.
Future plans.
Although much depends on getting funding, Handmade Parade CIC is now planning to expand its work into other areas, helping other communities create their own events, or facilitating workshops and outreach sessions linked to existing events in other areas.

Fiftytwo Ridge

Fiftytwo Ridge is a mountain ridge in east-central British Columbia, Canada, located just southwest of Battle Mountain at the southeastern end of Wells Gray Provincial Park.
Geology.
Fiftytwo Ridge is a volcanic feature associated with the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. It is a subglacial volcano that formed in the Pleistocene period when this area was buried beneath glacial ice during the last ice age. The eruptions melted the ice, so the hot magma contacted with water and caused violent explosions. About 20 small craters can be found today. Some contain fine examples of pumice, an extraordinarily light-weight rock with numerous air-holes. When hiking here early in summer, some of the craters may be filled with runoff water (called maars) and are less obvious. 
Naming.
Fifty-Two Ridge has only been called that since 1952 when a biological study was conducted here by Ralph Ritcey and Pat Martin. As early as 1935, it was known as Bull Ridge and the valley between it and Battle Mountain was called Bull Valley. Clearwater Valley ranchers Lawrence and Charlie Ludtke often guided big-game hunters into these meadows, in search of the prized bull caribou.

Wattstown

Wattstown () is a village located in the Rhondda Valley in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. Located in the Rhondda Fach valley it is a district of the community of Ynyshir. Prior to mid 19th century industrialisation the area was once little more than a wooded area, sparsely populated by farmsteads. With the coming of the coal industry Wattstown became a busy, densely populated village, but with the closure of the collieries Wattstown suffered an economic downturn that still affects the village today. 
Wattstown is named after Edmund Hannay Watts, who at one time owned the National Colliery in Wattstown.
Early history and industrialisation.
The earliest evidence of human activity around what would become Wattstown is found on the hillside at Carn Y Wiwer, overlooking the village; a small grouping of Bronze Age cairns are present and in the same vicinity are the remains of five platform houses; rudimentary, Medieval seasonal farm houses. During the Napoleonic Wars the land around Carn Y Wiwer was cultiviated by farmers to produce additional crops. Prior to industrialisation, the area that would become Wattstown was known as Pont Rhyd Y Cwch or Pont-Y-Cwtch.
Compared to other areas in the Rhondda, Wattstown was slow to be developed as a mining area. The first deep mine, the National Colliery, originally known as Cwtch Colliery before being renamed the Standard, was sunk sometime in the late 1870s and first appeared on the Inspectors' Lists of Mines in 1880. The land on which the colliery was built, belonged to Crawshay Bailey and William Bailey, but the mine was owned by several different concerns, including the National Steam Coal Company and Watts & Company, who would give the village its name. Although Wattstown expanded to fulfill the working requirements of its colliery, it never expanded at the same rate as other areas. The village had its own church, dedicated to St. Thomas, built in 1896, schools, chapels and public houses, but its number of private residents was much lower than other similar settlements in the South Wales Valleys.
National Colliery 1887 disaster.
Wattstown would suffer two mining disasters at the National Colliery. The first was on 18 February 1887, when the village was still known as 'Cwtch'. The accident occurred in-between the day and night shifts, which probably saved many lives as 200 men were yet to make their descent into the mine. The explosion was so powerful it damaged the winding gear which delayed the rescue by several hours. Once the rescuers were able to descend they managed to bring to the surface 38 men, 29 of whom were uninjured. In total, the death toll counted thirty men and boys, with a total of 12 injured. Although an inquest jury could not come to a conclusion to the cause of the explosion, in his report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, F.A. Basanquet, placed the cause of the disaster as an explosive cap being fired in an area where there had been a buildup of flammable gas.
National Colliery 1905 disaster.
On the 11 July 1905, just four months after the Cambrian Colliery disaster at Clydach Vale, an explosion at the National Colliery in Wattstown resulted in the deaths of 120 men and boys. Only three people were rescued from the mine, but two would later die of their injuries, leaving Matthew Davies as the lone survivor. The report into the cause of the disaster was undertaken by the Inspector of Mines, which concluded that the explosion was caused by illegal use of blasting material underground. Shortly before the explosion occurred, the master sinker had requested blasting cable and a battery to charge the shot. The manager, Mr. Meredith had entered the mine a quarter of an hour before the explosion and was amongst the list of fatalities.
Amongst the messages of condolences received at Wattstown was a message from King Edward VII. On the day of the funeral, the streets were lined by thousands of mourners and the funeral cortège was reported as being over four miles (6 km) long.
Sport and leisure.
Wattstown is home to Wattstown RFC, a rugby union club with over a hundred years of history.

Robert Townsend (captain)

Captain Robert Townsend (October 21, 1819 – August 15, 1866) was a Civil War-era ship Captain in the United States Navy. He served twice, once before the war then again during the war. He saw active combat while serving aboard three ships, most notably as commander of the USS "Essex" from 1863–1864, an ironclad gunship on the Mississippi River. Captain Townsend died of heatstroke while commanding the USS "Wachusett" in China in 1866, and is buried in Albany, New York.
Ancestry.
Robert Townsend was born on October 21, 1819 in Albany, New York to Isaiah and Hannah Townsend. His father was an executive of the Stirling Iron Works which under his great-grandfather Peter Townsend forged The Great Chain which was strung across the Hudson River at West Point and prevented the British Royal Navy from threatening that important American base and potentially controlling the river. His grandfather was Captain Solomon Townsend who was a merchant ship captain before the American Revolution. Robert Townsend was descended from John and Henry Townsend, New York, among the first settlers of that area in the early 17th century.
Early life and pre-Civil War career.
Townsend received his primary education at The Albany Academy, and his secondary education at the Rev. Dr. Dewey's Boarding School in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. After graduating he attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, but left college before graduating in order to join the board of survey of the Utica and Schenectady Railroad Company.
Townsend entered the United States Navy on August 4, 1837, serving first as a midshipman on the ship . In 1838 he was ordered to the battleship , then in each subsequent year to the sloop , the steamship . In 1843 he was promoted to passed midshipman and served on the frigate , then a year later on the brig .
He served in the Mexican-American War from 1846–1847 where he was engaged in the capture of Vera Cruz. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1850, and resigned from the navy on April 7, 1851.
On June 19, 1850, Townsend married Harriet Munro, the daughter of Nathan Munro and Cynthia Champlin, of Elbridge, New York. The couple had three children; a son, Robert Townsend, Jr., born October 4, 1854, and daughters Mary Walker Townsend, born December 23, 1858, and Elizabeth Munroe Townsend, born July 19, 1860.
Civil War service.
At the beginning of the civil war Townsend re-entered the service on 17 September 1861 as acting-lieutenant, receiving a promotion to commander a few months later, and served on a number of fighting ships.
USS Miami.
In 1862 Townsend was acting-lieutenant of the under the command of Abram Davis Harrell. The "Miami" was a side-wheel, double-ender gunboat with a crew of 134 and armament of one 80-pounder Parrott rifle, one 9 inch smoothbore, and four 24-pounder cannon. The ship participated under Admiral David Farragut as part of the Mortar Flotilla in neutralizing Confederate forts below New Orleans. Eliminating the forts permitted the Union ships to move upriver and eventually take New Orleans. Townsend became Commander of the "Miami" by October of that year.
USS Essex.
In 1863, he was promoted to commander and given command of the under Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi Squadron. The "Essex" was a 1,000 ton ironclad river gunboat of the United States Army and later United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was named for Essex County, Massachusetts. "Essex" was originally constructed in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana as a steam powered ferry named "New Era". She had a crew of 134, armament consisting of one 32-pounder, three 11-inch Dahlgren smooth bores, one 10-inch Dahlgren smoothbore and one 12-pounder howitzer, with armor consisting of 1¾ inch forward casemate, ¾-inch sides.
Under Townsend's command the "Essex" participated in the Siege of Port Hudson which occurred from May 21 to July 9, 1863, when Union Army troops assaulted and then captured the Mississippi River town of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Along with the Mortar Flotilla, the "Essex" bombarded the area daily and helped bring about the surrender of the city. The Union's success in this battle gave Northern forces effective control of the Mississippi River and effectively cut the states of Arkansas and Texas off from the rest of the confederacy.
On July 9, she engaged the enemy at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and although damaged in the battle, carried out her patrol duty at this point through March 6, 1864 when she sailed with the fleet into the mouth of the Red River and assisted in the capture of Fort de Russy on March 15 and 16.
Townsend relinquished command of the "Essex" on November 3, 1864 to Commander Bryson.
USS Wachusett.
After relinquishing command of the "Essex", Townsend was given command of the . The "Wachusett" was a wooden steam frigate with a detachable propeller, carrying nine guns and a complement of 170 men. She was a large (1,032-ton) steam sloop-of-war that served the United States Navy in the American Civil War. She was outfitted as a gunboat and used by the Navy as part of the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. On February 17, 1865, the ship was given orders to proceed to the East India Station by way of the Cape of Good Hope. There, she joined and in an effort to track down the Confederate commerce raider .
While in China the ship was engaged in efforts to track down outlaws and pirates who were harming American interests. In mid-August the ship sailed up the Yangtze River in this mission. The heat was reportedly 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 °C) in the shade and the ship made difficult passage up the river. A number of cases of heat stroke, some of them fatal occurred. At 1:45 am on August 15, 1866, Robert Townsend died of heat stroke. The executive officer John Woodward (Jack) Philip, (later Admiral), assumed command of the "Wachusett" and sailed it downriver with the goal of making it to Japan for the health of the crew. That evening the ship anchored by the consulate in Shanghai and held a funeral for their commander.
Burial.
Robert Townsend's body was returned to America and is interred at the Albany Rural Cemetery in New York.

1953 college football season

The 1953 NCAA football season finished with the Maryland Terrapins capturing the AP, INS, and UPI national championship after Notre Dame held the top spot for the first nine weeks. The #4 Oklahoma Sooners defeated Maryland in the Orange Bowl, but there was no further polling after the November 30 results were released. However, Notre Dame was selected as the National Champions by 10 other polls and the Oklahoma Sooners received first in 2 polls.[http://collegefootball.about.com/od/nationalchampions/a/champions-list_3.htm] However, despite the team receiving National Championship rings, the University of Notre Dame does not recognize this title due to their policy of only recognizing AP titles. Maryland was also the first champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which had been formed earlier in 1953 by seven colleges formerly with the Southern Conference. The year 1953 also saw the Michigan State Spartans, previously an independent, join the Big Nine Conference, which then became the Big Ten; MSU won the conference title in that first year and was the conference representative to the Rose Bowl, which it won 28-20 over UCLA.
During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual "NCAA Football Guide" of the "unofficial" national champions. The AP poll in 1954 consisted of the votes of as many as 378 sportswriters. 
Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams. Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the "overall" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained "unbeaten and untied" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20. Generally, the top teams played on New Year's Day in the four major postseason bowl games: the Rose Bowl (near Los Angeles at Pasadena), the Sugar Bowl (New Orleans), the Orange Bowl (Miami), and the Cotton Bowl (Dallas).
September.
In the preseason poll released on September 14, 1953, Notre Dame was rated first, followed by the defending champion, Michigan State, Georgia Tech, UCLA, and Alabama. As the regular season progressed, a new poll would be issued on the Monday following the weekend's games.
In a Friday night game at Los Angeles, #4 UCLA beat Oregon State 41-0. Meanwhile, at Montgomery, AL, #5 Alabama was shocked by Southern Mississippi, 25-19. The next day, September 19 #3 Georgia Tech beat Davidson, 53-0. Notre Dame and Michigan State began their seasons the following week. 
On September 26 #1 Notre Dame won 28-21 at #6 Oklahoma. #2 Michigan State won at Iowa, 21-7. #3 Georgia Tech went to #15 Florida and was held to a 0-0 tie. #4 UCLA beat Kansas 19-7. Still at #5, Alabama, trying to salvage some respect against a second unranked opponent, went to 0-1-1 after a 7-7 tie against LSU in Mobile; in the poll that followed, the Crimson Tide fell completely out of the Top 20. #9 Maryland, which had won 52-0 at Washington and Lee, rose to third, and previously unranked Michigan (a 50-0 victor over Wisconsin, entered the poll at fourth. 
The poll: 1.Notre Dame 2.Michigan State 3.Maryland 4.Michigan 5.UCLA
October.
October 3 With the exception of #4 Michigan, which beat Tulane 26-7 at home, the other top teams won on the road, with #1 Notre Dame at Purdue, 37-7, #2 Michigan State at Minnesota 21-0, #3 Maryland at Clemson, 20-0, and #5 UCLA defeated Oregon 12-0 in an away game. #6 Ohio State, which won 33-19 at California, rose to third in the next poll, knocking UCLA out. The Big Ten had three of the spots in the top five: 1.Notre Dame 2.Michigan State 3.Ohio State 4.Maryland 5.Michigan 
October 10 #1 Notre Dame was idle, but stayed at #1 after #2 Michigan State's 26-19 win over TCU. #4 Maryland won 40-13 over Georgia and #5 Michigan edged Iowa 14-13. The night before, #3 Ohio State had lost 40-21 to Illinois, while #6 UCLA returned to the top bracket with a 13-0 win over visiting Wisconsin. The poll: 1.Notre Dame 2.Michigan State 3.Maryland 4.UCLA 5.Michigan 
October 17 #1 Notre Dame beat Pittsburgh 23-14. #2 Michigan State defeated Indiana 47-18. #3 Maryland won 26-0 at North Carolina. #4 UCLA lost at Stanford, 21-20.
October 24 #1 Notre Dame stayed unbeaten with a 27-14 win over #4 Georgia Tech.
October 31 #1 Notre Dame beat Navy 38-7. #2 Maryland beat South Carolina 24-6.
November.
November 7 #1 Notre Dame won 28-20 at Penn. #2 Maryland beat George Washington University 27-6 at a game in Washington, DC. #3 Baylor lost at Texas, 21-20. #4 Illinois beat Michigan 9-3. #5 Michigan State won 28-13 at Ohio State, but still dropped in the poll. #6 Georgia Tech, which beat Clemson 20-7, rose to fifth.
November 14 #1 Notre Dame won at North Carolina, 34-14, and #2 Maryland beat Mississippi 38-0 as both stayed unbeaten and untied. #4 Michigan State beat Michigan 14-6. On the other hand, #3 Illinois lost to Wisconsin, 34-7 and #5 Georgia Tech fell 13-6 to Alabama in a game at Birmingham. Returning to the Top Five to take their place were #6 Oklahoma and #7 UCLA, which had defeated Iowa (47-0) and Washington (22-6), respectively.
November 21 Number one since the season began, #1 Notre Dame played to a 14-14 tie with Iowa. #2 Maryland closed its season with a 21-0 win over Alabama to finish the season unbeaten and untied, at 10-0-0, to take the top rung on the AP poll. #3 Michigan State closed with a 21-15 win over Michigan. #4 Oklahoma beat Nebraska 30-7, and #5 UCLA beat USC, 13-0. 
November 28 The new #1, Maryland, had already finished its season. #2 Notre Dame, with a 48-14 win at USC, and #4 Oklahoma (42-7 over Oklahoma State) were the only Top Five members who hadn't closed their seasons. The following Saturday, December 5, Notre Dame beat visiting SMU 40-14. 
In the Final AP poll, released November 30, #1 Maryland, the only unbeaten and untied team, received 187 first place votes, and unbeaten, but once-tied #2 Notre Dame had 141 votes. ACC member Maryland accepted a bid to the Orange Bowl to meet once-beaten (8-1-1), Big 7 champ, and #4 Oklahoma, while #3 Michigan State and #5 UCLA would meet in the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame declined to participate in a postseason game.
Postseason.
After the AP National Champion Maryland lost in the Orange Bowl, there was a lot of controversy since the AP Poll had been finalized beforehand and could not be changed to take this result into account. This Maryland loss resulted in Notre Dame being ranked #1 by 10 polls, including Billingsley Boand, DeVold, Dunkel, National Championship Foundation, Williamson, and several others. As a reward for beating the Terrapins, the Sooners received #1 from Berryman and Football Research.[http://collegefootball.about.com/od/nationalchampions/a/champions-list_3.htm

Junkers T.21

The Junkers J 21 (manufacturer's sales designations T 21 and H 21) was a reconnaissance aircraft designed in Germany in the early 1920s and produced in the Soviet Union at the Junkers plant at Fili for use by the Soviet Air Force.
Design and development.
The J 21 was an all-metal, parasol-wing monoplane of conventional configuration and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The pilot and observer sat in tandem, open cockpits. Two prototypes were constructed at the Junkers factory in Dessau, the second with a wing of reduced area. Despite the fact that the prototypes were unable to attain the performance that had been specified by the Soviets, series production commenced at Fili in August 1923 where it was known as the Ju 21 (Юнкерс Ю 21 in Cyrillic).
The production version differed from the prototypes in having a BMW IV engine in place of the BMW III originally fitted, and carried machine gun armament for both the pilot and observer. Sluggish performance led to a few examples being fitted with L2 and L5 engines, but these provided little improvement. With performance only marginally better than the World War I-vintage de Havilland DH-9A that it had been purchased to replace, the Ju 21 was itself soon replaced by newly built DH-9As built under license as the Polikarpov R-1.
The type was also evaluated by the "Reichswehr"s clandestine training school at Lipetsk, but it was rejected due to its poor performance and the Heinkel HD 17 purchased instead.

Ridge (differential geometry)

In differential geometry, a smooth surface in three dimensions has a ridge point when a line of curvature has a local maximum or minimum of principal curvature. The set of ridge points form curves on the surface called ridges.
The ridges of a given surface fall into two families, typically designated "red" and "blue", depending on which of the two principal curvatures has an extremum.
At umbilical points the colour of a ridge will change from red to blue. There are two main cases: one has three ridge lines passing through the umbilic, and the other has one line passing through it.
Ridge lines correspond to cuspidal edges on the focal surface.

Phacelia sericea

Phacelia sericea, the silky phacelia, blue alpine phacelia, or sky-pilot, is a showy perennial species of "Phacelia" endemic to western North America. Uncommon, it grows mainly at subalpine to alpine elevations in forest openings or above treeline among rocks and sand. "Sericea" comes from the Latin "sericeus", or silky, referring to the fine hairs on the leaves and stem. 
Description.
"Phacelia sericea" consists of several upright or ascending stems to 0.6 m (2 ft) from a tap-rooted, branched woody base. Its leaves are pinnatifid with cleft or entire segments. The basal leaves are somewhat larger than the upper cauline leaves and are more persistent and petiolate. The leaves and stems are generally covered with silvery silky hairs but are scarcely glandular. 
The inflorescence consists of several short panicles, tightly packed, at the end of the stem, resembling a bottle-brush. The dark blue to purple bell-shaped corolla is 4-6 mm across. It is hairy inside and out but not glandular. The filaments are two to three times as long as the corolla and give the inflorescence a fuzzy appearance. The anthers are bright yellow or orange and the style is shortly cleft. The fruit consists of two-chambered capsules with 8 to 18 seeds.
A subalpine to alpine species of open well-drained slopes, usually above 1500 m elevation, it is found in the mountains of Vancouver Island, the southern British Columbia Pacific Ranges, the Rocky Mountains from Banff National Park to southern Colorado, Olympic National Park, the Cascade Range of Washington, the mountains of eastern Oregon and the northernmost counties of California, and the mountains of Idaho, Nevada and Utah. It generally blooms from near the end of May through the end of August.
Subspecies.
Two subspecies are recognized. 
Where the ranges overlap, "P. sericea" ssp. "ciliosa" occurs at a lower elevation than ssp. "sericea". These are listed as subspecies by the USDA PLANTS database and ITIS, and as varieties by Jepson and Hitchcock.
Uses.
"Phacelia sericea" is listed by the Federal Highway Administration as a native species suitable for landscaping along roadsides in Colorado.

The Flatiron is high, long and generally about wide. It is flanked by Hemp Creek to the west and Trout Creek to the east.
Geology.
The Flatiron is probably the oldest of Wells Gray Park’s numerous volcanic formations, now estimated by geologists to be 1.4 million years old. The eruption filled an old valley here, long before Hemp Creek and Trout Creek created their canyons to the west and east respectively. The lava cooled very slowly and formed into columns, one of the park’s finest examples of columnar basalt. Most of the erosion that exposed the Flatiron occurred after the last Ice Age when huge quantities of meltwater flooded through this area. Since then, the columns that make up the Flatiron have been falling away regularly and piling up at the base, so the Flatiron keeps gets thinner.
Access.
A one-hour hike from Clearwater Valley Road (also called Wells Gray Park Road) leads to a viewpoint of the Hemp Canyonlands with the Flatiron in the distance. After another 30 minutes hiking, it is necessary to leave the trail and bushwhack to the base of the Flatiron. As the cliffs almost surround the Flatiron, the only access to the top is a scramble from the west side above Hemp Creek.

Unique Quartette

The Unique Quartette was a black vocal quartet in New York City. Founded in the mid-1880s by Joseph Moore, they are best known for a handful of wax cylinder recordings made in the first half of the 1890s. They are the earliest known black vocal group to have been commercially recorded, with their first recordings made in December 1890 for the New York Phonograph Company.
Several of their wax cylinders survive, most recorded by the North American Phonograph Company, and are among the earliest extant recordings of any African-American musicians, along with recordings by George W. Johnson and a single surviving cylinder recorded by Louis Vasnier.
The earliest surviving wax cylinder recording of the Unique Quartette - and thus the earliest surviving recording by any African-American musician - is Edison 694, "Mamma's Black Baby Boy," recorded in 1893. There are two copies left, one resides in the library of congress and one is privately owned.

Luke Harper

Jon Huber (born December 16, 1979) is an American professional wrestler signed to WWE under the ring name Luke Harper as a member of the Wyatt Family. He was previously known for his work on the North American independent circuit under his former ring name Brodie Lee in promotions such as Chikara, Jersey All Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor. He also wrestled in Japan for Dragon Gate.
Professional wrestling career.
Early career (2003–2007).
After being trained by Kirby Marcos and Rik Matrix in Rochester, New York, and Tony Mamaluke in Schenectady, New York, Huber made his professional wrestling debut for Roc City Wrestling in late 2002, working under a mask as Huberboy #2. He would eventually unmask while still using the Huberboy #2 name. During 2003, Huber began working for Rochester Pro Wrestling (RPW), adopting the new ring name Brodie Lee, which he came up with from the movie "Mallrats" by combining the names of actor Jason Lee and his character Brodie Bruce. Huber cites Rick Rude, Jake Roberts and Big Show as his influences. Throughout his time in RPW, which was later renamed to NWA Upstate and then again to NWA New York, Lee would go on to win multiple championships including the Heavyweight Championship on three separate occasions, the Tag Team Championship once and the Television Championship once, which he would also proceed to unify with the Kayfabe Dojo Championship. Huber has described his original "The Right Stuff" gimmick as him "just having fun" and "being a cruiserweight".
Chikara (2007–2012).
Huber made his debut for Philadelphia-based Chikara on March 24, 2007, at "Time Will Prove Everything", using the "The Right Stuff" Brodie Lee gimmick and losing to Equinox. Lee originally was not scheduled to wrestle at the event, but was instead visiting backstage with friends. However, when Reckless Youth no-showed the event, Chikara booker Mike Quackenbush offered Lee the chance to get in the ring. Lee would return to the company two months later, defeating Equinox in a rematch and starting a streak of not being pinned or submitted that would last for the rest of the year. In August, Lee aligned himself with the Olsen Twins (Colin and Jimmy) and adopted the nickname "Big Rig" and a more serious gimmick of a trucker. Lee and the Olsen Twins were scheduled to enter the 2008 King of Trios tournament as Team Dr. Keith, but after Colin signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the team was left one man short. A random draw picked Retail Dragon as his replacement, but after he dropped the deciding fall in their opening round match against Cheech, Cloudy and m.c.KZ, Lee turned on him while simultaneously ending his alliance with Jimmy Olsen in the process.
In April 2008, Lee's bullying of smaller wrestlers led to Claudio Castagnoli issuing a challenge to him. Their first match on April 20 ended in Castagnoli being disqualified for accidentally kicking the referee of the match. The second match on May 24 ended in similar fashion, this time Lee was disqualified for kicking the referee. This led to a No Disqualification match on July 13, which Lee won after interference from Shayne Hawke and Mitch Ryder, both of whom had a grudge with Castagnoli for breaking up the Kings of Wrestling the previous year. Lee's and Castagnoli's feud ended on September 7, 2008, in Chikara's first-ever steel cage match, with Castagnoli coming out victorious.
In late 2008, Lee aligned himself with Eddie Kingston and Grizzly Redwood to form a stable called The Roughnecks. On February 21, 2009, The Roughnecks defeated UltraMantis Black, Crossbones and Sami Callihan to earn a spot in the 2009 King of Trios tournament. On March 27, The Roughnecks lost their King of Trios opening round match to Team Uppercut (Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli and Dave Taylor). When Kingston moved on to feuding with Castagnoli, Lee and Redwood began wrestling matches as a tag team. With victories over Los Ice Creams (El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream, Jr.), Cheech Hernandez and K.C. Day, and the North Star Express (Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz), Lee and Redwood earned their right to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. On October 17, 2009, Lee and Redwood challenged The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant) for the Championship, but were defeated in two straight falls. Lee opted to give Redwood one more chance, but when he dropped the fall on October 19 in a match against The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian), Lee kicked him in the face, effectively ending The Roughnecks. Redwood made his return six months later on April 24, 2010, as a surprise opponent of Lee's, but was easily defeated by him. Afterwards, Redwood stated that he was not done with Lee, but would prepare himself before their next match. On August 29 Lee entered the Countdown Showdown battle royal and was dominating the match, before being eliminated by Redwood. On October 23 Lee suffered an upset loss in a match against Dasher Hatfield, who was defeated by Redwood the following day. On November 20 Lee and Redwood, having earned each other's respect, re–united and attacked Hatfield after his match with Shayne "Buck" Hawke. On January 23, 2011, at the season ten premiere, the Roughnecks defeated the Throwbacks (Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton) in a tag team match. The Roughnecks and the Throwbacks ended their feud on March 13 in a lumberjack match, where Hatfield and Dunkerton were victorious. In May 2011, Lee entered the "", set to determine the inaugural Chikara Grand Champion, but was forced to pull out of the tournament following his first match, after suffering an injury. Lee returned to Chikara on October 30. After signing a developmental contract with WWE, Lee made his farewell appearance for Chikara on March 25, 2012, when he unsuccessfully challenged Eddie Kingston for the Chikara Grand Championship.
Squared Circle Wrestling (2007–2012).
Lee made his debut for Syracuse, New York–based Squared Circle Wrestling (2CW) on August 20, 2007, teaming with Colin Olsen, as a replacement tag team partner for Jimmy Olsen, in a tag team match, where they were defeated by the Wyld Stallyns. Lee started off as a heel aligned with the rival promotion NWA Upstate. Lee started becoming popular after a July 26, 2008, post–match incident in Binghamton, New York that ended with him punching out a fan in the parking lot. Lee was kayfabe suspended from 2CW over the incident. He returned on October 24 to a huge ovation, although he was still a heel, leading NWA Upstate to a victory in an eight man tag team main event. He officially became a babyface starting April 2009 when the rivalry between 2CW and NWA Upstate had subsided. Lee then started a friendly rivalry with Slyck Wagner Brown that saw both men trade wins in singles matches on June 6 and September 19, 2009. Lee defeated Brown in a rubber match on February 19, 2010, and then again in a two out of three falls match on April 3, 2010, to end the feud. Lee challenged Jason Axe for the 2CW Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 2010, but lost due to outside interference. Lee defeated Isys Ephex on July 10 in a number one contender's match to earn another shot at the title and, on August 22 in Watertown, New York, defeated Jason Axe to win the 2CW Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Lee made a successful first defense of the title against the former champion, Jason Axe, in an "I Quit" match in Binghamton, New York, on September 24, 2010. Lee lost the title to Slyck Wagner Brown on November 19, 2010, in Elmira, New York. Lee regained the title on April 13, 2012, in a four-way match with Jay Freddie, Slyck Wagner Brown and Kevin Steen, who stole the belt after the match. The following night, with the title belt still in Steen's possession, Lee successfully defended the 2CW Heavyweight Championship in another four-way against Jason Axe, Jay Freddie and Matt Milan and afterwards relinquished it, announcing that he had signed with WWE and would be contractually unable to defend it in the future.
Ring of Honor (2008–2009).
Lee made his debut for Ring of Honor on October 25, 2008, aligning himself with The Age of the Fall and helping the stable's leader Jimmy Jacobs defeat Austin Aries in an Anything Goes match. Lee then teamed with fellow Age of the Fall member Delirious and defeated Cheech and Cloudy in a tag team match, before ending the night by attacking Necro Butcher, with whom the stable was feuding with, after his match with Go Shiozaki. On November 7, Lee's match with Necro Butcher ended in a disqualification, when the rest of the Age of the Fall attacked his opponent. Lee and Necro Butcher had a rematch under Anything Goes rules on February 27, 2009, which Necro won. In March Delirious turned on the Age of the Fall and on May 30 he defeated Lee in his final ROH match to date.
Jersey All Pro Wrestling (2009–2011).
Lee made his debut for Jersey All Pro Wrestling on March 28, 2009, as a member of the Hillbilly Wrecking Crew, along with Necro Butcher and Trevor Murdoch. On August 1 Lee and Necro defeated the Garden State Gods (Corvis Fear and Myke Quest) to win the JAPW Tag Team Championship. On January 23, 2010, at JAPW's 12th Anniversary Show Lee and Necro lost the title to Da Heavy Hitters (Havok and Monsta Mack) in a three-way match, which also included the H8 Club (Nate Hatred and Nick Gage). On March 20 Lee got to challenge for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion Dan Maff. After the match Nick Gage attacked Maff and joined the Hillbilly Wrecking Crew, replacing Murdoch, who had left the company. On May 22 Lee and Necro faced Maff and the JAPW New Jersey State Champion Charlie Haas in a tag team match, where they put their JAPW careers on the line against the titles of their opponents. In the end Lee managed to pin Haas, after Maff had turned on him, to become the new JAPW New Jersey State Champion. On October 23, 2010, Lee challenged Dan Maff for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship in a Champion vs. Champion match, but was defeated. On November 20 Lee first successfully defended the New Jersey State Championship against Eddie Kingston and then defeated Dan Maff, Nick Gage and Azrieal in a Championship Scramble to win the JAPW Heavyweight Championship for the first time, unifying the two titles. Lee made his first JAPW Heavyweight Championship defense on December 11, during the Anniversary weekend, defeating Rhino with help from Nick Gage. On December 30, 2011, JAPW announced that Lee, who had not made an appearance for the promotion in nine months, had been stripped of the Heavyweight Championship.
Evolve (2010–2011).
Lee debuted for Evolve on January 16, 2010, at the promotion's first ever show, teaming with Gran Akuma and Icarus in a six man tag team match, where they were defeated by Team Frightning (Mike Quackenbush, Hallowicked and Frightmare). After losing a singles match to Gran Akuma on March 13, Lee picked up his first victory in the company by defeating Gran Akuma, Hallowicked and Chris Dickinson in a four-way match on May 1. At the fourth show on July 23, Lee wrestled Jon Moxley to a no contest. As Moxley was protesting the stoppage, Lee kicked a chair into his face, which led to Evolve suspending him for the September 11 show. Lee returned to Evolve on May 20, 2011, in a match, where he was defeated by Sami Callihan via submission.
Dragon Gate USA (2010–2011).
On May 8, 2010, Lee made his debut for Dragon Gate USA, defeating Cheech, Cloudy, Kyle O'Reilly, Phil Atlas, Xtremo, Brent B. and Anthony Fiasco in a dark eight–way fray elimination match, prior to the tapings of the Uprising pay-per-view. Later, on the pay-per-view section of the evening, Lee interrupted a match between Rip Impact and Johnny Wave and beat down both of the competitors, before announcing that next time he would be coming after a Japanese wrestler. At the following event on September 25, Lee defeated Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson) in a three–on–one handicap match, before repeating his threat of going after a Japanese competitor. Later in the night Lee set his sights on Yamato and chased him away from ringside, when he tried to interfere in a match between his ally Jon Moxley and Jimmy Jacobs. The following day Lee defeated Jimmy Jacobs, Kyle O'Reilly, Mike Quackenbush, Rich Swann and Silas Young in a six–way match. On October 29 at Dragon Gate USA's first live pay-per-view, Bushido: Code of the Warrior, Lee teamed with sumo legend Akebono Tarō in a tag team match, where they defeated The Osirian Portal. After the match, Lee and Akebono had to be separated from one another by the rest of Dragon Gate USA's locker room. Later in the night, Cima used his draft pick to name Lee the newest member of his Warriors International stable. At the following day's tapings of Freedom Fight 2010, Lee defeated Akebono in a singles match. On January 28, 2011, at "United: NYC", Lee, now representing the heel group Blood Warriors, defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a singles match. The following day at "United: Philly", Lee suffered his first loss in Dragon Gate USA, when he was defeated by Open the Freedom Gate Champion Yamato in a non–title match.
Dragon Gate (2010–2011).
On December 21, 2010, Lee made his debut for Japanese promotion Dragon Gate in Tokyo, where he, representing the Warriors stable, defeated Kzy. The Warriors stable turned heel on January 14, 2011, when they attacked Masato Yoshino and World–1, aligning themselves with Naruki Doi's group, though Lee himself was not present, as he was snowed in and could not make the show. The following day Lee made his return to Dragon Gate as a member of the new top heel group, in a match, where he, Gamma and Genki Horiguchi defeated Yamato, Kagetora and Diablo. On January 18 the new group was named Blood Warriors.
WWE (2012–present).
On March 12, 2012, it was reported that Huber had signed a developmental contract with WWE. Huber made his debut for WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) at a house show on May 18, working under the new ring name Luke Harper.
When FCW was rebranded as NXT Wrestling in August 2012, Harper made his television debut on the November 7 episode of "NXT" as a follower of Bray Wyatt, who introduced Harper as the "first son" of the Wyatt Family. The Wyatt Family later also came to include Wyatt's "second son" Erick Rowan, with whom Harper formed a tag team, with the two defeating Percy Watson and Yoshi Tatsu in their first match together on the January 9, 2013, episode of "NXT". On the January 23 episode of "NXT", Harper and Rowan again defeated Watson and Tatsu in the opening round of the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament. Following a win over Bo Dallas and Michael McGillicutty in the semi-finals with Wyatt's interference, Harper and Rowan were defeated in the finals of the tournament by Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey. Harper defeated tag champion Neville on the March 20 episode of "NXT". On the May 2 episode of "NXT", Harper and Rowan won a triple threat elimination tag match by last pinning tag champion Neville. On the May 8 "NXT" (taped on May 2), Harper and Rowan defeated Neville and Bo Dallas, filling in for the injured Grey, to win the tag title. On the June 5 "NXT", Harper and Rowan successfully retained their title against Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno. On June 20, Harper and Rowan lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to Adrian Neville and Corey Graves.
From the May 27 episode of "Raw", WWE aired vignettes promoting the upcoming debut of the Wyatt Family. The vignettes showed the Wyatt Family's backwoods origins. On the July 8 episode of "Raw", the Wyatt Family made their debut by assaulting Kane. Harper made his WWE in-ring debut on the July 26 episode of "SmackDown", where he and Rowan defeated Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai) in a tag team match. Over the next few months, Harper and Rowan went on a winning streak over many teams, until Cody Rhodes and Goldust handed them their first loss on the October 11 episode of "SmackDown". After the Wyatt Family started feuding with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan, Harper wrestled two singles matches, losing to Punk on the November 4 episode of "Raw" and to Bryan via disqualification on the November 8 episode of "SmackDown".

Gauge (band)

Gauge was a post hardcore band from the northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.
Band history.
From the ashes of the bands Ivy League and Target, Gauge formed at the beginning of 1991. Highly regarded in Chicago's northwest suburban punk scene, they inspired and performed with other bands from the same area such as Cap'n Jazz, Friction, and Braid. Gauge released their first full-length, Soothe, by the end of 1992. After releasing their second album in 1994, entitled Fire Tongue Burning Stomach, they announced their break up. A posthumous 10" was released in 1995, making the band's final recordings available.
During their career, Gauge played 150 shows. Their final show was on October 6, 1994 at The Moose Lodge in Mount Prospect, IL with Cap'n Jazz and Tetsuo.
Members of Gauge went on to perform in the bands Sky Corvair, Euphone, 5ive Style, Sweater Weather, Haymarket Riot, Traluma, Radio Flyer, Heroic Doses, Ambulette and Rollo Tomasi, as well as working with Joan Of Arc, Owls and Noyes.
Kevin J. Frank contributed vocals to the songs, "Geheim" and "Sergio Valente", which are tracks 12 and 13 on disc 2 of the Cap'n Jazz anthology album, Analphabetapolothology. These songs also appear on the Cap'n Jazz 7", "Boys 16 to 18 Years... Age of Action" (Further Beyond Records, 1993).
On December 8, 2009 it was announced Gauge will play live for the first time since 1994 on March 6, 2010 at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago, IL.

The Midnight Man (1974 film)

The Midnight Man is a 1974 detective film directed by Burt Lancaster, who also starred with Susan Clark.
General information.
Burt Lancaster shared directing credit with Roland Kibbee, and shared writing credit with Kibbee and author David Anthony upon whose 1969 novel "The Midnight Lady and the Mourning Man" the movie was based. Featuring a fairly convoluted plot, the movie was not a major success and Lancaster did not consider it to be among his better work. Other than "The Kentuckian", this was Lancaster's only film as a director.
Co-stars included Susan Clark and Cameron Mitchell, as well as the future Daisy Duke, Catherine Bach, in her first screen appearance, and character actors Ed Lauter and Charles Tyner who would both be featured in "The Longest Yard" (the 1974 original, not the 2005 remake).
It was filmed in Clemson, South Carolina, and Anderson and Pickens Counties in 1973, with the first shots begun on February 13, 1973, the opening scenes of the Jim Slade character arriving by Trailways bus at Jordan College. The film was released in the United States on June 10, 1974 in New York City, and nationwide on June 14. It premiered at the Astro III theatre, Clemson, S.C., on March 14, 1974 with a red carpet ceremony.
Plot.
Lancaster plays an ex-Chicago policeman, Jim Slade, who has just been released on parole from prison for shooting his wife's lover in their bed. He goes to live with friends, played by Cameron Mitchell and Joan Lorring, in a small town where he has been offered a job (part of his parole agreement) as a night watchman at the local Jordan College, the campus of which is portrayed by Clemson University. A coed is murdered (Catherine Bach) and the local sheriff (Harris Yulin) tries to pin the crime on a creepy college janitor who spouts Biblical revelation while hiding pornography, played by Charles Tyner, who would be cast a year later as the pyromaniac murderer in The Longest Yard. Slade has other ideas and pursues an unauthorized investigation of his own. "Taking the lid off the hornet's nest involves him in considerable danger as blackmails, beatings, attempted rape and further murders wrestle for screentime before the long and-overcomplicated drama grinds to a close." 
The murdered student turns out to be the daughter of Senator Clayborne (Morgan Woodward), who subsequently receives blackmail letters over his daughter Natalie's confession to her campus psychiatric department counselor about an incestuous relationship with her father. Incriminating cassette tapes of the account have fallen into the hands of the blackmailers. Slade questions various possible suspects including Natalie Clayborne's estranged boyfriend King, (played by Burt Lancaster's son, William), who declares to Slade that the generation gap "just got a little wider", Dean Collins, the psych professor, ( played by actual Clemson faculty member Harold N. Cooledge Jr.), a nerdy student whose taped psych rant was also stolen, and Senator Clayborne.
All the while, Slade is being warned off of overstepping his authority as a mere night watchman, no longer a cop, by his parole officer Linda Thorpe, played by Susan Clark, as well as by his buddy Quartz, played by Mitchell. Lancaster has a brief affair with Clark. A rustic family of thugs overseen by a "Ma Barker"-ish mother provide misdirection in the plot, as well as turning out to be "muscle" for certain corrupt members of the Sheriff's Department. Their appearance on screen is always accompanied by a hwonking harmonica to emphasize their hillbilly status. Ed Lauter portrayed one of the sons.
The story concludes with Jim Slade realizing that both the parole officer and his buddy Quartz are the powers behind the crime, a conclusion that has to be narrated for the audience in a "thought" monologue by Lancaster as he watches his friend hobble around the cinder track of historic Riggs Field at Clemson, on crutches from a broken leg suffered early in the film. Only Quartz could have known one critical clue in the cover-up of the original murder. Sheriff Casey rolls up and arrests Quartz. Slade confronts Thorpe, who produces the stolen tapes, hidden in her freezer, knowing that the jig is up and she is about to be arrested. 
The film concludes with the sheriff offering Slade an apology, and a job. This is one of the major flaws in the film since, as a convicted violent felon, Slade cannot hold a position in law enforcement or carry a firearm. Roll credits.

Mark Marshall

Mark Anthony Marshall (born 5 May 1987) is an Jamaica-born English footballer currently playing for Coventry City.
Career.
Marshall's early career saw him come through the ranks at non-League Carshalton Athletic before later joining Grays Athletic and Eastleigh. During the pre-season of 2008–09 he joined Swindon Town on trial, but was originally not offered a deal as Town continued their pursuit of winger Kevin Betsy. However, the move for Betsy failed as the player joined League One rivals Southend and Marshall finally joined Swindon in early August 2008 on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
His debut for Swindon Town came three days later in a defeat away to Cheltenham Town, and continued to make a number of cameo appearances from the substitute bench under manager Maurice Malpas but his involvement with the first team ended at the same time as Malpas' departure in November 2008. New manager Danny Wilson accepted an offer from Bournemouth to take the winger on a one month loan in January 2009, but Marshall rejected the move. He later made a few substitute appearances as the season drew to a close. Marshall's first season at Swindon saw him make 15 appearances in all competition, all but one as a substitute.
On 17 September 2009, Marshall made a loan switch to League Two side Hereford United. The loan deal was later extended on 20 October 2009, keeping Marshall at Hereford until 17 November 2009. He was released by Swindon at the end of the 2009–10 season, and joined Barnet in July 2010. Marshall had a successful first season with The Bees, playing 45 league games and scoring six goals to help Barnet stay in League Two.
On 31 January 2012 it was announced by Barnet that Marshall had been provisionally suspended by the club after testing positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine. The FA later confirmed Marshall would serve a two-year ban from all football activity, which started from 20 January 2012. In May 2012, Marshall was released by Barnet due to the expiry of his contract.
Following the expiry of his ban, Marshall was signed by Coventry City on a short term contract starting 3 February 2014. On 3 February 2014, after impressing manager Steven Pressley on trial, Marshall earned a short-term contract at the club until the end of the 2013–14 season.

Felton Little Park

Felton Little Park (originally Auburn City Park) is a municipal park in Auburn, Alabama, United States. Felton Little Park is the oldest park in Auburn. From 1949 until 1968, the park was the home stadium of the Auburn High School Tigers football team, and from 1949 through 1967, the Auburn High School baseball team. Today, Felton Little Park has three softball fields for youth leagues. The park is named for Felton Little, an Auburn city councilman who donated the land for the park.
History.
In the late 1940s the city of Auburn decided that the town needed a centrally-located park and football and baseball facilities for Auburn High School, which had previously been playing home matches at nearby Auburn University. The nearest property suitable for such a park to downtown was owned by Felton Little, who donated the land to the city in September 1947. On September 30, 1949, the park was dedicated as Auburn City Park as the Auburn High football team played Tuskegee High School. As the football field was equipped with outdoor lights, this was the first night football game to be played in Auburn.
In 1955, the park was renamed "Felton Little Park" after its benefactor. In 1967, the Auburn High baseball team moved from the park to a new facility on the high school campus (today Sam Welborn Field), and on October 4, 1968 the football team played its final game at Felton Little before inaugurating its new stadium, Duck Samford Stadium. In the early 1970s, the park was converted to house three youth-league baseball fields, and in 2003 the park underwent a major renovation which converted the three fields to softball fields.
Records.
Auburn High School's football team played 20 seasons at Felton Little, compiling a 42–42–8 record.

Garbure

Garbure is a thick French soup or stew of ham with cabbage and other vegetables, usually with cheese and stale bread added. The name derives from the use of the term "garb" to describe sheaves of grain depicted on a heraldic shield or coat of arms. Thus the name of garbure, which is eaten with a fork, is a reference to the use of pitchforks to pick up sheaves of grain. It originated in Gascony in south-west France. It is similar to "potée".
"Garbure" was the daily sustenance of Gascon peasantry. It differed from one home to the next and varied with the rhythms of the seasons, the resources of the cook, and with household income. The basic principle behind this dish is the lengthy simmering of an assortment of vegetables and meats, generally meats preserved "en confit". As far as vegetables go, anything is possible. The cabbage may be accompanied by broad beans, fresh or dried, mange-tout, potatoes, turnips, peas, onions, carrots, celeriac, kohlrabi, beets, lettuce, chestnuts, nettles or borage. Thus the "garbure" could be adapted to the needs of every household.
A large tureen of garbure is often presented to the table in Bearnais restaurants, and guests can help themselves to as much as they wish at the start of the meal using the ladle supplied.
Frequently the meal would end with a traditional chabrot, which is a custom of mixing half a glass of red wine in with the liquid left in the bottom of one's bowl after eating the solid contents and then consuming it.

Willem Frederik van Bylandt

Willem Frederik count of Bylandt or Bijlandt (June 5, 1771 – October 25, 1855) was a Dutch lieutenant-general who as a major-general commanded a Belgian-Dutch infantry brigade at the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo.
Biography.
Family life.
Bylandt was born at The Hague, the son of major-general Alexander count of Bylandt and Anne, baroness Van der Duijn. His father was the acting-governor of the fortress of Breda who in 1793 was held responsible for the less-than-vigorous defense of that city against the French armies then invading the Dutch Republic. Alexander was court-martialed and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Bylandt first married Mary Christian (daughter of rear-admiral Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian) on June 20, 1806 at the Isle of Wight. After her death in 1818 he married Virginie Fréderique Wilhelmine Aspasia Craan (daughter of Willem Benjamin Craan) on December 22, 1825 in St. Joost ten Node (Belgium).
Early career.
Bylandt was the scion of a well-known Dutch military family, both army and navy officers (a cousin became a well-known admiral of the same epoch). He first entered the service of the Dutch Republic as a cadet at age 12 in a regiment of Dragoons in 1783. In 1786 he became an NCO in the elite "Gardes te paard" (Life Guards of the Stadtholder), and shortly afterward shifted to the Foot Guards as a second lieutenant (as such he took part on the Orangist side in the suppression of the Revolt of the Patriots). Promoted to captain in 1790 he transferred to the Schwartz battalion in 1794. He participated in the 1792-1795 campaigns of the War of the First Coalition, fighting in the Battle of Fleurus (1794) among others.
After the fall of the Republic and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic in January, 1795 Bylandt resigned his commission and joined the Hereditary Prince (the future William I of the Netherlands) in Bremen with other "émigrés", and followed the Prince to England later in the year to join a group of Orangist Dutch military men, who offered their services to the British. On November 25, 1795 he obtained a captain's commission in the regiment Hompesch Hussars that was sent to fight in the West Indies. He transferred to a regiment of chasseurs in 1796 as a major and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1797. He so distinguished himself in the assault on Trinidad that he was entrusted with the military government of Antigua. In 1800 he rejoined the Hompesch Hussars as a lieutenant-colonel to take part in the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He participated in the Battle of Ballinamuck with distinction.
After the Peace of Amiens Bylandt was paid off by the British and returned to the Batavian Republic to manage his estates near Breda. Only after the Netherlands regained its independence in 1813 did he again enter military service, this time as a lieutenant-colonel of the new Battalion "Landmilitie" (Militia) No. 12 (which was renumbered No. 8 in 1814). He was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1814. On April 21, 1815 he was put in charge of the First Brigade, Second Netherlands Division (Perponcher) as a major-general.
Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo.
On the evening of June 15, 1815 Bylandt's brigade was ordered by general Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque, chief of staff of the Netherlands Mobile Army, to take up position at the cross roads of Quatre Bras, because a French attack by Marshal Michel Ney was expected. Bylandt deployed a skirmish line of his 27th Jager Battalion and awaited developments. The next day the expected French attack came, and the Dutch troops (still without British support at this time) were hard pressed. Bylandt's brigade was concentrated around the Gemioncourt farm and the nearby woods. The farm changed hands several times and especially the 5th Militia Battalion suffered heavy casualties.
The Dutch troops were finally relieved by the arrival of general Thomas Picton's Fifth British Division and the 3rd Dutch Light Cavalry Brigade (general Van Merlen) around 3 pm. After a hard-fought battle the Allies were left in command of the battlefield. Bylandt's brigade was now ordered to the vicinity of Waterloo.
What happened next is the subject of some controversy. The Duke of Wellington placed his allied army in two lines and a reserve "behind" a ridge on the north side of what would become the battlefield. The ridge was supposed to offer some cover for the Allied troops against artillery fire. At first, however, Bylandt's brigade was placed "in front of" this ridge, fully exposed to any opening bombardment. The controversy concerns the question whether this tactical error (the result of sloppy staff work) was remedied in time. In many accounts of the battle it is asserted that the brigade (already depleted by the heavy losses at Quatre Bras) in fact remained deployed in this exposed position and therefore suffered terribly during Napoleon's opening artillery barrage. But this is doubtful, because the after-battle report by the chief-of-staff of the 2nd Division (then captain) Van Zuylen van Nyevelt states that the brigade was in time moved to a safer position. The famous map of the battlefield by Bylandt's future father-in-law Willem Benjamin Craan and his appended explanatory note, also place the brigade in this safer position.
Craan's 1816 history of the battle therefore does not mention heavy casualties for Bylandt's brigade as a consequence of Napoleon's opening barrage of 80 guns, but instead blames the infantry charge by d'Erlon's divisions on the sector of the Allied front that the brigade occupied for these indeed heavy casualties. As the Dutch troops received several point-blank volleys, and because they were deployed in a thin line (to cover as much terrain as possible according to Craan) the French broke through their line and the remnants of two of the Militia battalions retreated in haste, until they were rallied by the 5th Militia Battalion, that was placed in reserve.
During this enemy action Bylandt himself was wounded and the command of the brigade was taken over by the commander of the 8th Militia Battalion, lt.-col. W. A. de Jongh. After the battle Bylandt received the Knight's Cross Third Class of the Military William Order for his gallantry.
Later career.
After the return of the army to the new Kingdom of the United Netherlands Bylandt was appointed military governor of South-Brabant (which contained Brussels). He was military governor of that city when in 1830 the Belgian Revolution started. Because he acted less than decisively the situation soon got out of hand. He was blamed for this and put on non-active status on November 24, 1830. In the following years he published several pamphlets to defend his good name. He retired from the service in 1840 but was nevertheless promoted to lieutenant-general in 1843.
Bylandt died aged 84 on his estate at Prinsenhage, near Breda, in 1855.

Pelle Svensson

Per Oskar "Pelle" Svensson (born 6 February 1943 in Sollefteå, Västernorrland County, Sweden) is a Swedish former Greco-Roman wrestler and lawyer. His achievements include a silver medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the light heavyweight class and two gold medals at the World Championships in 1970 and 1971.
Wrestling career.
Svensson, who started his career in wrestling in 1955, competed for the clubs Sundsvalls AIK and Heby BK. He won the Swedish Championships for the first time in 1962, competing in the 100 kg class. He won the Swedish Championships for thirteen consecutive years until his retirement in 1974. He competed at the World Championships for the first time in 1963, ending up fourth. At the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, Svensson won a silver medal in the light heavyweight class. He also won two gold medals at the European Championships in 1969 and 1970 and two gold medals at the World Championships in 1970 and 1971, as well as three bronze medals at the European Championships in 1966, 1967 and 1968. As a wrestler he was nicknamed "Pelle Swing" in Sweden.
Svensson was chairman of the Swedish Wrestling Federation () from 1993 to 1998, and a member of board of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) from 1990 to 2007. Svensson left his position as a member of board of FILA in protest of what he saw as a lack of willingness from FILA to fight within the sport.
Lawyer career.
Following his career in wrestling, Svensson pursued a career as a lawyer and was noted for taking on several high-profile criminal cases. He first received attention when he filed a civil indictment against a suspected murderer in the case of the disappearance of an eleven-year-old boy north of Sundsvall in 1980 (known in Sweden as "Johanfallet", "the Johan Case"), together with the parents of the boy. The case ultimately ended in loss in the court of appeal, which ordered the parents to pay the court costs, and Svensson was criticized and accused of taking the case in order to receive media attention.
In 1988 Svensson served as the defendant to Juha Valjakkala, who was later convicted of the murder of three people in the village of Åmsele (known in Sweden as "Åmselemorden", "the Åmsele Murders") earlier in the same year. In 2005 he wrote the book "Utan nåd : grymhet utan gräns" ("Without Mercy – Cruelty Beyond Limit") about the case.
Svensson also served as the defendant to Lars Tingström (known in Sweden by the nickname "Bombmannen", "the Bomb-Man"), who was later convicted of three bomb attacks around Stockholm. In 1996 Svensson published parts of what he said was a testament authored by Tingström shortly before his death in 1993. In the purported testament, Tingström wrote that he had given Christer Pettersson the instructions to assassinate Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. The journalist Gunnar Wall wrote an article in "Dagens Nyheter" where he accused Svensson of manipulating the testament from Tingström. A forensic investigation later proved the testament to be real. Svensson's information led the prosecutors to file an application for a new trial against Pettersson for the assassination of Palme, but this was rejected by the Supreme Court.
Svensson ended his career as a lawyer after a burnout, but continued to take cases after his retirement.
Personal life.
Svensson is married and has three children. He lives in the small village of Njurunda outside Sundsvall in Västernorrland County.

Stranger in My House (Ronnie Milsap song)

"Stranger in My House" is a song written by Mike Reid, and recorded by American country music artist Ronnie Milsap. It was released in 1983 as the first single from the album "Keyed Up". The song tells of a man who suspects his wife is fantasizing about being with a secret lover.
Success and reception.
His 35th single to be released, the song immediately became a major hit as it peaked at No. 5 on the country charts, and at No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary. The song also went as high as No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts.
The song features a rock guitar solo from Bruce Dees. Some stations edited this solo out of the song, and a station in Denver, Colorado refused to play the song, because personnel at the station thought that the song sounded like a Led Zeppelin song. The airplay lost from the Denver station kept the song from going to number one.
Music video.
A black-and-white music video for the single, directed by David Hogan, was also released. During the beginning of the video, a man is shown literally breaking into the narrator's house as the blind singer plays his piano. During the climax, it shows his wife's imaginary lover playing an electric guitar as she performs an erotic dance to the solo. In the end, it shows investigators searching the house. White tape is laid down in the shape of an electric guitar.

Nobody Runs Forever

Nobody Runs Forever, also called The High Commissioner, is a 1968 film directed by Ralph Thomas based on Jon Cleary's 1966 novel "The High Commissioner". It stars Rod Taylor as Australian policeman Scobie Malone and Christopher Plummer as the Australian High Commissioner in England caught up in corrupt dealings, during delicate negotiations. Taylor's production company was involved in making the film as was the American Selmur Productions.
Plot.
New South Wales Police Sergeant Scobie Malone (Taylor) is summoned to Sydney by the Premier of New South Wales (Leo McKern) who at the time was the controversial Sir Robert Askin. The Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir James Quentin (Plummer) is wanted for a 25-year-old murder charge, that the Premier, Quentin's gruff political rival, has discovered.
Upon arrival in London, Malone meets Lady Quentin (Lilli Palmer) and her husband, the sophisticated Sir James, as well as Sir James's secretary (Camilla Sparv). Sir James offers no objection to the murder charges but demands several days before departure as he is conducting delicate peace negotiations. As Malone waits as a guest of the High Commissioner, he prevents assassination attempts against Quentin by a dangerous spy ring headed by Maria Cholon (Daliah Lavi).
Production.
Filmed in Australia and London, this was the last big-screen appearance of Franchot Tone, who plays the American ambassador.
Rod Taylor has a rare opportunity to play an Australian, even though that is his native land. He plays Malone as a tough single Outback policeman unlike the married Sydney Detective Sergeant of the original books Taylor's unsophisticated integrity is contrasted with the London diplomatic scene throughout the film.
Taylor accepted the role on the proviso he could rewrite some of the script. In particular, the opening scene where Scobie Malone arrests Jacko (Charles Tingwell) is Rod's work.
Differences from Novel.
There were several key changes from the novel, including:
Reception.
The film earned rentals of $455,000 in North America and $150,000 elsewhere. It recorded a loss of $1,185,000.

Alf Linder

Alf Linder (July 28, 1907 - December 21, 1983) was a Swedish organist, renowned for his frequent radio broadcasts and his teaching at the Stockholm Conservatory.
Life.
Linder was born in Hammerö, near Karlstad on July 28, 1907. He studied organ with Claes Rendahl and Otto Nordlund (organists of Karlstad cathedral) and is reported to have learned the complete organ works of Bach by the age of ten. In 1924 he auditioned, unsuccessfully, to study organ at the Stockholm conservatory with Gustaf Hägg. He was accepted into the conservatory the following year and became the first organ student of the newly appointed organ professor Otto Olsson. His repertoire during his studies at the conservatory included Bach's Piece d'Orgue, Olsson's Prelude and Fugue in C# minor and Widor's Symphonie Romane. He passed the organist's exam in 1927 and the church music exam in 1933.
In 1938-1940 Linder traveled several times to Leipzig to study organ with Günther Ramin, studies that influenced him greatly. He later described the experience in the program notes of a 1977 recording:
Linder made his first recordings for Swedish Radio in January and March 1940 and he was appointed organist of the Stockholm Concert Hall the same year, a position he held until 1954. He became the organist of Oscar's Church, Stockholm in 1943 and held that position until his death in 1983. There he arranged 45 minute organ recitals on Saturday nights and played the complete works of Bach within this recital series 1944-1945. He taught organ at the Stockholm Conservatory starting in 1938 and became professor in 1958. In 1954 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

The college is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Conference and competes in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, plays in the Mid-States Football Association, fielding 17 varsity teams in 11 sports: football, soccer (men's/women's), volleyball, cross country running (men's/women's), basketball (men's/women's), indoor track and field (men's/women's), wrestling, baseball, golf (men's/women's), outdoor track and field (men's/women's) and softball.
In addition, the cheerleading and competitive dance squads occasionally perform at athletic events. The squads are supported by the athletic department.
History.
Grand View joined the NAIA after it moved from junior college status in 1979. Many athletic programs at Grand View have been reinstated or added in the past decade. Grand View added women's soccer in 1998 and has reinstated competitive dance (2002), cross country (2003), golf (2004) and track (2006). Wrestling and football were added in 2008. There was talk of reinstating women's tennis in fall of 2007, but so far nothing has been announced.
Football.
Grand View announced that it will be creating a football team in the fall of 2008 with the hiring of Mike Woodley in July 2007. Woodley has over 30 years of coaching experience and prior to Grand View, Woodley was head coach at Sam Rayburn High School in Pasadena, Texas. Woodley is a familiar name in the Iowa football community, after serving as head coach at conference rival Saint Ambrose University in Davenport, Iowa from 1991 to 1993 and assistant coach at Iowa State University from 1994 to 2003. Woodley is a 1974 University of Northern Iowa graduate and four-year football letterman. He still holds the Panthers' school record for 20 career interceptions.
In a press release by the Grand View athletic department, Woodley stated, “Anybody who’s been in this business long enough knows that the opportunity to start a program from scratch is very rare. There are so many exhilarating things happening on campus with the addition of athletic programs, new student housing, and new buildings. Grand View is headed in the right direction, and I want to be a part of it." 
Grand View will play independently of a league in 2008 before officially joining the Midwest League of the Mid-States Football Association, in 2009. Iowa Wesleyan College, McKendree University, Quincy University, Saint Ambrose University, University of St. Francis, and William Penn University are all members of the MSFA.
The Vikings played Briar Cliff University in its historical debut on Saturday, August 30, 2008 Williams Stadium, Grand View's new home field. Grand View won 20-17.
Grand View won the 2013 NAIA Championship with a 35-23 win over Cumberlands (KY). This was Grand View's first championship in football. The team finished 14-0.
Wrestling.
The campus newspaper, The Grand Views, mentioned in its September 7, 2007 issue that construction will begin in the fall of 2007 of "a new weight room for sports teams; faculty offices; and wrestling team area" and will be completed by the summer of 2008 as part of the college's master plan. This addition will be built onto the southeast side of the existing Johnson Wellness Center near the baseball field.
On Thursday, March 6, 2008, Grand View announced the establishment of a wrestling squad with the hiring of new head wrestling coach Nick Mitchell. Mitchell is a graduate of Wartburg College, where he was an assistant wrestling coach leading up to his hiring at Grand View.
The Grand View wrestling program will be the first Des Moines collegiate wrestling program since Drake University dropped their program after their 1992-1993 season. The Des Moines Register also reports that the first season for Grand View wrestling will be in the 2008-2009 winter.
Athletic facilities.
Charles S. Johnson Wellness Center/Sisam Arena.
Located at 1500 Morton Avenue, the Charles S. Johnson Wellness Center opened in 2002 and is the largest building on campus as of summer 2007. The facility can be considered the nerve center of the Viking athletic program. The women's volleyball team plays home games in the fieldhouse, and the men's and women's basketball teams play home games in Sisam Arena. Home wrestling events are also held in Sisam Arena. The lobby of the arena contains trophy cases which make up the Grand View Athletic Hall of Fame. Sisam Arena was named after David Sisam, longtime coach and athletic director.
Sisam Arena was renovated in 2002 while the wellness center was being built and received new bleachers, backboards, wall padding and a small media platform.
The upper fieldhouse contains 1/10 mile track, weight lifting equipment open to athletes and Grand View students, faculty and staff and a double basketball court resides on the ground level. 
In 2008, a new two-level addition was added on the southeast corner to provide a new weight room, a wrestling room and athletics staff offices. The weight room facility exclusively for athletes has ten "Power Lift" stations and a collective in plates, dumbbells and bars.
Luhrs Athletic Complex.
Luhrs Athletic Complex, located behind the wellness center at 1500 Morton Avenue, is composed of one field each for soccer, baseball, softball as well as an open grassy practice area adjacent to the baseball field on Sheridan Avenue. Luhrs was renovated in 2004. Residential houses sit immediately on the other side of the fence of the soccer field.
Williams Stadium.
Located away from campus at 1591 East University Avenue, Grand View will be playing at the stadium of East High School (Des Moines), Williams Stadium. The college and East High will be in a working partnership. Grand View has committed to spending $800,000 on a new locker room facility and will raise an additional $1.2 million for other track and field renovations at the stadium. Grand View and the East High Foundation, an organization for alumni, staff, faculty and the east-side community, will partner in the fundraising. Artificial turf was installed, allowing both East High and Grand View to play and practice on the field, for the 2009 season. A sports pavilion, new goal posts, and a new college-regulation track will also be part of the renovation plan.

Northeast Corner Conference of Indiana

The Northeast Corner Conference is an eleven-member Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA)-sanctioned conference based in Northeast Indiana. Its schools are located within DeKalb, Elkhart, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben, and Whitley counties.
History.
The conference was formed as the Bi-County Conference in 1964, as the formations of Lakeland and Prairie Heights left Lagrange and Steuben Counties with only seven schools total. Angola already competed in the Northeastern Indiana Athletic Conference, and Lakeland decided to compete independently. The five remaining schools started the conference, though Shipshewanna-Scott and Topeka were due to consolidate by 1966. Meanwhile, at that point the five remaining Noble County schools were set to consolidate into two schools themselves, and were also needing new conference affiliation. They joined with the Bi-County Conference teams, and changed their name to the current NECC. Howe Military also joined that year.
Other schools to join since then were Lakeland in 1974, Fairfield in 1980, Garrett in 1981, Eastside in 1983, and Angola and Churubusco in 1989. Howe Military left in 1980, and Garrett followed in 2005. Yet the Garrett Railroaders will return to the NECC after leaving to the ACAC.

Johannes Overbeck

Johannes Adolph Overbeck (March 27, 1826 - November 8, 1895) was a German archaeologist and art historian.
Biography.
Overbeck was born in Antwerp. He was son-in-law to zoologist Georg August Goldfuss (1782-1848), and was father-in-law to anthropologist Emil Ludwig Schmidt (1837-1906). His uncle was famed painter Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869).
In 1848 Overbeck received his Ph.D. from the University of Bonn, where he served as a privatdocent from 1850 to 1853. In 1853 he became an associate professor of archaeology and dean of the archaeological collection at the University of Leipzig. He worked at Leipzig for the remainder of his career, becoming a full professor in 1859. Two of his better known students were Adolf Furtwängler (1853-1907) and Adolf Michaelis (1835-1910). He also helped direct the Archaeological Institute in Berlin (1874-1895).
One of his earliest publications was a significant work on Pompeii that ran to several editions, and in 1884 with August Mau (1840-1909), he published a book about Pompeii and its works of art, titled "Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümern und Kunstwerken". Overbeck was also a specialist of Greek "Kunstmythologie" (mythological art) within the field of archaeology.
He rarely visited archaeological sites, preferring to write about them second hand. This tended to give his writings a dry flavor, which even his comprehensive marshalling and organization of materials could not really overcome. Carl Schurz has noted that “it has been said that wrote the best book that has ever been written on Herculaneum and Pompeii, without ever having seen either spot.” Overbeck's devotion was mainly to the lecture pulpit, and there he made his most noteworthy contributions. His lectures were very well attended, the primary ones with frequently over 100 listeners. He sought to improve the life of students in other ways as well by establishing a reading room and infirmary. As one compensation for his lack of first-hand experience, he developed Leipzig's collection of plaster casts.

TAE Greek National Airlines

TAE Greek National Airlines (, , literally "Technical Aeronautical Exploitations—National Air Lines"), originally branded in English as "TAE National Greek Airlines", was formed by the Greek government in 1951 to be the national airline of Greece. The airline operated without competition on domestic routes in Greece and served a small number of European and Middle Eastern cities. The airline was sold to Aristotle Onassis in 1957 and he renamed the carrier Olympic Airways.
History.
In the post-World War II era, there were four airlines operating in Greece: T.A.E. (Technical and Aeronautical Exploitations/), G.A.T./ΕΛΛ.Α.Σ. (Greek Air Transport--Hellenic Airlines/), Α.Μ.Ε./Air Transport of Greece () and Daedalus Airlines . Of these, T.A.E., Daedalus and A.M.E. were privately held and G.A.T. was publicly owned. In 1950, Daedalus ceased operations as the number of passengers for all Greek airlines declined precipitously. Due to the financial difficulties of all three carriers and to ensure that Greece maintained a Greek-flagged carrier, in 1951, the Greek government forced the merger of all three companies into TAE Greek National Airlines.
The 18 aircraft from the three merged airlines included 1 Douglas DC-4 Skymaster and the rest were Douglas DC-3 Dakotas. The DC-4 was used primarily on the bi-weekly route from Athens to Rome-Paris-London. Additionally, the airline served the Balkan cities of Belgrade and Istanbul, Nicosia in Cyprus and the Egyptian city of Alexandria
In 1955, the airline was not performing financially and the Greek state sought unsuccessfully to find a buyer. Eventually, Aristotle Onasis agreed to buy the ailing carrier in July, 1956. The company flew under the name T.A.E. until April, 1957, when the airline was renamed Olympic Airways.
Destinations.
TAE Greek National Airlines served a number of domestic destinations in Greece, as well as international destinations.

The Pond (intelligence organization)

The Pond was a small, secret organization formed by the government of the United States of America which operated between 1942 and 1955. It engaged in espionage. Its existence has only recently been acknowledged. 
History.
In the spring of 1942, Brigadier General Hayes Kroner, the head of the War Department's Military Intelligence Service, was given the go-ahead to set up an espionage organization separate from William "Wild Bill" Donovan's Office of Strategic Services. He selected to head it U.S. Army Captain John or Jean Grombach, who was a rival and previous employee of Donovan. Grombach, the son of the French consul in New Orleans, had obtained American citizenship and graduated from West Point before World War II. 
In 1955, The Pond was disbanded by the American government because of post-war centralization of intelligence gathering and questions about the organization's effectiveness.
On April 27, 2008, the Associated Press reported that the Central Intelligence Agency planned to "release a stash of Pond-related papers accidentally discovered in a Virginia barn in 2001" and hand them over to the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.

Starrett &amp; van Vleck

The architectural firm of Starrett & van Vleck, often spelled Starrett & Van Vleck, specialized in the design of early 20th century department stores primarily in New York City. The partner Goldwin Starrett had worked for four years in the Chicago office of Daniel Burnham. Included in their designs were the New York City flagship stores of Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue, Abraham & Straus, and Alexander's. The Lord and Taylor store, located on Fifth Avenue between 38th and 39th streets, was completed in 1914 and was Starrett & van Vleck’s first major department store. In December 2007, the store was named a New York City landmark.
Starrett & van Vleck was also responsible for the design of the New York City landmarks 21 West Street (1929), Everett Building (1908), American Stock Exchange (1921), and Downtown Athletic Club (1930). Between 1937 and 1948, they designed the downtown flagship store of the J. N. Adam & Co. in Buffalo, New York, which is currently threatened with demolition. It is located in the J.N. Adam-AM&A Historic District. Starrett & van Vleck, credits also include the flagship store of Washington, D.C.'s Garfinckel's. The latter was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
In Pittsburgh, Starrett & van Vleck was responsible for the design of the downtown flagship of the Gimbels Department Store which was built in 1914 at 339 Sixth Avenue. After Gimbels went out of business in the late 1980s, the building was renamed the Heinz 57 Center. It was added to the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation as a Historic Landmark in 1987. Near Pittsburgh, in 1912, they designed the house that later became the clubhouse of the Foxburg Country Club.

Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet

Sir Thomas Robert Tighe Chapman, 7th Baronet (6 November 1846 – 8 April 1919) was an Anglo-Irish landowner, the last of the Chapman baronets of Killua Castle in Ireland. For many years he lived under the name of Thomas Robert Lawrence, taking the name of his partner, Sarah Lawrence, the mother of his five sons, one of whom was T. E. Lawrence, 'Lawrence of Arabia'.
Early life and background.
Born in 1846, the second of the three sons of William Chapman (1811–1889) and his wife Louisa, daughter of Colonel Arthur Vansittart (1775–1829), of Shottesbrook, and the grandson of Sir Thomas Chapman, 2nd Baronet, Chapman was educated at Eton College.
He was brought up to lead the life of a country gentleman, at a house called South Hill, near the village of Delvin, County Westmeath, Ireland, a modest property of some 170 acres, and also at the family's town house in Dublin. The Chapman family belonged to the higher level of the Anglo-Irish landowning class and for generations its members had married into families of a similar standing in England and Ireland.
"Debrett's Baronetage" for 1918 says: 
Life.
As a younger son, it was expected that Chapman would run, rather than own, the family's estates, and from 1866 to 1868 he learnt about estate management at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. However, his elder brother, William Eden Chapman (1844–1870), an officer in the 15th The King's Hussars, died in May 1870, leaving Chapman as the heir. The third brother, Francis Vansittart Chapman, was then trained to manage the estates.
On 24 July 1873, Chapman married Edith Sarah Hamilton (b ca 1847), daughter of George Augustus Rochfort-Boyd, JP, DL, of Middleton Park, County Westmeath, and they had four daughters, Eva Jane Louisa (born 1874), Rose Isabel (born 1878), Florence Livia (born 1880) and Mabel Cecele (born 1881).
In the late 1870s, the Chapmans took on as a governess a capable and cheerful young Scotswoman who was known as Sarah Lawrence. By this time, Edith Chapman had become zealously religious, subjecting members of her household to frequent prayer meetings and disapproving of many of their pleasures, while Chapman himself had become a heavy drinker. He fell in love with Sarah Lawrence, who was younger than he by some fifteen years. One of Chapman's daughters later recalled that her father usually had a dour manner, but whenever Sarah Lawrence entered a room, he became "all gay". Lawrence, who had been born on 31 August 1861 in Sunderland, County Durham, had been registered at birth under the surname of her unmarried mother, Elizabeth Junner, who at the time was working as a servant in the house of Thomas Lawrence, a Lloyd's surveyor, and his son John Lawrence is thought to have been Sarah Lawrence's father.
In 1885, Lawrence became pregnant. She went to live in rooms in Dublin which Chapman got for her, and in December 1885 a son was born and christened Montagu Robert. Chapman stayed with his wife, while seeing Lawrence and his son, until Edith Chapman found out what had happened (the Chapmans' butler, while in a Dublin grocer's shop, heard a young woman give her name as Mrs Thomas Chapman – he recognised the woman as Sarah Lawrence). He then left his wife to live with Lawrence. He took her to live at Tremadog, Caernarfonshire, now Gwynedd, North Wales, and their second illegitimate son, christened Thomas Edward and later known as Lawrence of Arabia, was born there in August 1888.
The couple stayed only a short time in Tremadog, and soon moved on, to Kirkcudbright in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright in Scotland, then to Dinard in Brittany, the Isle of Wight, and the New Forest, choosing places where their English neighbours were not of Chapman's class and were unlikely to recognise him. They had nine children altogether, but three of them died young, leaving five sons and a daughter who survived infancy. In 1896, still unmarried and going under the name of Mr and Mrs Lawrence, the couple arrived in Polstead Road, Oxford. The purpose of this move was largely to enable them to educate their sons, despite limited means.
Chapman lived a life of leisure and spent much of his time with his sons. He was a photographer, hunted, spoke good French, was interested in medieval architecture, taught his sons carpentry, and even in old age would quote from Homer and Horace. He bought smart new bicycles and liked to cycle long distances.
In 1914, Chapman succeeded his cousin Sir Benjamin Rupert Chapman, 6th Baronet (1865–1914), to the baronetcy. When he died on 8 April 1919, he was buried at Wolvercote. As he left no legitimate heir, the title became extinct.
Chapman's son T. E. Lawrence had already become world-famous, following the Arab Revolt of 1916. Another of his surviving sons, A.W. Lawrence (1900–1991) became notable as an archaeologist and art historian.
Money affairs in exile.
On 30 March 1888, Chapman assigned his life interest in his father's estates to his younger brother Francis Chapman, in exchange for an annuity for life of £200. Their father, William Chapman, died in 1889, leaving the bulk of his property to his son Francis. However, Chapman also had (or later inherited) some capital, which by 1916 was more than £20,000, producing at the time an annual income of some £1,000, a substantial figure.
Chapman (otherwise Mr Lawrence) was probably disappointed when his brother Francis died unmarried in 1915, leaving him only £25,000 of his estate of £120,296, with £10,000 going to the Adelaide Hospital in Dublin and £25,000 being shared by Chapman's four daughters, who were also the residuary legatees. When Chapman (Lawrence) received the £25,000, he shared part of it out among his sons.
Chapman had a sister, Caroline Margaret Chapman, who in 1894 married her cousin, Montagu Chapman, later the fifth Chapman baronet, and Sir Montagu died childless in 1907. In 1911, his widow made a Will which divided the Killua estate, leaving £20,000 to her brother, Chapman, and separate large amounts to his four daughters. However, when she died in 1920, the £20,000 went to the daughters, as her residuary legatees, as Chapman had himself died a few months before and she had not specified that the bequest was to go elsewhere in that event. The loss of the £20,000 may explain the bitterness of an allusion to the Chapmans which T. E. Lawrence added to Liddell Hart's biography of him: "The father's family seemed unconscious of his sons, even when after his death recognition of their achievement might have done honour to the name."
What was left of the family's land in Ireland was sold in 1949 and then came to some .
Descendants.
Chapman had four daughters: Eva Jane Louisa (b. 1874); Rose Isabel (b. 1878); Florence Lina (b. 1880) and Mabel Cecele (b. 1881).
Chapman's eldest son Montagu Robert Lawrence (1885–1971) became a physician and was a medical missionary in China.
His second son T. E. Lawrence died childless in a motorcycle accident in 1935, while his third and fourth sons, William George Lawrence (1889–1915) and Frank Helier Lawrence (1893–1915), also childless, were killed during the First World War.
His fifth son, Arnold Walter Lawrence (1900–1991), married Barbara Thompson in 1925 and had one child, Jane Helen Thera Lawrence (1927–1977). In 1947, she married James Macdonald Cassels (1924–1994), who became Lyon Jones Professor of Physics in the University of Liverpool in 1960, and they had one son and one daughter.
Sarah Lawrence died in 1959, aged 98, in an Oxford nursing home.

Bernhard II, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg

Bernhard II, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg (ca. 1260 – aft. 26 December 1323), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg.
He was the third son of Bernhard I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his wife Princess Sophie, daughter of King Abel of Denmark.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1287, Bernhard inherited the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg. In accordance with the family law of the House of Ascania, he was obliged to rule jointly with his older brother John I without division of their patrimony. John died four years later (1291) and Bernhard became the sole ruler.
In the year 1300 Bernhard adopted the title "Count of Bernburg". His princely title was confirmed the next year.
After the Anhalt-Aschersleben line became extinct in 1315, Bernhard inherited the senior princely title of Ascania as well as the title prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben. However, he could not take actual possession of his cousin Otto's lands Anhalt-Aschersleben or retain title to this fief, because the territory was lawfully expropriated by the Bishopric of Halberstadt as payment for the debts of the late Prince Otto. Bernhard agreed to this arrangement in writing in 1316, however his descendants continued to dispute the loss of the principality for centuries. Aschersleben was finally awarded to Brandenburg-Prussia in the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.
In Frankfurt am Main on 27 September 1320, Bernhard was created Count palatine of Saxony and Count of Brehna. He died three years later.
Marriage and issue.
In 27 December 1302 Bernhard married Helene (b. 1270 – d. 9 August 1315), daughter of Wizlaw II, Prince of Rügen and widow of John III, Lord of Mecklenburg. They had three sons:

Within the video, she crosses Dero, dressed in a top-hat and suit (presumably as the Mad Hatter), a menacing looking anthropomorphic rabbit in a BDSM collar and leash, an old woman with sharpened teeth who is drinking blood (the Queen of Hearts), and Crap and Flux. She runs away after seeing the blood and tries to escape through a mirror. She is then caught by Dero, who wraps her in a red fabric, but the girl escapes using the scissors she picked up at the beginning of the video. As she runs into another room, she encounters a double of herself, but with white hair and glowing eyes, painting white roses red.

Sam Houston Zephyr

The Sam Houston Zephyr was a named passenger train operated by the Burlington-Rock Island Railroad, a subsidiary of both the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. It was the first streamlined passenger train in Texas. 
Inaugurated on October 1, 1936, the year of the Texas centennial celebrations, the streamlined train was named for Texas hero Sam Houston. On its original schedule, the train ran from the Texas and Pacific station in Fort Worth to Union Station in Houston in exactly five hours, making only four intermediate stops in Dallas, Waxahachie, Corsicana, and Teague. 
The train was designated number 3 southbound, and number 4 northbound. Its chief competitor was the "Sunbeam", operated by the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific) on a parallel route between Dallas and Houston. 
One of the original trainsets from the "Twin Cities Zephyr", number 9901, was transferred to begin this new route. While under the management of the Rock Island, "Zephyr" 9901 power car was destroyed by fire on December 19, 1944. The Rock Island did not maintain the train properly; the cause of the file was oil residue which poor maintenance failed to remove. Because equipment was needed to keep the busy line running, the Rock Island replaced its "Texas Rocket" with the new "Twin Star Rocket" in July 1945.
Like many other passenger trains that experienced declining revenues in the face of competition from automobiles and airplanes in the 1950s and 1960s, the "Sam Houston Zephyr" was discontinued in 1966.

The Farwell Building is a commercial building located at 1249 Griswold Street in Detroit, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
Description.
The Farwell Building is an eight-story rectangular building built of brick, and designed in the Chicago school architectural style. The front façade makes extensive use of glass, and includes both horizontal and vertical elements. A horizontal frieze crosses the façade at the entrance level, and a second frieze decorated with triglyphs and metopes adorns the second story. Ionic pilasters stand at the corners of the building and flanking the central entrance. Decorative iron grillwork is on the entrance transom, and the interior features a Tiffany mosaic ceiling, brass elevator doors, and marble walls.
History.
The Farwell Building is named for the estate of Jesse H. and Emmer J. Farwell. The building was completed in 1915 from plans made by architect Harrie W. Bonnah. The decorative (and structural) ironwork was made by the Russel Wheel and Foundry Company of Detroit.
In 1956, the Farwell was significantly altered: the original terra cotta cornice with Pewabic tiles was bricked over, and significant changes were made to the ground level façade. Higgins Management Company purchased the Farwell during the 1970s and renovated the building for office space. However, since 1984, the building has been completely vacant.
In October 2009, it was announced that the State of Michigan was in negotiations to buy the building from the current owners through the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. A final sale price (to be determined) of over $3 million USD has been announced (less past-due property taxes owed on the building).

The Bankstown Berries are a soccer club based in Bankstown, New South Wales. They were one of the first clubs formed in Sydney and competed in the first ever New South Wales State League as Canterbury FC, the club has also been known as Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic and West Sydney Berries; the "Berry" part of the name derives from Canter-"bury." Since that time, the club has enjoyed some years of success and also painful years of premiership droughts and grand final losses. The club played in the 1986 season of the National Soccer League.
The club currently plays in the NSW Super League, and Fivedock Dodgeball Tournament. After being relegated from the NSW Premier League in 2010. Bankstown Berries hosts matches at The Crest Reserve in Bass Hill, Sydney.
History.
In the 1950s, a group of influential disgruntled Pan-Hellenic (Sydney Olympic) members and supporters decided because of various disputes to leave and invest in a controlling stake in what was then known as Canterbury-Marrickville to form the basis of a 2nd big Greek soccer club in Sydney to be known as Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic Soccer Club.
In the mid-2000s the club had changed its name from Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic to West Sydney Berries to increase its appeal across South-western Sydney. It was the first time in the club's history club played without Canterbury in its name.
The club was chosen by Football NSW to be automatically promoted along with Macarthur Rams to the NSW Premier League for the 2008 NSWPL Season. The main reason for the club's inclusion was to strengthen football's presence in Western Sydney and also to have a starting post for a possible Western Sydney franchise in the A-League. The team had an unsuccessful return to the top-flight league in New South Wales. The team managed a lowly 10th place and narrowly escaped relegation from the NSW Premier League. In July 2008 the West Sydney Berries announced they had raised more than $ 32.000 for the Hospital at Westmead.
After finishing last in the 2010 NSW Premier League season the club was relegated to the NSW Super League for the 2011 season, and for the 2012 NSW Super League season will be now known as Bankstown Berries FC.
Johnny Warren, after whom Australian football's greatest prize, the Johnny Warren Medal is named is the best known personality of the history of the club. Alongside John Watkiss he participated in the World Cup 1974 in Germany. Graham Arnold, Charlie Yankos, goalkeeper Ron Corry, Peter Katholos, John Watkiss and Zlatko Arambasic are also Australian internationals who originated in the ranks of the club. Austrian legend, the former SK Rapid Wien player Leo Baumgartner belonged to the team with the Warren brothers, Watkiss and Corry that defeated Sydney FC Prague in the NSW grand-final of 1960 5-2.

Pleterje Charterhouse

Pleterje Charterhouse (; , also "Pleterjach", "Pletriach", or "Pleteriach") is a Carthusian monastery, or charterhouse, in the village of Drča near Šentjernej in Slovenia, the only extant monastery of that order in the country.
History.
First foundation.
The monastery, situated in a valley at the foot of the Gorjanci mountains, was founded in 1403 by Count Herman II of Celje, and its construction completed by 1407.
The Austrian mystic and theologian Nikolaus Kempf was prior here from 1447 to 1451 and again from 1462 to 1467.
In 1471 an Ottoman raid destroyed the buildings, which were reconstructed in a much stronger and more easily defensible manner.
After a long period of decline Archduke Ferdinand II of Inner Austria gave the monastery in 1595 to the Jesuits of Ljubljana. When the Jesuits were suppressed in 1772, Pleterje became state property. In 1839 it passed into private hands.
Second foundation.
In 1899 the Carthusians reacquired the site and began construction of a new monastery, which was completed five years later.
During World War II the charterhouse suffered severe damage when in 1943 it was set on fire by Communist partisans.
Present day.
The charterhouse has remained a Carthusian monastery to this day. The buildings date from the second foundation in the late 19th century, except for the Gothic church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which survives from the earlier monastery.
Produce.
The monks cultivate 30 hectares of land, mostly for fruit and honey, which they sell, and from which they also produce wine, fruit spirits (especially pear brandy), mead and beeswax candles.
Art collection.
The community at Pleterje are the owners of a significant collection of several dozen paintings, which for the sake of the peace of the community have been deposited on permanent loan for exhibition in a gallery in Kostanjevica na Krki. The paintings date from the 17th and 18th centuries, and are attributed to Flemish, French, Italian and German artists. They seem mostly to have reached Pleterje with refugee monks from Bosserville Charterhouse in Lorraine, who were given shelter in Pleterje in 1904.
Museums.
The monastery accommodates a display of items from the collections of the Dolenjska Museum of local history, and on part of its lands stands the Pleterje Charterhouse Open Air Museum of typical Slovenian buildings.

<doc id="18897198" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18897198" title="Toshima clan">
Toshima clan

The was a Japanese samurai clan prominent in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods of Japanese history in the northwest of what is today Tokyo. The clan was based primarily in Shakujii castle, in what is today Shakujii Park in the town of Shakujii, in Nerima-ku, until the fall of the castle in the late 1470s to Ogigayatsu Uesugi clan vassal Ōta Dōkan.
History.
The clan made its chief seat of governance in the area around the Hiratsuka Shrine in what is today the Nakazato area of Tokyo's North Ward ("Kita-ku"), and expanded their influence over the years to cover a much wider area, delegating much of it to branch families such as the Miyagi, Takinogawa, Shimura, and Itabashi clans. The Toshima obtained and moved into Shakujii towards the end of the Kamakura period (1185-1333).
The clan's power and lineage solidified over the 13th-14th centuries. Though a number of clan heads had no direct male heir, for roughly one century from 1282 to 1395 the clan was supported by the Miyagi clan, with whom the Toshima shared territory and intermarried. Miyagi Tamenori was the son of Miyagi Masanori and a daughter of Toshima Shigehiro; Tamenori would in turn father 11th clan head Toshima Munetomo.
Following the death of ninth clan head Toshima Yasukage, on account of the minority of his son Toshima Tomoyasu, Yasukage's brother Toshima Kagemura took over as clan head. He expanded and solidified the clan's control over the districts of Toshima, Adachi, Tama, Niiza and Kodama. Toshima-san Dōjō-ji, which would later become the chief clan temple of the Toshima, was established in 1372 in a location adjacent to Shakujii castle by Kagemura's adopted son, Toshima Terutoki. Terutoki's birth father, Hōjō Tokiyuki, was hidden and protected at Shakujii during the Nakasendai Rebellion (1335) by Toshima Kagemura; since Kagemura lacked a male heir, Terutoki was adopted to succeed him as clan head. He died in 1375, and when his son Toshima Kagenori died in turn, leaving no heir, the position of clan head passed to Toshima Munetomo; as described above, Munetomo was related to the Miyagi family, and was of a different branch of the Toshima clan from the previous clan heads.
Another temple strongly associated with the clan, Sanbō-ji, was established to the east of Shakujii castle in 1394. It is said to have been moved to its current location on the edge of Sanbō-ji Pond, one of two ponds which form the center of modern-day Shakujii Park, by Ōta Dōkan, following the destruction of the Toshima clan by his hand in the late 1470s.
Thirteenth clan head Toshima Noriyasu led the clan in siding with Uesugi Norimoto, general of Ashikaga Mochiuji's forces, during the 1417 rebellion of Uesugi Zenshū. In the political and military conflicts surrounding the Kyōtoku Incident (1454-1482), the Toshima clan at first supported Ashikaga Shigeuji, but later switched sides to support Uesugi Fusaaki and Uesugi Akisada of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan. During this time, Uesugi vassal Nagao Kageharu rebelled against the Uesugi clan and, along with the Ashikaga, sought to take control of the Kantō region. Toshima clan heads Toshima Yasutsune, lord of Shakujii and Nerima castles, and his brother Toshima Yasuaki, lord of Hiratsuka castle, sided with Kageharu, and were ultimately defeated by Uesugi vassal Ōta Dōkan, marking the demise of the clan.

Diane Yatauro

Diane Yatauro was an American politician affiliated with the Democratic party. She was formerly the representative of the 18th Legislative District in the County Legislature of Nassau County, New York, as well as the former Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature and the former Minority Leader of the Nassau County Legislature.
Background.
Diane grew up in the Soundview and Morris Park sections of the Bronx borough in New York City. Prior to starting a career in politics, Diane established herself as a businesswoman by serving as Second Vice President of Chase Manhattan Bank. She is also known as a noteworthy activist in the Long Island community by serving as Vice President of the Oyster Bay- East Norwich Boys and Girls Club, as well as a former board member of Portledge School. Diane has also taught religion at St. Rocco's Church in Glen Cove. Today, she maintains her strong ties with community through active membership at the Glen Cove Sons of Italy, Glen Cove Chamber of Commerce, the Junior League, and the North Shore Historical Museum.
Diane currently resides in Glen Cove, New York with her husband, Bernie. Together, they have two children: son Michael and daughter Noelle.
Political career.
Diane served 4 terms in the Nassau County Legislature, having been elected in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009. In 2008, Diane was sworn in as Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature and served in this role through 2009. When the Nassau County Democratic Party lost the majority in the 2009 election, Diane became the Minority Leader starting in 2010.
First term, 2004-2005.
In her first term, Yatauro pioneered the Collette Coyne Cancer Prevention Bill, which is designed to protect teens from the dangers of tanning salons. Diane appeared on several media outlets in the New York metropolitan area, which led to adoption of this bill in areas nationwide. For this effort, she was honored by the Collette Coyne Melanoma Awareness Campaign.
Legislator Yatauro also successfully co-sponsored the "Tobacco 19" law, which increased the smoking age to 19 in an effort to keep
cigarettes out of Nassau County high schools. Yatauro was also responsible for helping to push a living wage law, increasing the minimum wage for all employees of County hired contractors.
Second term, 2006-2007.
In her second term, Diane co-authored the environmental bond referendums, which guaranteed a $100 million environmental bond for the county in 2006(she was also a co-author in the referendum which secured a $50 environmental bond in 2004). After several decades of neglect, Yatauro was instrumental in addressing the environmental problems facing the residents of The Birches, a community within Locust Valley. By helping to pass legislation for a pump station in the area, sewage seepage is now prevented from seeping onto local streets.
Third term, 2008-2009.
After winning her 2007 election, with the Nassau Democrats still holding the majority, Judy Jacobs stepped down as Presiding Officer and Yatauro was sworn in as the Presiding Officer of the Legislative body. In her third term, Diane created three new committees within the legislature: Education, Aging, and Veterans. During this time, she also was vital in creating a property tax exemption for Cold War Veterans as well as supporting a "Green Procurement" incentive, which requires Nassau County to purchase environmentally safe products and services.
Fourth term, 2010-2012.
With the Nassau Democrats losing the majority, Diane was sworn in as the Minority Leader of the Legislative body. Legislator Yatauro continued her strong commitment to improving quality of life within her district, as well as maintaining a conservative stance on fiscal matters and remaining a community activist.
By the end of 2009, Yatauro secured Community Revitalization Funding for improvements to the 18th Legislative District’s parks, sidewalks, roadways and shopping areas. Because of her contribution to the Nassau Legislature, Diane was a proud recipient of the
2009 Long Island Business News Top Fifty Influential Women Award.
In April 2011, Yatauro announced that she would not seek re-election, to help on her daughter's acting aspirations. In January 2012, she officially vacated her post to Delia DeRiggi-Whitton, who was elected legislator of the 18th district.

<doc id="18897248" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18897248" title="Fallopian tube cancer">
Fallopian tube cancer

Primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC), often just tubal cancer, is a malignant neoplasm that originates from the fallopian tube.
Frequency.
Tubal cancer is thought to be a relatively rare primary cancer among women accounting for 1 to 2 percent of all gynecologic cancers, In the USA tubal cancer had an incidence of 0.41 per 100,000 women from 1998 to 2003. Demographic distribution is similar to ovarian cancer, and the highest incidence was found in white, non-Hispanic women and women aged 60–79. However, recent evidence suggests tubal cancer to be much more frequent .
Evidence is accumulating that individuals with mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are at higher risks for the development of PFTC.
Pathology.
The most common cancer type is the adenocarcinoma; in the largest series of 3,051 cases as reported by Stewart et al. 88% of cases fell into this category. According to them half of the cases were poorly differentiated, 89% unilateral, and the distribution showed a third each with local, regional, and distant extensions. Rarer forms of tubal neoplasm include the leiomyosarcoma, and the transitional cell carcinoma.
As the tumor is often enmeshed with the adjacent ovary it may be the pathologist and not the surgeon who will determine that the lesion is indeed tubal in origin.
Secondary tubal cancer usually originates from cancer of the ovaries, the endometrium, the GI tract, the peritoneum, and the breast.
Symptoms.
The internal location of the fallopian tubes makes it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. Symptoms are nonspecific and may consist of pain and vaginal discharge or bleeding. A pelvic mass may be detected on a routine gynecologic examination.
Vaginal discharge in fallopion tube carcinoma result from "intermittent hydrosalphinx" that is called as "hydrops tubae profluens".
Diagnosis.
A pelvic examination may detect an adnexal mass. A CA-125 blood test is a nonspecific test that tends to be elevated in patients with tubal cancer. More specific tests are a gynecologic ultrasound examination, a CT scan, or an MRI of the pelvis.
Occasionally, an early fallopian tube cancer may be detected serendipitously during pelvic surgery.
Treatment.
The initial approach to tubal cancer is generally surgical and similar to that of ovarian cancer. As the lesion will spread first to the adjacent uterus and ovary, a total abdominal hysterectomy is an essential part of this approach and removes the ovaries, the tubes, and the uterus with the cervix. Also, peritoneal washings are taken, the omentum is removed, and pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes are sampled. Staging at the time of surgery and pathological findings will determine further steps. In advanced cases when the cancer has spread to other organs and cannot be completely removed cytoreductive surgery is used to lessen the tumor burden for subsequent treatments. Surgical treatments are typically followed by adjuvant usually platinum-based chemotherapy.
Also radiation therapy has been applied with some success to patients with tubal cancer for palliative or curative indications
Staging.
FIGO staging is done at the time of surgery:
Prognosis.
Prognosis depends to a large degree on the stage of the condition. In 1991 it was reported that about half of the patients with advanced stage disease survived 5 years with a surgical approach followed by cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.
