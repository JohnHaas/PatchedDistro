Danny Malboeuf

Danny Malboeuf (born 1960) is a visual artist and musician from Statesville, North Carolina. As kolaboy he is a member of the breedArt collective and a Senior Member of deviantART, where four of his paintings have received the site’s top award. His musical project is Cowgirl in the Snow.
Art.
Danny Malboeuf is a self-trained artist/illustrator. Working mainly in acrylics, he paints in an allegorical figurative style that combines surrealist, symbolist and pre-Raphaelite sensibilities, often in conjunction with subtle pop-culture references. Malboeuf counts music and literature as his greatest sources of inspiration; specific artistic influences include the painters Arnold Boecklin, John Martin, Ferdinand Khnopff, and Leon Frédéric. While many of his paintings deal with mythological and religious themes, the frequent incorporation of sci-fi and pop-culture imagery from the artist's youth establishes tentative connections with movements such as pop surrealism. He has a strong bias towards painting female subjects, "perhaps because the essence of female is more poetic, and the male more prosaic." 
Malboeuf is represented by The Queen’s Gallery and Art Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the international Surreal Visionary Art Collective. In the past twenty years, his work has been exhibited in numerous solo and joint exhibitions, including one at the Huntington Museum of Art, and his paintings can now be found in private collections in Europe, America, Asia and Australia.
Malboeuf's outsider leanings and penchant for dark themes and forbidden mixtures can be disquieting or even controversial. “If you've never contemplated the odd, spellbinding paintings by Charlotte original Danny Malboeuf, now's your chance to catch up. An uneasy feeling mixed with awe at the artist's painterly skill is not unusual with these acrylics. "Holy Water" and "Consecration of St. Joan" both deliver a biting admixture of religion and sexuality.” Another critique reads "This artist's idiosyncratic slice of surrealism, dark and Gothic, is imbued with a strong dose of high-techno metallica in a strange quasi-religious vein that incites uneasy thoughts. If Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft rose from the dead and co-wrote a series of stories — and Max Ernst collaborated with Dante Gabriel Rossetti using Giger's "Alien" as a prototype to illustrate these collaborative tales — the result might resemble Malboueuf's series of images. [...] Malboeuf's intensely symbolic paintings do occasionally depict a sunnier mood, [...] but more common is a decaying, bittersweet morbidity — futuristic pre-Rapahelite paintings corrupted by the forces of the darkside. There's a repellent attraction to this work that's compelling."
Online, where he uses the screen-name "kolaboy", Malboeuf is a member of the breedArt collective; he also holds Senior Member status at deviantART, where his online gallery has had over 213 000 page-views and is subscribed to by some 2700 members. He is listed in deviantART's Top Artists directory and has four times won the site’s top "Daily Deviation" award, a recent win being accompanied by the editorial observation "One of dA's finest Surreal artists, "kolaboy" never ceases to amaze." 
Three of Malboeuf’s paintings have been published in "Mostro", an Italian-language literary/art journal, with one gracing the cover. His paintings have also been featured on the cover of "OLOGY" magazine, with the editorial comment "Speaking of things that are sweet, check out this issue’s cover artist, Danny Malboeuf. Take a good look, folks, because long after we are all dead, people will still be talking about his work." The same outlet has also showcased some of Malboeuf's writing. His artwork is featured on the cover of "Bandersnatch", a hardcover anthology of horror stories, as well as on the cover of the Ruby Vileos album "This is the Day". His painting "The Eternal" was featured in Web Digest Weekly. Three of his paintings are reproduced in the literary/arts journal "Antithesis Common". 
Malboeuf has also provided two invited pieces for the Pornsaints website; his art was included in their 2008 exhibition at A&D Gallery in central London, and their 2010 exhibition at the Birdhouse Gallery in Austin, Texas. "Firebird" was chosen to illustrate the exhibition review in the Austin Chronicle; as arts critic Wayne Brenner observed, "of the depictions of saintly pornstars are depictions of women. Which is fine by this (admittedly biased) reviewer ... especially when the artwork is as gorgeous as Danny Malboeuf's finely detailed and cyberpunky Firebird painting". Also in 2010, Malboeuf was described as "a Surrealist for our times" in a review for The 405, a music and culture magazine. The October 2010 issue of visual arts magazine "n-sphere" featured Malboeuf's art on the cover and in the lead article, accompanied by a 26-work exhibition in The Spheres guest gallery. A positive review of Malboeuf's Statesville exhibition in early 2014 noted the artist's reclusive nature and prolific output, estimated at 6000 paintings. On the academic front, Malboeuf's painting "Holy Water" is the subject of a Master's dissertation. Early in 2011, Malboeuf published an illustrated book, "Saestralle - A Tale of the North," which presents a poetic legend imagined in the Arctic region. He has since published other illustrated books which are suitable for young readers. 
Solo exhibitions
Music.
A singer/songwriter and instrumentalist, Malboeuf’s solo music project is Cowgirl in the Snow; it straddles the indie, twee, and shoegaze genres, releasing candy-coated dream pop songs in the spirit of Sarah Records and 4AD. Musical influences include Ultra Vivid Scene and The Records. A review reads: “Cowgirl in the Snow makes addictive lo-fi indie pop, with guitars drenched in effects … Twee pop at its finest.” Danny Malboeuf's brother is David, who is the musician D. M. Frankin Kane and his father was the bluegrass fiddler "Red" Tommy Malboeuf.

The village has an approximate population of 2,000.
The village belongs to one of the oldest rural settlements in the area, having been endowed by the king on a Polish knight, Dominik Pieniążek (see: Jan Chryzostom Pieniążek, from Odrowąż family(see Odrowąż coat of arms) in 1291. The village has long comprised what is now the villages of Kobylanka, Klęczany and other negligible adjacent areas, until those two became separate nobility's ("szlachta"'s) estates.
Unlike most of the neighbouring villages, which before the Operation Vistula (1940s) were largely inhabited by Rusyns' populations (recently called "Lemkos" to avoid inappropriate associating them with any Russian proveniences), throughout the history, Dominikowice and Kobylanka constituted almost homogenously Polish settlement.

Sandwich class

The sandwich class is an informal term used in Singapore and Hong Kong to refer to the middle class. 
Very generally, the sandwich class consists of lower-middle-class people who feel "squeezed" — although they are not poor, they are not able to achieve their aspirations as people with a higher income. 
In Hong Kong, this comprises families with an income of US$20,000–40,000 per year. Per capita income is typically around US$10,000 per year in Hong Kong, so this places them far above the average family in the territory. However, given very high real estate prices, it is nowhere near enough for them to afford a private residence. Hence, they are "sandwiched" between the large population who truly need public assistance, and the smaller amount of people who can afford private residences and other luxury goods.

Battle of Kokenhausen

The Battle of Kokenhausen (Kokenhuza, ) was a major battle opening the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611). It took place on the 23 June 1601 near Koknese in Livonia (now in Latvia). In the battle, Polish forces defeated the Swedish relief force and captured the besieging force, relieving the Polish garrison. The battle is notable as one of the greatest victories of the Polish hussars, who defeated their numerically superior Swedish adversaries.
Prelude.
Kokenhausen was one of three major forts blocking the Swedish progress on the line of the Daugava River river. Swedish forces of about 2,000 under Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm had been blockading the fortified town of Kokenhausen, located on Daugava River, between Riga and Daugavpils - since 10 March - after the arrival of Duke Charles with heavy artillery - laying a siege to it since 28 March. On 1 April the Swedes had taken the town but not the inner castle, which was still defended by a Polish garrison. Charles left about 2,600 strong besieging force, and moved north to Erlaa.
The Polish relief army of 800 men under Krzysztof Mikołaj "the Thunderbolt" Radziwiłł arrived around 11 May and in turn started to besiege the Swedes; it grew to over 4,000 with 16 cannons by mid-June. The Swedes decided to prioritize the relief of the Kokenhausen siege force. They have been reinforcing it with supplies through the river, but many of them have been captured by Poles on May 29. A major Swedish relief force of about 2,000 under Carl Gyllenhielm has been defeated at Erlaa by 1,000 Poles under Jan Siciński in early June. Emboldened by the victory, other Polish detachments captured some nearby strongholds and harassed the Swedish units. The Poles did not assault Kokenhausen, however, as they were waiting for more artillery, and were content to starve the Swedes out. The Swedes did not give up on securing the site, however, and reinforced to 5,000 the Swedes under Gyllenhielm arrived on the morning of 23 June at Kokenhausen and attempted to break the Polish encirclement.
Battle.
The field of battle was raised along its edge with the Daugava for some one and a half kilometers to a width of about half a kilometer with the side nearest the river being steep and falling more gently towards the field.
Gyllenhielm had about 900 infantry, 4000 cavalry and 17 cannons. Radziwiłł left about 500 infantry under Otto Denhoff with orders to maintain the siege, and took the field with the rest (around 3,000 men, of which some 400 were infantry, 1000 Polish hussars, and 9 cannons). In addition to Grand Lithuanian Hetman Radziwiłł, the Polish forces also included the Field Lithuanian Hetman, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz.
Polish cavalry first broke the Swedish left flank. The Swedish counterattack on the right flank, which while initially successful, was in turn broken by the Polish hussar counterattack. The Swedish infantry still held against the Polish cavalry, until being broken by the artillery fire. Gyllenhielm gathered some 2,000 cavalry but his troops refused to return to aid the infantry, and he was forced to retreat.
Aftermath.
The Poles lost about 200 men, the Swedes - 2,000 (including almost all of their infantry). After the battle, the Swedish force besieging the Kokenhausen castle, which took no part in the battle, surrendered to the Poles. Swedish siege artillery was also captured.
Both the hussar charges and artillery fire proved decisive in this engagement. The battle is notable as one of the greatest victories of the Polish hussars, who defeated their numerically superior Swedish adversaries.

Breast Cancer Network Australia

Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) is a not-for-profit organisation that supports Australians affected by breast cancer. Represented by the Pink Lady silhouette, BCNA informs, empowers, represents and links together women and families affected by breast cancer. The organisation is driven by women who have themselves experienced breast cancer and was launched in October, 1998.
BCNA provides many resources to support women and families affected by breast cancer. These include:
History.
In 1998, Lyn Swinburne envisaged an organisation that would positively influence the way breast cancer was considered in the community. Her goal was for people to talk openly about the disease and acknowledge its enormous personal impact.
Following a public meeting in every state and territory, over 300 women came together to discuss issues affecting women with breast cancer. An action plan was developed and formed the inaugural Making a Difference Report. The official launch of BCNA took place following this conference, at the inaugural Field of Women, a visual display of breast cancer statistics on the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra.
BCNA's aims included:
Lyn retired as CEO of BCNA in November 2011. Maxine Morand is currently CEO of the organisation.
BCNA continues to work towards helping women and their families access the best information, treatment, care and support, no matter who they are or where they live.
BCNA is one of a number of major breast cancer organisations in Australia. BCNA works co-operatively with the other national organisations including Cancer Australia, National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), McGrath Foundation and BreastScreen Australia.
Events & campaigns.
Key BCNA fundraising initiatives include the "Field of Women LIVE" events held in 2005 (MCG), 2007 (SCG) and 2010 (MCG). At the 2010 event, the most recent, 14,000 people in pink ponchos formed the Pink Lady silhouette, bringing the national cancer statistics to life in a sparkling display of strength and support.
The "Field of Women LIVE" events have now been adapted to be held in communitities across Australia every year. These events are called "Mini-Fields of Women". They centre around a visual display of 100 Pink Lady silhouettes planted in the ground or on display, and often include a simple ceremony. Personal messages are displayed on the silhouettes by family and friends.
In September 2010, AFL champion Shane Crawford embarked on a marathon walk from Adelaide to Melbourne, "That's What I'm Walkin' About". Crawford's efforts raised $500,000 for BCNA and he continues to support the organisation. Shane Crawford then raised more than $1.32 million for BCNA after riding 3,600 kilometres from Melbourne to Perth in 22 days on his marathon "Tour de Crawf" from 20 June - 11 July 2013.
Key annual BCNA fundraising and awareness campaigns include Pink Sports Day and the Bakers Delight Pink Bun campaign. The Pink Bun campaign is an annual fundraising campaign which sees every Bakers Delight bakery around Australia donate 100% of the sale of their Pink Finger Buns to BCNA. Each year Bakers Delight bakeries are decorated in pink during the campaign to show support for and to raise awareness for breast cancer and BCNA.

The Graduate College of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) was founded as the Division of Graduate Studies in 1964 by Nevada Southern University. Prior to 1969, UNLV was known as Nevada Southern University. It was not until 1972 that the Division of Graduate Studies would become the Graduate College as it is known today. 
As of 2006, the current Dean is Mr. Ronald Smith who also works as a professor of sociology in addition to his role as an administrator.
Academics.
The Graduate College offers an array of degree programs ranging from accounting to water resources management. However, in recent years, the Graduate College, like most institutions of higher education in Nevada, has faced a series of budget cuts. Due to the effects of these cutbacks, the Graduate College has had to roll back some of its programs, especially ones with low enrollment.

Georg Ludolf Dissen

Georg Ludolf Dissen (December 17, 1784 – September 21, 1837) was a German classical philologist who was a native of Groß Schneen, a village in the District of Göttingen.
He studied classical philology at the University of Göttingen, where one of his instructors was Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729-1812). After graduation he was a lecturer at Göttingen, and in 1812 relocated to the University of Marburg as an associate professor. The following year he returned to Göttingen, where he was a colleague to Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker (1784-1868), Ernst Karl Friedrich Wunderlich (1783-1816) and Karl Otfried Müller (1797-1840). In 1817 he was appointed "full professor", and in 1833 became a full member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.
Dissen was considered an excellent teacher, and was an important influence to the development of philologist Karl Lachmann (1793-1851). Among his written works were editions of Pindar (1830), Tibullus (1835) and the orations of Demosthenes (1837). In addition, he collaborated with Philipp August Böckh (1785-1867) on the latter's masterful edition of Pindar.

Bobrowniki, Lublin Voivodeship

Bobrowniki is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ryki, within Ryki County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It lies in northeastern corner of historic Lesser Poland, approximately south of Ryki and north-west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 610, and was officially a town from 1485 to 1869.
The history of Bobrowniki dates back to the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, when this area was under authority of a castellan from Sieciechow. At that time, the nearby Wieprz river was abundant with Eurasian beavers. These animals were regarded as royal property because of their precious furs and were protected from hunting by royal officials, known as bobrownicy (hence the name of the village). 
The first documented mention of Bobrowniki comes from 1375, when it was located near the eastern border of Poland. The village was frequently destroyed in the raids of the Lithuanians, Yotvingians, Tatars and Rusyns. This ended in the late 14th century, when, after the Union of Krewo, the raids ended, and in the second half of the 15th century, Stanislaw Tarlo, the owner of Bobrowniki, managed to convince King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk to grant Magdeburg rights to the village. It happened on July 24, 1485. Bobrowniki remained a small town, whose population reached its maximum in c. 1660, when it was almost 2,000. After that, Bobrowniki declined, and its population was decimated by cholera (1780–85), when 1,600 died. 
After the Partitions of Poland Bobrowniki, which had for centuries belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship, was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915 it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1840, Russian authorities built a fortress called Ivangorod, which later was renamed into Deblin. Around the fortress a new town quickly emerged, together with an important railroad hub. Bobrowniki declined even further, finally losing its town charter after the January Uprising. The village now has a Baroque church, and two cemeteries - Roman Catholic and Jewish, as well as a monument dedicated to the Home Army.

Richard Durante

Richard John Joseph Durante (born 17 August 1930 at New Westminster, British Columbia) was a Liberal Party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was a supervising principal by career.
In the 1968 general election, Tom Barnett was initially declared the winner of the Comox—Alberni riding over Durante by a three-vote margin. But the Liberals demanded a recount whose result gave Durante a nine-vote lead, therefore giving Durante the seat in Parliament. However, Barnett and his party's riding association filed a court challenge that concluded on 3 February 1969 when two British Columbia Supreme Court court judges ruled that twelve Canadian Forces members had voted despite being ineligible. The result was therefore invalidated. Durante was allowed to remain a member of the House of Commons for one additional week, to allow time for a possible appeal. The Liberals ultimately decided not to challenge the ruling, and Durante's seat was declared vacant.
This led to a by-election on 8 April 1969 which Barnett won against Durante, therefore cutting short the Liberal candidate's career in federal politics.

Jōmon Sugi

Jōmon Sugi is located on the north face of Miyanoura-dake, the highest peak on Yakushima, at an elevation of . Discovery of the tree in 1968 "sparked moves to protect the forests" of Yakushima and gave rise to the island's tourist industry, which comprises more than half of its economy.
Jōmon Sugi is accessible via the Kusugawa Hiking Path (east of Miyanoura) and the Arakawa Trail (starting at the Arakawa Dam), but requires a "four-to-five hour mountain hike" from the nearest road to reach. After the designation of Yakushima as a World Heritage Site in 1993, local officials restricted access to the tree to an observation deck built at a distance of from the tree.
The tree has a height of and a trunk circumference of . It has a volume of approximately , making it the largest conifer in Japan. Tree-ring dating conducted by Japanese scientists on the tree's branches indicated that Jōmon Sugi is at least 2,000 years old. In "Remarkable Trees of the World" (2002), arborist Thomas Pakenham describes Jōmon Sugi as "a grim titan of a tree, rising from the spongy ground more like rock than timber, his vast muscular arms extended above the tangle of young cedars and camphor trees".
In 2005, vandals stripped from the tree a piece of bark measuring about on each side.
In April 2009, Jōmon Sugi was partnered with Tāne Mahuta in New Zealand's Waipoua Forest.

King's Field IV

King's Field IV (released as "King's Field: The Ancient City" in North America) is the fourth game in the "King's Field" role-playing video game series. Like its predecessors, the game is played through first person view in a dark and mysterious, medieval fantasy setting.
The game was developed by the Japanese game development company From Software, and released October 4, 2001 in Japan, and March 25, 2002 in the U.S. On March 28, 2003, almost exactly a year after Agetec's release, UK based publisher Metro 3D released the PAL version, with some translation changes compared to the NTSC release. The game has only been released for the PlayStation 2 console.
Plot.
An accursed idol responsible for the destruction of an ancient race has resurfaced to wreak havoc once again among the kingdoms of man. You must return the idol to the Ancient City to break its curse, but monsters of unspeakable horror haunt the ruins. There is a palpable fear in the air of the Ancient City—even the monsters themselves fear the evil that has returned.
Treasures beyond imagination await the warrior bold enough to attempt the journey, strong enough to face the minions of death, and wise enough to follow the path that leads to the essence of light. Use your sword arm well to rid the land of a potent curse. Be aware that should the sword fail, you have the magical arts to serve you in your quest. Learn the proper time and place for each or you too shall be counted amongst those lost forever.
Naming of Characters in the Agetec Release.
Before the release of the game as "King's Field: The Ancient City" in North America, there were a number of fans of the series using what is now called a "Yahoo.com" "Group". Discussing possible plotlines, characterizations, and aspects of gameplay in the upcoming release, they caught the attention of an ASCII Entertainment employee ("left unnamed for reasons of privacy"). The group, known on the site as The Verdite Inn, collaborated on a community driven storyline based in the world of the first two North American releases. Out of respect for the group's opinions, imaginations, and support for the games, the names or usernames of the contributing members were used as the names of certain NPCs. 
These were sometimes associated with a role they had explored in The Verdite Inn site, such as the NPC "Lee Maynor". In the game, he is either found wounded near a giant spider, wishing to die, or already dead and possessed, and is, in fact, the only NPC in the game that can be killed with no negative effect. At The Verdite Inn, Lee Maynor (who allegedly suffered from arachnophobia) portrayed himself as the undead "Lord Darkman the Vampire". One of the first shopkeeper NPCs in the game, "David Bunch" is named after the only one of the Yahoo group admins to be made aware of the naming before the game's release. He kept the plans to honor the club secret until the day of the release, when a member found his character in-game and asked about it on the forum. His dialogue reflects some of his quotes from the website.
Many others, including Jamarc Neely, Duhrin Pathwarden, and Arx Angelos, are known to be derived from names of the users of the site. Ramirez Martin, also an NPC, is the webmaster of http://www.kings-field.com/.
Reception.
On release, "Famitsu" magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40.

Arc of Infinity

Arc of Infinity is the first serial of the 20th season in the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who", which was first broadcast in four twice-weekly parts from 3 January to 12 January 1983.
Plot.
On Gallifrey, the Doctor's home planet, a Time Lord traitor is at work, stealing the bio-data code of another Time Lord and killing a technician who stumbles across the crime. The traitor provides the bio-data to a creature known as the Renegade, which is composed of anti-matter and uses the bio-data to invade the TARDIS and then the Doctor's metabolism. His companion, Nyssa, helps him recover. The Renegade is shielded in this attempt by the Arc of Infinity, a curious curve between the dimensions containing quad radiation, which can shield anti-matter. The Doctor decides to head to Gallifrey to track down the supplier of his bio-data, conscious that unless the creature trying to cross universes is stopped, its incursion could cause a chain reaction fatal to our universe.
The High Council of the Time Lords is also taking the matter seriously and has decreed that the Doctor’s TARDIS should be recalled for the same reason. The Chancellery Guard under the over-zealous Commander Maxil seizes the Doctor and Nyssa. He stuns the Doctor to ensure his delivery to the High Council.
When the Doctor is brought before the High Council, the new Lord President, Borusa, is inscrutable, while Chancellor Thalia and Cardinal Zorac are openly hostile; only his old friend Councillor Hedin seems pleased to see him. The President stresses the gravity of the situation since the Renegade poses such a threat to the Universe, and the High Council has had no alternative but to issue a Warrant of Termination on the Doctor to ensure the Renegade can no longer bond with him. The Doctor is taken away protesting, sure his bio-data has been compromised and stolen from within the High Council. Fortunately an old friend, Damon, another technician in the records section, provides him with the proof he needs that a member of the High Council did indeed steal his bio-data extract. The Doctor is soon taken for execution, despite Nyssa’s attempts to save him, and placed in a dispersal chamber. Sentence is carried out.
The supposed death of the Doctor, however, has not solved the situation. Unbeknownst to the High Council, his mind has been taken into the Time Lord living repository of knowledge, the Matrix, while his body is hidden behind a force shield in the termination cubicle. The Renegade, who demands an opportunity to return to the Universe it once inhabited, contacts him. The truth of the aborted execution is discovered by the wily Castellan, who tells first Nyssa and Damon that the Doctor is alive; and then the High Council.
Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, the Doctor’s former companion Tegan Jovanka arrives looking for her cousin Colin Frazer. She is greeted by his friend Robin Stuart, who explains that Colin has disappeared while they were crashing in the crypt of the Frankendael mansion. When neither of them can persuade the police to take an interest, they decide to investigate the crypt themselves. They find a hypnotised Colin working for a curious birdlike creature, which is armed with a deadly weapon. They are rendered unconscious and their minds scanned, revealing to the Renegade, who has established its base in a TARDIS hidden at the Frankendael, that Tegan knows the Doctor. The Renegade uses Tegan as bait to force the Doctor to obey him, also releasing Colin from his slavery as a reward. The Doctor is returned to normal space on Gallifrey where he makes for the High Council Chamber. Lord President Borusa has fallen under suspicion of being a traitor because the Castellan reveals it was his codes that were used to transmit the bio-data. The truth, however, is that Councillor Hedin is the Time Lord in league with the Renegade. He is in awe of his master, the mighty Omega, first of the Time Lords and pioneer of time travel (see "The Three Doctors"). Hedin wishes to release Omega from his exile in a universe of anti-matter, not realising the great Time Lord has been driven mad by his years of solitary confinement. The Castellan kills Hedin, but this does not prevent Omega using the Arc of Infinity to seize total control of the Matrix and, therefore, the organisation of Gallifrey.
Fortunately the Doctor and Nyssa manage to slip away and return to the TARDIS. They use scant knowledge provided by Tegan to determine that Omega has established his base in Amsterdam on Earth, and head there immediately, desperately trying to find the Frankendael crypt she described. After a lengthy hunt they find the lair defended by the birdlike creature, the Ergon, and Nyssa disposes of it with its own matter-converter gun. They reach Omega’s TARDIS at the point at which both the ship is destroyed and Omega makes full transference to Earth using the Arc of Infinity. When he peels his decayed mask away, he reveals the features of the Doctor, whom he now perfectly resembles.
Omega heads off into Amsterdam with the Doctor and Nyssa in hot pursuit. Within a short time, the Doctor’s prediction of an unstable transfer begins to come true: Omega’s flesh decays and it is clear his new body is not permanent. When the Doctor and Nyssa catch up with him, it is a painful task for the Doctor to use the Ergon’s anti-matter converter on Omega, expelling him back to his own universe of anti-matter. The Time Lord High Council on Gallifrey detects the end of the threat. Once Tegan has checked on her cousin’s progress in hospital, she decides to rejoin the TARDIS crew, this time as a willing traveller.
Continuity.
Every story during Season 20 featured an adversary from the past. For this serial, it was Omega, who had faced the first three incarnations of the Doctor in the 10th anniversary story "The Three Doctors" (1973).
Tegan is the first companion to have rejoined the TARDIS crew after having departed.
This story's Castellan, played by Paul Jerrico, would return in "The Five Doctors". It is stated that the Doctor's execution in this story is only the second time in Time Lord history that the race has sentenced one of its own to death, the first being Morbius from "The Brain of Morbius". The Doctor's failure to return Romana to Gallifrey, as seen in "Warriors' Gate", and Leela's decision to remain behind at the end of "The Invasion of Time", are mentioned briefly. The Doctor isn't quite finished with Omega, as heard in the audio "Omega", which takes place shortly after this TV story.
Production.
The working titles for this story were "The Time of Neman" and "The Time of Omega". For Parts One and Two, the character of Omega was credited as "The Renegade" on the end credits. Colin Baker stated on "Doctor Who: The Colin Baker Years" video that John Nathan-Turner believed his performance was a little arch, and therefore gave him the nickname of Archie.
Substantial portions of the story were filmed on location in Amsterdam. This was only the second time the show had filmed outside of Britain. John Nathan-Turner hoped to repeat the success of the first story filmed overseas, "City of Death". Amsterdam was chosen both because the BBC had recently developed contacts there and because it was cheap to arrange travel and hotel accommodations.
Part One was broadcast on a Monday in contrast to the rest of this season's episodes, which were all transmitted on consecutive Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
Footage of the Fifth Doctor is used in the 2013 episode The Name of the Doctor.
Cast notes.
The story features a guest appearance by Michael Gough (who had previously played the Celestial Toymaker in the story of the same name). Leonard Sachs previously played Admiral Gaspard de Coligny in "The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve". Ian Collier previously played Stuart Hyde in "The Time Monster".
Colin Baker (who would later succeed Peter Davison as the Sixth Doctor) appeared in the serial as Commander Maxil. It was his performance in this role (which, according to Baker, producer John Nathan-Turner repeatedly told him to "tone down") that first brought him to the attention of the production office. Shortly after the production, the Assistant Floor Manager on the serial, Lynn Richards, invited Colin Baker to her wedding reception. Amongst the other guests were Ron Jones, Peter Davison, Sarah Sutton, Eric Saward, John Nathan-Turner and Gary Downie. Baker has said in a number of interviews that his entertaining form at the party directly led to his being cast as the Sixth Doctor the following year. Baker reprised the role of Maxil as an uncredited cameo in the 2006 Big Finish Productions audio play "".
Elspet Gray, who played Thalia, later played Hera in the audio play "Immortal Beloved". Her character's name is shared with the Greek Muse of comedy. At the Fifth Element convention in London in February 2010, Alastair Cumming (who played Colin Frazer) explained that he is not related to Fiona Cumming (director of the Fifth Doctor serials "Castrovalva", "Snakedance", "Enlightenment" and "Planet of Fire"), despite frequent reports that she is his mother.
Commercial releases.
In print.
A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in July 1983.
Home media.
"Arc of Infinity" was released on VHS in March 1994. A double-pack DVD featuring both "Time-Flight" and "Arc of Infinity" was released on 6 August 2007. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 108 on 20 February 2013.

Novo-Konyushenny Bridge

The Novo-Konyushenny Bridge (, literally "New Stables Bridge") is a bridge across the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It acts as an extension of the Stable Square.
History.
The first wooden bridge was built here in the 1880s to assist the construction of the Church of the Savior on Blood. During construction, the width of the bridge reached 115 meters (for comparison, the widest bridge in Saint Petersburg today, the Blue Bridge is 97.5 meters wide). When the cathedral was completed in 1907, the bridge remained in place and was named "Church of the Resurrection of Christ Bridge". After October Revolution in 1917, it was renamed to "bridge-overlap". 
In 1975, the new ferroconcrete bridge was built, and it was named "Grinevsky Bridge", after Ignacy Hryniewiecki - the assassin of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who threw the bomb into tzar's cart near the location of the modern bridge. In 1998 the bridge was renamed once again to its current name after the nearby Stable Square ("Konyushennaya" Square).

Constitution of Laos

Previous constitutions.
Laos' first, French-written and monarchical constitution was promulgated on May 11, 1947 and declared it to be an independent state within the French Union. The revised constitution of May 11, 1957 omitted reference to the French Union, though close educational, health and technical ties with the former colonial power persisted. The 1957 document was abrogated on December 3, 1975, when a communist People's Republic was proclaimed. 
Development of the 1991 constitution.
On August 14, 1991, sixteen years after the establishment of the LPDR, the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the country's highest legislative organ, adopted a constitution. Although the SPA had been charged with drafting a constitution in 1975, the task had low priority. It was not until the Third Party Congress that party Secretary General Kaysone stated that the LPRP should "urgently undertake the major task...of preparing a socialist constitution at an early date." Laotian press reports subsequently revealed that a constitutional drafting committee was working informally under the chairmanship of Politburo member Sisomphone Lovansai, a specialist in party organization, with the help of East German advisers. Despite the proclaimed urgency of the task, only on May 22, 1984, did the SPA Standing Committee formalize the appointment of Sisomphone to head a fifteen-person drafting committee.
Although the political institutions had functioned without a written constitution for fifteen years, the lack of a constitution created serious drawbacks for the country. International development agencies were reluctant to invest in Laos given the absence of a fixed, knowable law. Amnesty International, in a 1985 report on Laos, asserted that without a constitution or published penal and criminal codes, citizens were "effectively denied proper legal guarantees of their internationally recognized human rights." Even the party newspaper, Xieng Pasason (Voice of the People), commenting in June 1990 on the absence of a constitution and a general body of laws, acknowledged that "having no laws is... a source of injustice and violation, thus leading to a breakdown of social order and peace, the breeding of anarchy, and the lack of democracy."
Reasons for the leisurely pace of constitution drafting, unusually slow even for the plodding bureaucracy, were not readily apparent. Vietnam had adopted a revised constitution in 1980 and Cambodia in 1981, only two years after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge. According to some reports, progress in Laos had been blocked by differences within the Politburo over certain substantive clauses. Perhaps most important, the party leadership, accustomed to rule without question, may have assigned a low priority to producing a document that might eventually lead to challenging their authority, despite rhetoric to the contrary. Further, the public seemed not to care.
After the new SPA was elected in March 1989, it formally appointed a seventeen-member constitutional drafting committee. The National Radio of Laos reported that the drafting committee was working "under the close supervision of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee." Six members of the drafting committee were members of the Central Committee; two of these members also served on the SPA, which also had six members on the drafting committee.
In April 1990, after securing approval of its document from the LPRP Politburo and the Secretariat, the SPA finally made public the draft constitution. With its publication, the party Central Committee issued Directive Number 21, on April 30, 1990, calling for discussion of the draft, first among party and government officials and then among the public. The discussions, although orchestrated by party cadres, did not always please party authorities. An LPRP spokesman released a memo complaining that "people in many major towns" had dwelled too much on what the constitution had to say about the organization of the state. In June a member of the Central Committee cautioned against demonstrations to "demand a multiparty system" and warned that demonstrators would be arrested. Competing parties would not be tolerated, he asserted, adding that "our multi-ethnic Lao people have remained faithfully under the leadership of the LPRP." In a later pronouncement, he said that "the Party has proved to the people in the last 35 years that it is the only party that can take care of them" and he lectured that "too many parties invite division." A Central Committee directive, dated June 14, 1990, hinted at the quality of the public discussion, noting that "in many cases where people were convoked to a meeting, they were simply given question and answer sheets to study."
However, not all discussions of the draft constitution were perfunctory. Undoubtedly inspired by the examples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union—where the monopoly of power by communist parties had crumbled—a group of some forty government officials and intellectuals began criticizing the country's one-party system in a series of letters and meetings in April 1990. Organized in the unofficial "Social Democratic Club," the group called for a multiparty system in Laos. One member of the group, an assistant to the minister of science and technology, submitted a letter of resignation to Prime Minister Kaysone in which he labeled Laos a "communist monarchy" and a "dynasty of the Politburo" declaring that the country should "change into a multi-party system in order to bring democracy, freedom and prosperity to the people."
Criticism of the draft document gathered strength in the succeeding months; Laotian students in Paris, Prague, and Warsaw joined in the call for free elections. Criticism broadened as a group of young, educated party cadres associated with nonparty bureaucrats—many educated in France and Canada—targeted veteran party leaders. These groups charged that the new policies of the old guard were fostering corruption and increased social and economic inequality. It was not until October 1990 that the government finally cracked down on these calls for democratic reforms, with the arrest of several protesters, including a former vice minister in the State Planning Commission and a director in the Ministry of Justice who were sentenced to long prison terms in Houaphan.
Thus, although the constitution purports to guarantee freedom of speech and petition and its framers give lip service to the desirability of public discussion, the ruling party sent a clear message with these arrests that it will not tolerate challenges to its exclusive exercise of power. Veteran party leaders were clearly more impressed by the political models of Vietnam and China than by the examples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Although willing to experiment with economic liberalization, party leaders seemed determined to retain political domination—if they could—through a Leninist-style party.
Overview of the 1991 constitution.
The 1991 constitution, which contains elements of an earlier revolutionary orthodoxy, is clearly influenced by the economic and political liberalization within Laos, as well as by the dramatic changes in the socialist world and the international balance of forces. The constitution specifies the functions and powers of the various organs of government and defines the rights and duties of citizens. Several chapters prescribing the structure of the state define the function and powers of the National Assembly (the renamed SPA), the president, the government, the local administration, and the judicial system. The constitution has little to say, however, about the limitations on government. In foreign policy, the principles of peaceful coexistence are followed.
The constitution legally establishes a set of authorities that resemble the traditional differentiation among executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The delineation does not imitate any particular model (neither Vietnamese, nor Russian, nor French), but it pays respect to the idea of a basic blueprint of responsibilities lodged in designated institutions. There is room for evolution of government authority, but there are also specific boundaries.
Government outside Vientiane has developed an independence over the years, reflecting the exigencies of the Pathet Lao armed struggle and of economic self-reliance during the postwar socialist pitfalls. The constitution eliminated elected people's councils at the provincial and district level as "no more necessary," in an effort to fit the state apparatus to the needs of building and developing the regime under "the actual conditions of the country." Again, the will of the ruling party determines which road the administration follows in regard to local governance, but the constitution has left governors, mayors, and district and village chiefs free to "administer their regions and localities without any assistance from popularly elected bodies." The leading role of the party within the administration of the nation overall is illustrated by the fact that party Politburo members are found in state offices—the offices of the president of state, and prime minister, deputy prime ministers (two), chair of the National Assembly, minister of defense, and chair of the Party and State Inspection Board.
The first words of the Preamble refer to the "multi-ethnic Lao people," and frequent use of this term is made throughout the text, a clear rhetorical attempt to promote unity within an ethnically diverse society. The "key components" of the people are specified as workers, farmers, and intellectuals. The Preamble celebrates a revolution carried out "for more than 60 years" under the "correct leadership" of the ICP.
The dominant role played by the LPRP, however, is scarcely mentioned, and the constitution is almost silent about the party's functions and powers. One brief reference to the ruling party is made in Article 3, which states that the "rights of the multiethnic people to be the masters of the country are exercised and ensured through the functioning of the political system with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party as its leading nucleus."
Article 5 notes that the National Assembly and all other state organizations "function in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism." This stricture is a reference to the Marxist-Leninist principle, which calls for open discussion within a unit but prescribes that the minority must accede to the will of the majority, and lower echelons must obey the decisions of higher ones.
Article 7 calls upon mass organizations, such as the Lao Front for National Construction, the Federation of Trade Unions, the People's Revolutionary Youth Union, and the Federation of Women's Unions, to "unite and mobilize the people." The Lao Front for National Construction, the successor to the LPF, served as the political front for the party during the revolutionary struggle. As of mid-1994, its mandate is to mobilize political support and raise political consciousness for the party's goals among various organizations, ethnic groups, and social classes within society. Other mass organizations are assigned to pursue these goals among their target populations of workers, youths, and women.
The constitution proclaims that the state will respect the "principle of equality among ethnic tribes," which have the right to promote "their fine customs and culture." Further, the state is committed to upgrading the "socio-economy of all ethnic groups."
Regarding religion, the state "respects and protects all lawful activities of the Buddhists and of other religious followers." Buddhist monks and other clergy are reminded that the state encourages them to "participate in the activities which are beneficial to the country".
The chapter on the socioeconomic system does not mention the establishment of socialism, a principal goal of earlier dogma. Instead, the objective of economic policy is to transform the "natural economy into a goods economy." Private property appears to be assured by the statement that the "state protects the right of ownership," including the right of transfer and inheritance. The state is authorized to undertake such tasks as managing the economy, providing education, expanding public health, and caring for war veterans, the aging, and the sick. The constitution admonishes that "all organizations and citizens must protect the environment."
A chapter on the rights and obligations of citizens sets forth a cluster of well-known rights found in modern constitutions, including freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly. Women and men are proclaimed equal, and all citizens can vote at age eighteen and hold office at twenty-one. In return, citizens are obliged to respect the laws, pay taxes, and defend the country, which includes military service. In commenting on this chapter in 1990, Amnesty International, clearly concerned about past human rights abuses, criticized the document for what was not included. Amnesty International noted the absence of provisions for protecting the right to life, abolishing the death penalty, guaranteeing the inalienability of fundamental rights, prohibiting torture, safeguarding against arbitrary arrest and detention, protecting people deprived of their liberty, and providing for a fair trial. No safeguards exist to protect the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, and independence of the judiciary.
Laos is made up of provinces, municipalities, districts, and villages. The constitution gives no clear guidance on provincial and district responsibilities except to specify that the leaders at each echelon must ensure the implementation of the constitution and the law and must carry out decisions taken by a higher level. In spite of the party's inclination to centralize decision making, provinces and localities have enjoyed a surprising degree of autonomy in shaping social policy. This independence is partly due to limited resources and poor communications with Vientiane. But the central government has also encouraged direct contacts along the borders with China, Thailand, and Vietnam, and trading agreements with neighboring jurisdictions.

Stężyca is a village in Ryki County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Stężyca. It lies approximately west of Ryki and north-west of the regional capital Lublin.
The village has a population of 2,000, and is located in northeastern corner of the historic province of Lesser Poland. In the early Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stężyca was a major urban center of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, and the seat of a "powiat" (county). The village was first mentioned in the 12th century, for hundreds of centuries it was the center of the "Land of Stężyca" ("Ziemia Stężycka"). It was granted Magdeburg rights in 1330 from King Kazimierz Wielki, losing its town charter in 1875, as a punishment for January Uprising. Until the Partitions of Poland, Stężyca belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship, and from 1815 to 1918 it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland.
In the late Middle Ages, Stężyca was spelled as "Stanzitia" (1325–1327), "Stazicza" (1365), "Stanzicza" (1441), and "Sthezicza" (1569). The early settlement was founded near a Slavic gord, which guarded the Vistula river crossing. Its name probably comes from ancient Polish word "stężyć", which means "to strengthen". In the spring of 1575, after the escape of King Henryk Walezy, the town was the seat of the so-called "Stężyca Sejm" (May 12 - June 4, 1575). The village has a Gothic church of St. Martin (1434).

World population

The world population is the total number of living humans on Earth. As of today, it is estimated to number  billion by the United States Census Bureau (USCB).
The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12, 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations Population Fund, it reached this milestone on October 31, 2011.
The world population has continuously grown since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million. The fastest growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred briefly during the 1950s, and for longer during the 1960s and 1970s. The global growth rate peaked at 2.2% in 1963, and has declined to below 1.1% . Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million, and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million, while deaths number 56 million per year, and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.
The UN projects steadily declining population growth in the near future, with the global population expected to become between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. ---> UN Population Division estimates for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion; independent mathematical modeling supports the lower estimate. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources.
Population by region.
Six of Earth's seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale. Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.3 billion inhabitants accounting for 60.31% of the world population. The world's two most-populated countries alone, China and India, together constitute about 37% of the world's population. Africa is the second-most-populated continent, with around 1 billion people, or 15% of the world's population. Europe's 733 million people make up 12% of the world's population(as of 2012), while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 600 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 352 million (5%), and Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 35 million inhabitants (0.5%). Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population, based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.
History.
Antiquity and Middle Ages.
Until the development of agriculture around the 11th millennium BC, it is estimated that the world population stabilized at about three million people, who subsisted through hunting and foraging – a lifestyle that by its nature ensured a low population density. The total world population probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the invention of agriculture. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.
The plague which first emerged during the reign of Emperor Justinian caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between the 6th and 8th centuries AD. The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340. The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400; it took roughly 200 years for Europe's population to regain its 1340 level. China experienced a population decline from an estimated 123 million around 1200 to an estimated 65 million in 1393, which was presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions, famine and plague.
At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368, China's population was reported to be close to 60 million; toward the end of the dynasty in 1644, it may have approached 150 million. England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500. New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth. Since their introduction by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, maize and cassava have replaced traditional African crops as that continent’s most important staple food crops.
Pran Nath estimates that, around 300 BC, the population of India was between 100 million and 140 million; Kingsley Davis agrees with this figure. According to estimates made by the historian W. H. Moreland, the population of India in 1600 was around 100 million. Hence, from 300 BC to 1600, India's population was more or less stable.
The total population of the Americas in 1500 may have been between 50 and 100 million. The pre-Columbian North American population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million. Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90% of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza. Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity.
Modern era.
During the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829. Between 1700 and 1900, Europe’s population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million. Altogether, the areas of European settlement comprised 36% of the world's population in 1900.
Population growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of compulsory vaccination and improvements in medicine and sanitation. As living conditions and health care improved during the 19th century, the United Kingdom's population doubled every fifty years. By 1801, the population of England had grown to 8.3 million, and by 1901 it had reached 30.5 million; the population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006. The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920, exceeding 307 million in 2010.
The first half of the 20th century in Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of wars, famines and other disasters, each accompanied by large-scale population losses. Stephen J. Lee estimates that, by the end of World War II in 1945, the Russian population was about 90 million fewer than it could have been otherwise. In recent decades, Russia's population has declined significantly – from 148 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012 – but as of 2013 this decline appears to have halted.
Many countries in the developing world have experienced rapid population growth over the past century. China's population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953, and now stands at over 1.3 billion. The population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at about 125 million in 1750, reached 389 million in 1941; today, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.5 billion people. The population of Java increased from about five million in 1815 to more than 130 million in the early 21st century. Mexico's population grew from 13.6 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010. Between the 1920s and 2000s, Kenya's population grew from 2.9 million to 37 million.
Milestones by the billions.
It is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, seven billion in March 2012. The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.
According to current projections, the global population will reach eight billion by 2030, and will likely reach around nine billion by 2050. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion. Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the "low scenario", to "high scenarios" of 24.8 billion. One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau places them in July 1959 and April 1974. The United Nations did determine, and celebrate, the "Day of 5 Billion" on July 11, 1987, and the "Day of 6 Billion" on October 12, 1999. The "Day of 7 Billion" was declared by the Population Division of the United Nations to be October 31, 2011.
Global demographics.
As of 2012, the global sex ratio is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female. The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant gender imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations. Approximately 26.3% of the global population is aged under 15, while 65.9% is aged 15–64 and 7.9% is aged 65 or over. The global median age was 30.4 years in 2012, and is expected to rise to 37.9 years by 2050.
The global average life expectancy is 67.07 years, with women living an average of 69 years and men approximately 65 years. In 2010, the global fertility rate was estimated at 2.52 children per woman. In June 2012, British researchers calculated the total weight of Earth's human population as 287 million tonnes, with the average person weighing .
The nominal 2012 gross world product was estimated at US$71.83 trillion by the CIA, giving an annual global per capita figure of around US$10,000. Around 1.29 billion people (18.4% of the world population) live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than US$1.25 per day; approximately 925 million people (13.2%) are malnourished. 83% of the world's over-15s are considered literate. In June 2012, there were around 2.4 billion global Internet users, constituting 34.2% of the world population.
The Han Chinese are the world's largest single ethnic group, constituting over 19% of the global population in 2011. The world's most-spoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese (spoken by 12.44% of the world's population), Spanish (4.85%), English (4.83%), Arabic (3.25%) and Hindustani (2.68%). The world's largest religion is Christianity, whose adherents account for 33.35% of the global population; Islam is the second-largest religion, accounting for 22.43%, and Hinduism the third, accounting for 13.78%. In 2005, around 16% of the global population were reported to be non-religious.
Largest populations by country.
Approximately 4.144 billion people live in these ten countries, representing around % of the world's population as of October 2013.
Most densely populated countries.
The tables below list the world's most densely populated countries, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations.
Fluctuation.
Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. According to the United Nations, population growth on Earth's inhabited continents between 2000 to 2005 totalled:
During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. This increase was due to a number of factors, including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances, and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution.
In 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people), down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. According to data from the CIA's 2005–2006 World Factbooks, the world population increased by an average of 203,800 people every day in the mid-2000s.

Globally, the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.
In some countries, there is negative population growth (i.e. a net decrease in population over time), especially in Europe – this is mainly due to low fertility rates. During the 2010s, Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth, due to sub-replacement fertility rates.
In 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion. However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion. An alternative scenario is given by Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' "most likely scenario" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.
Projections.
Long-term global population growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the latter, the world population reached seven billion in March 2012, while the UN asserted that this occurred in late 2011. The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.
Average global birth rates are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics, wars and other mass catastrophes, or advances in medicine.
Population growth by region.
The table below shows historical and predicted regional population figures in millions. The availability of historical population figures varies by region.
"Note: in the table below, the figures for North America only refer to post-European contact settlers, and not native populations from before European settlement."
Mathematical approximations.
In 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025. The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people →demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance →accelerating growth of the carrying capacity →faster population growth →accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors →faster technological advance → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on. The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.
According to Sergei Kapitsa, the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:
where
Years for world population to double.
Using linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the following years (with two different starting points). Note how, during the 2nd millennium, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2025 it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.
Overpopulation.
Predictions of scarcity.
In his 1798 work "An Essay on the Principle of Population", as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers; the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. The essay was written to refute what Malthus called, the unattainable Utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet; presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised this argument in "The Population Bomb", predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s. The predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably Julian Lincoln Simon, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the Green Revolution, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%. The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents. However, neo-Malthusians point out that the energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels, in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers, oil-derived pesticides, and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation, and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure could potentially have global repercussions.
In May 2008, the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels, the increase of world oil prices to over $140 per barrel ($880/m3), global population growth, the effects of climate change, the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development, and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India. Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries. However, oil prices then fell sharply, and remained below $100/barrel until around 2010. Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines, but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages.
David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people; its population as of 2013 is over 310 million. In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, Professor John Beddington, warned that growing populations, falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a "perfect storm" by 2030. Beddington claimed that food reserves were at a fifty-year low, and that the world would require 50% more energy, food and water by 2030. According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the world will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people.
The observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, with 923 million undernourished in 2007, versus 832 million in 1995. The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion.
Environmental impacts.
A number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world's ecosystem, as well as straining humanity's ability to feed itself.
The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994, called the growth in human numbers "unprecedented", and stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution, were aggravated by the population expansion. Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.
At the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion, and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.
Population control.
Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's birth rate, by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, and religious reasons. The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy, with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.
The University of Nebraska publication "Green Illusions" argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that "Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet." The book "Fatal Misconception" by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.
Overpopulation as a myth.
Some scientists, religious commentators and public policy analysts have criticised predictions of overpopulation and attendant resource scarcity, with some describing overpopulation as a "myth". They argue that advances in agricultural, medical and industrial technology have allowed global economic productivity to keep pace with rising populations despite Malthusian predictions to the contrary, and point out that family sizes are naturally declining worldwide due to higher living standards and better economic opportunities for women. Some identify individual overconsumption as a greater threat to world resources than population growth.
Number of humans who have ever lived.
An estimate of the total number of humans who have ever lived was prepared by Carl Haub of the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau in 1995, and was subsequently updated in 2002 and 2011; the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion. Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required "selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period". Various estimates published in the first decade of the 21st century give figures ranging from approximately 100 billion to 115 billion.
Estimation methodologies.
An accurate estimate of the number of humans who have ever lived is difficult to produce for numerous reasons. Firstly, the set of specific characteristics that define a "human" is a matter of definition, and it is open to debate which members of early "Homo sapiens" and earlier or related species of "Homo" to include in the estimate (see also Sorites paradox). Even if the scientific community reached a broad consensus regarding which characteristics distinguished human beings, it would be nearly impossible to pinpoint the time of their first appearance to even the nearest millennium, due to the scarcity of fossil evidence. However, the very small size of the world population in prehistoric times (as compared to its current size) makes this uncertainty of limited importance.
More importantly, robust population data only exist for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service. Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.
Another critical factor for such an estimate is life expectancy, which depends significantly on infant mortality rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times. Haub's numbers suggest that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that "life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history".

Songza

Songza is a free music streaming and recommendation service for Internet users in North America. 
Stating that its playlists are made by music experts, the service recommends various playlists based on time of day and mood or activity. Songza offers playlists for activities such as waking up, working out, commuting, concentrating, unwinding, entertaining, and sleeping. Users can vote songs up or down, and the service will adapt to the user's personal music preferences. Users can find playlists not just based on artists, songs, or genres, but also based on themes, interests, and eras, such as "songs in Apple Commercials", "90s One-Hit Wonders", and "Music of Fashion Week". Songza is headquartered in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York City.
History.
Amie Street acquired Songza, a product created by Aza Raskin and Scott Robbin, in October 2008. In August 2010, Amie Street was sold to Amazon for an undisclosed amount. Shortly after this the co-founders, CEO, Elias Roman, COO, Peter Asbill, CPO, Elliott Breece, and CCO, Eric Davich refocused their efforts on Songza. The team discontinued the original version and relaunched a new alpha version of Songza, keeping nothing of the original product but the name.
Over the next year the founders experimented with various iterations, when the app originally launched in 2010 "it was like a pre-Turntable.fm. A function called Social Radio allowed users to be DJs for their friends" stated PandoDaily. This version of the app allowed it to be social and crowdsourced; the problem with it was that the service as it stood was not sufficiently differentiated from other services on the market and the quality of the crowd sourced playlists was low. Following a year of testing various iterations of the alpha version of the app, Songza relaunched in beta on iPhone and Android apps on September 13, 2011, armed with a team of 25 expert music curators.
In March 2012, Songza released its Music Concierge feature, on iPhone and the web. The concierge presents users with up to 6 situations based on time of day, with filters for whatever mood they might be in. For example, on a Wednesday morning a user might be presented with situations for "Waking Up", "Singing in the Shower", "Working Out" and so on. This feature was rolled out to iPad on June 7, 2012, during the first ten days following the iPad app launch, Songza saw over 1.15 million downloads. On June 12, 2012, Songza was listed as the top free app on iTunes for the iPad and the number two free app for the iPhone. Concierge was released on Android on July 10, 2012, and Android tablet on August 14, 2012. The app expanded to Canada on August 7, 2012 and became the #1 overall free app in Canada on August 13, 2012. Within the week of Microsoft's Build developer event in June 2013, Songza snuck in their official Windows 8 App 
Songza launched in Canada on August 7, 2012 and reached the one million download mark after 70 days.
Starting October 2013, Songza now inserts pop-up audio/video ads when initiating a playlist so is no longer "audio-ad free".

Waldemar VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Waldemar VI, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (1450 – Köthen, 1 November 1508), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen.
He was the eldest son of George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his second wife Sophie, possibly a member of the House of Hohnstein.
Life.
In 1471, his father concluded a succession contract with Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. Under the terms of this contract, George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, took over the government of half the principality of Anhalt-Köthen and became co-ruler with Adolf as "Mitherr." Shortly after, George renounced his rights in favor of Waldemar, who became the new co-ruler with Adolph I.
Adolph I died two years later, in 1473, and Waldemar then had to rule jointly with his half-brother and heir, Albert VI. The new Prince Albert died fifteen months later and was succeeded by his infant son Philip. Upon the death of Albert VI, two sons of Adolph I, Magnus and Adolph II, were included in the government of the principality.
During his lifetime, Waldemar also assumed the following titles: "Lord of Köthen" (in 1480), "Lord of Hoym" (in 1492), and "Lord of Burgscheidungen" (in 1496).
Philip died without issue in 1500 and Adolph I's sons formally renounced their rights to rule the principality eight years later. In consequence, Waldemar became the sole ruler of Anhalt-Köthen, but enjoyed this status for only a few months during the year 1508.
On his death, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Wolfgang.
Marriage and issue.
In Köthen on 24 January 1485 Waldemar married Margarete (b. Rudolstadt, 16 June 1464 - d. Köthen, 1 August 1539), daughter of Günther XXXVI, Count of Schwarzburg and Lord of Arnstedt. They had four children:

History.
As a result of the Partitions of Poland (1772-1795), the Galicia area and Krakow were attributed to the Habsburg Monarchy. Kocmyrzów was in the "Bezirkshauptmannschaft" (powiat?) of Krakow area when the post-office was opened in Austrian Galicia in 1878.

Maciejowice

Maciejowice is a village in Garwolin County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Maciejowice. It lies in northeastern corner of historic Lesser Poland, approximately south of Garwolin and south-east of Warsaw. The village has a population of 1,400, and used to be a town from 1507 until 1870. Its name comes from the Maciejowski family, which in the past owned Maciejowice.
For centuries Maciejowice was part of the Land of Stezyca, which belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1794, the Battle of Maciejowice took place near the village. In the early years of the Polish statehood, this part of the country was sparsely populated, due to proximity of the eastern border. First local village, mentioned in documents, is Kochow (one kilometer south of Maciejowice), which was founded in 1155. In the late 12th century, a Roman Catholic parish of Kochow was established, and in the 15th century, the area of the future Maciejowice was purchased by a local nobleman Kacper Maciejowski. The village remained in the hands of the Maciejowski family until the late 17th century.
In 1507, King Sigismund I the Old granted town charter to Maciejowice. The town itself was located in the area of the village of Ostrow. In 1557, King Zygmunt August granted several privileges to Maciejowice. The town at that time belonged to the Castellan of Sandomierz, Stanislaw Maciejowski, and with the royal permission, it was allowed to organize fairs. Furthermore, the construction of a defensive castle was initiated. Since the late 17th century Maciejowice belonged to several noble families, such as the Potocki family and the Zamoyski family. Until the Partitions of Poland, it remained in Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. 
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Zamoyski family opened here an Agricultural School, rebuilt the castle, and opened several enterprises. During the January Uprising, a local unit of Polish rebels under Colonel Walenty Lewandowski attacked a Russian unit located at Laskarzew (Jan. 28, 1863). In 1870, following many other locations of northern Lesser Poland, Maciejowice lost its town charter. 
In the summer 1915, heavy Russian-German fighting took place in the area of the village, and on August 13, 1920 (see Polish-Soviet War), a Red Army unit penetrated as far as a local village of Kobylnica. In September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, two large units of the Polish Army (13th Infantry Division and Wilenska Cavalry Brigade) evacuated eastwards on a wooden bridge at Przewoz. The bridge was destroyed on Sept. 9, 1939.

King's Field (series)

King's Field (キングスフィールド) is a role-playing video game series developed by From Software and localized into English by ASCII Entertainment (who later reformed into Agetec). It is known for its brooding atmosphere and cryptic, labyrinthine dungeons. Titles in this series have been released for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Microsoft Windows, and various mobile phone platforms.
"King's Field" was released for the PlayStation in Japan on December 16, 1994, 13 days after the PlayStation console itself went on sale. The game is fully 3D, first person perspective was groundbreaking among role-playing video games of the time and received significant critical acclaim.
The next two "King's Field" titles followed in quick succession: "King's Field II" on July 21, 1995 and "King's Field III" on June 21, 1996. "King's Field IV" was released several years later for the PlayStation 2 on October 4, 2001. A spiritual successor to the series, named "Demon's Souls", was released February 5, 2009 in Japan for the PlayStation 3, followed by "Dark Souls" for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC in September 22, 2011.
Games.
PlayStation.
The first game in the series, "King's Field", was released only in Japan. While it was not officially localized into English, a fan has written a full English translation patch.
In "King's Field", the player takes the role of Jean Alfred Forester. He is searching for his missing father, Hauser Forester, who disappeared along with his soldiers while exploring a dead king's underground graveyard. Shorter than the others in the series, "King's Field" includes five floors. The main aspects of gameplay consist of first-person battles, puzzle solving, and exploration.
After the success of the first game, "King's Field II" was also released in the United States, under the name "King's Field". In the sequel, the player takes the role of Alexander (アレフ　lit. Aleph/Alef) the lone survivor of a shipwreck who at the behest of King Alfred tries to fulfill his duty to find and retrieve a mysterious sword from the dangerous island of Melanat. 
In "King's Field III" (released in the US as "King's Field II"), the player takes the role of Prince Lyle Austin Forester (son of King Alfred) as he struggles to uncover the reasons behind his father’s sudden descent into madness and to restore peace to the suffering kingdom of Verdite.
This time around, a large portion of the game takes place above ground, but the main aspects of gameplay remain unchanged: first-person battles, puzzle solving and exploration.
Overall gameplay remained very similar to the other King’s Field games and entails first-person battles, puzzle solving and exploration. This installment is the largest of the first three and contains various tweaks to the game's user interface which streamline controls and gameplay.
PlayStation 2.
"King's Field IV" (released as "King's Field: The Ancient City" in the US) was the first game from the series released on the PlayStation 2 console. The entire game takes place within the Land of Disaster, where the forest folk once dwelled until an evil curse came upon the land. The player takes the role of Prince Devian of the Azalin Empire who has been given the task of returning the cause of the blight, the Idol of Sorrow, back to the cursed land. His journey follows the downfall of the Kingdom of Heladin and the exploits of Septiego the Sword Master who led an expedition of over 1000 men in a failed effort to return the cursed Idol.
PlayStation Portable.
"King's Field: Additional I" is the first game of the series released on the PlayStation Portable. It was only released in Japan and was never localized to English; however, the game came with a mini-instruction manual in both English and Chinese for grey import buyers. The "Additional" series uses a step-by-step style of gameplay, rather than free-roaming. 
"King's Field: Additional II", the sequel, also only found a Japanese release, and was never localized to English. It featured the ability to import the player's character from "Kings Field: Additional I", including all equipment and statistics.
Microsoft Windows.
"Sword of Moonlight: King's Field Making Tool" is a "King's Field" designing tool for the Microsoft Windows platform which was released in Japan. It lets the user construct free-standing "King's Field" games which may be played independently, without having Sword of Moonlight installed. It also contains a full remake of the first "King’s Field" game originally released on the PlayStation. A fan made full English translation is available as an unofficial patch.
Mobile phones.
"King's Field Mobile" is a KF title released in Japan but was available for purchase and download to anyone with a compatible cellular phone platform. It was followed by two sequels: "King's Field Mobile 2", and "King's Field EX".
Merchandise and other media.
To commemorate their 20th anniversary, From Software released the special collection package called the "King's Field Dark Side Box", which contained a reissue of the four "King's Field" games which had previously been released on the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, as well as an audio CD, a map of Verdite, and other bonuses.
Reception.
Critical reception for the series in general was extremely polarized in that people tended to either hate it or love it. Common criticisms include: slow moving player character, low number of game characters (NPCs), difficult gameplay, and muddy colors. Others often cite these very things as what they like about the series.
As opposed to other combat based RPGs, "King's Field" focuses more on exploration and a dark brooding ambiance. The slow character movement facilitates streaming data from the game disk which eliminates loading screens that plague most PlayStation titles. Fans say the lack of loading screens aid in becoming absorbed into the artistry of the title by removing constant reminders that "it's just a game".
Overview.
While the first three installments continued a single story, the fourth ("King's Field IV") begins a new story. All "King's Field" games share elements of game play and some common items. The Moonlight Sword has been a recurring element in every "King's Field" (as well as its spiritual successor Demon's Souls and its spiritual successor Dark Souls) title as well as items such as the Earth Herb and Antidote. 
In all "King's Field" releases, except for the PlayStation Portable titles, battles are fought in real time, and usually involve maneuvering to land blows using melee weapons as well as casting offensive ranged-magic spells.

Sergei Kamensky

Count Sergei Mikhailovich Kamensky (; November 5, 1771 – December 8, 1834) was a Russian infantry general who served in the Napoleonic wars.
Early life.
Sergei Kamensky was the son of Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky and brother of General Nikolai Kamensky (in military histories he is known as Kamensky-1 and his younger brother as Kamensky-2). Like many sons of nobles, he was enlisted as an infant in a regiment and received his education in a cadet school. 
Military career.
In 1789, he became a lieutenant colonel in the Ekaterinoslav Grenadier Regiment and participated in the Russo-Turkish War; in 1792-1794, he served in the Russo-Polish War and was wounded in the stomach at Praga, across the river from Warsaw. In 1797 he was promoted to colonel and in 1798 to major general, but he was disgraced by Paul I and discharged from the army in 1798. 
He returned to service after Paul's death in 1801 and was appointed commander of the Fanagoria Grenadier Regiment on August 31 of that year. He participated in the War of the Third Coalition and fought in Langeron’s column at Austerlitz, where he was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 1st Class; a historian of the battle says "Kamensky-1's brigade over-achieved in a very difficult situation... stands out for his rare example of initiative and effective intervention at a critical point in the battle." On June 27, 1806, he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the 12th Division. He joined the Army of Moldavia and participated in another Russo-Turkish War, in which he took part in actions at Brăila, Constanţa, Babadag, and Varna. In 1810, he served under his younger brother, General Nikolai Kamensky, and distinguished himself in the battle at Pazardzhik, for which he was promoted to general of infantry. He defeated the Turkish army at Shumla on August 4 and was awarded the Order of St. George (2nd Class). He commanded the Russian left wing in the battle of Batin in northern Bulgaria on September 7, 1810. In 1812, Kamensky commanded a corps in the army of General Alexander Tormasov and took part in the battles of Kobryn and Gorodechna. However, he had a falling-out with Tormasov and took a prolonged furlough late in the year. 
He was discharged from the army in 1822 and spent the rest of his life at Orel.
Personal life.
Kamensky was both famous and notorious as the owner of a serf theater that had been created by his father; he brought it to Orel, where he was cruel to his serfs but generous to the poor and "lived in unspeakable squalor."This short, fat, bald dandy, the owner of seven thousand souls, created an elaborate complex on Cathedral Square with residence, church, theater, and actors' dorms — housing altogether about four hundred people. Sparing no expense, Kamensky engaged a German ballet master; bought an acting couple and their six-year-old tap-dancing daughter for 250 souls; maintained a well-trained serf orchestra and horn band... In a regiment-like operation, actors took their meals standing up and were marched back and forth to the music of drum and horn. A jail cell was on hand for infractions. Kamensky closely monitored actresses and had them flogged for leaving their quarters at night, corresponding with officers, or even looking at spectators. He dictated stage gestures as if from a lexicon, had actors memorize lines without a prompter, and beat them between the acts when they fumbled.Though the theater was popular and influential, its expense eventually ruined Kamensky, whose cruelty to his serf actress Kuzmina inspired Alexander Herzen's story "The Thieving Magpie."

Implicit data collection

Implicit data collection is used in human computer interaction to gather data about the user in an implicit, non invasive way.
Overview.
The collection of user related data in human-computer interaction is used to adapt the computer interface to the end user. The data collected are used to build a user model. The user model is then used to help the application to filter the information for the end user. Such systems are useful in recommender applications, military applications (implicit stress detection) and others.
Channels for collecting data.
The system can record the user's explicit interaction and thus build an MPEG7 usage history log. Furthermore the system can use other channels to gather information about the user's emotional state. The following implicit channels have been used so far to get the affective state of the end user:
Emotional spaces.
The detected emotional value is usually described any of the two most popular notations:

The Pennsylvania Railroad's steam locomotive class D5 (formerly Class G, pre-1895) comprised eighteen lightweight 4-4-0 locomotives for light duty, maintenance-of-way and branch-line service, constructed at the railroad's own Altoona Works during 1870–1873.
They shared many parts with other standard classes, although less so with the heavy 4-4-0s on account of their lighter build; instead, they shared some components with 0-6-0 switcher classes F and H (later B1 and B2).
The Class G locomotives had a straight-topped boiler, unlike the wagon-top of the other 4-4-0 classes.

Alien abduction claimants

Alien abduction claimants (also called abductees and experiencers) are people who have claimed to have experienced the paranormal abduction phenomenon. The term "abduction phenomenon" describes claims of non-human creatures kidnapping individuals and temporarily removing them from familiar terrestrial surroundings. The abductors, usually interpreted as being extraterrestrial life forms, are said to subject experiencers to a forced medical examination that emphasizes the alleged experiencer's reproductive system.
The first alien abduction narrative to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. Since that time, the credibility and mental health of alleged experiencers has taken on great importance to those seeking to determine the veracity of the abduction claims. Mainstream academics and members of the skeptics movement generally doubt that the phenomenon occurs literally as reported, and have proposed a variety of alternate explanations. 
Such skeptics often argue that the phenomenon might be a modern-day folk myth or vivid dreams occurring in a state of sleep paralysis. On the contrary ufologists and paranormal researchers hold positions closer to the face-value of abduction claims. The discovery of common psychological traits shared by abductees would have the potential to determine a neurological explanation for the claims, while other commonalities or differences may serve to reinforce that the claims of the experiencers do in fact correspond with objective reality.
Overview.
As a category, abductees have some psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect. Dr. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to "mildly paranoid thinking," nightmares and having a weak sexual identity. According to Yvonne Smith, some alleged abductees test positive for lupus, despite not showing any symptoms.
Abductees and the paranormal.
Alleged abductees are seen by many pro-abduction researchers to have a higher incidence of non-abduction related paranormal events and abilities. Following an abduction experience, these paranormal abilities and occurrences sometimes seem to become more pronounced. According to investigator Benton Jamison, abduction experiencers who report UFO sightings that should have been, but are not, reported by independent corroborating witnesses often seem to "be 'psychic personalities' in the sense of Jan Ehrenwald."
Sometimes abductees experience the sensation of being both human and alien at the same time, a phenomenon Joe Nyman calls "dual reference." Dual reference emerges in hypnotic regression sessions wherein the subject reports pre-birth or pre-life existence as one of the same species as those he or she would later report abducting them. When presenting a paper on the subject to the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference several investigators in attendance accused him of leading his subjects in his hypnotic regression sessions, possibly encouraging them to confabulate. However, some of Nyman's subjects disagreed with the accusations and defended him.
Age demographics.
In a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, Jenny Randles found that in each of the four cases out of fifty total where the experiencer was over forty years of age or more, they were rejected by the aliens for "what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason." Randles concludes "he abduction is essentially a young person's experience." Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy. It could also be partially because people over the age of forty are less likely to have "hormonic" or reproductive activity going on.
Children as abductees.
Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common amongst child abduction claimants. 
Deborah Truncale, a pro-abduction researcher believes that the reports made by children should be taken similarly seriously to those made by adults. She notes several characteristic behaviors of children fictionalizing stories, such as pausing to think, attempting to anticipate the reaction of the listener, or trying to fake convincing eye contact. Truncale sees child abduction claimants as lacking these mannerisms, instead, she says, they can be described as "generally more animated children making up stories and speakquickly, [they recall an account without the behavior that involves...story telling." 
Some pro-abduction researchers feel that children do not include the image of the Grey-type alien as part of their "image bank," and consequently their reports are not likely derived from cultural depictions of UFO related phenomena. Budd Hopkins once investigated "several mask and novelty stores" for a commercially produced grey alien costume for children, but could not. He feels that this supports the hypothesis that children are not familiar with "greys." John Carpenter also believes that young children are not "contaminated" with cultural images of greys. He reports that a fellow investigator who is a school teacher requested her children to draw an alien, and that none of them drew a Grey-like being.
Children seem to react differently to their alleged abduction experiences than adult claimants. Many alleged adult experiencers report doubting their sanity or the veracity of what they believed happened to them. Children, by contrast, never seem to doubt that their experiences happened to them. For an adult, an abduction experience can challenge much of what they believe about the world. Children however, by virtue of being in a formative stage of development, more readily assimilate the experience into their developing worldview.
Many repeat-abductees report that, as children from the ages of 2-6, they would be visited by balls of light that would enter their room at night. These balls would seem to play games with children and fly around the room. Some have interpreted them as being a way for the alleged abductees to develop their psychic abilities the way a physical ball helps develop coordination and athletic abilities. As such these intangible orbs have been dubbed "psychic toys." Although these phantasms are alleged to have appeared regularly, no corroborating sightings from members of the abductees' families or others that may have been expected to see them have been reported.
Hopkins Image Recognition Test.
UFO and abduction researcher Budd Hopkins has designed an image recognition test (known as the Hopkins Image Recognition Test, or HIRT) for Children that he claims is helpful in verifying legitimate occurrences of alien abduction. There are ten different illustrated flash cards in the HIRT, nine of which depict "images from myth, from the real world, and from popular culture." The tenth image is the "grey" type entity commonly associated with claims of abduction. The images are drawn simply in black and white, featuring characters drawn in what Hopkins calls a "neutral and inexpressive" fashion. This is supposed to be a preventative measure intended to keep the images from affecting the child's responses on an emotional basis.
Procedure.
The test would be administered to two groups of about 10-12 children individually, one group being composed of children who are thought to be possible abduction experiencers, and a control group. Furthermore, the test consisted of three parts. The first portion test is treated as a flash-card type children's game where the administrator asks the child to identify the figure depicted on the card presented to them. Hopkins reports that when the allegedly abducted children encounter the Grey face, they frequently will respond by recounting a detailed abduction narrative containing elements extremely similar to those found in claims made by adults, he even recalls an instance where a child-claimant reported a "baby presentation" scenario. Parents have sometimes supposedly seemed disturbed by their children's responses to the "Gray" face. He says no child in the control group of any test session has recognized or attached significance to the "Grey" image.
During the second phase of the HIRT, the administrator asks each child to separate the flash cards into two piles, one pile for those depicting characters they like, and one for those depicting characters they dislike. As the child divides up the cards, the administrator asks for the child to explain the reasons they liked or disliked the characters on the cards. Hopkins says that abduction-candidate children usually file the alien head under the "dislike" category for "reasons we have come to expect." By contrast, control group children often file the alien head under the "like" category, because "they had no reason to dislike something they didn't recognize."
Stage three involves more active participation on the part of the children. The administrator will ask the child to make up a story about an imaginary encounter with the character depicted on it. This usually acts as a trigger for reporting an abduction account in the potential abductees if earlier tests had not elicited an explicit account of this type.
Criticism.
Hopkins' test has been criticized by abduction researcher David Gotlib, who felt that Hopkins's use of terminology in describing the test implied it had been evaluated and standardized in a scientifically rigorous way, when in fact it had not. Hopkins withdrew the offending statements. Psychologist Richard Boylan raised a similar objection to the way Hopkins had hyped the test. Boylan also voiced criticism of the test itself, noting that the grey face was "the only anomalous figure in the set," and that a "spooky narrative" in response to the image was to be expected. This, he said, was "obvious, but is not probative."
Prevalence.
Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are less common outside of English speaking countries, especially the United States.
The Roper Poll.
In 1991, Hopkins, Jacobs and sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum commissioned a Roper Poll in order to determine how many Americans might have experienced the abduction phenomenon. Of nearly 6,000 Americans, 119 answered in a way that Hopkins et al. interpreted as supporting their ET interpretation of the abduction phenomenon. Based on this figure, Hopkins estimated that nearly four million Americans might have been abducted by extraterrestrials. The poll results are available at this external link: Abduction by Aliens or Sleep Paralysis 
Criticism.
However, critics have argued that there were significant problems with the poll's methodology which should invalidate the results. Writing in "Skeptical Inquirer", psychologist Susan Blackmore notes that based on her analysis, "I conclude that the claim of the Roper Poll, that 3.7 million Americans have probably been abducted, is false."

Christopher Greene

Christopher Greene (May 12, 1737 – 1781) was a US legislator and soldier. He is best known for leading the spirited defense of Fort Mercer in the 1777 Battle of Red Bank, and for leading the African American 1st Rhode Island Regiment during the American Revolutionary War, most notably with distinction in the 1778 Battle of Rhode Island. He was killed in May 1781 by Loyalists, possibly because he was known to lead African American troops.
Home life.
Christopher Greene was born 12 May 1737 at Occupessatuxet, a village of the town of Warwick, Rhode Island, to Judge Phillip Greene and Elizabeth (Wickes) Greene. On May 6, 1757 Christopher married his third cousin Anna Lippitt, born November 15, 1735, the daughter of Jeremiah Lippitt and Welthian Greene, both descended from a distinguished Rhode Island colonial family, Jeremiah was the Town Clerk of Warwick, from June 1742 to his death in 1776, with the exception of the year 1775. He was a deputy to the General Assembly for four years, and Assistant five years. 
Christopher and Anna would have nine children together. When Greene's father died in 1761, Christopher inherited the family's mill estate and ran the business until he became an officer in the Continental Army. He served in the Rhode Island Legislature from 1772 to 1774. Greene was chosen a lieutenant of the Kentish Guards 1774.
Marching north in revolution.
In May 1775, he was appointed a major in the Army of Observation by the Rhode Island legislature. He was given command of a company and marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in support of the rebellion against British rule. In 1775 George Washington put him in charge of a Continental regiment in Cambridge under the command of Benedict Arnold. Greene's regiment was part of Arnold's expedition through present-day Maine to attack the British garrison at Quebec. In the assault on that city, Greene led a detachment of troops, and after Arnold was wounded Greene was taken prisoner. He was exchanged after eight months' confinement.
In New Jersey.
In June 1776, Greene was promoted to major under James M. Varnum, in a division which was commanded by his third cousin, General Nathanael Greene. In October he was promoted to colonel, with charge of Fort Mercer, New Jersey, on the Delaware River near the Gloucester County town of Red Bank (now National Park, New Jersey), south of Philadelphia and Trenton.
Fort Mercer and its Pennsylvania counterpart, Fort Mifflin, had the mission of defending the Delaware River against British naval movements on the river. After the British captured Philadelphia in September 1777, the forts prevented the Royal Navy from bringing supplies into the city.
On October 22, 1777, the fort was assaulted by the Hessians under Colonel Carl von Donop, in what came to be called the Battle of Red Bank. Von Donop was eager to avenge the 1776 defeat of Hessian troops by Washington in the Battle of Trenton. Though they were supported by gunfire from six British men-o-war in the Delaware River, they were repulsed with heavy loss, and von Donop was mortally wounded.
The Battle of Rhode Island.
Colonel Christopher Greene returned to the cooler climate of his home state. He struggled to piece together a unit of former slaves – the 1st Rhode Island. When the idea of offering slaves their freedom in return for active service was first suggested, all concerned believed the plan would help solve the problem of finding Continental recruits. The Rhode Island General Assembly voted that every able-bodied Negro, mulatto, and Indian slave could enlist for the duration of the war with bounties and wages the same as for free men. Once enlisted and approved by the regimental officers the slave would become absolutely free.
Unfortunately the small population of 3,331 blacks and Indians could not support the effort adequately. Fewer than two hundred soldiers were recruited. Finding the scheme expensive and impractical, the legislators reversed themselves. "No negroe, mulatto, nor Indian slave will be permitted to enlist in the Continental battalions after 10 June 1778." Greene and his officers proceeded to train the black infantrymen who had already signed on. All heard the news that a French fleet was on the way, and many were looking forward to some serious fighting in the near future.
Colonel Greene and his regiment were detached for special service in Rhode Island, and he was placed under the command of General John Sullivan. General Sullivan, whose headquarters were in Providence, was charged with the task of containing the depredations of the 4,000 British and Hessian troops occupying Newport on Aquidneck Island. For this purpose he had only a brigade of Rhode Island state troops, and several thousand as yet unmobilized militia. In early July 1778 orders from General Washington changed Sullivan's mission from defense to attack and thrust the quiet Rhode Island sector into the forefront of the war.
The Battle of Rhode Island commenced on August 29, 1778. Colonel Greene temporarily commanded a brigade in the center of the American order of battle. Greene's "Black Regiment", now under General Nathanael Greene's longtime friend, Maj. Samuel Ward, Jr, held the far right of the American line. This regiment served with distinction, praised by the allied French officers for repulsing attacks by Hessian soldiers. Even though the battle was tactically inconclusive, the Americans retreated off the island afterward.
Death and memorial.
Colonel Greene and several of his Negro soldiers died on May 13 or 14, 1781, when a group of Loyalists surrounded his headquarters on the Croton River in Westchester County, New York. From one account of the attack, "his body was found in the woods, about a mile distant from his tent, cut, and mangled in the most shocking way." A common conjecture is that this indignity was retribution for his leading black soldiers against the British Crown.
Congress voted Greene a sword, which in 1786 was presented to his son by Secretary of War Henry Knox. A monument to his memory was erected near Red Bank, New Jersey, in October 1829 by New Jersey and Pennsylvania volunteers.

Jean-Lesage generating station

The Jean-Lesage generating station, formerly known as Manic-2, is a dam located 22 km from Baie-Comeau built on Manicouagan River in Quebec, Canada. It was constructed between 1961 and 1967. On June 22, 2010, the dam and the generating station were renamed to honor former Quebec premier Jean Lesage, who was premier of Quebec during the construction of the complex.
Description.
Jean-Lesage is a gravity dam "hollow type" with a spillway made of concrete. The reservoir starts at the base of Manic-3. The dam is considered run-of-the-river and is fitted with eight Francis turbines, with a total capacity of 1145 megawatts.
Construction and commissioning.
Construction started on October 24, 1961. From June 2 to December 8, 1962, diversion tunnels were driven through the mountain to divert the river's flow around the construction site. The cofferdam that forced the water to use the diversion tunnels was completed on July 30, 1963, construction of the dam started the day after. By autumn 1965, the dam and powerhouse were sufficiently complete to put the first group of five turbines into service, the others were put in service at the end of construction. Commissioning was completed in 1967.
Tourism.
It is possible to visit the complex during summer between the end of June and start of September. The 90 minutes visit consists of a guided tour by Hydro-Quebec which lets the visitor enter cavities of the dam and see a turbine in action within the powerhouse.

Angophora floribunda

Angophora floribunda, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a common woodland and forest tree of the family Myrtaceae native to Eastern Australia. Reaching 30 m (100 ft) high, it is a large tree with fibrous bark and cream-white flowers that appear over the Austral summer. It grows on alluvial soils on floodplains and along watercourses. Much of the land it grew on has been cleared for agriculture.
Taxonomy.
The rough-barked apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as "Metrosideros floribunda", having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1794. It was growing from seed in Empress Josephine's arboretum at Malmaison by 1804, when Étienne Pierre Ventenat catalogued it in his "Jardin de la Malmaison". The species name is derived from the Latin "floribunda" "abundant flowers". Robert Sweet gave it its current name in 1830. Common names include rough-barked apple, apple box, rusty gum, gum myrtle and Boondah.
Genetic work has been published showing "Angophora" to be more closely related to "Eucalyptus" than "Corymbia", and in 2000 botanist Ian Brooker coined the name "Eucalyptus florida" for this species as "Eucalyptus floribunda" and "E. intermedia" had already been used for other eucalypts.
This tree hybridizes with "Angophora subvelutina". "Angophora inopina" from the vicinity of Wyee on the Central Coast of New South Wales is closely related and may be a dwarf form of "A. floribunda".
Description.
"Angophora floribunda" is a large, wide, spreading tree growing to a height of 30 m (100 ft). The trunk is often gnarled and crooked with fibrous grey bark. Like all members of the genus "Angophora", the dull- to glossy green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem. 5.5 to 15 cm (2.2–6 in) long and 1–5 cm (0.4–2 in) wide, they are lanceolate to ovate and attached to the stems by 0.6–1.5 cm (0.2–0.6 in) long petioles. The leaves in the western parts of the range are narrower than those in more coastal regions. The cream-white flowers appear from November to March.
It can be confused with "A. subvelutina", but the latter has leaves that are heart-shaped at their base and lacking petioles, arise from the stem.
Distribution and habitat.
The range is across eastern Australia, from Rolleston and Roma in central Queensland though eastern and central New South Wales and into eastern Victoria, where it is found at Mallacoota. It is found on alluvial soils, generally on shale or basalt soils. In open forest, it is associated with such trees as swamp she-oak ("Casuarina glauca"), white stringybark ("Eucalyptus globoidea"), blackbutt ("E. pilularis"), Blakelys red gum ("E. blakelyi"), forest red gum ("E. tereticornis"), brittle gum ("E. mannifera"), forest she-oak ("Allocasuarina torulosa"), grey gum ("E. punctata"), broad-leaved white mahogany ("E. umbra"), while in wetter forest, it grows alongside Sydney blue gum ("E. saligna") and closed forest alongside lillypilly ("Syzygium smithii"), cheese tree ("Glochidion ferdinandi"), Australian white birch ("Schizomeria ovata") and sandpaper fig ("Ficus coronata") and under emergent specimens of bangalay ("E. botryoides"), grey ironbark ("E. paniculata") and turpentine ("Syncarpia glomulifera").
Ecology.
The rough-barked apple regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds after bushfire. Trees live for more than a hundred years. The Grey-headed Flying Fox ("Pteropus poliocephalus") and Little Red Flying Fox ("P. scapulatus") eat the flowers, and the White-plumed Honeyeater ("Lichenostomus penicillatus") forages among the flowers. The tree is used as a nesting site by the rare Regent Honeyeater ("Xanthomyza phrygia"). The jewel beetle species "Curis caloptera", "Stigmodera andersoni", "S. terminatis" and "S. vigilans" also visit the flowers, the latter three species being fairly specific in their preference for "Angophora floribunda". The longhorn beetle species "Paroplites australis" and "Agrianome spinicollis" have been recorded from the rough-barked apple.
"Angophora floribunda" has been recorded as a host for several mistletoe species "Amyema bifurcata", "A. miquelii", "A. pendula", "Dendrophthoe curvata", "D. glabrescens", "D. vitellina", "Muellerina celastroides" and "M. eucalyptoides".
Cultivation.
This is a large plant generally unsuitable for any but the largest gardens.

In 1969 he started to compose film scores with his work in "La Lola, dicen que no duerme sola" directed by Jaime de Armiñán. He worked for film directors :Jaime de Armiñan, José Luis Borau, Juan Antonio Bardem, Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón and Fernando Colomo. Since the late eighties, Nieto's work has taken greater relevance, especially since he began working with Vicente Aranda in El Lute (1987), a film that would begin a long relationship with the director. José Nieto has also worked for Pilar Miro and Imanol Uribe, among others. 
He has been honored with numerous Goya Awards. Since the first edition of the Goya Awards, there has been much rivalry with Alberto Iglesias in the best score category. Until the twentieth edition (2005) they were matched with six awards each, but in the 2006 edition, Iglesias leads when he achieved its seventh award.

Lucius O'Brien, 13th Baron Inchiquin

Lucius (McEdward) O'Brien, 13th Baron Inchiquin (5 December 1800 – 22 March 1872), known as Sir Lucius O'Brien, 5th Baronet from 1837 to 1855, was an Irish politician and nobleman.
Biography.
He was born at Dromoland Castle in 1800, the eldest son of Sir Edward O'Brien, 4th Baronet and Charlotte Smith. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1825. In 1826, he replaced his father as Tory Member of Parliament for Clare, but was unseated in 1830 by the Whig candidates. He unsuccessfully contested the county again in 1835, but was appointed High Sheriff of Clare for that year instead. Upon the death of his father in 1837, he succeeded to the baronetcy, and he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Clare in 1843.
He again contested Clare in 1847, topping the poll and ousting Cornelius O'Brien. In 1848, he published a book, "Ireland in 1848: the late famine and the Poor Laws". During the same year, his brother William Smith O'Brien, a Liberal, led an abortive rebellion and narrowly escaped hanging. O'Brien did not contest Clare in 1852.
In 1855, he inherited the title of Baron Inchiquin from a distant cousin, the last Marquess of Thomond, although this was not confirmed until 1862. He was elected a representative peer for Ireland in 1863. He died in 1872 at Dromoland and was succeeded by his son Edward O'Brien, 14th Baron Inchiquin.
Family.
O'Brien Married Mary FitzGerald and together they had the following children;

Angelino Fons

Angelino Fons Fernández (6 March 1936 – 7 June 2011), was a Spanish film director and screenwriter. He is best known for his critically praised debut film "La busca" ("The Search") (1966). His career was closely linked to literature, adapting classic Spanish novels to the big screen.
Career.
Angelino Fons was born on 6 March 1936 in Madrid, just months before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. He grew up in Murcia and Orihuela, where he moved with his family in 1940. He studied at the Jesuit school of Santo Domingo in Orihuela, Alicante. He entered the University of Murcia to study Philosophy and Literature. Abandoning his studies at the University of Murcia, Fons returned to Madrid to be trained as a film director and entered the national film school (IIEC), graduating with a specialty in directing in 1960. Fons began his professional career with his graduation short film A este lado del muro ("This side of the wall") based on the novel "Las Afueras" ("The outskirts"s) written by Luis Goytisolo. His following project was the short " Garabato"
"Sketches" based on poems by Rafael Alberti. Fons worked as assistant director to Marco Ferreri in the classical comedy El cochecito (1960). Closely associated with Carlos Saura during that director first decade as a professional filmmaker, Fons collaborated on a number of Saura’s scripts during the early 1960s, receiving screen credits for "La Caza" (1966), "Peppermint Frappé" (1967) and "Stress Is Three" (1968), as well as Francisco Requeiros’ Amador (Lover) (1965). 
Fons made his own directorial debut in 1966 with" La Busca" ("The Search"), a modern day adaptation of a novel written by Pio Baroja, marked by a sense of critical realism reminiscent of Miguel Picazo’s La Tía Tula (Aunt Tula). The film was extremely well received and, as a result, Fons basked in critical adulation for a number of years as one of the most promising of the young filmmakers of the generation of film directors of the second half of the 1960s. "The Search" was followed two years later by the mediocre musical "Cantando à la Vida" (Singing to Life) (1968). 
In 1969, Fons began a collaboration with the producer, Emiliano Piedra, directing a weak adaptation of the Perez Galdós novel "Fortunata y Jacinta" (1969) with the producer’s wife Emma Penella, in the lead. This was followed by "La Primera Entrega" (The First Delivery) (1971), with even less favorable critical results. Fons directed another Perez Galdós adaptation the following year, "Marianella" (1972), but it was becoming increasingly apparent to critics and audiences that the promise shown in his first film had largely dissipated. Even a collaboration with Carmen Martí- Gaite, on an adaptation of one of her stories "Emilia... parada y fonda" (Emilia) (1976), scripted by the novelist herself, did little to alter the apparent downward course of Fon’s filmmaking career. By the early 1980s, Fons was directing cheap comic sexploitation films such as "The Cid cabreador" (The Vexing Cid) (1983). He retired as film director in the 1980s.
Afflicted with heart disease, he died on 7 June 2011 aged seventy five.

Netherwood Hughes

Netherwood "Ned" Hughes (12 June 1900 – 4 April 2009) was one of the last two Tommies who served the United Kingdom during the First World War, along with Harry Patch, although Patch is the only one to have seen action. Hughes was also one of three British veterans still living in the country, with Patch and Henry Allingham being the other two. The Ministry of Defence has not confirmed his war service, but many First World War service records were destroyed in the Blitz during the Second World War. However the World War I Veterans Association invited him to the Cenotaph for the 90th Anniversary of the Armistice. He did not attend as his family felt that the journey would be too much for him.
He was born in Great Harwood, the middle child of seven siblings to John, who worked as an optician, and Robina. He had three brothers: Charlie, Henry, and Sidney, who served in the Royal Navy on HMS Albion. Hughes spent most of his working life as a mechanic and driver and, in June 1918, he was called up, like every other driver in Great Britain, to perform that role in the British Army. While he was still in training the war ended, and he returned home to drive in a mill. He later became a bus driver. Hughes married twice, but never had any children, although he was frequently visited by his nephews at his care home, Woodlands Home for the Elderly in Clayton-le-Moors, where he spent most of his time in the grounds, smoking his pipe.
When receiving a birthday card from the Queen each year since his 100th birthday, he commented: "She has the same frock on".
In his final few weeks, Ned's health deteriorated and he had difficulty speaking for a week before his death, according to his niece, Ann Hutton. He died of natural causes on 4 April 2009, aged 108, at Woodlands. Speaking to the "Accrington Observer", Mrs Hutton said, "It’s not the family’s wishes for a military funeral.

Isaiah Blood

Isaiah Blood (February 13, 1810 Ballston, Saratoga County, New York – November 29, 1870) was an American farmer, manufactuter and politician from New York.
Life.
He was the son of Sylvester Blood, a farmer and scythe maker who enlarged his business by purchasing land next to the Kayaderosseras Creek in an area known as "The Hollow.” 
In 1831, Isaiah married Jane E. Gates of Ballston Spa and was given the choice of taking over the scythe shop or a retail store of which Sylvester was part owner. Isaiah chose the scythe shop and moved to The Hollow with his wife. Six years later he took over the business and began increasing production.
In 1851, Blood joined up with two other businessmen and built an axe factory a short distance downstream, and within a year became the sole owner. A fire burned down the enterprise, but Blood persevered and built a new factory even larger than the one that was lost. The Scythe Works also burned down in the 1850s and were rebuilt on a larger scale.
His organizational skills and ambition were applied in greatly expanding the production of both scythes and axes through the careful development of quality control processes. His tools became well known throughout the Western Hemisphere, and lumbermen were proud to have the name “I. Blood” stamped on their axes. In the American Civil War, Blood manufactured an order of battle-axes for a Massachusetts artillery company in the Union Army measuring two feet long (resembling a short, slightly curved sword).
His political inclinations were Democratic. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Saratoga Co., 1st D.) in 1852; and of the New York State Senate (15th D.) in 1860 and 1861. Governor Morgan appointed him a member of the war committee of Saratoga County to enlist recruits for the army during the Civil War. He was again a member of the State Senate in 1870, but died of typhoid fever on November 29. At the time of his death, he was also Supervisor of the Town of Milton, New York, a position he had held twice before, in 1847 and 1859. He is buried in Ballston Spa Village Cemetery.
Legacy.
His son-in-law Henry Knickerbacker assumed ownership of the works and operated it for 20 more years. In 1892 the business was sold to the American Axe & Tool Company. In 1901 both the axe and scythe works were destroyed in separate fires and not rebuilt. The hamlet of Bloodville, New York still bears his name today.

Wakwak

The Wakwak is a vampiric, bird-like creature in Philippine mythology. It is said to snatch humans at night as prey, similar to the "Manananggal" and the "Ekek" in rural areas of the Philippines, due to its ability to fly. The difference between the "Mananggal" and the "Wakwak" is that "Wakwak" cannot separate its torso from its body while the "Manananggal" can. Some believe it is also a form a vampire takes. Other people contend that a "Wakwak" is a Philippine night bird belonging to a witch.
The sound of a "Wakwak" is usually associated with the presence of an "Unglu" (vampire) or "Ungo" (ghost or monster). It is also believed that this monster is called "Wakwak" due to this sound it makes when it flaps its wings while flying. When one hears the "Wakwak", it is looking for possible victims. If the sound of the "Wakwak" is loud, it means it is far from you. Otherwise, it is near and worse yet, it is about to attack. It slashes and mutilates its victims and feeds on their hearts.
The "Wakwak" is often described by old folks to have long sharp talons and a pair of wings similar to those of a bat. It uses its talons or claws to slash its victims and to get their heart. Many say that its wings are also sharp as a knife.
The sound that a "tiki", "tike" or "teke" (Common House Gecko) makes usually at night when out of sight was discovered by an American who spent much time in the Philippines to be the source of the sound everyone was saying was a "Wakwak".
"A Dictionary of Cebuano Visaya" by John U. Wolff published by Cornell University, South East Asia Program and Linguistic Society of the Philippines 1972 defines Wak Wak as:
Also Wak-Wak in early Philippine history was the Kingdom of Wak-Wak along with the Kingdom of Zabag and were situated in Pampanga

The Bottle

"The Bottle" is a song by American soul artist Gil Scott-Heron and musician Brian Jackson, released in 1974 on Strata-East Records in the United States. It was later reissued during the mid-1980s on Champagne Records in the United Kingdom. "The Bottle" was written by Scott-Heron and produced by audio engineer Jose Williams, Jackson, and Scott-Heron. The song serves is a social commentary on alcohol abuse, and it features a Caribbean beat and notable flute solo by Jackson, with Scott-Heron playing keyboards. 
The song was issued as the first and only single for Scott-Heron's and Jackson's album "Winter in America" (1974). It became an underground and cult hit upon its release, and the single peaked at number 15 on the R&B Singles Chart. Cited by music critics as the album's best recording, the commercial success of "The Bottle" helped lead to Jackson's and Scott-Heron's next recording contract with Arista Records. Similar to other compositions by Scott-Heron, the song has been sampled extensively by hip hop artists.
Composition.
"The Bottle" is a social commentary on alcohol abuse with a Caribbean beat. Scott-Heron wrote it after seeing men line up every day in front of a liquor store called the Log Cabin, bringing back their empty bottles to get a discount on their next purchase. Scott-Heron said of his inspiration for the song in an interview for "Newsnight", "I discovered one of them was an ex-physician, who'd been busted for abortions on young girls. There was an air traffic controller in the military - one day he sent two jets crashing into a mountain. He left work that day and never went back."
The song also became a popular song played at parties at the time. French music critic Pierre Jean-Critin later described it as "an epic song ... whose infectious groove can still set dance floors alight over thirty years later." The song's pop/dance sensibilities and social message engendered its appeal to listeners following its release as a single. Scott-Heron later said of the single's success and style, "Pop music doesn't necessarily have to be shit." 
Cited by critics and music writers as "Winter in America"s best recording, "The Bottle" also addresses problems of drug addiction, abortion, and incarceration, while featuring Jackson on flute and Scott-Heron on keyboards. While its theme examines the plight of alcoholics and those who have to live with and cope with them, "The Bottle" became a concert favorite and one of Scott-Heron's most popular songs.
Release and reception.
"The Bottle" was released in 1974 as the only single for "Winter in America". The song became an underground and cult hit upon its release. Soon after, it also became one of Scott-Heron's most successful singles, as it reached the number 15 spot on the R&B Singles Chart. The single's success helped lead to Jackson's and Scott-Heron's next recording contract with Arista Records, where they would enjoy more commercial success. 
"The Bottle" has been cited by critics as "Winter in America"'s best recording. Paul J. MacArthur of the "Houston Press" called it a "strong anti-alcohol rant with a funky bass hook and chilly flute fills." Much like many of Scott-Heron's recordings, "The Bottle" has been sampled by several hip hop artists, including De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers. "The Bottle" was later ranked number 92 on "NME's" list of The Top 150 Singles of All-Time and was included in "Q" magazine's "1010 Songs You Must Own!" publication.

The village remains small, with a population of 590, mainly due to its isolation and poor farming environment. Nevertheless, Zelków is connected to Kraków by public transit (Bus 242) and minivans ("bus" in Polish).

Ramoceros

Ramoceros is an extinct genus of the artiodactyl family Antilocapridae endemic to Miocene and Pliocene North America.
Relatives and characteristics.
"Ramoceros" was a prehistoric relative of modern pronghorn ("Antilocapra americana"), which is a species of artiodactyl mammal indigenous to interior western and central North America; modern pronghorn are the second-fastest mammal in the world. The modern pronghorn weighs about , whereas the smaller "Ramoceros" generally weighed .
"Ramoceros" is one of several genera that originated from the subfamily Merycodontinae, of which the pronghorn is the only surviving remnant. In fact, pronghorn is the only surviving remnant of the entire family Antilocapridae.
The long forked horns of "Ramoceros" may have been used by rival males in competition. Like other antilocaprids, "Ramoceros" regrew their horns every year, forming new horns growing on bony centers. For that reason, many scientists believe they are more closely related to deer than to cattle.

Odontopteryx

Odontopteryx is a genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds or pelagornithids. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Species and taxonomy.
One species of "Odontopteryx" has been formally described, but several other named taxa of pseudotooth birds might belong here too. The type species Odontopteryx toliapica is known from the Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England) and slightly older rocks of the Ouled Abdoun Basin (Morocco). Its tarsometatarsus (e.g. specimen BMNH A4962) was for some time in the late 20th century believed to be from a giant procellariiform and called "Neptuniavis minor", but specimen BMNH A44096 – the holotype skull described by Richard Owen in 1873 – was the first pelagornithid recognized as such, and not assigned to some other seabird lineage. It was still often allied with Sulidae (boobies and gannets) or Diomedeidae (albatrosses), to which it is quite certainly not closely related.
One to five (or perhaps more) additional unnamed species are tentatively assigned to the present genus, mainly due to their size and/or forward-angled "teeth": one smaller and one larger than "O. toliapica" and also from the Late Paleocene or Early Eocene of the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco, one from the mid-Eocene of Uzbekistan, one from Middle Eocene strata of the Tepetate Formation from near El Cien (Baja California Sur, Mexico), and one from the Early Eocene of Virginia, USA. As regards the Moroccan fossils, however, the largest of the three "Odontopteryx"-like forms (initially called ""Odontopteryx" n. sp. 2") has provisionally been termed "Odontopteryx gigas" but may in fact be a "Dasornis", while the smallest (""Odontopteryx" n. sp. 1") has been considered a distinct genus (as "Odontoptila inexpectata") but that name is both a "nomen nudum" and would in any case be a junior homonym of the geometer moth genus "Odontoptila" and thus unavailable for the bird. Though the Mexican specimen (MHN-UABCS Te5/6–517, a distal humerus piece) agrees with "O. toliapica" in size and shape, it is not entirely clear whether the American forms belong in this otherwise Eurasian genus. It must be remembered, however, that at that their time the Isthmus of Panama had not been formed yet.
"Pseudodontornis tschulensis" from the Late Paleocene of Zhylga (Kazakhstan) is sometimes placed in "Odontopteryx", as is "Macrodontopteryx oweni" which was also found in the London Clay. In the latter case however, this does not seem to be correct (see below). The species originally described as "O. longirostris" was made the type species of "Pseudodontornis" in 1930. Small pelagornithid specimens have also been reported from the Early Oligocene Kishima Group and the Late Oligocene Ashiya Group of Japan, but their placement in "Odontopteryx" is even more uncertain.
""Neptuniavis" minor" was described from remains assigned to "O. toliapica" by Richard Lydekker in 1891. However, the supposed procellariiform genus "Neptunavis" is actually a pseudotooth bird too, and hence the smaller "species" is here synonymized as proposed by Lydekker. The type species ""N." miranda", on the other hand, is a junior synonym of the large "Dasornis emuinus". In a peculiar twist, some material assigned to ""N." minor" eventually turned out to be remains of the paleognath "Lithornis vulturinus"; the very first described bone of "Dasornis emuinus" on the other hand – a humerus piece – was at first mistaken for to be a "Lithornis" tarsometatarsus.
Description and systematics.
"O. toliapica" is among the smallest pseudotooth birds known to date – but this still means that to would have rivalled, if not exceeded, most living albatrosses in wingspan and the Brown Pelican ("Pelecanus occidentalis") in bulk. In life, its head (including the beak) would have been 20–25 cm (8–10 in) long. Unlike in most other pseudotooth birds, its "teeth" are slanted forwards.
Like those of its relatives, the thin-walled bones of "Odontopteryx" broke easily and thus very few fossils – though still far more than of the average pseudotooth bird genus – are decently preserved. In combination with its small (for pseudotooth birds) size, some traits allow to identify the present genus. It resembles "Dasornis" in having a jugal arch that is mid-sized, tapering and stout behind the orbital process of the prefrontal bone, unlike in the large Neogene "Osteodontornis". Also, its paroccipital process is much elongated back- and downwards, again like in "Dasornis" but unlike in "Pseudodontornis longirostris". Meanwhile, the distal humerus specimen from Mexico (MHN-UABCS Te5/6–517) which may or may not belongs in the present genus differs from the corresponding bone of "Osteodontornis" in a more narrow and less excavated surface between the external condyle and the ectepicondylar prominence, with the pit between these closer to the bone's end. Its quadrate bone, meanwhile, differed from that of "Osteodontornis" in a very broadly grooved dorsal head, a wide main shaft with a strongly curved lateral ridge and a small and somewhat forward-pointing orbital process. The forward center of the quadrate's ventral articulation ridge extends downwards and to the middle, and the pterygoid process is only slightly expanded to the upper center in "Odontopteryx". The socket for the quadratojugal is displaced downwards. The quadrate of "P. longirostris" is not very well preserved; it agees with "Odontopteryx" in a broad main shaft but is closer to "Osteodontornis" in the straight main shaft ridge and its upward-directed ventral articulation ridge's forward center. Its quadratojugal socket differs from both.
"Odontopteryx" differed from "Pelagornis" (a contemporary of "Osteodontornis") and agreed with "Dasornis" in having a deep and long handward-pointing pneumatic foramen in the fossa pneumotricipitalis of the humerus, a latissimus dorsi muscle attachment site on the humerus that consists of two distinct segments instead of a single long, and a large knob that extends along the ulna where the ligamentum collateralis ventralis attached. Further differences between "Odontopteryx" and "Pelagornis" are found in the tarsometatarsus: in the present genus, it lacks a deep fossa of the hallux' first metatarsal bone and its middle toe trochlea is conspicuously expanded forward. The salt glands inside the eye sockets were far less developed in "Odontopteryx" than in "Pelagornis". As the traits shared between "Odontopteryx" and "Dasornis" are probably plesiomorphic however, they cannot be used to argue for a closer relationship between the two Paleogene genera than either had with "Osteodontornis" and/or "Pelagornis".
But even though – due to the lack of better-preserved fossils – a close relationship between "Odontopteryx" and "Dasornis" cannot be excluded for sure either, it seems that the Neogene pseudotooth birds all derive from a large Paleogene form – such as "Dasornis" or (if it is not actually identical with "Pelagornis") the mysterious "P. longirostris" – and that the smallish lineage became entirely extinct before the Neogene (perhaps in the "Grande Coupure"). In 1891 "O. toliapica" was proposed as type genus of a family Odontopterygidae; recent authors generally place all pseudotooth birds in a single family. But if the evolutionary scenario outlined above is correct, the family name Pelagornithidae could be restricted to the giant lineage, and the Odontopterygidae reestablished as name for the smaller lineage. "Macrodontopteryx" was initially also included in the Odontopterygidae, but if not a distinct genus it is more likely a young individual of "Dasornis". The only smallish Neogene pseudotooth bird known as of 2009 is ""Pseudodontornis" stirtoni" from New Zealand, which was about the size of "O. toliapica". Its relationships are completely obscure.

Kayaderosseras

The Kayaderosseras Creek, usually shortened to Kaydeross, is the largest river that lies completely within Saratoga County, New York State. It originates in the northern part of the county, passes through the Town of Greenfield and the Town of Milton, and serves as the boundary between the City of Saratoga Springs and the Town of Malta before emptying into Saratoga Lake.
The Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois five nations utilized the Kayaderosseras Valley as a summer hunting and fishing destination. They named the creek Kayaderosseras (which translates into "Valley of the Crooked Stream") due to its tortuous course and dramatic drop in elevation. One source derives the name from the French, a
corruption of either "pay arrosé", a watered country, or "pay des ruisseaux", a
country of streams, adapted by the Mohawks when they pushed out the previous inhabitants, the Mahicans, in the 1600s. 
The creek is best known for providing water power to a host of paper mills and a hard edge tool factory in the 19th century. "Paper Bag King" George West established his paper bag empire on the banks of the Kayaderosseras Creek in Rock City Falls in 1862. Of the dozen paper mills situated along the creek in the late 19th century, only the Cottrell Paper Company survives today.
From 1898 to 1929, a small, 12 mile long electric trolley railroad closely followed the banks of the creek to serve the paper mills and the hard edge tool factory of Isaiah Blood. The Ballston Terminal Railroad was unique in that it was one of the few trolley railroads with the primary purpose of hauling freight.
Over-logging caused the flow of the creek to decrease dramatically in the late 19th century and early 20th century. However, today the creek possesses several popular fishing spots, especially in Rock City Falls, Milton Center, and Craneville.

Przyszowa

Przyszowa is a picturesque village in southern Poland, in the Limanowa County, within the province of Lesser Poland. It lies approximately south-east of the regional capital Kraków. The village has 2,470 inhabitants.
Etymology.
The village name Przyszowa is traditionally derived from the word "przychodzić" (come). It is believed that the founders of the village were Walachian shepherds, who came from the Southern Carpathians through the Dunajec valley.
History.
Przyszowa is one of the oldest villages in the Limanowa County. The earliest surviving documentary reference to the village dates from 1326. However, the ruins of the medieval Przyszowa Castle, atop the Łyżka (Wyżka) hill overlooking the village, are from a much earlier date, possibly 11th century. is believed that the castle originally belonged to the castellans of Nowy Sącz, and then to the Wierzbięta family of the noble Janina clan (most notable bearers of the Janina coat of arms include members of the House of Sobieski, including Jan III Sobieski King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania).
At the end of the 13th century, for unknown reason, the Wierzbięta family abandoned the castle and relocated into a new manor house in the centre of the village, where they ruled until the middle of the 17th century. In the second half of the 17th century part of the village belonged to the Dunin-Wąsowicz family of the Łabędź clan. In 1655 Krzysztof Dunin-Wąsowicz famously lead an army of local landlords and peasants to victory against a much larger Swedish garrison near Limanowa, during the Second Northern War between Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1683 the village was purchased by the Żuk-Skarszewski family of the Nałęcz clan after their family manor in Skarszowice in Podolia was destroyed by the Cossacks during the Polish–Cossack–Tatar War. The descendants of the Żuk-Skarszewski family continue to live in the village.
In 1880 Tytus Czyżewski was born here, one of the pioneers of modern Polish painting. In 1969 Jerzy Harasymowicz, a Polish poet, in his poetry collection "Madonny polskie" (Polish Madonnas), made famous the 14th-century Gothic statue of the Madonna of Przyszowa, as one of the finest examples of the so-called "spisko-sądecki" style.
Religion.
Jan Długosz, a Polish chronicler, confirms that a Roman Catholic parish existed in the village as early as 1326. Since then, the village was predominantly Catholic with a small Jewish minority, except for a brief period around the turn of 16th century, when the local nobility, including the owners of the village, the Wierzbieta family, converted to Arianism. In 1580 the parish priest was expelled from the village and the church gradually fell into disrepair and was eventually demolished. In 1612 the Wierzbieta family converted back to Catholicism and provided funds for the construction of a new wooden Church of St. Nicholas, which stood until the end of 19th century. In 1901–1906 a new Church of St. Nicholas was built in brick with stone dressings, to a design by the architect Teodor Talowski, which is a spectacular example of neo-Gothic architecture.
Culture.
Przyszowa is one of the largest centres of the culture of Lachy Sądeckie, an ethnographic group of Polish people characterised by a specific dialect and culture, living in the southern Lesser Poland. rich folk culture contains a variety of cultural elements from the highlands and the lowlands of Lesser Poland. The village is home to the regional ensemble "Przyszowianie", which focuses on the unique folk traditions of Lachy Sądeckie and performs live music and dance at folk festivals across the country.
Geography.
Przyszowa is located in the east part of Island Beskids mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. It lies in the valley between the three hills of Łyżka (one of the highest peaks in Island Beskids), Pępówka and Piekło. The centre of the village is located on both sides of the river Słomka, 420 – 500 meters above see level, while the Łyżka hill lies 807 meters above see level.
Climate.
Przyszowa has a typical mountain climate with variable weather conditions. Dry air masses from mainland Europe clash here with moist air from the Atlantic. A characteristic feature of the area is a frequent occurrence of sea fog over the valleys caused by temperature inversion. This makes only individual peaks visible, like islands in the sea, hence the name of the area Island Beskids. July is the hottest month of the year when average temperature reaches 27°C (81°F), while February, the coldest month of the year sees -12°C (10°F) of average low.
