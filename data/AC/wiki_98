XPath

XPath, the XML Path Language, is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document. In addition, XPath may be used to compute values (e.g., strings, numbers, or Boolean values) from the content of an XML document. XPath was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Overview.
The XPath language is based on a tree representation of the XML document, and provides the ability to navigate around the tree, selecting nodes by a variety of criteria. In popular use (though not in the official specification), an XPath expression is often referred to simply as "an XPath".
Originally motivated by a desire to provide a common syntax and behavior model between XPointer and XSLT, subsets of the XPath query language are used in other W3C specifications such as XML Schema, XForms and the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS).
XPath has been adopted by a number of XML processing libraries and tools, many of which also offer CSS Selectors, another W3C standard, as a simpler alternative to XPath.
Versions.
Two versions of XPath are currently in use. The current version of the language is 2.0, but version 1.0 is still more widely used.
Syntax and semantics (XPath 1.0).
The most important kind of expression in XPath is a "location path". A location path consists of a sequence of "location steps". Each location step has three components:
An XPath expression is evaluated with respect to a "context node". An Axis Specifier such as 'child' or 'descendant' specifies the direction to navigate from the context node. The node test and the predicate are used to filter the nodes specified by the axis specifier: For example the node test 'A' requires that all nodes navigated to must have label 'A'. A predicate can be used to specify that the selected nodes have certain properties, which are specified by XPath expressions themselves.
The XPath syntax comes in two flavours: the "abbreviated syntax", is more compact and allows XPaths to be written and read easily using intuitive and, in many cases, familiar characters and constructs. The "full syntax" is more verbose, but allows for more options to be specified, and is more descriptive if read carefully.
Abbreviated syntax.
The compact notation allows many defaults and abbreviations for common cases. Given source XML containing at least
the simplest XPath takes a form such as
which selects C elements that are children of B elements that are children of the A element that forms the outermost element of the XML document. The XPath syntax is designed to mimic URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and Unix-style file path syntax.
More complex expressions can be constructed by specifying an axis other than the default 'child' axis, a node test other than a simple name, or predicates, which can be written in square brackets after any step. For example, the expression
selects the first element ('codice_5'), that is a child ('codice_6') of a B element that itself is a child or other, deeper descendant ('codice_7') of an A element that is a child of the current context node (the expression does not begin with a 'codice_6'). If there are several suitable B elements in the document, this actually returns a set of all their first children. ("codice_9" returns just the first such node.)
Expanded syntax.
In the full, unabbreviated syntax, the two examples above would be written
Here, in each step of the XPath, the axis (e.g. codice_12 or codice_13) is explicitly specified, followed by codice_14 and then the node test, such as codice_15 or codice_16 in the examples above
Axis specifiers.
Axis specifiers indicate navigation direction within the tree representation of the XML document. The axes available are:
As an example of using the attribute axis in abbreviated syntax, codice_17 selects the attribute called codice_18 in codice_19 elements anywhere in the document tree.
The expression . (an abbreviation for self::node()) is most commonly used within a predicate to refer to the currently selected node.
For example, codice_20 selects an element called codice_21 in the current context, whose text content is codice_22.
Node tests.
Node tests may consist of specific node names or more general expressions. In the case of an XML document in which the namespace prefix codice_23 has been defined, codice_24 will find all the codice_25 elements in that namespace, and codice_26 will find all elements, regardless of local name, in that namespace.
Other node test formats are:
Predicates.
Predicates, written as expressions in square brackets, can be used to restrict a node-set to select only those nodes for which some condition is true. For example codice_32 will select those codice_19 elements (among the children of the context node) having an codice_18 attribute whose value is codice_35.
There is no limit to the number of predicates in a step, and they need not be confined to the last step in an XPath. They can also be nested to any depth. Paths specified in predicates begin at the context of the current step (i.e. that of the immediately preceding node test) and do not alter that context. All predicates must be satisfied for a match to occur.
When the value of the predicate is numeric, it is interpreted as a test on the position of the node. So codice_36 element child, while codice_37 selects the last.
In other cases, the value of the predicate is automatically converted to a boolean. When the predicate evaluates to a node-set, the result is true when the node-set is non-empty. Thus codice_38 selects those codice_39 elements that have an attribute named codice_40.
A more complex example: the expression codice_41 selects the value of the codice_42 attribute of the first codice_19 element among the children of the context node that has its codice_18 attribute set to codice_35, provided the document's codice_46 top-level element also has a codice_47 attribute set to codice_48. The reference to an attribute of the top-level element in the first predicate affects neither the context of other predicates nor that of the location step itself.
Predicate order is significant if predicates test the position of a node. Each predicate 'filters' a location step's selected node-set in turn. So <code>awill find a match only if the first codice_19 child of the context node satisfies the condition codice_50, while codice_51 will find the first codice_19 child that satisfies this condition.
Functions and operators.
XPath 1.0 defines four data types: node-sets (sets of nodes with no intrinsic order), strings, numbers and booleans.
The available operators are:
The function library includes:
Some of the more commonly useful functions are detailed below. For a complete description, see the W3C Recommendation document
Usage examples.
Expressions can be created inside predicates using the operators: codice_69 and codice_70. Boolean expressions may be combined with brackets codice_71 and the boolean operators codice_72 and codice_73 as well as the codice_74 function described above. Numeric calculations can use codice_75 and codice_76. Strings can consist of any Unicode characters.
codice_77 selects items whose price attribute is greater than twice the numeric value of their discount attribute.
Entire node-sets can be combined ('unioned') using the vertical bar character |. Node sets that meet one or more of several conditions can be found by combining the conditions inside a predicate with 'codice_73'.
codice_79 will return a single node-set consisting of all the codice_80 elements that have codice_40 or codice_82 child-elements, as well as all the codice_83 elements that have codice_84 child-elements, that were found in the current context.
Examples.
Given a sample XML document
The XPath expression
Selects name attributes for all projects, and
Selects all editions of all projects, and
Selects addresses of all English Wikimedia projects (text of all edition elements where language attribute is equal
to "English"). And the following
Selects addresses of all Wikipedias (text of all edition elements that exist under project element with a name
attribute of "Wikipedia")
Implementations.
The Java
package has been part of Java standard edition since Java 5. Technically this is an XPath API rather than an XPath implementation, and it allows the programmer the ability to select a specific implementation that conforms to the interface.
Use in schema languages.
XPath is increasingly used to express constraints in schema languages for XML.

Amber Sound FM

Amber Sound FM is a Community Radio station based in the Amber Valley, Derbyshire. It was awarded a five year community license by OFCOM in 2008 after several Restricted Service License broadcasts. Amber Sound said it would "encourage
local people, young and old, to become part of" the station. Chris Knight is now the Station Manager at Amber Sound FM.
History.
Local radio first appeared in Amber Valley in 1994 when Glyn Williams began Valley Radio. Backed by the local MP the station first broadcast from a railway carriage at the Midland Railway Centre (now Midland Railway - Butterley) in Ripley, Derbyshire. This was followed by three FM licences broadcast from office space located in Oxford St, Ripley.
Following the group's second broadcast, musical differences caused a split. Amber Sound FM was born and ran alongside Valley Radio. Ran by local DJ Chris Smelt and local businessman Alan Farrar, Amber Sound FM held two restricted service licences back in October 1995 and August 1996.
Both stations felt that Amber Valley was under served by other local stations in the area. The team went to work to give Amber Valley a station of its own. After an amount of radio activity in the area the 2 groups called it a day back in 1996 when it seemed the Radio Authority were not willing to grant licences in the area.
Meanwhile the first rounds of community licences had been awarded to stations around the UK when in 2006 another station 'Amber FM' popped up on the dial. This station ran by Eddie Fowler prompted Chris Knight to get interested again and Eddie and Chris reformed under the name of Amber Sound FM in 2007 and performed two further RSL broadcasts. During these broadcasts Glyn Williams joined the group and so all three radio groups were now united under one banner.
In late 2007 Ofcom the new licencing authority advertised for applicants for a new tier of community radio in the East Midlands.
Amber Sound FM applied for the licence and in May 2008 were awarded one. On the first Saturday of October 2008 the station began broadcasting. The first ever song to be played on Amber Sound was "Easy" by Commodores.
The station also ran a fortnightly show produced by local students of Mill Hill School, Ripley and Alfreton Grange, Alfreton. This was known as the "Teatime Takeover" and ran on Sundays from 17:00-19:00. The show ran for approximately 7 months.
The new station can be heard on 107.2FM in Amber Valley or online.
Listening audience has been independently measured at up to 24% of the 120,000 population

Cui Huan

Cui Huan (崔渙) (died January 14, 769) was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor briefly during the reign of Emperor Suzong -- although he was commissioned by Emperor Suzong's father Emperor Xuanzong, not Emperor Suzong.
Background.
It is not known when Cui Huan was born. His grandfather Cui Xuanwei was a chancellor during the reigns of Wu Zetian and her son Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and was a key figure in Emperor Zhongzong's restoration. Cui Huan's father Cui Qu (崔璩) served as a deputy minister during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong and was said to be a capable writer. Cui Huan had at least two brothers—an older brother named Cui Zhen (崔震) and a younger brother named Cui Bi (崔賁).
Cui Huan himself was said to be well-learned in the Confucian classics and rhetoric. He started his official service career as the civil service officer (司功參軍, "Sigong Canjun") at Bo Prefecture (亳州, roughly modern Bozhou, Anhui), and later served as "Simen Yuanwailang" (司門員外郎), a junior official at the ministry of justice. It was said that he did not flatter the chancellor Yang Guozhong and therefore was disliked by Yang. Yang thus had him sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the governor of Baxi Commandery (巴西, roughly modern Mianyang, Sichuan).
As chancellor.
In 755, the general An Lushan rose against Emperor Xuanzong's rule, and by summer 756, Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee Chang'an, toward Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng fled to Lingwu instead and was proclaimed emperor there (as Emperor Suzong), and he honored Emperor Xuanzong as "Taishang Huang" (retired emperor). Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong, unaware of this, was still exercising imperial authority, and on his way to Chengdu made Fang Guan a chancellor. As he went through Baxi Commandery, Cui Huan welcomed him. When Emperor Xuanzong conversed with Cui, he was impressed by Cui's talent and regretted not promoting him earlier. Fang also recommended Cui. Emperor Xuanzong thus made Cui "Menxia Shilang" (門下侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"), and chancellor "de facto" with the title "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). He had Cui accompany him to Chengdu.
Emperor Xuanzong soon heard that Emperor Suzong had taken the throne, and he recognized Emperor Suzong as the new emperor. He sent Cui and fellow chancellors Wei Jiansu and Fang to Lingwu to officially invest Emperor Suzong as emperor and gave them the imperial seal and the edict officially passing the throne. They encountered Emperor Suzong, who was then launching a counterattack, at Shunhua (順化, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), and they offered the seal and the edict to Emperor Suzong. Emperor Suzong declined, stating that with empire still in turmoil, it was not an appropriate time for him to officially take the throne, instead putting the seal and the edict aside and paying them daily respects, as they represented Emperor Xuanzong.
Meanwhile, because the empire was then in turmoil due to An Lushan's rebellion, the regular civil service process was not being carried out. Emperor Suzong sent Cui to the Yangtze River-Huai River region to select candidates for civil service, but Cui was not considered competent at this task. (Cui's biography in the "Book of Tang" claimed that Cui overly listened to his subordinates, who accepted bribes to recommend people, while his biography in the "New Book of Tang", which was less critical of him, claimed that he was willing to select people that he knew without fear that he would be accused of nepotism, but was nevertheless not very good at selecting candidates.) In fall 757, Emperor Suzong removed him from his chancellor position and made him the governor of Yuhang Commandery (餘杭, roughly modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), as well as the examiner and commander of the region east of the Yangtze.
After serving as chancellor.
At a later point, after Tang forces had recaptured Chang'an, Cui Huan was recalled to the capital to serve as deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, "Libu Shilang"). It was said that his life was simple and unambitious, and he was respected by others for this. He later served as chief imperial censor (御史大夫, "Yushi Daifu").
During the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, the chancellor Yuan Zai dominated the imperial government, in association with the eunuch Dong Xiu (董秀). Cui despised Yuan, and on an occasion, when he met with Emperor Daizong, he accused Yuan of being treacherous. Emperor Daizong, defending Yuan, stated:
Cui responded:
Emperor Daizong became silent and did not respond.
Meanwhile, Cui also served as special emissary for the collection of "Qingmiao" taxes (青苗, i.e., taxes imposed on newly grown crops), which were used for paying official salaries. It was said that because of requests from the lower officials, he used these taxes not only to pay the higher officials, but also the lower ones. Yuan's associate Zhang Qing (張青) argued that this was inappropriate, and Emperor Daizong had Cui investigated and interrogated. Cui had no response to the accusations and was demoted to be the prefect of Dao Prefecture (道州, in modern Yongzhou, Hunan). He died in 769 and was posthumously honored and given the posthumous name of Yuan (元, meaning "discerning").

Andrew Kötting

Andrew Kötting (born on 16 December 1959) is a British film director, writer and artist.
Life.
Kötting was born in Kent. He studied BA Fine Art at Ravensbourne College of Art and Design, London, 1984; MA in Mixed Media, Slade School of Art, London 1988. In 1989 he collaborated with Leila McMillan in setting up BadBLoOd & siBYL studios in the French Pyrenees. He is currently a teaching Professor in Video Arts Production at the University for the Creative Arts.
Films.
One of his first attempts at filmmaking, according to a "Premiere" profile, "involved inserting iron filings in the shape of religious icons into his penis and then drawing them out again". For his degree film, a short called "Klipperty Klop" (1986), Kötting ran round and round a Gloucestershire field pretending to ride a horse. 
Over the next ten years, Kötting directed a number of experimental shorts, often produced via the London Film-Makers Co-op. 
Kötting's first feature-length movie was "Gallivant" (1996). A "highly idiosyncratic" documentary, it records a journey the director took clockwise around the coast of Britain accompanied by his 85-year-old grandmother, Gladys, and his seven-year-old daughter Eden. Eden was born at Guy's Hospital, London, in 1988 with a rare genetic disorder – Joubert syndrome – causing cerebral vermis hypoplasia and several other neurological complications. The growing closeness between these two and the sense of impending mortality give the film its emotional underpinning. Gallivant was premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where it won the Channel 4 Best New Director prize.
Kötting's second feature, "This Filthy Earth" (2001), was loosely adapted from Émile Zola's novel "La Terre", the film is set in a rural community somewhere and sometime in the north of England. Kötting summed up his aim as "trying to show the landscape in its full beauty and brutality". Since then he has completed "Mapping Perception" (2002), a short 'science, film and art project' inspired by his daughter Eden. Kötting still sees himself as essentially a performance artist. "Even to this day," he says, "I wouldn't think of myself as a feature film-maker. I'm just making longer pieces of work."
Most recently Kötting has returned to working within the gallery context see his In the Wake of a Deadad . www.deadad.info a piece of work which led to his being shortlisted for the Derek Jarman Award 2008.
His most recent film is "Ivul", screened at the 53rd London Film Festival in 2009, is set in Switzerland and the Pyrenees. Alex Ivul (Jacob Auzanneau) is the boy in a family of three sisters, a Russian father (Jean-Luc Bideau) and mother (Aurelia Petit). Alex is close elder sis Freya (Adélaïde Leroux), who is about to leave for Russia. They play taboo games before she leave and when his father finds out he banishes him to the trees by declaring that he should not set foot on the floor again. Alex takes this command literally. In very brief terms, the core themes examine family relationships and his father's dynamic. The film was released through Artificial Eye in June 2010.
In July 2010, Kötting was one of two directors in residence at the La Rochelle International Film Festival in South West France, creating work and collaborating with the photographer artist Sebastian Edge, using his self-built camera in the 19th Century process and his [http://www.sebastianedge.co.uk/pdf/Sebastian%20Edge%20CV2010.pdf"Darkvan"], a Transit van Sebastian converted into a mobile darkroom.

The Spa witch trial took place in the city of Spa in present day Belgium, in 1616. It was one of the larger and more known of the witch trials in Belgium. It led to the execution of ten women, and possibly the death of another four.
Background.
On 31 January 1616, the authorities of Franchimont issued an investigation of sorcery. The reason was, that one wished to find a cause for a strange plague which had caused the death of both humans and animals. The authorities encouraged the public to report anyone suspicious, such as women gathering in the forest, anyone absent from work, and condemned those giving bread to the sick, in attempt to bewitch them, and husbands who suspected their wives of committing adultery with devils.
The trial.
The 3 February, Gielette Handchoule and Maroie Herodes was reported by a woman to be reputed witches. The husband of Herodes gave said that she had once felt very cold on return after having been absent, and that she had then felt very cold. A man reported Isabeau delle Court and Gelette Noel to be talked about as witches, and claimed that his horse had been sick after passing them. Several women were reported to the authorities in a similar way. Fourteen women were judged guilty and sentenced to death. The method of execution for witchcraft in Belgium was commonly garrotting and burning. This was a witch trial which seem to have been staged entirely by the authorities.
The accused of the trial.
Fourteen women were judged guilty on witchcraft. More women were put on trial, but some of them were declared innocent.
Of fourteen women, ten were executed. The remaining four were possibly killed in prison during torture.

Mannheim–Saarbrücken railway

The Mannheim–Saarbrücken railway is a main line railway from Ludwigshafen am Rhein to Saarbrücken. It was opened by the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company in 1847 and 1848 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. The section to Ludwigshafen to Homburg is now part of the network of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn.
An extension was opened in 1867 across the Rhine to Mannheim, which was not historically part of the Ludwig Railway, but since the building of a new Ludwigshafen Central Station in 1969 has effectively formed part of it.
Sections of the line have been redeveloped for a maximum speed of 200 km/h for the TGV services between Paris, Kaiserslautern, Mannheim and Frankfurt.
Route.
From Ludwigshafen to Schifferstadt the line runs directly toward the southwest, it then turns right and runs in a straight line until just before Neustadt-Böbig; it then leaves the Upper Rhine Plain and begins to climb the Haardt range. From there, it has the character of a mountain railway line.
After Neustadt an der Weinstraße it passes through the Palatinate Forest, running through 12 tunnels. First, it passes through the Wolfsberg Tunnel. After Lambrecht is the branch of the "Cuckoo Railway" ("Kuckucksbähnel"), which is a preserved railway running to Elmstein. Then, the line passes through more tunnels on the way to Kaiserslautern (Lichtensteiner-Kopf, Retschbach, Schoenberg-Langeck, Mainzer Berg, Gipp, Köpfle, Eisenkehl, Kehre, Schlossberg, Franzosenwoog and Heiligenberg tunnels). In the 33.5 km long section between Neustadt and Kaiserslautern the line climbs 109 metres.
A few kilometres west of Kaiserslautern, the line leaves the Palatinate Forest behind and runs almost straight through the West Palatinate lowland moor ("Westpfälzische Moorniederung") through Landstuhl to Homburg.
After Homburg the line divides into two branches: one runs as a branch over the original line of the Ludwig railway via Bexbach to Neunkirchen (now called the Homburg–Neunkirchen railway) and the other runs through Sankt Ingbert to Saarbrücken. A junction after Homburg connects to the Blies Valley Railway.
The line then passes the former Limbach-Altstadt station, which was a customs post on the 19th century border of Bavaria and Prussia. It then crosses the Blies river, winds through the St. Ingbert-Kirkel forest to the densely populated valley of Rohrbach and continues to its finish in Saarbrücken.
History.
Planning and Construction (1835-1850).
On 10 January 1838 a provisional company was formed to build a line from Rheinschanze (renamed Ludwigshafen in 1865) to Bexbach. On 30 March 1838, the "Bavarian railway company of the Palatinate-Rheinschanze-Bexbach Railway" ("Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft der Pfalz-Rheinschanz-Bexbacher Bahn") was formally established. In May 1844 the company was renamed the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company ("Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft").
The company was directed by Paul Camille von Denis, an important German railway pioneer. Work started at the end of March 1845. The line was intended primarily for the transport of Saarland coal from the Bexbach area (then part of Bavaria) to the port and commercial centre of Rheinschanze. It was named after the Bavarian King Ludwig I. It was also agreed that a branch line would be built from Schifferstadt to Speyer, then the capital of Bavarian Palatinate.
On 11 June 1847 the 29.33 km long section from Rheinschanze to Neustadt opened; on 1 July 1848 the Kaiserslautern–Homburg section opened and on 6 June 1849 the line was extended from Homburg to Bexbach. The Kaiserslautern–Frankenstein section was opened on 2 December 1848. The line to Bexbach via Homburg was completed on 25 August 1849 with the closing of the Neustadt–Frankenstein gap. Bexbach station is the oldest surviving railway station in the Saarland. The Homburg–Bexbach section today forms part of the Homburg–Neunkirchen line.
Further development (1850–1945).
In July 1856, the line was duplicated for its whole length between Ludwigshafen and Neunkirchen. On 7 May 1857 the Blies Valley line was opened from Homburg to Zweibrücken via Schwarzenacker. In 1866 and 1867, the Palatine Ludwig Railway line was rerouted over this line to Schwarzenacker and extended via Bierbach to St. Ingbert. On 25 February 1867, the Rhine bridge between Ludwigshafen and Mannheim was opened for rail operations.
On 15 October 1879 the line was completed by the Saarbrücken Railway between St. Ingbert and Saarbrücken and a new Station was inaugurated in St. Ingbert. The new link to Saarbrücken was shorter than the line via Neunkirchen. Because of the acute danger of collapse of the Hasseler tunnel between Niederwürzbach and St. Ingbert, a new line via Rohrbach with a new station in Hassel was opened on 1 September 1895. The junction with the line from Landau to Biebermühle (now Pirmasens Nord station), Zweibrücken and Saarbrücken (the Queich Valley Railway) was moved from St. Ingbert to Rohrbach.
A further shortening of the Ludwig Railway occurred on 1 January 1904 with the opening of the new line from Homburg to Rohrbach, now a suburb of St. Ingbert.
On 1 January 1909 the Palatinate Railway became part of the Bavarian State Railways. After World War I, the Saar Basin was administrated by the League of Nations. As a result, in 1920 the Homburg–Saarbrücken section came under the administration of the Saar Railways. The rest of the line became part of Deutsche Reichsbahn. With the inclusion of the Saarland in Germany in 1935, the Saarland part of the line was taken over by Deutsche Reichsbahn.
Developments since 1945.
After World War II the line between Homburg Saarbrücken returned to the administration of the Saar as part of the "Railways of the Saarland" ("Eisenbahnen des Saarlandes", EdS). The section east of Homburg became part of the "German Federal Railways" ("Deutsche Bundesbahn", DB). EdS was taken over by DB in 1957, following the inclusion of the Saarland in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Since the route had always been of great importance for long distance traffic, it was electrified in 1960. On 8 March 1960 the line could be run electrically between Saarbrücken and Homburg. The Homburg–Kaiserslautern section followed on 18 May 1961 and by 12 March 1964 the "Palatine Ludwig Railway" was electrified throughout. The electrification of the last section was delayed mainly because of the many tunnels between Kaiserslautern and Neustadt that had to be widened for it. The operation of trains was facilitated in May 1969 by the opening of the new Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof, which replaced the old terminus.
In December 2003, Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn trains began running between Kaiserslautern and Ludwigshafen. S-Bahn services were extended in 2006 to Homburg. With the introduction of S-Bahn operations the stations along the route were also upgraded and the platforms were raised to a height of 76 centimetres to provide level access to the class 425 railcars. The length of platforms between Ludwigshafen and Kaiserslautern was generally extended to 210 metres (140 metres at Neidenfels) and 140 metres west of Kaiserslautern. The former Weidenthal station was abandoned and a new station was built 800 metres closer to Frankenstein.
Development plans.
On 22 May 1992 the transport ministers of Germany and France agreed on the upgrading of the route from Paris to Eastern France to Southern Germany for high-speed trains (marketed as TGV POS trains, POS standing for "Paris-Ostfrankreich-Süddeutschland").
In May 1998, the Federal Government and Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) signed a financial agreement on the improvement of the line between Mannheim and Saarbrücken at a cost of 351.4 million Deutsche Mark for completion by 2004. In a first stage the track was upgraded for a top speed of 160 km/h for tilting trains. The infrastructure in the sections between St. Ingbert and Kirkel and between Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and Ludwigshafen was upgraded for 200 km/h and a bypass was built around Schifferstadt. The whole Kirkel–Kaiserslautern section can now be operated at 200 km/h. The clearance of the line for 160 km/h required ETCS Level 2 signaling, control and train protection be operational by the end of 2008, although this was delayed. ETCS operations are now controlled remotely from the Karlsruhe operations centre. The route through the Palatinate Forest between Neustadt and Kaiserslautern, including its many tunnels, remains unchanged structurally.
Operations.
Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn services (S1 and S2) operate from Ludwigshafen to Kaiserslautern every half-hour, with line S1 continuing hourly to Homburg. Regionalbahn (RB) trains to and from Kusel run between Landstuhl and Kaiserslautern. RB trains run every hour between Homburg and Saarbrücken and over the Saar Railway to Merzig and Trier. In addition Regional-Express (RE) run hourly between Kaiserslautern and Saarbrücken. Most trains are electric multiple units of class 425 or 426. Intercity-Express (ICE) and TGV 2N2 trains run between Frankfurt am Main, Mannheim, Saarbrücken and Paris and Intercity and ICE trains to and from Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. Two peak hour RE trains run between Mannheim and Saarbrücken.

The J2EE standard includes Servlet and JSP specifications to facilitate Web application construction and rollout. Although these specifications provide the basic infrastructure for creating Web applications, they do not establish the application design.
Creating the application execution architecture goes beyond creating a collection of common application services, such as data access, e-mail delivery or queue management objects. It must provide the base architecture for the applications, defining the tier structure and design templates used in each of them.

Dennis Grassow

Dennis Grassow (born 10 October 1971 in Berlin) is a retired German footballer who played as a defender.
Career.
Grassow was born and raised in Berlin, before moving to Munich the age of 16. He joined TSV 1860 München, where he made one appearance in the Bayernliga, before moving on to SpVgg Starnberg and later FC Starnberg. He began his senior career in 1993 with SpVgg Unterhaching, where he had four successful years, which earned him a move to FC Bayern Munich. 
He was unable to break into Bayern's first team, making only one appearance – in a DFB-Pokal game against DJK Waldberg, a match which Bayern won 16–1. After half a season he moved again, joining 1. FC Köln, where his arrival bolstered a struggling defence. He remained in Cologne for eighteen months, but the club was relegated at the end of the 1998–99 season, and he left, rejoining Unterhaching, who had since been promoted to the Bundesliga. The club spent two years in the Bundesliga, finishing 10th in their first season, but then suffered two consecutive relegations, falling to the third-tier Regionalliga in 2002. Grassow stayed with the club as they returned to the 2. Bundesliga, and consolidated their position, before leaving at the end of the 2003–04 season.
Grassow returned to the Regionalliga, playing for SV Darmstadt 98 for two years, before moving on to Bayernliga side SSV Jahn Regensburg in 2006. Here he was appointed captain by the coach Günter Güttler, as the side were promoted to the Regionalliga, which they followed with qualification for the new 3. Liga. After one season at this level, Grassow retired.

Yuri of Uglich

Yuri Vasilievich ("Юрий Васильевич") (30 October 1532 – 24 June 1563) of the House of Rurik, was Prince of Uglich, and the second son of Vasily III of Russia and Elena Glinskaya, as well as being the younger brother of Ivan the Terrible. He was born deaf mute, and was thus never considered to be a candidate as heir to the Russian throne.
He was a year and a half old when his father died of a leg abscess, and six when his mother was apparently poisoned. According to letters written by his older brother Ivan, the two children customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. Unlike his brother who spent his spare time in learning theology, Yuri was apparently only interested in food and games. Yuri accompanied his brother during the latter's coronation as Tsar, and was later given a private residence with servants. On 16 June 1552, during the Russo-Kazan war, Yuri was given full charge of state affairs while his brother accompanied the army to Kazan. Yuri was married in 1558 to Princess Ulyana of Palekh (Paletskaya) and had a son, Vasili, in 1559. The child died 11 months later.
Yuri died three years later from natural causes. His wife was sent to the Novodevichy Convent. Yuri's property was inherited by his elder brother.

A Waste of Shame

A Waste of Shame (aka A Waste of Shame: The Mystery of Shakespeare and His Sonnets) is a 90-minute television drama on the circumstances surrounding William Shakespeare's composition of his sonnets. It takes its title from the first line of Sonnet 129. It was first broadcast on BBC Four on 22 November 2005 as part of the supporting programming for the BBC's ShakespeaRe-Told season. 
Its screenplay was written by William Boyd and the film was directed by John McKay. Lines from the sonnets are presented as thoughts running through Shakespeare's mind.
Plot.
1609: Shakespeare is struggling to complete his sonnets while plague rages. He sees the body of a young child and remembers the moment in 1596 when he learned of the illness of his son Hamnet while rehearsing a play in London. Returning to Stratford-upon-Avon he was subjected to abuse from his shrewish wife Anne for neglecting them by living in the capital. His son died, and an embarrassing argument between his father John and Anne disrupted the funeral. John later told him that the family was in financial difficulties. William agreed to pay off the debt, but to do so he had to return to London. 
1597: Shakespeare receives a bag of money from Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, for writing the procreation sonnets, to encourage her son, the young William Herbert to marry. He meets the young aristocrat and becomes strangely attracted to him. Herbert says that he will meet Shakespeare again when he comes to London. 
Disturbed by his attraction to the youth, Shakespeare gets drunk in a brothel run by his friend George Wilkins. Wilkins tempts him with a new dusky-skinned "half caste" called Lucie, just come from France. Shakespeare has sex with her. 
At a performance of "Hamlet", Herbert and his young friends meet up with Shakespeare. They are keen to experience the seedy side of London life, so Shakespeare takes them to Wilkins' brothel. There they enjoy the pleasures on offer but Herbert is shocked to see Wilkins help some men to beat up one of the girls. Shakespeare tells him to ignore it and that the girl is being punished for giving a client syphilis. 
Shakespeare becomes increasingly close to Herbert and entranced by him, but discovers that his rival Ben Jonson is now one of Herbert's cronies. He also becomes more deeply involved with Lucie. Lucie tells him that she is leaving Wilkins. She now has her own place paid for by another client. She tells him that she likes him best. Later, he visits Herbert's house, but is brushed off by a servant. He realises that Herbert is avoiding him. He follows him and discovers that Lucie has become Herbert's mistress, and that he pays for her lodging. Embittered, he writes "Measure for Measure". 
He meets Herbert again at a performance of the play. He learns that Lucie has gone back to France. The two part awkwardly. 
A new outbreak of plague leads to the closure of the theatres. Shakespeare, Richard Burbage and William Kempe discuss the options for their acting troupe. However, Shakespeare starts to notice worrying signs of illness on his body. He returns to Stratford to get a diagnosis from John Hall and is told that he does not have the plague, but he does have syphilis. He writes up his sonnets for publication.

VII Fighter Command

The VII Fighter Command was a formation of the United States Army Air Forces. Its last assignment was with Far East Air Forces, based on Guam, Mariana Islands. It was inactivated after being redesignated the 46th Fighter Wing on 24 August 1948.
History.
The command was established in Hawaii in February 1942. From its inception until March 1945, the mission of the command was the air defense of the Hawaii Territory. Within ten days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the VII Interceptor Command consolidated all Hawaiian Islands defense units. In May 1942, the unit was redesignated the VII Fighter Command, constituting the fighter arm of Seventh Air Force, and its defensive responsibilities expanded to include Midway Island; Canton Island Airfield in the Phoenix Islands and Christmas Island Airfield in the Line Islands.
It's assigned units were deployed to forward bases in the Central Pacific Area in rotational deployments. During the assault on the Marshall Islands by Seventh Air Force bombers that began in late 1943, VII Fighter Command pioneered the use of long range fighter escort in the Pacific theater. B-25 Mitchell medium bombers attacking the island chain were being harassed by Japanese fighters who would begin their attacks after the bombing run and break off at the point they estimated to be the maximum range of Seventh Air Force fighters. The Seventh eventually fitted some of its P-40 Warhawks with belly tanks, and on January 26, 1944, sent them out to wait above the clouds for the pursuing Japanese. They shot down ten enemy fighters in three minutes, effectively ending interception of the bombers over the Marshalls.
By March 1944, VII Fighter Command was back on Oahu for regrouping, reinforcement, aircraft transition, and general reorganization in preparation for the Marianas campaign. Its strength was increased from four squadrons to three complete fighter groups of three squadrons each.
It was during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944 that the command began their transition from a static defensive unit in the rear to the spearhead of the attacks on Japan. VII Fighter Command participated in the seizure and consolidation of that island group and, more importantly, gained valuable experience in long-range operations, escorting Thirteenth Air Force B-24 Liberators on strikes to Iwo Jima and Truk from its base on Saipan.
Beginning in March 1945, the command was reassigned to Twentieth Air Force on Iwo Jima, which had been sized by Marine Corps units to provide emergency landing fields for B-29 Superfortresses. From its forward airfields on Iwo Jima, its mission became the command and control echelon of fighter groups providing escort of B-29 Superfortress bombers operating from bases in the Mariana Islands. The command's units flew Very Long Range (VLR) bomber escort operations against the armed forces of the Empire of Japan.
On 7 April 1945, 119 P-51 Mustangs of VII Fighter Command lifted off from Iwo Jima on the first Very Long Range (VLR) mission by land-based fighter aircraft against the Japanese mainland. Off the coast of Honshu they rendezvoused with more than 100 B-29 Superfortresses for an attack on the Nakajima aircraft plant in Tokyo. The B-29s had been taking heavy losses to Japanese fighters on these Empire strikes, but the 110 to 125 who came up to greet them this day were in for a surprise.
VII Fighter command pilots described the Japanese, who attacked singly during the bomb run and immediately after, as easy targets for the Mustangs that broke off in pairs to engage them. Combined, the American fighters and bombers accounted for 71 Japanese aircraft destroyed, along with 30 probably destroyed of the 44 that were damaged.
After the end of the war, the command was re-designated as a Wing, with the elimination of the command echelon in the postwar Air Force. It moved to Guam in the Marianas and remained assigned to the Far East Air Force. The organization was inactivated on 24 August 1948.

Noah's Ark (2007 film)

"Noah's Ark, El Arca" ("The Ark") in the original English/Spanish version, is a 2007 Argentine film directed by Juan Pablo Buscarini and based on Noah's Ark. The film focuses more on the animals' point of view. The story tends to follow the traditional biblical story; however, both the humans and the animals involved are seen as "talking" creatures throughout the film.
Plot.
The mortal world has fallen into a state of pandemonium, corruption and evil—men swindle, rob and take from one another; innocent people are either in debt to criminals or forced into slavery and wild animals end up captured and/or killed very quickly. Sickened by this endless display of impurity, God (who is portrayed as an African man as opposed to a Caucasian in most other biblical works) feels that he should unleash Judgement Day upon the world; however, one of his angels begs him to give humanity a chance to prove itself. After seeing an old man use all of his money to free a slave, God says that he will consider giving humanity one last chance.
Noah—an old, Jewish man with the heart of a saint and a large family to care for—finds himself in debt to a pair of con artists—the diminutive Farfan and his female cohort, Esther—yet again after he frees a slave (much to the displeasure of his three sons—Shem, Ham and Japeth). Though his children and the rest of his family insist that he chop down the forest of gopher wood near his home to make some money and get them out of debt for good, Noah refuses for sentimental reasons (his grandfather planted the whole forest) and because he feels that his family will make do, like always; despite this, even Noah's wife, Naama, is beginning to question whether or not Noah is truly of sound mind. Before dinner, Noah receives a message from God that a world-enveloping flood is imminent and that he and his family shall be the saviors of mankind (and animal-kind, as Noah is told to bring two of each animal—one male and one female, naturally) by building an ark that shall bring the survivors to a new world, where they shall begin life anew. Though the rest of his family believes he has finally gone crazy, Noah's wife believes him and is willing to stand beside him. Knowing all too well that much work is to be done, Noah (over the coming days) proceeds to chop down his entire forest for the wood needed for his ark and builds it single-handedly (all the while, his sons are contemplating running away to a new community to get a fresh start on life).
Selling his house to the con artists from earlier in exchange for a flock of doves, Noah intends to send personal, hand-written messages to all of the animals so that they can avoid their untimely deaths; unbeknownst to Noah, the doves have no intention of helping him and instead head to a bar/strip club for rest and relaxation. Only one of the doves—a white dove named Pepe—feels any moral obligation to Noah (and is aware that the coming destruction of the world may be a reality) and takes off on his own to deliver the messages to the animals. Unfortunately, his attempts to spread the word of the oncoming apocolypse fail miserably, as he is set upon by several of the jungle's predators, until he reaches the home of the lions- the king of beasts. Kairel, a lioness and aide to the royal family, takes pity on the dove and his plight and takes him to the elderly King Sabu and his wife, Queen Oriana. Realizing the severity of the situation, King Sabu calls an emergency meeting of all the animals to speak of the coming disaster; much to the king and queen's surprise, their son and the sole heir to the throne, Xiro, is willing to go on this lengthy journey (unbeknownst to them, Xiro received one of the letters but, having only received a portion of it, mistook this last chance at salvation as a pleasure cruise). All of the animals from the jungle (along with some animals from the North Pole, who question whether or not coming to the meeting was such a good idea) gather together at the behest of the king. Though some mythical animals (Bigfoot, a unicorn and a dragon, to be exact) insist that this summons is a trap set by mankind, the rest of the animal kingdom decide to give man the benefit of the doubt (apparently, the animals hoped that mankind would send a representative to be a part of the animal council, but he/she never appeared).
While preparing for the journey, Xiro talks to Bombay—a close friend and massage therapist—concerning who they're bringing along for the trip. Bombay has already chosen his travel companion—a somewhat brutish, but still friendly, orangutan named Lily—but Xiro hasn't chosen yet; he's having potential companions screened to find the most suitable candidate. Unbeknownst to the prince, the Queen asked Kairel to do the screening and her standards for what count as "a suitable companion" are high (i.e. they must have brains); naturally, most of the Prince's preferred choices are shooed away and, upon his discovery of this, Xiro promptly chooses a companion on his own—a lioness named Bruma, who had previously been rejected. With the couples formed, the animal kingdom makes its way to Noah's ark. Along the way, Kairel (who was sent by the king and queen to ensure that the pilgrimage made it to their destination smoothly) makes it very clear that she doesn't approve of Bruma, labeling her as "a wholly unimpeachable woman"; likewise, the opposite is also true, as Bruma doesn't approve of Kairel (as to where this disapproval comes from is unknown).
Meanwhile, Noah has completed the ark and the end result is nothing short of a work of art- the ark is roughly the size of a cruise ship and is just as well-stocked. The ship has been divided into two sections: the cargo hold and lower floors go to the animals (with a grand total of 13,000 double cabins—one for each animal couple—and five towers exclusively for the birds), while the upper deck and the higher floors go to Noah and his family (complete with a large fishing area and four cabins to house Noah's family). Sure as the flood is soon to arrive, the animals appear only a short walk away from the ark; unfortunately, the herbivores don't trust the carnivores enough to get on board the ark and naturally, the choice of whether or not to go on-board falls to Xiro's will. This unintentionally reveals Xiro's poor decision-making skills (as well as the fact that he is easily swayed by beautiful creatures), thus causing the animals to stop only a few feet from salvation. However, before things can get ugly, a scheming tiger named Dagnino (who is only showing kindness to the herbivores because he is secretly working to make himself king) stops a conflict from erupting, suggesting that they respect one another (as they are forging a new world order) and making a solemn promise to punish anyone who mistreats one of their "brothers". Noah comes over to greet the animals and welcome them aboard the ark; though Xiro tries to make a good impression, Kairel reminds him of "the rule"- animals can't talk to humans -,which unintentionally breaks the fourth wall. Because of this, Noah asks for a sign from God. The sign turns out to be the beginning of the flood; needing no further proof that the ark is their only salvation, the animals make full speed for it (unintentionally trampling Noah in the process, though he is relatively unscathed). Kairel attempts to give a heart-felt farewell to Xiro (along with a warning about what Dagnino is really up to), but Bruma steps in and promptly decides to tell Kairel off. During Bruma's little speech, an unexpected chain of events occurs involving the animals that leads to Bruma's (presumed) untimely demise; this leaves Kairel as the only lioness for miles and the only lioness who can take Bruma's place on board the ark.
Back at Noah's old home, Farfan and Esther quickly become aware of the oncoming flood and realize that (unintentionally) they've ended up getting the short of the stick and they're doomed unless they can somehow get on board the ark. Against all odds, the two con artists make it onto the ark by way of one of the mooring ropes just as the ark begins to set sail. With the ark leaving, all of the mythical animals are left pondering if staying back was really such a smart idea.
On board the ark, the animals quickly decide which rooms belong to what couple (though some of the rooms aren't exactly tailor-made for some of the animals); Xiro and Kairel end up with one of the luxury suites. While setting up their room, Kairel tries to get the message of responsibility into Xiro's head; unfortunately, he's only concerned with himself and his beauty (which he calls into question after seeing Farfan outside the ark and thinking that it was his own reflection), which understandably drives Kairel nuts. Before turning in for the night, Xiro excuses himself, saying he's going to "check in on the other animals"; in reality, he's going to a recently established B-room comedy club dubbed "The Dive". After Pity the Parrot does his comedy act, things take a turn for the beautiful as Bombay introduces the super-star of "The Dive"- Panty the panther (who strangely has no mate of her own), a seductive and voluptuous singer. Performing a parody of the song "I Will Survive" (dubbed "I Want to Live"), she quickly gains Xiro's infatuation.
Upon the show's conclusion, Dagnino reveals his plan to his fellow carnivores (save for Xiro). Knowing all too well that the herbivores fear/respect them, when the new world order comes around, Dagnino will have things set up so that the prey runs "towards" the predators (in a way of feeding similar to modern-day food packaging methods) and not the other way around, which is depicted as one of the more graphic parts of the movie. The only obstacle- Xiro, who would much more lenient in his rule as king (if given the chance) and is actually willing to be friends with the herbivores. However, Dagnino has foreseen this as well and plans to dispose of the would-be king. Deducing quickly that Xiro has a soft spot for beautiful animals, he has Panty convince Xiro to come over for a chat and a drink. Soon enough, the young king is quickly inebriated; however, before things can go in the mutineers' favor, Kairel (who noticed all too well that Xiro never came back) bursts in and angrily hauls Xiro out for a well-deserved chewing out. Though Xiro insists that he was trying to act in everyone's best interest (as Kairel asked him to so that he could learn to be a king), he realizes the situation is much more severe than first analyzed when Kairel hands him a complete version of the invitation from Noah.
Elsewhere, Farfan and Esther (whose presence on board the ark enrages God) explore the ship, crossing paths with a room full of snakes, before Esther makes animal outfits for the both of them out of their fur coats, since she figures that the only way they'll survive is if they look like animals. Disguising themselves as the fictional species "Grass-whoppers", they manage to trick the predators, who were busy coming up with a new plan to dispose of Xiro, and earn themselves a few more precious moments of life. Unfortunately, the duo don't go unnoticed by the rest of the animal denizens. Though the two crooks are trying to make their way to the bridge of the ship in order to take over, an unexpected (and unintentional) intervention from God sends the two back down into the depths of the ship. The duo end up at the cafeteria (where Dagnino expected they'd show up in due time) and, in an attempt to get to the top deck, poison lunch and get the majority of the animals on-board sick. Kairel soon notices the sickness and is on-hand to notice the temporary closing of the bathroom (the cause of the shut-down is soon disposed of and eventually covers Farfan and Esther). By some pure coincidence, the crook duo make it to the top deck, but not for long, as Noah's family attempts to capture them; however, this proves easier said than done, as the crooks prove light on their feet and (in the confusion) Noah falls into the hold with them. Though Japeth volunteers to journey below decks to see if Noah still lives, his cowardice proves stronger than his promises and he quickly returns. Quickly noticing that there's nobody steering the ship, the sons quickly get to fighting over it and, in the struggle, break the wheel. Sickened by her family's behavior, Naama reprimands them and states that they owe Noah for having gotten this far. Fearing that they will crash, Noah's family prays for aid from God; though he is annoyed at this, he helps anyway. Eventually, the ship winds its way into the Arctic area (unbeknownst to all aboard).
Back in the ship's depths, Farfan and Esther find Noah in their company and quickly knock him out, resuming their attempt at a takeover soon afterwards. Alas, thanks due to a boost of overconfidence to Farfan, they mess with the wrong animal type—the predator—during their trek; luckily, only the lower half of Farfan's animal suit is taken, but it provides Dagnino with all he needs for his plan.
During lunch, noting that the herbivores are growing weary and unhappy from the long journey, the Predators make their move, as Panty is sent to lure Xiro into a trap that will frame him for murder. Using her feminine charm, Panty lures Xiro straight to her room, where the trap is sprung. Pretending that Xiro has murdered an innocent herbivore that wandered into Panty's room (using part of Farfan's grasswhopper costume as animal flesh and using tomato paste as a blood substitute), Dagnino makes it seem that Xiro is anything but the ideal candidate for a leader and has him thrown in the brig. He also makes it clear that he intends to take Kairel and turn her into one of his would-be lovers, like Panty (much to Xiro's great distaste).
Meanwhile, with the revelation that the world could be finished hanging over him, Xiro decides to step up his maturity levels and work with Kairel in an attempt at creating a better world. During their time at the suggestions office, Xiro and Kairel listen to ideas on shortening prison terms via the court codes, investments in foreign currency and the stock market, credits for small enterprises, regulation of drugs in order to avoid substance abuse and mud hot tubs. By the end of the sessions, both Xiro and Kairel are naturally tired of the mostly ridiculous suggestions that have been doled out; despite the endless wait, Kairel holds strong with her belief that, if Xiro can learn to govern his people properly, then there can be such a thing as a perfect world. Xiro likes the idea, but naturally, his sexual tendencies take hold of him when Panty arrives to ask for some time together with Xiro during lunch; this sends Kairel to the breaking point. In a rage, Kairel promptly kicks Xiro out of their room, calling Xiro a womanizer (which is very much true) and stating how disappointed she is at Xiro's state. Seeking advice from Bombay, Xiro is left wondering if he made the right choice in picking Panty over Kairel. Quickly realizing that he has let his heart run away with his head, Xiro goes to tell Panty that they're through; unfortunately, in his attempt to do so, he falls for the Predators' trap. Even worse, his pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Though Xiro is dragged off, his panda and mole friends know that something doesn't quite make sense. Despite the fact that Xiro's friends know that Xiro would never commit murder (particularly Kairel), the lioness is hesitant to take sides; however, she quickly realizes that Xiro is innocent when Bombay reveals that the animal skin everyone saw was just a knitted coat.
Back up top, Noah is having a difficult time keeping his family together, as his daughters-in-law are growing restless on board the ark and are manipulating Noah's sons to try and stage a rebellion. Though Noah can understand his family's poor state of mind, he says that God planned this to happen. Displeased with this answer, the wives begin to plot a mutiny before the trip "turns into a nightmare". Following Noah's fall into the ship's depths (which he miraculously survives), Pepe goes down to save him (much to Naama's gratitude). Noah soon regains consciousness and tends to the injured Pepe (unknowingly encouraging Xiro to save the other animals on board the ship) before sending him in search of green land.
Lying in a fetal position in the brig, Xiro- who seems to have given in -is reinvigorated when he hears what seems like a voice from the heavens that he believes is "the voice of his lineage" (though it's really Noah just talking). Faith renewed, Xiro readily goes to defend the herbivores in the ship after his friends break him out of prison. Though Xiro and Kairel reconcile, Bombay reminds them that there's still the matter of reclaiming the kingdom. They arrive just in the nick of time, as Dagnino has made his move and is rounding up all of the herbivores. After Xiro and his fellow freedom fighters perform the New Zealand warrior dance, both teams- The Predators and the Freedom Fighters -go to town on one another. Though the Freedom Fighters are at something of a disadvantage at first, they manage to turn the tables and beat the Predators. Dagnino, realizing his minions are beaten, takes on Xiro in a one-on-one fight to the finish. Though Dagnino fights dirty, Xiro manages to beat him. Aggravated beyond belief, Dagnino rallies his minions for one last go at the freedom fighters, but before they (the Predators) can do anything permanent, they all end up stuck in a wall (with the exception of Panty, who was surprisingly absent from the final battle) thanks due to the ark suddenly stopping. Though the Predators have been dealt with, the other animals are still worried- the crash couldn't have just happened for no reason, so they're naturally worried. At last, the time has come for Xiro to assert his position as king. Unfortunately, the animals (who are still gripped by mass hysteria) fear that the ship could sink and run outside to relative safety. However, before they do anything regrettable, the animals are stopped by Xiro's roar, which quickly gains everyone's attention. Preaching that the only way for anyone to survive is to work together, Xiro gains the allegiance and trust of the animals (even some of the Predators, much to Dagnino's irritation). With the sun having returned after what seemed like endless darkness, Xiro leads his people for a brief visit outside to the Arctic wastes (which is made a bit more interesting because of the opera singing playing in the background, courtesy of the male hippopotamus that accidentally killed Bruma). Setting up a few makeshift fires, Xiro and Kairel calm the stir-crazy animal denizens of the ark. Though Xiro is still uncertain that he is worthy of being the leader, he gains some encouragement courtesy of a kiss from Kairel. Quickly realizing that the pitch from the ark- when coupled with an open flame -can burn through ice with ease, Xiro gets every animal working towards carving a path straight through the ice. With the pitch poured out, Xiro tosses the torch that sets the whole path ablaze and opens the way to the New World.
Down below, in the ship's depths, Farfan and Esther have noticed that they've hit land and quickly rush out to take over; unfortunately, the land turns out to be a frozen wasteland with no vegetation or any sign of life. Their hopes of creating a monopoly are quickly dashed and soon forgotten, as it turns out that the Arctic animals have chosen to stay behind in the cold wastes and they're very hungry. Realizing that they're the closest food for miles, Farfan and Esther run, with the Arctic animals in hot pursuit.
On the top deck, Noah's family notices their current surroundings. They also notice that the storm has ended and, to make the sweet pot even sweeter, Noah returns, bringing much happiness to his family. Working together, Noah's family restores the ark's wheel to a functional position and then watches as the animals clear a path through the ice using some leftover pitch and one of the torches from the ship. With the ship back on track, good news arrives, as Pepe brings back an olive leaf- a sign that there is some green land still out there.
The entirety of the ship (both humans and animals) quickly notice they have hit land- Arctic land, to be precise. Unless the ice can be melted, there's no way for the ark or any of its passengers to move onwards. Luckily, God has finally decided that the flood and the rain have both gone on long enough and promptly stop both of them. The clouds soon part, offering the first glimpse of sunlight that has been seen for weeks. With the ice melting, the ark finally surges forward towards the New World. The film concludes with the animals having a huge party, thanking Noah for "showing them the way", whilst the Predators swear revenge on the animals and the humans; overhead, God gives his promise to never flood the world again- the rainbow.

Poole Bridge

Poole Bridge (also known as Poole Lifting Bridge) is a bascule bridge in Poole, Dorset, England. Constructed in 1927, the bridge provides a road link across a busy boating channel. In February 2012 a second bridge was completed intending to operate in conjunction with the existing bridge
Location.
Poole Bridge is situated on the western end of Poole Quay and spans across a narrow channel between Poole Harbour and Holes Bay, a tidal inland lake which lies to the north of the harbour. The bridge provides a road link as part of the A350 road between Poole's town centre and the suburb of Hamworthy, avoiding a journey of around Holes Bay.
History.
The existing bridge is the third to be located on the site. William Ponsonby, a Member of Parliament for Poole, was responsible for building the first bridge in 1834. Ponsonby promoted his own Act of Parliament to build the wooden toll bridge. However, the bridge had a steep gradient that caused problems for horses and in 1885 it was replaced by an iron swing bridge with gentler approach gradients. It was privately owned and collected tolls up until 1926, when it was purchased by the Borough of Poole and replaced with the third and present bridge which opened in 1927. It has seven time-tabled lifts a day and another ten unscheduled lifts for commercial boats and it is estimated to lift over 6,000 times a year.

Climate change in West Virginia

Climate change in West Virginia is of a concern due to the effects on the environment.
Over the last century, the average temperature in Charleston, West Virginia, has increased 1.1°F (0.61°C), and precipitation has increased by up to 10% in many parts of the state. These past trends may or may not continue into the future.
Over the next century, climate in West Virginia may change even more. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre’s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in West Virginia could increase by 3°F (1.67°C) in winter, spring, and summer (with a range of 1-6 °F) and 4°F (2.23°C) in fall (with a range of 2-7 °F). Precipitation is estimated to increase by 20% (with a range of 10-30%) in all seasons, slightly more in summer. Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of summer thunderstorms is possible
Impacts.
Human health.
Warming and other climate changes could expand the habitat and infectiousness of disease-carrying insects, thus increasing the potential for transmission of diseases such as malaria and dengue. Warmer temperatures could increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in West Virginia, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation.
Water resources.
The topography of West Virginia is rugged, and many of the rivers in the state are influenced by winter snow accumulation and spring snowmelt. A warmer climate would lead to an earlier spring snowmelt, resulting in higher streamflows in winter and spring.
Lower streamflows and lake levels in the summer and fall could affect the dependability of surface water supplies, particularly since many of the streams in West Virginia have low flows in the summer. The growing tourism and recreation industries such as whitewater rafting also could be affected by lower summer streamflows. Groundwater sources also could be reduced by lower spring and summer recharge. Lower summer streamflows and warmer temperatures could affect water quality by concentrating pollutant levels. This could exacerbate existing problems with acid drainage from coal mines, high concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria, and industrial pollution from the manufacturing plants along the floodplains of the Ohio and Kanawha rivers
Increases in rainfall could mitigate these effects. Higher rainfall, however, could contribute to increased flooding. Most homes and businesses in West Virginia are built on flat, narrow valley floors and are susceptible to flooding. More rain also could increase erosion and exacerbate pollution in runoff areas devoted to manufacturing, coal mining, and oil and gas extraction.
Agriculture.
In West Virginia, production agriculture is a $400 million annual industry, three-fourths of which comes from livestock, mainly cattle and poultry. Very few of the farmed acres are irrigated. The major crop in the state is hay. Hay yields could increase by about 30% as a result of climate change, leading to changes in acres farmed and production. Farmed acres could remain constant or could decrease by as much as 30% in response to changes in prices, for example, possible decreases in hay prices. Livestock and dairy production may not be affected, unless summer temperatures rise significantly and conditions become significantly drier. Under these conditions, livestock tend to gain less weight and pasture yields decline, limiting forage
Forests.
With changes in climate, the extent of forested areas in West Virginia could change little or decline by as much as 5-10%. However, the types of trees dominating those forests and woodlands are likely to change. Forested areas could be increasingly dominated by pine and scrub oaks, replacing many of the eastern hardwoods common throughout West Virginia. In areas where richer soils are prevalent, southern pines could increase their range and density, and in areas with poorer soils, which are more common in West Virginia’s forests, scrub oaks of little commercial value (e.g., post oak and blackjack oak) could increase their range. As a result, the character of forests in West Virginia could change. Climate change also could affect the success of tree plantings to stabilize open-face mining sites.
Ecosystems.
The state of West Virginia is 97% forested, and much of this cover is in high-elevation areas. These areas contain some of the last remaining stands of red spruce, which are seriously threatened by acid rain and could be further stressed by changing climate. These forests provide habitat for many plants and animals, including the varying hare, red squirrel, the endangered Virginia northern flying squirrel, and the threatened Cheat Mountain salamander. Whereas species of lower elevations at least have the potential to move upward in response to warming temperatures, those in high elevation areas do not. Given a sufficient change in climate, these spruce forests could be substantially reduced, or could disappear.
West Virginia has the fourth highest number of caves (including 3,300 limestone caves) in the nation and 11 of the world’s 50 longest caves. At least eight species of bats, including two that are federally endangered (Indiana bat and the Virginia bigeared bat), use caves as winter hibernation roosts or to raise young in the summer. One cave protects over 5,000 Indiana bats each winter, and another contains the largest known concentration of hibernating Virginia big-eared bats as well as the largest known maternity colony. Higher-than-normal winter temperatures could boost temperatures inside cave bat roosting sites, which has been shown to cause higher mortality due to increased winter body weight loss in endangered Indiana bats (e.g., an increase of during winter hibernation has been associated with a 42% increase in the rate of body mass loss). The south branch cave beetle is another endangered cave dweller.
Another unique West Virginia ecosystem is in the Ice Mountain Preserve. In a small slope area there are 60 small holes and openings at the base of a rock talus whose vents blow air year round. As a result, high elevation boreal plants group around the cold air vents, where ice can be seen well into May. The effects of gradually warming temperatures are already noticeable on Ice Mountain, and ice around the vents is disappearing earlier in the year. This could adversely impact the boreal plants found in this system.

1904 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand

The 1904 British Isles tour to New Zealand and Australia was the sixth tour by a British Isles team and the fourth to New Zealand and Australia. It is retrospectively classed as one of the British Lions tours, as the Lions naming convention was not adopted until 1950.
Led by David Bedell-Sivright and managed by Arthur O'Brien the tour took in 19 matches, 14 in Australia and 5 in New Zealand. Of the games four were test matches, three played against Australia national rugby union team and one against the New Zealand All Blacks. The Lions won all three Australia tests but lost the All Blacks' game.
This was the first time that a British team would take on both Australia and New Zealand in the same tour and would become a Lions tradition up until 1971. The team captain, Bedell-Sivright, a veteran of the 1903 tour of South Africa, was requested to lead the team by the England Rugby Board. Bedell-Sivright broke his leg in the opening match of the New Zealand section of the tour and Teddy Morgan took over the captaincy.

Nagaharu Yodogawa

Early life.
Yodogawa was born in Kobe and grew-up in his father's geisha agency in the Shinkaichi entertainment district, along with his brother and two sisters. His family were regular movie-goers, visiting the cinema several times a week. Yodogawa began accompanying his family at age four. By the age of seven he proved himself to be a budding cinemaphile; he would often go to the movies on his own, seeing as many as 10 films in one week.
Career in film criticism.
Upon graduating from Kobe High School, Yogodowa started his journalistic career working for the magazine "Eiga Sekai" ("Movie World"). After World War II he became Chief Editor of "Eiga no Tomo" ("Film Friend"), a post he held for 20 years.
After his tenure at "Eiga no Tomo", Yogodowa went on to do freelance work in radio, television and print, all in relation to film. In 1962 he began working at TV Asahi as the host of "Sunday Western Movie Theatre", a job to which he was so devoted that he did not miss a single appearance until just a week before his death in 1998. During his 3 decades as the show's host he interviewed film stars "ranging from Charlie Chaplin to Steven Seagal". He is also known for closing each show with his signature line "Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara".
Love of film.
Yodogawa's first love was silent film. He preferred silent movies over sound film because he felt that silent films depicted real life and were easy to understand, even without Japanese captions.
Over his career, Yodogawa became increasingly critical of modern Japanese film, once stating: "It is because I love film so much that I hate those incompetent and uninteresting new movies." In contrast, he believed that even the worst movies were worth watching; he felt that all films had at least one redeeming feature, such as a well composed shot. Near the end of his life he did however show interest in the new style of film-making of Takeshi Kitano, to whom he referred as "the true successor to Kurosawa".
Influence.
Yodogawa's appreciation of film is notable amongst the film industry of Japan; fellow critic and scholar Shigehiko Hasumi once said: "We usually watch films with the intellect, but Yodogawa watched them with every fibre of his being." The award-winning actor Hiroyuki Sanada also credited Yodogawa as having introduced him to foreign movies.
In 1991, the Yodogawa Nagaharu Award, sponsored by "Road Show Magazine" (Japan), was created to commemorate the film critic; the award is presented to a person or group who contributed greatly to the Japanese film industry in the preceding year. In 2005, Jackie Chan became the first non-Japanese recipient of the award.
Final years.
Yodogawa lived the last years of his life in the Zen Nikku Hotel in Tokyo (now ANA InterContinental Tokyo), where he paid for his room in cash every 10 days. He continued working as the host of "Sunday Western Movie Theatre" until just weeks before his death.
Nagaharu Yodogawa died November 11, 1998 of heart failure. "Yodogawa Nagaharu monogatari - Kobe-hen: Sainara", a biographical film depicting his life, directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, was released the following year.

The Steel Remains

The Steel Remains (2008) is a fantasy novel by Richard K. Morgan. It is the first fantasy book by Morgan, a noted science fiction author known for the Takeshi Kovacs trilogy and the standalone novels "Market Forces" and "Black Man".
"The Steel Remains" is the first book of a planned trilogy named "A Land Fit For Heroes", a series title also used by Phillip Mann. "A Land Fit For Heroes" was originally the working title of the first volume, and was retained as the series title after first Morgan and the UK publisher, and then the US publisher, decided to use the current title "The Steel Remains". The sequel, "The Cold Commands", was published in 2011. The third, "The Dark Defiles" is due in August 2013.
Plot.
Almost ten years after the Human-Kiriath Alliance repelled the invading Scaled Folk in a terrible war, three of the war heroes still have difficulty adjusting to the uneasy peace and the renewed conflict between the northern League and the Yhelteth Empire.
Ringil Eskiath lives in self-imposed exile from his native Trelayne, exchanging war stories for board and lodging in a small village's inn; to most people he is the hero of Gallows Gap, but his own family shuns him because he is gay. Lady kir-Archeth Indamaninarmal, the only human-kiriath half-breed, was left behind when the Kiriath abandoned the world, and finds herself more and more unable to tolerate the decadent court of the Yhelteth Emperor. Egar Dragonbane, a Majak mercenary, returned to his people after the wars, but having seen the wonders of the civilized world he feels out of place as a nomad clan leader in the steppe.

Grady v. Corbin

Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that: "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted."
Background.
In the fall of 1987, Corbin was driving under the influence as he drove his automobile across the center line of a New York highway and collided with two oncoming vehicles. Brenda Dirago, the driver of the second vehicle, died in this accident while her husband was seriously injured. Later that same day, Corbin was charged with DUI and pleaded guilty. The Supreme Court ruled that to try him now for homicide would constitute double jeopardy.
Case Overturned.
Grady v. Corbin was only valid law for three years. It was overturned by Dixon v. United States, 509 U.S. 688 (1993), which rejected the same conduct test in favor of the longstanding same element test. The same element test had been the law since Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932).

<doc id="19087356" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19087356" title="Culture of Mangalorean Catholics">
Culture of Mangalorean Catholics

The Culture of Mangalorean Catholics is a blend of Goan and Mangalorean cultures. After migration to Mangalore, they adopted the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions. Their traditional houses, observed only in Mangalore, have spacious porticos, red cement or terra cotta floors and fruit trees around the house.
Architecture and cuisine.
A German missionary Plebot set up the first tile factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission tile factory. In the course of time, Mangalorean Catholics learnt the technique of preparing Mangalore tiles and the Albuquerque tile factory, the first Indian Mangalore tile manufacturing factory was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque, a Mangalorean Catholic, at Pane Mangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing these red Mangalore tiles. After the opening of the Albuquerque tile factory, the Alvares tile factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. As of 1991—92, out of 12 tile manufacturing factories in Mangalore, 6 were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from hard clay, were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle-East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the old traditional variety of laterite-brick structures with Mangalore tile roofing with steep slopes. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large verandah is present in front of the house.
Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most curries. "Sanna-Dukra Maas" (Sanna – idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas – Pork) is one of the most popular dish of the Mangalorean Catholic community. "Rosachi Kadi" (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with coconut milk (ros), is a traditional curry served during the Ros ceremony. "Patrode", a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is also popular. "Kuswar" are sweet delicacies prepared during Christmas and includes around 22 varieties of sweets. Fish and rice form the staple diet of most Mangalorean Catholics. Par-boiled rice, also known as red rice, is the traditional rice eaten and preferred over raw rice.
Names and surnames.
Bilingual names, having variants in both Konkani and English, like "Zuãuñ" (John) and "Mornel" (Magdalene) are common among Mangalorean Catholics. Most Mangalorean Catholic names for males follow the second declension. Among women, the names follow the first declension, while among young girls, the names follow the second declension. The Mangalorean Catholic variant of many first names is the Mangalorean Catholic Konkani version of its Portuguese counterpart which was borrowed from the Portuguese language (examples include "Zâbel" from the Portuguese "Isabel", "Zuãuñ" from the Portuguese "João", "Pedru" from the Portuguese "Pedro", and "Zoze" from the Portuguese "José"). Portuguese surnames like D'Souza and Pinto are abundant among Mangalorean Catholics, and generally follow the second declension. Some families use their original Goud Saraswat Brahmin surnames such as Prabhu, Kamat, Pai, and Shenoy. Other European surnames are also found.
Language and literature.
Mangalorean Catholics speak the Konkani language, which they retained as their mother tongue despite the migration. The Konkani language is central to the community's identity. Konkani is an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages, which is spoken predominantly on the west coast of India. They speak a dialect of Konkani, known as Mangalorean Catholic Konkani, which the Ethnologue identifies as the "Mangalore" dialect. It is largely derived from the Bardeskaar (North Goan) dialect and bears a good degree of intelligibility with the modern Bardeskaar Christian dialect and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect. This dialect has a significant infusion of Tulu and Kannada loanwords. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due to the influence of Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. It is significantly different from the dialect spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara. The Mangalorean Catholic dialect is much closer to the dialects of the 
Goan Hindus than to that of the Goan Catholics. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect.
The origin of their literature dates to 1883, when Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei, an Italian Jesuit, published the first "English-Konkani Dictionary" in Mangalore. In 1912, the first Konkani periodical, "Konknni Dirvem" (Konkani Treasure), was published in Mangalore by Louis Mascarenhas. Popular Konkani periodicals published in Mangalore include "Raknno" (1938) by Mons Sylvester Menezes, "Konkan Daiz" (Heritage of Konkani) (1958), and "Kannik" (Donation) (1965) by Raymond Miranda. In Bombay, periodicals like "Sukh-Dukh" (1948) by G.M.B. Rodrigues, "Konknni Yuvak" (1949) by George Fernandes, "Poinnari" (1950) by V.J.P. Saldanha, and "Divo" (1995) by J.B. Moraes were published. Modern literature is diverse and includes themes such as Indian Politics in books like "What Ails the Socialists" by George Fernandes, historical awakening, in books such as "Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians" by Alan Machado Prabhu, and sexual desires, in "The Revised Kama Sutra: A Novel of Colonialism and Desire" by Richard Crasta.
The Mangalorean genealogist Michael Lobo published the first genealogical Encyclopaedia of the Mangalorean Catholic community in 1999. This genealogical Encyclopaedia, currently exceeding 6000 pages, covers over a thousand families, each of which is researched as far as its ancestry can be traced. Three offshoots have thus far been launched, which include "Mangaloreans Worldwide — An International Directory" (1999), "Distinguished Mangalorean Catholics" (2000), and "The Mangalorean Catholic Community — A Professional History / Directory" (2002). In 2000, the Diocese of Mangalore released the first Konkani Bible in Kannada script, which was made available online on 26 July 2007.
Traditions and festivals.
Roman Catholic traditions include the "Sakrament" (Seven Sacraments) and include "Povitr-Snan" (Baptism), "Thiravnni" (Confirmation), "Krist-Prasad" (Eucharist), "Prachit" (Penance), "Piddestanchi Makhnni" (Anointing of the Sick), "Iazokanchi Sonskornni" (Holy Orders) and "Logn" (Matrimony).
Mangalorean Catholics have retained many Indian customs and traditions and reveal their existence especially during the celebration of a marriage. Their culture is more traditional and Indian. Though the Portuguese traded quite frequently in Mangalore, and most of the priests arriving in the region were Portuguese, there did not develop a community identified with Portugal and Portuguese culture. They have no uniform rituals since they belong to both the patrilineal Brahmin stock and to the matrilineal non-Brahmin stock. It were mainly these Pagan marriage rites which the Portuguese during the Goan Inquisition found objectionable and prohibited it in a "Manual of Rules and Regulations of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in the Kingdoms of Portugal", published in 1640 by Bishop D. Franciscode Castro.
"Ros" (anointing) ceremony, conducted one or two days before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with "ros", a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. Later, it is followed by the "Resper" (Nuptial Blessing in Church) and finally the "Vordik" (wedding) and "Voran" (wedding party). Other traditions include "Soirik" or "Sairikecho Malo" (betrothal), "Voulik" (wedding invitation) and exchange of "Paan Pod" or "Bido" (betel leaves) during marriage ceremonies, which was called "badalchen" (changing hands). Indian traditions include adorning the bride with the "Sado" (wedding sari) and "Pirduk" (wedding necklace), the wearing of which indicates her "Ayaponn" (destiny), the "Onpnni" or "Opsun divnchen" (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), "Porthoponn" (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of "Honvious" (hymns). Some other traditions include "Novemjeevon" (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and "Novem" (blessing of new harvests).
In addition to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals of religious and historical significance. "Monti Fest" is one of the major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of "Novem" (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet in 1763. Though Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Father Miranda. "Attur Jatre" or "Attur Fest" (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Eucharistic Procession ("Evkaristik Purshanv" in Konkani) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.
Costumes and Ornaments.
Mangalorean Catholic men used to wear long loose frilled white or black coats (similar to the Maratha loose coats) with buttons. The turbans were usually flattened like the Coorgi turbans ("Urmal"). The "Urmal" is a long white piece of cloth with a golden hem and is tied around the head like a turban. In modern times, this mode has changed. Only a few old people can be seen wearing this traditional dress on church going occasions.

Only a few old people can be seen wearing this traditional dress on church going occasions. Before marriage, women used to wear white skirts over which sarees and blouses were worn. The dress was a sign of her virginity and she wore it on the day of "Ros" ceremony Gold ornaments in those days were absent. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. 
The Mangalorean Catholic bride's sari is known as an "Sado". It is usually a red coloured Banarasi sari, which are made of finely woven silk and are decorated with elaborate engravings. The bride is also presented with a sari by her own people which is called "Dharma sado", which was worn on other festive occasions. Some brides also wear a white sari during the nuptial blessing in church. Ornaments worn by the bride in ancient times included "kanti", "chakrasar", "kap", "karap", "mugud", "kanto", "dantoni". Except "datoni" none of these ornaments are in use in the modern generation. Present-day brides wear a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings and at least two of the golden combs known as "Dantoni" that consisted of two ordinary combs and the upper part of each one was plate with gold, that are worn in the hair on both sides of the headover the ears. On the way to church she wears some white and red flowers stuck in the hair. In the centre of the forehead, a "bang" (gold chain) was placed with a pendant. A widow had to wear a black sari all her life, and was not allowed to wear ornaments. 
Two more combs were worn by the bride, with a figure of a fish in gold inserted in each comb and were therefore called "masli" (fish). The hair is well combed and parted in the middle of the forehead. This fashion is strictly observed. A girl parting her hair in any other manner was regarded a loose girl. In the centre of the forehead where the hair is parted, a gold chain was placed with a pendant. This chain was called "bang".None of these ornaments are worn on ordinary days. Every bride formerly wore three pairs of gold bangles; in addition she wore bangles of red glass.
The bridegroom's dress in the early times consisted of a short loincloth of hand-woven cloth ("Dhoti"), a shawl to cover his shoulders and a red handkerchief on the head ("leis"). The groom's dress was gradually improved. Later, his dress consisted of a white loincloth with a red and gold hem ("todop"), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat ("kutav"), a shawl on the shoulders and a towel on the head. The bridegroom wore a "chakrasar" (neck chain) around his neck. He wore a pair of sandals or at least a pair of socks. In modern times however, some westernised Mangalorean Catholic couples have a White wedding, were the bridegroom wears a suit, while the bride wears a white gown.
Historical Society.
Mangalorean Catholics had retained the same caste system which their ancestors had in Goa. They were divided into four castes — Bāmaṇs, Charodis, Shudras, and Gaudis. The biggest group were the Bāmaṇs (the Konkani word for Brahmins). They were converts from the Brahmin caste (priestly class), and especially included the Goud Saraswat Brahmin converts from Goa. The Charodis, the second largest group, were converts from the Kshatriya (warrior class) and Vaishya (merchant class) castes. The artisan converts formed the third biggest group and were known as Shudras (labour class). The converts from the fisher-caste residing around Ullal, Kuloor and other places around the sea coast were called Gaudis, and formed the fourth group. Other minor castes, included the Padvals, who the historian Severine Silva, in his book "The Marriage Customs of the Christians in South Canara, India", assumes to be local Jain converts. 
It was difficult for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted the work of social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry but it was quite primitive and unskilled. Other crafts and industries were non-existent. By the later half of the 19th century Mangalorean Catholics were involved in the Mangalore tile industry, Coffee plantations and trade in plantation products. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, the cathecism, and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani. 
A widow had to remain indoors practically for the rest of her life. Canon Law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara, but few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast. No stigma was attached to her husband.
Songs and music.
On 26–27 January 2008, a Konkani cultural event, Konkani Nirantari, held in Mangalore by a Mangalorean Catholic organisation, Mandd Sobhann, entered the Guinness Book of World Records for non-stop singing of Konkani hymns. Mandd Sobhann members sang for 40 hours, surpassing the old record of 36 hours held by a Brazilian musical troupe, "Communidade Evangelica Luterana São Paulo" (Lutheran Evangelical Community of São Paulo) of "Universidade Luterana do Brasil" (Lutheran University of Brazil). The Silver Band, started in 1906 by Lawrence D'Souza in Mangalore, is one of the oldest and most popular brass bands in Mangalore. The well known Konkani hymn "Riglo Jezu Molliant" (Jesus entered the Garden of Gethsemene) was written by Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest, during the 18th century, when he was held captive by Tippu Sultan, on his Canara mission. Other popular Konkani hymns composed by Mangalorean Catholics as of today are "Aika Cristanv Jana", "Utha Utha Praniya", and "Sorgim Thaun". The ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has the form of an earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some wild animal, and the other is left open. The tradition Of "Voviyo" (wedding songs), sung by women during a "Ros", is important to this community. The procedure is that one of the elderly lady, usually the "yejman" (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as "yejmani") who knows the voviyos leads the song while the rest of the women sing along with her. Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.

Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis

The Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis is a street in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. It crosses the arrondissement from north to south, linking the Porte Saint-Denis to the "Métro" station of La Chapelle and passing the Gare du Nord.
History.
The rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis owes its name to the fact that it is an extension of the rue Saint-Denis to the faubourg or area outside Paris's walls (as marked today by the Porte Saint-Denis). It also marked the eastern boundary of the enclos (later prison) Saint-Lazare.
Historically, this street was an extremely upper-class area, occupied by jewellers and textile merchants, since it was part of the king's processional route to the Basilica of Saint Denis. After the French Revolution the street briefly bore the name rue du Faubourg Franciade in 1793 (with the portion between rue Saint-Laurent and place de la Chapelle being renamed rue du faubourg Saint-Lazare and rue du faubourg de Gloire).

Strategic goal (military)

A strategic military goal is used in strategic planning to define desired end-state of a war or a campaign. Usually it entails either a strategic change in enemy's military posture, intentions or ongoing operations, or achieving a strategic victory over the enemy that ends the conflict, although the goal can be set in terms of diplomatic or economic conditions, defined by purely territorial gains, or the evidence that the enemy's will to fight has been broken. Sometimes the strategic goal can be to limit the scope of the conflict.
It is the highest level of organisational achievement in a military organisation, and is usually defined by the national defence policy. In terms of goal assignment it corresponds to operations performed by a front or a fleet on a theatre scale, and by an Army group or, during the Second World War, by a Red Army Front.
A strategic goal is achieved by reaching specific strategic objectives that represent intermediary and incremental advances within the overall strategic plan. This is necessary because "high-level" strategic goals are often abstract, and therefore difficult to assess in terms of achievement without referring to some specific, often physical objectives. However, aside from the obstacles used by the enemy to prevent achievement of the strategic goal, inappropriate technological capabilities and operational weakness in combat may prevent fulfilment of the strategic plan. As an example, these are illustrated by the failure of the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command during the winter of 1943/44. 
A critical product of the analysis which leads to the strategic decision to use military force is determination of the national goal to be achieved by that application of force.
However, analysis of military history abounds with examples of the two factors that plague goal setting in military strategies, their change during the campaign or war due to changes in economic, political or social changes within the state, or in a change of how achievement of existing goal is being assessed, and the criteria of its achievement. For example, 
The complex and varied nature of the Vietnam War made it especially difficult to translate abstract, strategic goals into specific missions for individual organizations.
This occurred because aside from the economic change that saw cost of war escalate beyond original predictions, and the change in political leadership was no longer willing to commit to the conduct of war, but also to the radical change which the United States society experienced during the war, and more importantly because 
The American strategic goal was not the destruction of an organized military machine armed with tanks, planes, helicopters, and war ships, for which the United States had prepared, but the preservation of a fragile regime from the lightly armed attacks of both its own people and the North Vietnamese.
The United States did not intend to conquer North Vietnam for fear of a Chinese or Soviet military reaction. Likewise, the United States strategically assumed that the full extent of its power was not merited in Vietnam.

History of Mangalorean Catholics

The History of Mangalorean Catholics comprises three major eras. The first era consists of the Aryan inheritance from their ancestors, who once lived at the regions of the now extinct Saraswati River, and later migrated to Goa possibility due to the drying up of the river and/or Muslim invasion. The second era was the Lusitanian legacy, due to the conversion of their Hindu ancestors in Goa to Roman Catholicism by the Portuguese, and the final era being the migration of these Roman Catholics in Goa to Mangalore and other parts of South Canara between the mid-16th and mid-18th centuries, forming a new Mangalorean Catholic identity, and the subsequent growth and development of the community. Several centuries of living in South Canara gave these Catholics an identity of their own.
The Roman Catholics from Goa migrated to Mangalore in three major waves, the first after 1560, the second after 1570, and the third in about 1683. The first wave of migrants left due to the Goa Inquisition of 1560. The second and third waves left Goa because of famines, epidemics, and political upheavals such as the Portuguese–Maratha wars. During Hyder Ali's regime, the community had flourished. Soon after his son Tippu Sultan gained possession of Mangalore in January 1784, he issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam. They had to suffer extreme hardships, torture, death, and persecutions during the captivity. Many Christians were forcibly converted to Islam. Of the 60,000-80,000 Christians taken captive, only 15,000-20,000 made it out alive as Christians. The captivity ended with the death of Tippu in the Battle of Seringapatam (1799).
Ancestral roots.
Traditional accounts of the ancestral roots of Mangalorean Catholics have taught that they are descended from the Aryans who lived on the banks of the now extinct Saraswati River. Most historians agree that the Aryans descended into India from the areas of present-day Iran, and some came by themselves, while others came with their leaders in search of territorial expansions. The Saraswati river dried up in long stretches around 1500 BCE, when its source in the Himalayas got diverted into the Yamuna River due to sand deposition and river piracy. Due to the harshness in their native environments, several Aryan groups migrated to various different locations across India. According to Historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the modern Mangalorean Catholic community is mainly descended from two Aryan groups: the group which migrated to the Konkan coast and Goa; and the group which migrated to Bengal.
The Aryans are thought to have first migrated to Goa beginning in 600 BCE, and continuing in several waves until 400 CE. The Goud Saraswat Brahmins (GSBs) are believed to have migrated to Goa later around 300 CE from the Saraswati River settlement in Bengal. The GSBs also claim their origin to the Brahmins who lived on the banks of the now extinct Saraswati River. 
Pre-migration era.
All records of an early existence of Christians in South Canara were lost at the time of their deportation by Tippu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known when exactly Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara just as they did in Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveler Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce and possibly some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work. In April 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in south-western France) with four other friars landed at Thana. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon in 1328. About 1493, a cross was caught in the net by some fishermen off Mangalore. It was made of Olive wood, well finished and one span and a half in length, indicating the possibility of a Christian community in Mangalore. Some crosses painted black and red were discovered by the Portuguese in 1505 while digging up for laying the foundation for a fortress at Anjediva in North Canara. According to Paulo da Trinidade, they appeared to have belonged to a chapel or church of Christians. It is difficult to say whether these findings were Christian crosses or some other objects which looked like crosses and actually were instruments used by Hindus for astronomical observations. According to Historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. Even if it is assumed that Christianity existed in South Canara before the arrival of the Portuguese, the Christian community must have disappeared by 1498.
It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to be propagated. In 1498, the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama landed on a group of islands in South Canara on his voyage from Portugal to India. He named them "El Padron de Santa Maria", which later came to be known as St Mary's Islands. In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral, a Portuguese explorer, arrived at Anjediva with eight Franciscan missionaries. These missionaries under the leadership of Henrique Soares de Coimbra converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region. On 19 November 1502, some Christians of Mangalore and other interior places went with presents to meet Vasco da Gama, who was in Cochin. These Christian ambassadors told da Gama that they had their bishops and all of them said mass. They also told him that they undertook pilgrimages to the sepulcher of St. Thomas. Even prior to Alfonso de Albuquerque's conquest of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese had some settlements in Canara. It was easy for the Portuguese to send re-inforcements of missionaries to the existing stations in Canara and also to advance the work of evangelization. During the early part of the 16th century, Canara was ruled by Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire of Deccan. As it was not possible for the Portuguese to enter Canara with Krishnadevaraya as ruler, a Portuguese alliance with Krishnadevaraya was the only way to enter Canara. Krishnadevaraya granted commercial privileges to the Portuguese on the Canara coast and there was complete freedom of worship, belief and propagation of religious tenets in the Vijaynagara Empire.
In 1526, under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, the Portuguese took possession of Mangalore. During the rule of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, a regular mission was established in Mangalore by some Franciscans who came from Goa, where they had been established in 1517. The Portuguese Franciscans slowly started spreading Christianity in Mangalore. On 31 January 1533, the Diocese of Goa was created by a bull of Pope Clement VII, and confirmed in 1534 by Pope Paul III by his bull "Aequum Reputamus" dated 3 November 1534. The Franciscan monk, Father John of Albuquerque, became the first Bishop of Goa in 1537. In 1534, Canara was placed under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the Bishop of Goa, where the Portuguese had a strong presence. Missionaries soon arrived and gained converts. The number of local converts in South Canara started increasing. During the mid–16th century, the Portuguese faced resistance from Abbakka Rani of Ullal, the Queen of the Bednore dynasty. The first battle between Abbakka Rani and the Portuguese was fought in 1546, where she emerged victorious, and succeeded in driving the Portuguese out of South Canara.
Migrations from Goa.
Many of the Goan ancestors of the present Mangalorean Catholics fled Goa because of the Goa Inquisition introduced by the Portuguese in 1560. King Sebastian of Portugal decreed that every trace of Indian customs be eradicated through the Inquisition. The Inquisition characterized any vestige of Hinduism as heretical. Christian converts were banned from using Hindu names, attending any Hindu ceremonies including weddings, engaging the services of a Hindu doctor or midwife, wearing "dhotis" or "cholis", and planting "tulsi" (Holy Basil). Those Christians who were not prepared to give up completely their former Hindu practices were declared heretics and apostates and
could be condemned to death. But many Christians of Goa were attached to some of their ancient Indian customs, and refused to abandon them. Consequently they lived in constant danger for their lives. Those who refused to comply with the rules laid down by the Inquisition were forced to leave Goa and to settle outside the Portuguese dominion.
It is interesting and instructive, in this light, to view the rituals and practices of Mangalorean Catholics. These Catholics of South fled from Goa (mainly from its northern districts) in successive waves. A large number fled to escape the scrutiny of the inquistion. Among them the ritual substances banned by the inquistion such as betel leaves, areca nuts, rice and flowers, continue to be employed in domestic celebrations and the pattern of ritual practices appears much more resemble forms described in the Inquisitorial edict.— A.P.L. D'Souza, "Popular Christianity: A Case Study among the Catholics of Mangalore" 
The Christians who left Goa were skilled cultivators who abandoned their irrigated fields in Goa to achieve freedom. At the time of migration, Canara was ruled by the Bednore King Shivappa Naik (1540–60). He evinced great interest in the development of agriculture in his empire and welcomed these farmers to his fertile lands. This was confirmed by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician, when he visited Canara in 1801. In his book, "A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar" (1807), he stated that "The princes of the house of Ikeri had given great encouragement to the Christians, and had induced 80,000 of them to settle in "Tuluva"." Later, this was identified as a probable mistake and should have read "8,000". However even this figure included the second emigration of Christians from Goa. The Christians were also recruited into the armies of the Bednore dynasty. The Hindus left the Christians severely alone. The local Brahmins ignored the Christians, even those of Brahmin origin. On account of their change of religion, they refused to associate with them and did not admit them into their houses. Like the local Brahmins, the Bunts, who were largely self-sufficient in South Canara, also never associated with the Christians. A closer contact was, however, kept by the Christians with Goan Hindus of the same caste who were, like the Christians, refugees from Goa. The Christians used to invite their Hindu relatives to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings and funeral feasts, and the Hindus used to accept such invitations.
Under the provisional treaties between the Portuguese and the Bednore rulers, the Christians were allowed to build churches and help the growth of Christianity in South Canara. The arrival of the British and the Dutch halted the activity of the Portuguese and gradually the Portuguese were unable to send the required number of missionaries to Mangalore. In 1568, the Church of "Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Mangalore" (Our Lady of the Rosary of Mangalore) was erected by the Portuguese at Bolar in Mangalore. The Churches of "Nossa Senhora de Mercês de Velala" (Our Lady of Mercy of Ullal) and "São Francisco de Assis Igreja" (St. Francis of Assisi) at Farangipet were also erected by the Portuguese during the same time in South Canara. These three churches were highlighted by the Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, who visited Mangalore in 1623.
The Sultan of Bijapur attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur sultans were especially known for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Catholics from Goa migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred as the "Second Wave of Migration". The Milagres Church, one of the oldest churches in South Canara, was built in 1680 by Bishop Thomas de Castro, a Goan Catholic theatine priest who was appointed by Pope Clement X as the Vicar Apostolic of Canara. The attacks of the Maratha Empire on Goa, during the mid 16th century, was also a cause of migration. In 1664, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, attacked Kudal, a town north of Goa, and began his campaign for Goa. After Shivaji's death on 3 April 1680, his son Sambhaji ascended to the throne. The onslaught of Sambahji, along the northern territories of Goa drove nearly all the Christians from their homelands, and most of them migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred as the "Third Wave of Migration". From the Salcete district of Goa, according to one estimate, emigrations were around at the rate of 2,000 annually. From the Bardez district of Goa, Jesuit priests estimated that 12,000 Christians emigrated from Goa between 1710–1712, mot of them going southward. A Goa Government report of 1747 presently in the Panjim archives recorded that around 5,000 Christians fled from the Bardez and Tiswadi districts of Goa during the invasion of the Marathas. It was estimated that during the Maratha raids on Goa, about 60,000 Christians migrated to South Canara. During the later years, the migration slowed because of the Maratha-Mughal wars, which kept Sambhaji busy, and some 10,000 Christians returned to Goa. According to Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 by 1765.
Hyder Ali.
Hyder Ali occupied Mangalore in 1763. From 1766–1772, Hyder Ali took de facto control of the throne of the Mysore Kingdom through the Wodeyar dynasty. In February 1768, the English captured Mangalore from Hyder. The Portuguese had offered to help Hyder against the English. But when the Portuguese betrayed Hyder, he directed his anger towards the Mangalorean Catholics, who had been converted to Christianity by the Portuguese. Toward the end of 1768, Hyder defeated the English and captured Mangalore fort, where the Mangalorean Catholics were taking refuge. Around 15,675 of them were taken as prisoners to Mysore by Hyder. Only 204 returned; the rest died, were killed, or converted to Islam. After Hyder's death in the Second Anglo-Mysore War on December 1782, the British captured the fort again. Hyder was succeeded by his son Tippu Sultan. The Mangalorean Catholics helped the British in the fort by providing them rice, vegetables, and money. Tippu decided to come down heavily upon these Christians for providing aid to the British. On 20 May 1783, Tippu Sultan laid siege to the Mangalore fort, where the Mangalorean Catholics and English army were taking refuge. The fort was finally delivered to Tippu when the British capitulated it on 30 January 1784. More than 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics, who were condemned for treachery, were killed.
Captivity at Seringapatam.
The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history. Soon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tippu gained control of Canara. He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through the Jamalabad fort route. The account of the number of captives differ ranging from 30000 to 80,000. According to Thomas Munro, a Scottish soldier and the first collector of Canara, around 60,000 of them, nearly 92 percent of the entire Christian community of Canara, were captured, only 7,000 escaped. Francis Buchanan gives the numbers as 70,000 captured, from a population of 80,000, with 10,000 escaping. They were forced to climb nearly through the dense jungles and gorges of the Western Ghat mountain ranges along the Kulshekar-Virajpet-Coorg-Mysore route. It was from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took six weeks. According to the "Barkur Manuscrpt", written in Canarese by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barkur after his return from Seringapatam, 20,000  of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease and ill treatment by the soldiers. Those who resisted were thrown down from the Jamalabad fort route. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000 of them were captured. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives of the Muslims living there. The young men who offered resistance were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears and paraded in the city. According to Mr. Silva of Gangolim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment under the orders of Tipu was the cutting off of the ears, nose, the feet and one hand.
British era (1799–1947).
In the Battle of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799, the British stormed the fortress, breached the town of Seringapatam, and killed Tippu. After his death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the Mangalorean Catholics were freed from his captivity. Of the 60,000-80,000 Mangalorean Catholics taken captive, only 15,000-20,000 made it out as Christians. After deliverance from captivity, while returning home to South Canara the King of Coorg offered the Mangalorean Catholics safe stay in their lands and many of them settled in Coorg. British general Arthur Wellesley helped 10,000 of them return to South Canara and resettle on their lands. According to the Mangalorean genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely from this small group of survivors. Later, the British took over South Canara. In 1800, they took a census of the region. Of the 396,672 people living in South Canara, 10,877 were Christians. Padre José Miguel Luis de Mendes, a Goan Catholic priest, was appointed Vicar of Our Lady of Rosary at Mangalore on 7 December 1799. He took a lot of interest in the re-establishment of the community from 1799 to 1808. Later, British general John Goldsborough Ravenshaw II was appointed collector of South Canara. He took active part in the re-establishment of their former possessions and recovery of their estates. He constructed a church for them, which was completed in 1806. Their population almost doubled in 1818. According to various parish books existing that time, Mangalorean Catholics numbered 19,068 in South Canara (12,877 in Mangalore and Bantwal, 3,918 in Moolki, 2,273 in Cundapore and Barcoor). Seventeen churches which were earlier destroyed by Tippu were rebuilt. After relocation, the community prospered under the British, and the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa commenced again. Regarding the Christians, Stokes mentioned, "They have raised themselves to a name unquestionably the most respectable in every situation in which they move in Kanara, whether as holding high public". The Mangalorean Catholics gradually prospered under the British.
The opening of the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many handicraft and tile-manufacturing industries to the region and led to a large-scale rise in employment. In 1836-7, when the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil, Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese priest, was appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorization from the Pope. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, while some of them continued to be under the jurisdiction of Goa. The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups — one under Goa and the other under Verapoly. Under the leadership of Joachim Pius Noronha, a Mangalorean Catholic priest, and John Joseph Saldanha, a Mangalorean Catholic judge, the Mangalorean Catholics sent a petition to the Holy See in 1840 to establish Mangalore as a separate Vicariate to ward off the differences. Conceding to their request, Pope Gregory XVI established Mangalore as a separate Vicariate on 17 February 1845 under the Verapoly Carmelites. The Mangalore Mission was then transferred to the French Carmelites by a Bull dated 3 January 1870. During the regime of Carmelites, the Mangalorean Catholics constantly sent memorandums to the Holy See to send Jesuits to Mangalore to start institutions for higher education, since the youth frequently had to go to Bombay and Madras for educational purposes. The Roman Catholic Church studied the situation and Pope Leo XIII by the "Brief of 27 September 1878" handed over the Mangalore mission to the Italian Jesuit of Naples, who reached Mangalore on 31 December 1878. The Italian Jesuits played an important role in education, health, and social welfare of the community and built the St. Aloysius College in 1880, St Aloysius Chapel in 1884, and many other institutions and churches. On 25 January 1887, Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Mangalore, which is considered to be an important landmark in the community's history. In 1901, Mangalorean Catholics accounted for 76,000 of the total 84,103 Christians in South Canara., while in 1962, they numbered 186,741. During the mid-nineteenth century, Bishop Victor R. Fernandes, a Mangalorean Catholic priest, erected a large cross at former outskirts of Mangalore in Nanthoor near Padav hills to honour the memory of Mangalorean Catholic martyrs who died on the march and during their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam. During the later 20th century, they started migrating to other parts of India, especially Bombay and Bangalore. Till 1930 it was boom time when 
educated young Mangalorean Catholic men were drawn to Bombay from Mangalore in search of lucrative employment. It is to be noted however that the lower working class received no support from 
those of the upper class of their community in Bombay, Westernisation of habits and the rejection of the mother tongue was the reason for a sharp cleavage between the two classes. In 1930s, the profession taken up by the lower classes were as taxi drivers and fitters and as domestic service in homes. The men lived in "koods" mainly in Central and South Bombay. There were about 400 Mangalorean Catholics then in Bombay. The first Mangalorean Catholic to settle down in Madras in the 1940s was "Dewan Bahadur" Alexio Pinto.
Independent India (1947–present).
During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and Mangalore, after introduction of ships by the London based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay. The bicentenary anniversary of the release from captivity was widely celebrated on 4 May 1999 by the Mangalorean Catholic community. Five Catholics walked from Seringapatam to Mangalore to retrace the 278 km route that Tippu Sultan forced the Christians to take in 1784. The commemorative march ended on May 11 at the Rosario Cathedral, Mangalore. Events related to Mangalorean Catholics that took place in Mangalore, and made national headlines were the attacks on Christian churches in September 2008.

Fire Zuave

Fire Zuave is an American indie rock band formed in 2007 in West Palm Beach, Florida.
History.
Chuck Andrews, formerly of Cleveland-based Americana band Qwasi Qwa, relocated to South Florida in 2004. There, he began performing as a solo artist. Soon thereafter, Chuck met Chris Cartrett, formerly of Doorway27, and both decided to join forces as The Guns. By late 2007, the band was already opening for international acts such as the Black Crowes, and recording their first album "Sand Fastened". Around the same time, they changed their name to fire Zuave. In mid-2008, drummer Jason Hermes left the band and was replaced by drummer Jason Fusco.
In support of their first album, fire Zuave began touring in 2008. Their Athens, GA, performance included Disney Herpes, a one-off skit show created by David Barnes and Kevin Barnes, with the help of Josh Skinner. In December 2008, the band opened for of Montreal and the Fiery Furnaces during a handful of dates across Florida. The band has subsequently opened for of Montreal in 2009 and 2010.
Sand Fastened was released in May 2008 to generally favorable reviews. It also granted the band the "Artist of the Week" spot on the Indie Face Of Music blog. On April 7, 2009, the band's second album, "Oscillation Isolator" was released independently. David Barnes is credited with "Sand Fastened" and also contributes, along with Nina Barnes, to the "Oscillation Isolator" artwork.
In 2009, Chuck Andrews and Jason Fusco relocated to Athens, Georgia, and Chris Cartrett departed from the band. In July 2009, Pete Alvanos, aka Fabulous Bird, joined the band and they began work on their third album. The band's first music video, "Colors of the Sun", was voted into the semi-finals for the 2009 Babelgum Music Video Awards. Fire Zuave was featured by Polyvinyl Records at the 2010 SXSW music festival.
Style.
The band's first album, "Sand Fastened", shows a mix of alternative country, acoustic and indie rock, ranging from fast-paced power pop numbers, such as opening track "Starving Like A Pack Of Wolves" or "Translated Dragon" to mellower, acoustic-tinged ballads, such as "Colors Of The Sun" or "Emily." "Oscillation Isolator" has a more psychedelic folk rock influence, though the alternative country influence is still apparent.
Despite the involvement of Of Montreal's Kevin Barnes in band recordings, Fire Zuave's music bears little resemblance to of Montreal's, yet like of Montreal, the band continues to evolve in style. During their stage show masked actors climb around the stage, and avant garde sculptures create a more theatrical and psychedelic atmosphere, similar to of Montreal. Their use of ping pong balls in the band's promotion is widely documented.

Peronne Goguillon

Peronne Goguillon (died 29 May 1679) was an alleged French witch. She and the other women who were accused with her are regarded the last women to have been burned at the stake for witchcraft in France.
On 8 May 1679, four soldiers from the garrison at Marchiennes, near Douai, behaved violently in a village in Bouvignies. They demanded money from the villagers, and took one of them, Peronne Goguillon, with them and accused her of being a witch. On 10 May, her husband Andrieu Dufosset complained about this, but the next day, Michel Fontenier, the landlord of one of the soldiers, confirmed that she was a witch, possibly in fear of the soldiers. 
Twenty witnesses were called to the trial. Peronne was accused of having violated the holy sacrament, visited the witch's sabbath, having met the devil in shape of a black dog called Fréquette, cast spells on children, women and cattle, performed an abortion, and killed children. Three marks were found upon her body. She was eventually made to confess that they were given her by the devil. She pointed out her cousin Jeanne Goguillon, Jeanne Bachy, Jean Bachy, Pierre Hornet and her daughter Marie-Anne Dufosset (age 18) as witches on 24 May. Two days later, she also identified Marie-Anne Ducrocquet, Andrieu Fischel, Philippote Fischel, and Madeleine Truan. On 28 May, Peronne was judged guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to death by burning. The sentence was carried out 29 May 1679. 
Jeanne Goguillon was burned 3 July 1679 after a mark was found on her body. Marie-Anne Dufosset was judged guilty on the same charges as her mother and burned. These are regarded as the last women to be executed for witchcraft in France; the last women were put on trial in 1748 and 1768, but sentenced to fines; however, the last person to be executed for sorcery in France was male, Louis Debaraz, who was executed in 1745.

Mangalorean Catholic cuisine

The Mangalorean Catholic Cuisine is the cuisine of the Mangalorean Catholic community and is largely influenced by Mangalorean, Goan, and Portuguese cuisines.
Mangalorean Catholics are Roman Catholics from Mangalore and the former South Canara district on the southwestern coast of India. They are Konkani people and speak the Konkani language. Most of the ancestors of Mangalorean Catholics were Goan Catholics, who had migrated to South Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 during the Goa Inquisition and the Portuguese-Maratha wars. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics is a blend of Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted the local Mangalorean culture but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions.
Non-vegetarian cuisine.
Their curry uses a lot of coconut and curry leaves while ginger, garlic and chilli are also used. Mangalorean Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in "Laitao", the famous pork roast served as the "Pièce de résistance" at wedding dinners, and "Pork Sorpotel". Fabled cooks like Davidam or Alicebai were called in to help with the repast. Mangalorean Catholics mix pork blood and other parts in most of their pork delicacies as can be seen from "Pork Bafat", "Cabidela" and "Kalleze un Kiti" (heart and intestines). "Sanna–Dukra Maas" ("Sanna" – idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; "Dukra Maas" – Pork) and "Unde–Dukra Maas" ("Unde" – leavened bread; "Dukra Maas" – Pork) are popular dishes. "Chicken Indaz" is also popular. The traditional "Rosachi kadi" (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with "ros" (coconut milk) is quite popular and is served during the "Ros" (anointing) ceremony that is held 1 or 2 days before a Mangalorean Catholic wedding. Their fish curry especially their Fish Roe Curry, is known for its taste in the whole of coastal India while fried fish in their style is well known. The Sheveo Roce and Pathal Bakri (a variant of "Kori Rotti") are dry rice flakes dipped in chicken gravy dishes.
Vegetarian cuisine.
The ""Balthazaar Chutney"" is a popular condiment. The dish originated when Balthazaar, a Mangalorean Catholic nobleman, was taken prisoner by Tippu Sultan in 1784 during the Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam. Unable to stomach the indifferent camp food, he offered to make a chutney for the captured Mangalorean Catholics. 
The "Pollu", a type of Sambhar with "Galmbi" (powdered dried fish) or "Kambulmas" (Dried Tuna) is popular. The traditional "Fode" is a popular pickle. "Thail Piao", which means literally vegetables dumped with oil and onions and left to boil on the fire wood is quite popular. "Karamb" (Cucumber salad) and "Foka" (Lady’s finger combined with cashewnuts). The "Appam" (rice balls) and "Panpole" (a type of pancake) are popular delicacies made of soaked rice, water and salt. The "Thath Bakri" is a banana leaf rice dish made with ground red boiled rice mixed with raw scraped coconut and roasted on a tava on a banana leaf. The "Mitais", "Mandas", "Ushae", "Pitae" and "Mani" are well known sweet dishes.
"Kuswar" is a term often used to mention a set of unique Christmas goodies which are part of the cuisine of the Mangalorean Catholic community There are as many as 22 different traditional recipes that form this distinct flavour of Christmas celebration in Mangalore. Neuries are puffs stuffed with plums, nuts, and fried theel (sesame) and sugar. "Kidyo" or "Kulkuls" are curly concoctions dipped in sugar treacle, pathekas are savoury of green "nandarkai" bananas, theel laddus and jaw snapping "Golios". Macaroons is what Manglore is famous for and the subtle flavored rose cookies are a hot favorite. But it is the Rich Plum Cake which takes the better part of a week to make. Candied fruit, plums, currents, raisins are dexterously cut and soaked in rum. Flour sieved and gently warmed in the sun. Nuts shelled and chopped and the whole family comes together to make the cake. Jobs are allotted, one to whip up the eggs, while another creams the butter and sugar, cake tins are lined, and a strong pair of arms requisitioned to do the final mixing and stirring.
"Patrode" or "Pathrade", a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is also popular. The Mangalorean Catholic version of this steamed delicacy is a slight variation on the Tuluva recipe. More spicy, it is fried in "Meet Mirsang" (salt and chilly), a red chilli masala, which is a popular condiment used to flavour Mangalorean Catholic dishes.

Greenhouse gas emissions in Kentucky

The report “Kentucky Greenhouse Gas Inventory” provides a detailed inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks for Kentucky in 1990. Emissions were estimated using methods from EPA’s 1995 guidance document State Workbook: Methodologies for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In 1990, Kentucky emitted 35.4 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE). In addition, Kentucky estimated emissions of 0.4 MMTCE from biofuels. Emissions from biofuels are not included.
The principal greenhouse gases were carbon dioxide, comprising 87.9 million metric tons (24.0 MMTCE), and methane, with 1.1 million metric tons (6.4 MMTCE). Other emissions included 0.0016 million metric tons of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) (4.8 MMTCE), and 0.003 million metric tons of nitrous oxide (0.2 MMTCE)
The major source of carbon dioxide emissions was fossil fuel combustion (96%), the majority of which is utility coal. Minor emissions came from cement and lime production and forest/grassland conversion. Carbon dioxide sinks (i.e., an increase in forest carbon storage) offset about 26% of the total carbon dioxide emissions.
Sources of methane emissions were coal mining (73%), domesticated animals (12%), landfills (10%), manure management (3%), and natural gas/oil extraction (2%).
Nitrous oxide emissions were from fertilizer use. Sources of perfluorocarbons were HCFC-22 production (91%) and aluminum production (9%).
Kentucky’s emissions in 1990 were 9.6 MTCE per capita, compared to 1990 U.S. emissions of 6.4 MTCE per capita. Kentucky’s per capita emissions are high due to the large volume of coal-related activities in the state.

Sub-irrigated planter (SIP) is a generic name for a special type of planting box used in container gardening and commercial landscaping. A SIP is any method of watering plants where the water is introduced from the bottom, allowing the water to soak upwards to the plant through capillary action. It is possible to automate the watering and thus SIPs are popular with professional landscapers in buildings or urban settings. SIPs are available as products, under brand names such as Planter Technology (commercial) and EarthBox (consumer), or as do-it-yourself projects made from plastic buckets and boxes.

Dwight Johns

Brigadier General Dwight Frederick Johns (16 May 1894 – 8 November 1977) was an American soldier and general in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his service in the South West Pacific Area during World War II, where he headed the Advance Base and the Combined Operations Service Command during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna-Gona. He later commanded the Advance Base at Lae and Finschhafen, and the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. After the war he headed the Pacific Engineer Division, where he was responsible for a number of important flood control and irrigation projects.
Education and early life.
Dwight Frederick Johns was born in Rockford, Illinois on 16 May 1894. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point as an appointee from Illinois in 1912 and graduated sixth in the class of 1916. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers in June 1916.
World War I.
Johns initially served at the United States Military Academy as an instructor in the Department of Tactics but in July 1916 he was posted to the 1st Battalion of Mounted Engineers on the Mexican Border. He served with the Pancho Villa Expedition from November 1916 to February 1917, when the 8th Engineers returned to El Paso, Texas. Johns was promoted to captain in May 1917 and major in May 1918. He commanded the 8th Engineers from April to August 1918. Returning to the United States Military Academy in August 1918, he became an instructor in Drawing from August to December 1918, and in Tactics from November to December 1918. From December 1918 to mid-1919 he was an instructor in Mathematics.
Between the wars.
Like most officers in the aftermath of World war I, Johns was reduced in rank to his substantive rank of captain in August 1919, but was promoted to major again in February 1921. In June 1921 he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in June 1922 with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in civil engineering. He then became Assistant District Engineer of the Detroit River and Harbour District. In 1924 he was posted to the 11th Engineers, based in the Panama Canal Zone. He returned to the United States in 1927 to take up an appointment in the Office of the Chief of Engineers. From 1931 to 1933 he was a student at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. After graduating, he became District Engineer at St Paul, Minnesota. On 1 July 1937, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He attended the U.S. Army War College from 1937 to 1938, then became at instructor at the Command and General Staff College.
World War II.
In 1940 Johns became commanding officer of the 21st Engineers.
The 21st Engineers were assigned the task of investigating techniques for the rapid construction of air bases. As such, Johns was involved in the development of a number of new construction techniques, most notably the use of Marston Mat.
His expertise in airbase construction led to Johns being sent to the South West Pacific as Chief Engineer, American Forces in Java. Departing Washington, D.C. by air on 14 January 1942, Johns arrived in Surabaya nine days later. His first mission was to provide airfield facilities on Java for 2,000 aircraft. Tapping into the vast resources of labour available in one of the world's most densely populated regions, Johns set about readying the required airfields. However, Java was captured by the Japanese before the aircraft arrived. 
Johns reached Australia on 28 February 1942 and became Chief Engineer, United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), with the rank of brigadier general. As such, Johns represented the US Army on the Allied Works Council, the body controlling and coordinating all construction activities in Australia. With the arrival in Australia of General Douglas MacArthur, Brigadier General Hugh John Casey, who had accompanied MacArthur from the Philippines, became Chief Engineer at General Headquarters (GHQ), South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Johns, who was in an earlier class at West Point than Casey, remained Chief of Engineers, USAFIA until 25 May 1942, when he became Chief of Staff of US Army Services of Supply (USASOS). 
When the Kokoda Track campaign became mired in logistical difficulties, MacArthur and General Sir Thomas Blamey agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) under New Guinea Force to co-ordinate logistical activities in Papua-New Guinea. Johns was designated commander of both COSC and the Advance Base, New Guinea on 8 October 1942. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, a Royal Australian Engineers officer. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC but Johns chose to exercise command of the Australian units through Secombe. They built an organization that "was a radical departure from that which the Australian Army considered normal administrative procedure, but was adequately to meet the novel demands of a campaign in a country lacking roads and railways, in which all transport had to be by sea or air, and in which often the administrative or base areas coincided with the operational areas." Johns later wrote that:
Johns impressed Australian officers with his sensitive handling of inter-Allied issues, his co-operative nature, and his ability to get the job done. Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, who came to regard Johns as a close friend, later described Johns and Secombe as "born co-operators." One of Johns' most important decisions involved the construction of a new deep-water berth for Liberty ships at Tatana Island. This involved building a causeway out to the island. The project would double the capacity of the port of Port Moresby, but in order to build it Johns had to divert the African-American 96th Engineers from work on the airfields around Port Moresby, raising fears from airmen like Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead that the airfields would not be ready for all-weather operations by the time that the rainy season arrived. Rains in late October did indeed close three airfields but the causeway opened on 30 October and the wharf accepted its first ship on 3 November. 
Johns relinquished his roles in Papua and resumed his former post at USASOS in March 1943, being replaced by Brigadier General Hanford MacNider. In turn, he replaced MacNider as GHQ Coordinator, Milne Bay in October 1943. As such, he was responsible for all logistical activities at what was now the major US base in Papua-New Guinea. On 15 December 1943, he became Coordinator, Finschhafen. Finschhafen was destined to become the new hub of US activity in Papua-New Guinea; but an enormous amount of work was required to get the base ready for action. For his service in New Guinea, Johns was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. 
In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was responsible for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time it was too late for the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.
Later life.
Johns was Assistant Chief of Engineers for Military Operations from June 1945 to March 1947. He reverted to his permanent rank of colonel in March 1946. In June 1947 Johns became commander of the Pacific Engineer Division, based in San Francisco, responsible for the southern half of the Pacific coast. As such he was involved with a number of important construction projects, including the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, the Folsom Dam, the Isabella Dam, the Pine Flat Lake, and the Merced River projects. Johns retired from the army as a brigadier general on 31 December 1949. In retirement, Johns was awarded the Gold Medal from the Society of American Military Engineers in 1950, and served as its president in 1953. Johns maintained the wartime friendships he had made, and with his wife Laura he entertained Australian general Sir Edmund Herring in their home in Los Angeles in 1967. Johns died on 8 November 1977.

Drummond Nature Reserve

The Drummond Nature Reserve is an A class nature reserve 10 kilometres west of Bolgart, Western Australia. Named after the botanist James Drummond, the reserve has 439 species of vascular plants within its boundaries, including two rare and seven priority species.
History.
In 1993 the land was purchased by the Mundaring district office of the Department of Conservation and Land Management and gazetted as an A class reserve. Prior to purchasing the land was uncleared freehold grazing land. Despite this use the land was in excellent condition, though evidence of grazing impact was visible in part of the eastern area of the reserve. The reserve was named after botanist James Drummond who lived in nearby Toodyay. Between 1841 and 1844 Drummond explored and collected specimens in the area which were part of his second collection.
Topography and vegetation.
The Drummond Nature Reserve is constructed with a series of lateritic hills with spillway deposits plus a small outcrop of bedrock. There have been ten different vegetation areas identified, and these are based on different soil types, topography and drainage. The area has six different woodland types, two granite heath types, a mallee vegetation type and the last two claypan wetland areas remaining in the state.
The North west corner is a Wandoo Woodland that has been affected by salinity most of the trees are either dead or affect by dieback, the understory has died and been replace by weeds. The granite areas have two types one is an area covered by "Xanthorrhoea preissii", "Gastrolobium calycinum" with a "Borya" herbfield and the other is dominated by Melaleuca, Dodonaea also with a herbfield of "Borya". The soil of mallee area is a yellow sandy clay with the dominant plants being the low dense "Eucalyptus drummondii" and Allocasuarina.
Flora.
During 1999 and 2000 the first major survey of the plants species was conducted on foot, which identified 439 species of vascular plants. This consisted of 405 native plant species and 35 alien plant species. There were two declared rare flora; the aquatic herb "Trithuria leptogyne" (this is the only known location of this species) and "Eleocharis keigheryi" in two population groups. Additionally there are seven priority species in the reserve these are;
In addition there have some other factors of interest in the flora of the Drummond Nature Reserve. The occurrence of "Cyathochaeta equitans" is the only known inland population, as this species is found predominantly in the sands of the Swan Coastal Plain. A hybrid of "Eucalyptus loxophleba" has been found with the reserve, "Schoenus" aff. "loliaceus" which may be a new species of "Schoenus" and "Rhodanthe pyrethrum" is at it northern limit.

Gerlovo

Gerlovo or Gerilovo () is a small geographic and ethnographic region in Northern Bulgaria, a hilly fertile valley in the northeastern Balkan Mountains, south of the Ludogorie region. It lies between the Lisa, Preslav-Dragoevo and Kotel-Varbitsa mountains and covers much of Varbitsa municipality of Shumen Province, with smaller parts in Omurtag municipality (Targovishte Province) and Kotel municipality (Sliven Province). The main river is the Kamchiya, which runs through the entire valley and forms the Ticha Reservoir; the only sizable town is Varbitsa. Four strategically important mountain passes run through the region: the Preslav Pass, Dervent Pass, Kotel Pass and Varbitsa Pass.
The population mostly consists of Bulgarians and Turks;there is an Alian community. The population was subject to partial islamization during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, and many of the local Muslims are islamized Bulgarians.[http://www.refikengin.com/gelenler/068.DOC[http://www.nbu.bg/historyproject/dokumenti_44-62/razdel7t8/f1bop15ae765.pdf]

Adrian Pătulea

Adrian Marian Pătulea (born 10 November 1984 in Târgovişte) is a Romanian football striker, currently playing for FC Vaslui. He was also a member of the Romanian beach soccer team.
Career.
Pătulea played for Rapid Bucharest, Astra Ploieşti and Petrolul Ploieşti in his native Romania. He spent some time in Dubai with Al Hamriya where he linked up with his former Astra coach Petre Gigiu, before moving to the UK.
Lincoln City.
In February 2008 he trained with Burgess Hill Town, but problems with his international clearance curtailed any move. He began the 2008-09 pre-season with Boston United, playing in their 2-0 friendly victory at Shirebrook Town on 12 July 2008. He then arrived at Lincoln City and requested a trial. City manager Peter Jackson's resistance was broken by the player's bizarre training ground routine and Patulea then spent six weeks training with the first team squad. During this time, he scored a second-half hat-trick against local rivals Lincoln United and appeared to have won the hearts of Lincoln supporters. It then became apparent that Patulea's former club, Petrolul Ploieşti, held his registration and his switch to Sincil Bank looked to be over when his parent club demanded a large fee from City.
City eventually managed to negotiate a deal for Patulea, and he signed for the club on 29 August 2008. His international clearance documents did not come through in time for him to play in the derby with Grimsby Town, but he scored his first League goal on his debut for Lincoln City, coming off the bench to score a goal in the Imps' 2–0 win over Barnet. Pătulea then went on to make his second appearance from the bench in the Lincoln's away defeat against Bury, before he started his first game of the season away at Brentford, taking just 30 minutes to notch his second goal in a City shirt. Pătulea then scored again in the 57th minute in the 2–0 win over Chester. He yet again found the net in the 30th minute against Chesterfield in Lincoln's 3–1 win over Chesterfield. He then came off the bench to score two goals in Lincoln's 5–1 win at Sincil Bank against Accrington Stanley. He then scored the winner in Lincoln's 1–0 win over Notts County in the 32nd minute.
Leyton Orient & Hereford United.
On 23 June 2009, he signed for Leyton Orient on a two year deal. He scored his first goal for Orient in a League Cup tie at Colchester United on 11 August 2009. In September 2010, under new Orient manager Russell Slade, Patulea went on loan to Conference National club Hayes & Yeading United. He made his debut for United in the 3–1 defeat at Kidderminster Harriers, scoring their goal but later receiving a red card for violent conduct. When he returned to Orient, he was unable to cement a place in the first team and on 22 January, his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He signed for Hereford United on 7 March in a deal that ran until the end of the season. This contract was not extended after Patulea struggled to make an impact with the Bulls.
Farul Constanţa.
In August 2011 Pătulea returned to his home country to sign with Liga II team FC Farul Constanţa. He impressed here, scoring 15 goals from 27 games, and attracted attention from bigger clubs.
CSMS Iași.
In August 2012 he joined Liga I club CSMS Iași on a two year contract. His last game for Farul Constanţa was against Iași, where Pătulea scored two goals in an eventual 4–2 loss.
He scored his first goal for CSMS on 10 August, in a game against Petrolul Ploiești. He tied the score at 2–2 in a dramatic manner, by scoring in the last minute of extra time.
Rapid Bucharest and FC Vaslui.
On July 30 2013, Adrian Patulea signed with his old club Rapid Bucharest for 1 season, following CSMS Iasi's relegation. However, after TAS's decision to relegate Rapid Bucharest because of financial problems, he terminated his contract with the Bucharest club. He did not play a match for Rapid. On September 10 2013 he signed with FC Vaslui.

Mangalorean Catholic name

Mangalorean Catholic names and surnames encompass the different naming conventions of the Mangalorean Catholic community. Historically, many of them had names of Christian saints, while Portuguese-language surnames were most commonly found. A formal Mangalorean Catholic name consists of a given name, a middle name, and a surname.
Mangalorean Catholics use English forms of their names and surnames in English-language contexts and their native language Konkani forms in Konkani-language contexts.
Male given names.
Most Mangalorean Catholic names for males follow the second declension. However, if the name ends in e, it follows the first declension, such as "Zoze" (Joseph). If the name ends in o, it follows the third declension, such as "Lorso" (Lawrence). The name follows the fourth declension if it ends in i, such as "Jākki" (Joachim). The fifth declension is observed if the name ends in u, such as "Gabru" (Gabriel), or if it ends in ãuñ, such as "Zuãuñ" (John).
Female given names.
Mangalorean Catholic female naming conventions differ for married or grown up females and young girls. In case of married or grown up females, most names (more distinctly names ending in a or e) follow the first declension.
Surnames.
After the Portuguese possession of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese consolidated their power by imposing their own government and cultural institutions in Goa. They also started spreading Christianity in Goa and converted a large population to Christianity. The Christians adopted Portuguese surnames, customs and traditions. Later due to various religious, political, economic, cultural, social causes such as the religious intolerance of the Goa Inquisition (1560), pressures and attacks from the Marathas in Goa during the late 17th and the early 18th century, food shortages, epidemics, heavy taxation, the Goan Catholics started migrating to safer lands in South Canara, where they were welcomed.
After these Goan migrants settled in South Canara, they came to be known as Mangalorean Catholics, and continued using Portuguese surnames bestowed to their ancestors by the Portuguese. Some families, however, still use their original Goud Saraswat Brahmin surnames such as Prabhu, Kamat, Shet, Naik, Pai, and Shenoy. These original surnames are actually the names of five classes of persons and originally mean "lord, cultivator, merchant, warrior and writer". To capture their tradition, many have reverted to their original family surnames. Four of these are Goud Saraswat Brahmin surnames, with the exception of Shet that is used by a few who trace their origins to the Daivadnya Brahmins of Goa. A minuscule percentage descended from local converts still use the surname Padval. These ancestral pre-conversion surnames of the Mangalorean Catholics are called "paik" in Konkani. Mudartha is a unique Mangalorean Catholic surname to be found among some who hail from the Udupi district.
Presently, Portuguese surnames are also observed in Goan Catholics and East Indian Catholics and some other Christians in India. Portuguese surnames are very popular across the world and significantly found in Portugal, Brazil, Macau, Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and Mozambique.

Boulevard de Magenta

The boulevard de Magenta is located in the Ninth and Tenth arrondissements of Paris, France.
It begins at place de la République and 1, rue Beaurepaire, and ends at 1, boulevard de Rochechouart and 53, boulevard de la Chapelle. 
Etymology.
It is named after the battle of Magenta, a battle fought on 4 June 1859 near Magenta in Italy. It was a victory by the Piedmontais of the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and by the French armée d'Italie under general Mac-Mahon and Napoléon III over the Austrians under Guylay.
History.
The creation of the boulevard de Magenta was part of the Hausmannian transformation of Paris. It was completed in 1855 between rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin and the boulevard de Rochechouart (the boulevard here in fact follows the route of the old rue du Nord which formed a part of an 1827 subdivision) and in 1859 between place de la République and rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin.

Sibford Gower

Sibford Gower is a village and civil parish about west of Banbury in Oxfordshire, on one side of the Sib valley. It is the sister village of Sibford Ferris. Sibford Gower is on the edge of the Cotswolds and much of the village is within a conservation area.
History.
The Sibfords sit close to an ancient trackway which once ran between south-west England and York. Sibford Gower's situation on the top of a hill, close to this trade route, made it an early site for settlement. The Domesday Book records two Norman landowners in the village. William, son of Corbician, had about 1,000 acres, and the other, with a similar amount of land, was Hugh de Grantmesnil. The community's strong connection with religious activity began in the 1100s, when the Knights Templar established a chapel in the village. This was taken over by the Knights Hospitaller in 1312, who ran the chapel until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A group of Cistercians also lived in the village between 1194 and 1349. Like other Cotswold villages, Sibford Gower became affluent as the wool trade boomed in the 1400s. There is no record of the village being directly involved in the Civil War. However, Parliamentarian sympethisers were executed on the outskirts of the village, at a place that has since been known as Traitor's Ford. In 1773, 2000 acres of land in Sibford Gower were enclosed, resulting in many villagers leaving to look for work in local towns.
The Manor House was built in the 17th century and substantially remodelled between 1907 and 1915 by Frank Lascelles (1975-1934, pageant master, artist and sculptor).
Today the village is affluent and attracts a small number of tourists each year, being situated close to several Cotswold walkways.
Clockmakers.
Sibford Gower became associated with clock-making in the seventeenth century. Thomas Gilkes' son was born in Sibford Gower in about 1665. He was called Thomas after his father, and he became a clockmaker. There is no known record of where the younger Thomas learnt his trade, but as he was a Quaker he would have been apprenticed to a fellow Quaker; possibly Richard Gilkes of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in London. Thomas Gilkes died in 1743.
Thomas Gilkes trained two of his sons as clockmakers: a third Thomas (1704–57), who then worked in Charlbury as both a clockmaker and a Quaker minister, and Richard (1715–87) who established his business in West Adderbury. John Fardon (1700–43) of Deddington also served his apprenticeship with the elder Thomas Gilkes in Sibford. Gilkes pioneered a clockmaking industry in north Oxfordshire villages with such success that his fellow-Quakers, including several further members of the Gilkes and Fardon families, dominated the trade in parts of the district for the next 150 years.
Later clockmakers in Sibford Gower were also Quakers. John Wells' date of birth is unknown but he was married in the Friends' Meeting House in 1785. He moved his business to Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire, and he died in 1809. Ezra Enock (1799–1860) was born in Sibford Gower. From 1827 he traded in Whitechapel in East London, but in 1832 he returned to Sibford Gower where he remained for the rest of his life. His son John Enock (1834–83) traded as a clock repairer in adjoining villages.
Religious Buildings.
The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity was built in 1840. It is actually in the village of Burdrop, which is part of the parish and contiguous with Sibford Gower. Before 1840, Anglican villagers walked to nearby Swalecliffe for services.
Sibford Gower has a Methodist Church, which is a member of the Chipping Norton and Stow-on-the-Wold Methodist Circuit.
The Religious Society of Friends has a meeting house in Sibford Gower. It was built on land bought for the purpose in 1681 by Bray D'Oyley, Thomas Fardon and Thomas Gilkes.
Amenities.
Sibford Gower Endowed Primary School was founded in 1623. The 17th century school building was demolished in 1866 and replaced by a new one, which was enlarged in 1900 and 1960.
Sibford Gower has a gastropub, The Wykham Arms.

Jean Delvaux

Jean Delvaux (died 2 April 1595) was a Belgian Roman Catholic monk and an alleged witch.
In 1595, a great scandal occurred among the monks at an Abbey at Stavelot in the Ardennes. The monk Jean Delvaux claimed, that at the age of fifteen, he met a man in the woods who promised him riches if he followed him, which he had done, and he had given him two marks on his shoulders. He told him to become a monk at Stavelot, and promised that he would become an abbot. He had become a monk, and discovered many magicians among priests and monks. He said, that they were nine convents of wizards in the Ardennes, who gathered on the nights with demons to eat, dance and have sex. 
Delvaux was arrested by the order of the Prince Bishop of Liége. An investigation was made. On the way to Stavelot, the carriage of the commission broke down, and Delvaux claimed that a demon hade destroyed it. Delvaux was accused of being insane. Until the 10 January 1597, many people were questioned in connection to his accusations, both men and women from the public as well as people from the church. He was tortured and then turned over to the secular authorities. He was judged guilty and sentenced to death. As he was remorseful and asked for mercy, he was executed through decapitation and not by burning.

A Bf 109 of 4./JG 26 was claimed on 30 September, while Kingaby claimed four enemy aircraft, (three Bf 109's) in the second half of October. In November he shot down six Bf 109's, four of them (including 1 'probable') in a single day on 15 November.
During 1941 RAF Fighter Command went onto the offensive with its fighter sweeps over occupied Europe. With 92 Squadron, Sgt Kingaby claimed a dozen more kills and was dubbed by the press the "109 specialist". In October 1941 he was commissioned as an officer and rested from operations. 
In March 1942 he was back on operations with No. 111 Squadron. That April, Kingaby joined No. 64 Squadron, with which he shot down another couple of German fighters. Later in the year Kingaby was posted to No. 122 Squadron as flight commander and then squadron commander.

AlarmForce initially relied on franchisees to distribute to the major markets in Canada. However, it soon gave up the franchisee model to use its own resources for expansion. This model proved to be more successful and AlarmForce adopted it on a permanent basis. Today, AlarmForce manufactures, installs and monitors its own security systems using its own proprietary technology, without outsourcing any of the processes. AlarmForce went public in 1997.
Product launch years.
The company launched a two way voice alarm system called AlarmVoice in 1991. This was followed by the launch of AlarmPlus in 2000, and in early 2008, the personal emergency response system AlarmCare. In October 2011, AlarmForce launched VideoRelay, a video surveillance system with live two-way voice.
American expansion.
In November 2004 AlarmForce began its US expansion with its entry to the state of North Carolina. In December 2006 AlarmForce entered Ohio and this was followed by entry into Georgia, in 2007. In 2010 AlarmForce entered the state of Minnesota. In April 2011, the home alarm company expanded into the State of Florida. AlarmForce now services 11 major US centers located in Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Tampa Bay-St.Petersburg, Sarasota and Orlando. This expansion will continue over the next 24 months.
Revenue.
AlarmForce recorded revenues of CAD $37 million in 2010 and a subscriber base of over 130,000. As of April 30, 2011, revenues were $20 million and the subscriber base grew to 119,600.

Maguire v SOCOG 1999

Maguire v SOCOG 1999 was a decision of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which ruled on 18 October 1999 that a blind man had been directly discriminated against by the failure of a government agency to provide ticketing materials for the Sydney Olympic Games in braille.
The Commission held it was not reasonable for the agency to rely on alternatives such as telephone information lines or an assumption the respondent could have the materials read to him by another. The Commission also held that the cost of providing materials in braille should be considered in the context of an agency's overall budget rather than an assessed cost-benefit of the number of potential users of that material.
Background to the case.
Bruce Lindsay Maguire (b 1957) a small business owner from Baulkham Hills, New South Wales, was born totally blind and without sight or light perception. On 31 May 1999 Maguire sought to purchase tickets for himself and his family for the Sydney Olympic Games. At the time tickets were only available via an application form in a ticket book issued by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
Maguire initially tried to have the ticket book read aloud to him by his sister, but the level of detail and cross-referencing required in this process was onerous and the attempt was abandoned after several hours. Maguire then enquired about obtaining a braille version of the ticket book. SOCOG indicated a braille version would be published but this did not occur. On 7 June 1999 Maguire was contacted by SOCOG to advise that the book would not be printed in braille as the cost was considered too high given the likely small number of braille-literate users.
Maguire then lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, alleging direct discrimination against him personally, and indirect discrimination against those with vision impairment. The specific grounds for the complaint were: 
In September 1999 this third ground for complaint was separated from the others and formed the basis for the standalone decision in "Maguire v SOCOG 2000"
Prior to the matter being heard, SOCOG instituted a telephone helpline for ticketing enquiries by the visually impaired.
Arguments.
Jurisdiction of HREOC.
SOCOG initially objected to the Commission hearing the complaint on jurisdictional grounds. SOCOG argued it was a government agency and not a trading corporation and therefore not captured by section 12 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Instead, SOCOG argued the complaint should be heard by State disability tribunals.
On 24 September 1999 SOCOG withdrew its objection to the complaint being heard but indicated it may renew it should the matter proceed to the Federal Court. Commissioner William Carter maintained the Commission was competent to hear the complaint but was not required to formally rule on the objection as it was withdrawn prior to hearing.
Direct discrimination.
In failing to provide the ticket book in braille, the Commissioner found that SOCOG breached section 24 of the Act. SOCOG argued that the delivery of the information in the ticket book did not constitute the provision of services within the meaning
of section 24. The Commissioner did not accept that argument as the services provided by SOCOG fell inside the definition stated in section 4, in which SOCOG was providing tickets to sessions at the 2000 Olympics where SOCOG cannot refuse as the terms of conditions for the tickets was the same for Maguire as for any sighted person and that the ticketing process was integral to gaining a ticket to attend and to enjoy the entertainment provided by SOCOG. In providing the ticket book in print and not in braille meant that Maguire was denied access to the ticket book, the consequential services provided by SOCOG and accordingly, Maguire was denied the opportunity to make a valid application for tickets to the Olympic games.
Less favourable treatment.
The commissioner felt that unless Maguire could have access to the information in order to make a valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person. SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet. The commissioner dismissed those arguments. Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and hours of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected in all respect the final decided choices of That person. The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the ticket book which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation. The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the ticket book was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline. The vital information in the ticket book was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad.
Unjustifiable hardship.
SOCOG argued that the provision of the ticket book in braille was an unjustifiable hardship under section 24 (2). Using Section 24 and section 11 of DDA 1992, the commissioner found that despite the small proportion of blind persons in the community who use Braille, SOCOG had the financial capacity to bear the additional cost as the cost of 200 braille copies of the ticket book would be $17,250.00 in comparison to the ticket book printing and distribution expenditure noted in SOCOG's budget which was $7.18 million.
Indirect Discrimination.
The commissioner found that SOCOG in not providing the ticket book in braille treated Maguire less favourably than persons without the disability which is also a breach of section 6.
Decision.
After finding in favour of Maguire, under section 103(1)(b)(ii) of the act, the commissioner made a declaration that SOCOG provide to Maguire forthwith the second booklet and that prior to
8 October, that SOCOG consult and inform Maguire as best it can of the classes and sessions for which tickets remain available and assist him in making a valid application for the remaining tickets by 8 October 1999. Consequently, the commissioner made a further declaration that, if Maguire desire to engage in the final ticketing process and SOCOG is unable to
provide Maguire with the third booklet in Braille by 23 October, SOCOG again consult with Maguire and inform and assist him in the same manner as described in the second declaration above.

Iran Gas Trunkline

Iran Gas Trunkline (IGAT) is the series of large diameter pipelines constructed from gas producing areas in the south of Iran (Kuzestan and Bushehr Provinces) in order to transfer natural gas to the consumption centres in northern part of the country.
As of 2008, there are five trunkline in operation, two under construction and two under planning.
History.
IGAT1 was completed in October 1970, supplying the Southern Caucasus republics of the Soviet Union. In 1975 the National Iranian Gas Company concluded agreements with Ruhrgas, Gaz de France, the Soviet Union, and Austria's OMV, to supply gas to Western Europe via a proposed IGAT II. Under the arrangement, Iran was to supply additional gas to the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union was to pipe gas to Czechoslovakia from its own gas fields in Siberia. Construction of IGAT II halted following the Iranian Revolution.

Presidential elections were held in Bougainville (an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea) from November 30 to December 18, 2008. Voters elected the new President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, following the death of President Joseph Kabui while in office, on June 7.
The potential resumption of controversial mining activities, which were at the root of Bougainville's civil war in the 1990s, was reportedly a key issue in this election.
The two main candidates appeared to be Papua New Guinea's former mining minister Sam Akoitai and former rebel soldier Sam Kaouna. In total, 14 candidates stood in the election.
James Tanis, a former separatist who came third in the 2005 election behind Kabui and the former governor John Momis, won the election, as announced on 28 December 2008. He was sworn in on 6 January 2009.

The State Coach Britannia is an enclosed, six horse-drawn carriage. The carriage was completed in 2010 by coachbuilder W.J. Frecklington, renowned for having built the 1988 Australian State Coach. Although completed in 2010, as of June 2012 the coach had still not been shipped to London. At that point, the British monarchy was claiming that Frecklington had completed the coach of his own initiative and that it was not an official royal coach, although Frecklington stated that the coach was endorsed (but not commissioned) by Buckingham Palace.
Frecklington's intention was to create a coach that would encapsulate the history and heritage of the United Kingdom by incorporating material from Britain’s historic buildings, ships and other artifacts. The State Coach Britannia is therefore an especially wide-ranging representation of the great events, figures and objects of British history ever assembled, items directly related to more than 30 kings and queens of England, Scotland and Ireland, the most influential characters in British history, her greatest victories, her most treasured places, and her greatest contributions to the world.
Frecklington funded the construction of the coach as a private initiative. The coach weighs 2.75 tons and is and . Like the Australian State Coach, the Britannia has electric windows, heating and hydraulic stabilisers.

Zlatiya (region)

Zlatiya (, often with a definite article: Златията, "Zlatiyata"; also "Zlatia", "Zlatija") is a small geographic region in Northern Bulgaria. Zlatiya is a low asymmetrical plateau in the northwestern part of the country, a subregion of the Danubian Plain. It lies between three rivers: the Tsibritsa to the west, the Ogosta to the east and the Danube to the north. The plateau's elevation is around 100-150 metres above mean sea level, the highest point reaching 176 m near the Danube. The soil is a fertile chernozem; no rivers cross the plateau, but by heavy rainfall the ravines are drained away to the east by the Ogosta river and ultimately into the Danube. Zlatiya has been an Important Bird Area since 2005 (parts of it since 1997)and has been included in the EU's Natura 2000 ecological network. The protected area covers 434.987 square kilometres.[http://www.stroitelstvo.info/show.php?storyid=471384
Although most of the region is composed of arable land, there are still some extant small forests. The main local product has traditionally been grain, leading to Zlatiya's labeling as "Bulgaria's northwestern granary", a comparison to Dobruja.
The population mainly consists of Bulgarians, although there is a sizable Roma minority. A local centre is the town of Valchedram, Montana Province. The region's name roughly means "golden land".

Oswald Kaduk

Oswald Kaduk (August 26, 1906 – May 31, 1997) was a German SS-"Unterscharführer" and "Rapportführer" at Auschwitz concentration camp.
Biography.
The son of a blacksmith, Kaduk was born in Königshütte, Upper Silesia. After attending the Volksschule he trained as a butcher before becoming one in 1924. As well as working at the local slaughterhouse, Kaduk also held positions with fire fighting services at the municipal fire brigade in Chorzów and at a chemical plant.
World War II.
In 1939 he joined the Allgemeine SS and in 1940 he was drafted into the Waffen-SS. He was sent to the Eastern Front, but due to various illnesses and stays at military hospitals he was posted to Auschwitz in 1941. At first he was assigned to watch tower duties in 1942, then became Blockführer and finally Rapportführer. One prisoner reported that he had a weakness for schnapps.
Kaduk was considered to be "one of the cruelest, brutalest, most vulgar" of SS men at Auschwitz:
Historian Andrew Roberts in his book "The Storm of War" recounted Kudak's practice of handing Jewish children balloons just before they were murdered with a phenol injection to the heart at a rate of ten children per minute.
Kaduk also witnessed the mass murder of people in gas chambers. On describing his SS colleagues inserting the Zyklon B gas, Kaduk has said:
Kaduk is also known for Kaduk's chapel, a tiny tower between the barracks and the main camp of Auschwitz.
After the war.
After Germany's surrender, Kaduk worked in a sugar factory in Löbau. In December 1946 he was recognized by a former prisoner and consequently arrested by a Soviet military patrol. In 1947, a Soviet military tribunal sentenced him to 25 years hard labour, but he was reprieved in April 1956.
Kaduk then went to West Berlin, working at hospital as a nurse. Despite his violent reputation at Auschwitz, he earned himself the nickname "Papa Kaduk" among patients.
In July 1959 Kaduk was again arrested, and appeared in the Auschwitz Trials in Frankfurt where he was one of the main accused. On August 19, 1965 the court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder in ten cases, and joint murder in at least one thousand cases. Because of the gravity of Kaduk's deeds, the responsible "Spruchkammern" rejected various pleas for clemency.
While in prison, Kaduk was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about SS men stationed at Auschwitz. When asked about Holocaust denial, Kaduk says:
After the 1984 transfer to open prison ("Offener Vollzug"), Kaduk was released from the Schwalmstadt prison in 1989 due to health reasons ("Haftunfähigkeit"). He died in Langelsheim, Harz, as a pensioner in 1997, at the age of 91.

Mangalorean Catholic literature

Mangalorean Catholic literature is diverse.
History.
Mangalorean Catholics have immensely contributed towards Media Activities in Mangalore, Bombay and other cities in India. The "Konkani Dirvem" was the first Konkani language periodical to be published in Mangalore in 1912. The founder-editor of "Konkani Dirvem" was the great poet Louis Mascarenhas.<br> After the "Konknni Dirvem", came "Raknno" weekly in 1938 as an organ of the Diocese of Mangalore. A succession of brilliant priest-editors beginning with Sylvester Menezes, Alexander D’Souza, Mark Waldar, Vincent Menezes, Samuel Sequeira and the current editor Eric Crasta has transformed "Raknno" as a literary medium and in the process bringing countless writers into the limelight. G.M.B. Rodrigues was the first Mangalorean to start a Konkani Weekly "Sukh-Dukh" in Bombay in 1948. In 1949, George Fernandes brought out a monthly "Konknni Yuvak". Other periodicals of those times were "Amchi Mai", "Sevak", "Ange", "Jezu Rai", "Kala Kiran", "Samajicho Divo", "Samajichem Ful", "Prakas", "Uzvad", "Amchem Konkan", "Maiganv", "Bhingari", "Dublleancho Bhav", "Sant Ritachi Vordi", "Catholic Yuvak" etc. "Poinnari", a Weekly, was started in Bombay in 1950 and its first editor was the wellknown novelist V.J.P. Saldanha. Later on, the famous poet and dramatist Cha. Fra. D'costa became its editor.<br> Felix Noronha is a renowned Konkani writer, who wrote the words for the Konkani hymn "Dulob Jezu" that was set to the tune of the English hymn 'What a Friend we have in Jesus'. The wellknown novelist and writer J.S. Alvares brought out "Mithr", a Weekly in 1953 and "Jhelo" a Fortnightly in 1956 in Bombay. A.A. Saldanha, J.B. Moraes and V.M. Fernandes experimented on the model of "Reader's Digest" by bringing out a monthly Konkani journal titled "Konkan Daiz" in 1958. Cha.<br> Fra. D'Costa started periodicals like "Zaag-maag", "Vishal Konkan", "Jivit" and "Udev" one after the other. "Kannik" a fortnightly from Mangalore was one more periodical started by a Mangalorean Catholic "Raymond Miranda" in 1965. Since 1994, the Catholic Sabha of Mangalore is bringing out "Amcho Sandesh" a monthly, as its organ. "Amar Konkani" a half-yearly research oriented journal was started in Mangalore in 1980 by the Konkani Institute of the St. Aloysius College. "Divo" Weekly was started in Bombay in the year 1995 with its founder-editor being J.B. Moraes.

Alucita hexadactyla

The Twenty-plume Moth (Alucita hexadactyla) is a "micromoth" of the many-plumed moth family (Alucitidae). It is found in Europe and has been introduced into North America.
The wingspan is 14–16 mm. Unlike a typical moth, which has two pairs of scaly wings, "Alucita" has about twenty thin feathery plumes (with scales on the supporting ribs). It perches with the wings outspread like a fan. The wings have a bold zigzag pattern in white, black and brown, which together with the shiny backward-pointing hairs on each plume make the adult moth distinctive.
The moth is also popularly known as the "Many-plumed Moth", while the specific name "hexadactyla" comes from the Greek for six-fingered.
The moth flies the whole year depending on the location. It is common and often found in gardens, but is readily overlooked because of its small size.
The caterpillar larvae feed on honeysuckle ("Lonicera"). They are leaf miners, tunnelling inside the leaves of the food plant to avoid predators.

Borg–McEnroe rivalry

The tennis players Björn Borg and John McEnroe met 14 times on the regular tour and 22 times in total, with their on-court rivalry highlighted by their contrasting temperaments and styles. Borg was known for his cool and emotionless demeanor on court, while McEnroe was famed for his court-side tantrums. Their rivalry extended between 1978 and 1981, with each player winning seven times against the other. Because of their contrasting personalities, their rivalry was described as "Fire and Ice".
In 1980 McEnroe reached the men's singles final at Wimbledon for the first time, where he faced Borg, who was aiming for an Open Era record fifth consecutive Wimbledon title. At the start of the final McEnroe was booed by the crowd as he entered Centre Court following his heated exchanges with officials during his semi-final clash with Jimmy Connors. In a fourth set tie-breaker that lasted 20 minutes, McEnroe saved five match points (seven altogether in that set) and eventually won 18–16. However, he was unable to break Borg's serve in the fifth set and the Swede went on to win 8–6. This match is widely considered one of the greatest tennis matches ever played. McEnroe exacted his revenge by defeating Borg at the US Open final the same year in five sets.
In 1981 McEnroe returned to Wimbledon and again faced Borg in the men's singles final. This time it was the American who prevailed and defeated Borg to end the Swede's run of 41 consecutive match victories at the All England Club. At the US Open in the same season, McEnroe was again victorious, winning in four sets. Borg retired shortly afterwards, having never won the US Open, despite reaching four finals. Their final confrontation came in 1983 in Tokyo at the Suntory Cup (invitational tournament), with Borg prevailing 6–4, 2–6, 6–2.

Legal doublet

A legal doublet is a standardized phrase used frequently in English legal language which consists of two or more words which are near synonyms. The origin of the doubling — and sometimes even tripling — often lies in the transition of legal language from Latin to French. Certain words were simply given in their Latin, French and/or English forms, often pairing an English word (or a more archaic Anglo-Saxon word) with a Latin or French synonym, so as to ensure understanding. Such phrases can often be pleonasms.

Hugh McLaughlin (politician)

Hugh McLaughlin (April 2, 1827 – December 10, 1904) was an American politician and for many years the "boss" of the Democratic Party in Brooklyn.
Life.
Hugh McLaughlin was born in Brooklyn as son of Irish immigrants. He learned the trade of a rope maker. In 1855 he became master mechanic in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. That position put a great deal of patronage at his disposal which he used to build support for the Democratic Party.
In spite of his growing influence, McLaughlin's candidacy for sheriff of Kings County failed in 1860. In 1861, however, was elected to the office of Kings County Register of Deeds, a function which he kept for three consecutive terms. 
More important than his public offices was McLaughlin's position within the Brooklyn Democratic party: In 1862 he became the boss of the Brooklyn political machine known as the "Brooklyn ring". As such, he dominated local politics for many years, despite the efforts of reform-oriented mayors like Frederick A. Schroeder and Seth Low to roll back the influence of the Brooklyn ring.
McLaughlin was thus able to play an important role in the creation of Prospect Park and the building of Brooklyn Bridge. However, after the merger of Brooklyn and New York City in 1898, McLaughlin's ring came into conflict with the political machine of Tammany Hall in New York. McLaughlin lost and was forced to retire from politics in 1903. He was succeeded as Brooklyn's political boss by John H. McCooey. McLaughlin died one year later.

With a 40-34 double overtime win over Bowling Green on November 21, the Bulls won the MAC East division and gained a berth to the MAC Championship for the first time. The Bulls won their first-ever conference championship by beating #12 ranked and previously undefeated Ball State, 42-24 on December 5. The win was also Buffalo's first-ever against a ranked opponent and ensured a winning season for the first time since Buffalo returned to the top-level of college football in 1999. They earned an invitation to the International Bowl at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, their first trip to a bowl game in their history, exactly fifty years after the Bulls turned down their only previous bowl bid, to the Tangerine Bowl, when they were told by the bowl's organizers that their two black players would not be allowed to play. The Bulls also received their first-ever votes in the "USA Today" Coaches' Poll after winning the MAC Championship when UTEP coach Mike Price voted the Bulls #23 on his ballot. On December 16, Buffalo announced head coach Turner Gill agreed to a contract extension and a raise. Gill's contract now runs through 2013 and makes him one of the highest-paid coaches in the MAC. The ending of the season was bittersweet as the Bulls lost to the Connecticut Huskies 38-20 in the International Bowl, but the Bulls were able to give about two dozen members of the 1958 Bulls team the bowl experience they missed by inviting them to be honorary captains for the game.

Place de la Nation

The place de la Nation (formerly the place du Trône, then the place du Trône-Renversé) is a square in Paris, on the border of the 11th and 12th arrondissements. It was renamed the "Place de la Nation" at the national festivities of 14 July 1880 and is served by the Paris Metro station Nation.
History.
Ancien Regime.
The city bears traces of the mur des Fermiers généraux built well beyond the buildings of Paris in a campaign to encircle houses, gardens and monasteries. Its construction left a vast grassy space of vines and market gardens as far as the medieval city wall and the walls of the gardens of the old village of Picpus, filled with major convents, schools and retreats. A throne was erected in this space on 26 July 1660 for the solemn arrival of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain following their marriage in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. This gave the square its original name of place du Trône. 
Originally the square housed two pavilions and two columns of the barrière du Trône designed by Claude Nicolas Ledoux and built for the barrier of octroi (Mur des Fermiers généraux) which surrounded the entrance to the cours de Vincennes. The columns are surmounted by statues of kings Philip II and Louis IX.
French Revolution.
During the Revolution, the square was renamed place du Trône-Renversé after 10 August 1792. A guillotine was built n the southern half of the square, near the pavilion of law built by Ledoux. Those guillotined here are buried at cimetière de Picpus and include:
19th century.
The central monument, "The Triumph of the Republic", is a bronze sculpture created by Aimé-Jules Dalou. It was erected to mark the centenary of the French Revolution, at first in plaster in 1889 and then in bronze in 1899. It represents a personification of the Republic, and looks towards place de la Bastille. The figure stands on a globe in a chariot pulled by lions and surrounded by various symbolic figures.
20th century.
On 22 June 1963, the magazine "Salut les copains" organised a concert at Place de la Nation, featuring singers such as Johnny Hallyday, Richard Anthony, Eddy Mitchell and Frank Alamo. It attracted over 150,000 young people. The headline of the following day's issue of the journal "Paris-Presse" read, "Salut les voyous !". The photographer Jean-Marie Périer, who was a friend to many of the performers, photographed the concert. The Place de la Nation continued to be the location of the foire du Trône before the pelouse de Reuilly.

Dan-Air Flight 240

Dan-Air Flight 240 was a fatal accident involving a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 series 2A turboprop aircraft operated by Dan Air Services Limited on the first stage of a night mail flight from London Gatwick Airport to East Midlands Airport. The crash, which occurred on 26 June 1981 near the village of Nailstone, Leicestershire, following major structural failure caused by the failure of a cabin door, resulted in the aircraft's destruction and the deaths of all three on board (both pilots and a cabin attendant).
The aircraft.
The aircraft, operated by Dan Air Services Ltd, was a Hawker Siddeley HS 748-108 series 2A (construction/manufacturer's serial number: 1560, registration: G-ASPL) that had its first flight in 1964. Skyways Coach-Air was its original operator. Dan-Air acquired the aircraft from Skyways International, Skyways Coach-Air's successor, in 1972. At the time of the accident it had flown 34,592 hours.
Accident.
The aircraft departed London Gatwick at 17:28 with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at East Midlands of 18:25. The crew included two pilots and a cabin attendant, in accordance with Dan-Air's policy to carry one attendant in addition to the flightdeck crew on mail flights. (The attendant was known as a "postal assistant" on these flights.)
During its initial descent towards its destination, the attendant reported that one of the cabin door's indicators was showing an unlocked condition. Shortly afterwards, the right hand rear door (the baggage door) opened, detached itself from its hinge mounts and became lodged on the leading edge of the right horizontal tailplane. Later reconstruction of the aircraft's flight path from flight recorder evidence indicated that cabin decompression occurred when it was in the vicinity of Market Bosworth.
The aircraft became uncontrollable and went into a steep dive, which terminated in several abrupt pitch oscillations. Immediately after the decompression, the pilot asked the co-pilot to transmit a "MAYDAY" and request permission from air traffic control (ATC) to come straight in for an emergency landing, reporting that he thought he had lost the rear door and that he was having severe control problems.
Shortly after, the radar controller who handled flight 240 noticed that the aircraft was turning right beyond its assigned heading; however, his attempts to contact the crew proved futile. Approximately three minutes after the last distress message, reports began to reach ATC from the police of an aircraft crash.
Several people on the ground witnessed the final moments of flight 240. The consensus of their evidence was that the stricken plane was lower than usual compared with other aircraft approaching East Midlands, and that it was losing altitude as well as oscillating in both pitch and roll. As it regained level attitude, both wings folded up almost simultaneously and became detached from the fuselage, along with other parts of the structure.
The wreckage was found scattered across several fields, approximately northeast of the village of Nailstone.
Cause.
It was concluded that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged on the leading edge of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door warning indicators to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.

XXI Bomber Command

The XXI Bomber Command (XXI BC) was a unit of the Twentieth Air Force in the Mariana Islands for strategic bombing during World War II. The command was established at Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas on 1 March 1944. After a period of organization and its assigned groups receiving their B-29 Superfortress aircraft, the command transferred first to Peterson Field, Colorado, the deployed to the central Pacific, being headquartered at Harmon Field, Guam, in the Mariana Islands. Its assigned units engaged in very long range bombardment operations primarily against Japan until mid-July 1945.
History.
The Marianas chain of islands, consisting primarily of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, were considered as being ideal bases from which to launch B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. The islands were about 1500 miles from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, they could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship. In August 1944, Major General Haywood S. Hansell, Jr was directed to take over command of the organization.
Serious planning for the movement of the XXI Bomber Command's B-29s from their Second Air Force training bases in Kansas to newly constructed combat airfields on Saipan, Tinian and Guam began in April 1944. The construction and defense of the airfields would be the United States Navy's responsibility, as would logistical support. Before the B-29s could begin operating against Japan from the Marianas, the islands first had to be taken away from the Japanese.
This began with Saipan on 11 June 1944 when a four-day naval and air bombardment of the island began. On 15 June United States Marine units stormed ashore, followed a day later by Army units. After several weeks of heavy fighting, during which over 3000 American and 24,000 Japanese lives were lost, the island was finally declared secure on July 9.
The seizure of Saipan enabled invasions of Guam and Tinian to proceed, which were attacked on July 20 and July 24 respectively. The Marine Corps and the United States Army 77th Infantry Division's 305th Regimental Combat Team landed on Guam. By August 10 the island was secured. Tinian was assaulted on July 24, and by August 1 it was secured.
Airfield construction.
Construction of the B-29 airfields on Saipan began almost immediately, even while the fighting was still going on. Naval Construction Battalions (N-C-B), the "SeaBees" began construction at a former Japanese airstrip called Aslito. This was later renamed Isely Field, after Navy Commander Robert H. Isely (unfortunately his name was misspelled and the incorrect version stuck). The SeaBees did not meet their schedule but came very close. In a little over three months they had built a support base and air field on Saipan capable of supporting the 240 B-29s of the 73d Bombardment Wing and their logistical support units.
On Tinian, the SeaBees built the largest bomber base ever, North Field. The 6th Naval Construction Brigade built four 8500-foot runways for the 313th Bombardment Wing, and all required infrastructure; then went to the west end of the island and at West Field laid down two 8500-foot runways for the 58th Bombardment Wing.
On Guam the 5th NCB built North Field for the 314th Bombardment Wing and Northwest Field for the 315th Bombardment Wing.
Initial B-29 Operations.
The 73d Bombardment Wing was ordered to the Marianas rather than to the CBI Theater after its training with Second Air Force in Kansas. The first B-29 arrived at Isely Field, Saipan on 12 October 1944. By November 22, over 100 B-29s were at Isely Field. The XXI Bomber Command was assigned the mission of destroying the aircraft industry of Japan in a series of high-altitude, daylight precision attacks. However, General Hansell was fully aware that his crews still lacked the necessary experience to carry out such missions.
In late October and early November 1944, a series of tactical raids were carried out as training exercises for the crews. On October 27, 18 B-29s attacked lightly defended Japanese installations on Truk. The submarine pens at Truk were the target, and four Superfortresses had to abort because of the usual engine problems, and combat formations were scrappy. The bombing results were mediocre, with only nine planes bombing the primary target and only a few bombs hitting it. The same two groups returned to Truk on October 30 with even fewer bombs landing on the target. The third try, on November 2, was briefed as a radar bombing mission. Again the results were indifferent, with bombs scattered all over the general target area.
Aware that there was now a new threat, Japanese aircraft based on Iwo Jima staged a low-level raid on Isely Field on November 2, damaging several B-29s on the ground. Retaliatory strikes were ordered against the two enemy airfields on Iwo Jima on November 5 and 11 with the 497th and 498th Bombardment Groups dispatched to bomb airfields there, but the results were once again poor. As in the XX Bomber Command Operation Matterhorn bombing campaign from India, the B-29s were in danger of being dissipated in tactical missions and even these were not all that successful.
In order to properly plan missions to Japan, up-to-date reconnaissance photos of the proposed targets were needed. Other than information which was used during the Doolittle Raid in 1942, there was scant information about the locations of Japanese industry, especially the aircraft industry. On 1 November 1944, two days after arriving on Saipan, A 3d Photo Reconnaissance Squadron (3d PRS) F-13A Superfortress (photo reconnaissance-configured B-29) took off bound for Tokyo. The 3d PRS was attached to the 73d Bomb Wing. The aircraft flew over Tokyo at 32,000 feet for 35 minutes taking picture after picture. A few fighters made it up to the camera plane's altitude but did not attack. These photos, along with other intelligence gave the XXI Bomber Command the locations of the Japanese aircraft manufacturing plants and enabled mission planners to plan missions for the combat crews to attack. In honor of his mission, the aircraft was named "Tokyo Rose".
The 3d PRS continued to fly single plane missions to Japan, taking high altitude pre-strike target planning photos and poststrike damage assessment photos. The losses incurred by the 3d PRS in this type of activity were relatively light. Seldom were the Japanese able to get fighters up to 30,000 feet in time to intercept the photo ships.
All four groups of the 73d Bomb Wing were sent on their first mission to Japan on November 24 with 111 planes airborne. The target was the Nakajima Aircraft Engine Plant at Musashino in the arsenal sector of Tokyo. Also, for the first time, the B-29 encountered the Jet stream, which was a high-speed wind coming out of the west at speeds as high as 200 mph at precisely the altitudes at which the bombers were operating. This caused the bomber formations to be disrupted and made accurate bombing impossible. Because of the jet stream winds and bad weather, only 24 planes attacked the primary target; the majority dropped their bombs on the secondary target of the Tokyo Docks.
The group returned to Musashino on the 27th and closed out November with a raid on the Tokyo Industrial Area and Docks. The pace picked tip the next month with a return to Musashino on December 3. Again, poor bombing results were achieved, with the high speed jet stream winds scattering the bomb drops and the aircraft in the formation, with the result of not much damage to the enemy being done. December 8 saw 82 planes attacking the Iwo Jima Air Fields (Motoyama Nos 1 and 2). Then it was back to attacking Japan, hitting Nagoya on December 18 and 22. The airfields on Iwo Jima were revisited on December 24 and Tokyo the final target of the month on December 27.
In addition to the wing strikes, December saw the initiation of another type of single plane mission: the weather strike. These were missions to Japan to collect weather data and drop nuisance bombs on Japanese cities. Again, these were high altitude missions with surprisingly low losses. The 3d PRS lost two planes in December. Out of the 75 weather strike missions flown in December, there were only three losses. During the same time period the 73rd Wing lost 21 planes to all causes on the six multi-plane raids by the wing as a whole.
The pace continued to quicken for the 73d in January. Musashino on January 9 cost six planes; Nagoya on January 14, another five. One weather strike, out of 83 flown, was lost on January 10, but help was on the way as new B-29s from the United States were arriving almost daily and new groups were arriving in the Marianas. The 313th Bombardment Wing, operating from Tinian, sent 44 planes to Pagan Island on January 16, another 33 to Truk on January 21, and 28 to attack the Iwo Jima Air fields on January 24. Thirty-thrre more returned to Iwo Jima on January 29. The 313th's 504th and 505th groups joined in the attack on Kobe on February 4, while on February 9 their sister groups, the 6th and 9th, made their initial training mission against the Moen Island Air Field on Truk.
United States Marines landed on Iwo Jima 19 February 1945 with a mission to seize the island and for Navy SeaBees to utilize the Japanese airfields to build emergency landing airfields for XXIst Bomber Command as well as fighter airfields for VII Fighter Command. On 25 March the Battle of Iwo Jima was declared over and the island secured, although mopping up continued until June. Construction Battalions extended and transformed the former Japanese fields to accommodate B-29s and the first AAF units moved in during the beginning of March.
B-29 Incendiary Operations.
The high-altitude bombing raids on Japan carried out by the command were not causing a large amount of damage to the targets, primarily due to the jet stream winds over the islands. The failure of the command to successfully carry out its mission was causing severe problems, both with the War Department in Washington, which had planned to eliminate the Japanese industrial base by the same strategic bombing techniques which were being carried out in Europe. Also General Hap Arnold and the AAF command staff which were aware of the Manhattan Project, and planned on using the B-29 to drop the Atomic Bombs, were concerned that the B-29 would be unable to carry out that highly secret mission.
Since little progress in the bombing campaign was being made, General Arnold recalled General Hansell and moved General Curtis LeMay from the inactivating XX Bomber Command in India to take over XXI Bomber Command on Saipan. General LeMay arrived in the Marianas on 20 January 1945. General LeMay had analyzed the structure of the Japanese economy, which depended heavily on cottage industries housed in cities close to major industrial areas and issued new orders on 19 February. His plan was to destroy the feeder industries, that would slow or halt the flow of vital components to the central manufacturing plants, and disorganize the production of weapons vital to Japan. LeMay decided to do this by using incendiary bombs rather than purely high-explosive bombs, which would, it was hoped, cause general conflagrations in large cities like Tokyo or Nagoya, spreading to some of the priority targets. In addition, LeMay had concluded that the effects of the jet stream, cloud cover, and high operating altitudes were to blame for the failure of the B-29 raids to do any significant damage to the Japanese war industry. The initial raids against Japan had taken place at high altitudes in order to stay above anti-aircraft fire and the effective altitude of defending fighters. LeMay suggested that high-altitude, daylight attacks be phased out and replaced by low-altitude, high-intensity incendiary raids at nighttime. The aircraft would attack individually, which meant that no formation assembly over the base at the start of the mission or along the way would be needed. This would extend the range of the aircraft and allow them to reach targets in northern Honshu and Hokkaido.
The 6th and 9th Bombardment Groups joined in the attack on Tokyo on February 25, as did the 314th Bombardment Wing's 19th Bombardment Group, flying out of North Field, Guam. With these new tactics, a total of 302 B-29s participated in a raid on Tokyo on the night of 9-10 March, with 279 arriving over the target. The raid was led by special pathfinder crews who marked central aiming points. It lasted for two hours. The raid was a success beyond General LeMay's wildest expectations. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration known as a firestorm. When it was over, sixteen square miles of the center of Tokyo had gone up in flames and nearly 100,000 people had been killed. Fourteen B-29s were lost. The B-29 was finally beginning to have an effect.
On the night of 13-14 March, eight square miles of Osaka went up in flames. On 16–17 March, three square miles of Kobe were destroyed, and on 19–20 March in a return visit to Nagoya, three more square miles were destroyed. This destructive week had killed over 120,000 Japanese civilians at the cost of only 20 B-29s lost.
A month later, on April 12, the 314th Bombardment Wing's remaining two groups, the 39th and 330th, joined in the attack on the Hodagaya Chemical Works in Koriyama. With the addition of the 39th and 330th, the XXI Bomber Command now had three wings, twelve groups, thirty-six squadrons of 15 B-29s each at their disposal. In May, the 58th Bombardment Wing completed its move from India to Tinian, adding four more groups to the XXI Bomber Command.
In April 1945, General LeMay gave new orders for more incendiary raids. This time, aircraft engine factories at Musashino and Nagoya were to be hit, but urban areas in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kawasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama were also to be attacked. On 7 April 153 B-29s struck the aircraft-engine complex at Nagoya, destroying about 90 percent of that facility. Five days later, 93 B-29s destroyed the Nakajima factory at Musashino. The Japanese aircraft engine industry essentially ceased to exist after this time. On 13 April 327 B-29s burned out eleven more square miles of Tokyo. Seven more B-29s were lost.
On 5 June, the B-29s attacked Kobe with such effectiveness that the city was crossed off the target list as not worth revisiting. By the end of the month, the six major cities on LeMay's list had all been effectively destroyed.
Late May saw the arrival of the first of the 315th Bombardment Wing, whose B-29B planes were equipped with the new AN/APQ-7 Eagle radar. The antenna for this radar was an 18-foot, wing-shaped unit mounted under the forward fuselage. The antenna swept a 60-degree arc along the flight path of the plane, and a higher frequency (X-band) signal gave a much-improved radarscope picture. The 315th had been trained for low-altitude, nighttime pathfinder missions. Between 26 June and 10 August, they carried out a series of fifteen strikes against oil production facilities which essentially shut down the Japanese oil industry. The B-29Bs were also stripped of much defensive gunnery, adding capacity for additional incendiary or high-explosive bombs.
By now, the B-29 raids were essentially unopposed by Japanese fighters. In late June, B-29 crews felt sufficiently confident that they began to drop leaflets warning the population of forthcoming attacks, followed three days later by a raid in which the specified urban area was devastated by mass carpet bombing. By the end of June, the civilian population began to show signs of panic, and the Imperial Cabinet first began to consider negotiating an end to the war. However, at that time, the Japanese military was adamant about continuing on to the bitter end.
In June 1945, the XX and XXI Bombardment Commands were grouped under the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF), under the command of General Carl A. Spaatz. The history of XXI Bomber Command terminated on 16 July 1945. On that date the command was redesignated Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, Twentieth Air Force. This redesignation brought to an end the XXI Bomber Command as a separate establishment, as it was absorbed into the internal organizational structure of Twentieth Air Force and was placed under the command of USASTAF.

Minard's Liniment

Minards's is a brand of Liniment.
History.
Like other patent medicines Minard's was also sold by its creator with exaggerated claims. Dr. Levi Minard the King of Pain from Hants County, Nova Scotia, created Minard's Liniment. The cream is a special liniment for easing stiff, sore muscles, and aching backs. 
Dr. Minard's preparation, which he developed in the 1860s from ingredients known to bring comfort and relief, became a popular home therapeutic. Its use became widespread throughout the Maritime provinces and in Newfoundland. The popularity of Minard's Liniment then pushed west into Quebec and Ontario, where it became known as the "King of Pain Relief" because of the immediate relief it brought.
The Minard's Liniment brand was acquired by Stella Pharmaceutical in 1998.
Active ingredients.
Camphor: a natural pain relieving analgesic from camphor trees (a broad-leafed evergreen). Camphor stimulates the nerve endings in the skin, producing numbness at the site of application, inducing relief of pain and discomfort in muscle joints and the area below the skin where applied.
Ammonia Water: an alkaline substance that helps alleviate burning sensations.
Medicinal Turpentine: distilled from pine oil, it is a counter-irritant. A counter-irritant produces a mild, inflammatory reaction where applied in order to relieve more deep-seated pain or discomfort. It has analgesic properties and aids in stimulating circulation.

Abuna Yesehaq

Abuna Yesehaq, born Laike Maryam Mandefro in Adwa, Ethiopia, 1933; died 29 December 2005 Newark, New Jersey, was a leader of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in the Western hemisphere.
Mandefro was born to an Orthodox Christian family, attended Christian school, and joined the priesthood. He was one of the clerics fortunate enough to be tutored personally by Emperor Haile Selassie I, the titular head of the Church.
In October 1959, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church officially established a branch in New York; Abba Laike Mandefro, as he was then known, was sent there in 1963 and was given the task of finding a more suitable building for the Church, which was purchased in 1966. Mandefro then returned to Ethiopia to seek assistance for renovations; unfortunately the building was taken by the New York City authorities in his absence. 
With the assistance of Emperor Haile Selassie, and the Ethiopian consulate in New York, Mandefro returned to New York City and purchased another site for the Church in 1969. 
In 1970, he was sent to Jamaica where he began to minister specifically to the Rastafari community, at the official invitation of Rasta elders including Joseph Hibbert, who was in turn named as a "Spiritual Organizer" by Mandefro. Many government officials and others in Jamaica were deeply disappointed that Abba Mandefro defended the Rastafarians' faith on many occasions, and that he baptised thousands of them, pointedly refusing to denounce their faith in Haile Selassie as the returned Christ. On the other hand, a large number of other Rastas were likewise disappointed because he would not baptise them in the name of the Emperor, but only in the name of Jesus Christ. This however did not disturb those Rastas who viewed Christ and Haile Selassie as one and the same, and readily underwent baptism at the hands of this man who had been sent from Ethiopia by their living God. Only after the Marxist Derg Revolution that toppled Haile Selassie and appointed their own Patriarch over the Church, did the requirement become enforced for prospective baptisees in Jamaica to renounce his divinity and cut their dreadlocks. 
Abba Mandefro also founded many Orthodox Churches throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere, and received the title "Archbishop Yesehaq of the Western Hemisphere and South Africa" in 1979. 
In the 1990s, a schism happened in the Orthodox Church when the new government of the EPRDF took power in Ethiopia and appointed their own Patriarch, Abuna Paulos. Abuna Yesehaq refused to recognise this political change, pointing out that according to the ancient Church canons, the Church leaders are to remain in office until they pass away, and cannot be dismissed or reappointed by any secular government. However, the New York City authorities took the side of the newly appointed Patriarch, and police interrupted a Church service on 9 August 1998 with guns drawn, using profanity, handcuffed children, and took possession of the Church in the name of Abuna Paulos.

In Harmony (music)

In Harmony is a social and music education programme based on Venezuela's El Sistema, adapted to an English context. In Harmony uses music to bring positive change to the lives of children in disadvantaged areas of England, delivering benefits across the wider community. The programme encourages participation in music – in the form of the symphony orchestra – which can have huge personal benefits for the children involved, providing opportunities to grow and develop academically, socially and musically. 
British cellist Julian Lloyd Webber is the founder of In Harmony and was the Chairman of the In Harmony steering group, which was initially responsible for guiding the three pilot project in Liverpool (West Everton), London (Lambeth) and Norwich. The government commissioned Henley Review of Music Education (2011) reported that “there is no doubt that they (the In Harmony projects) have delivered life-changing experiences”. Independent evaluations published in 2011 reported that the programme has a significant impact on educational attainment and community cohesion.
In July 2011, maestro José Antonio Abreu, the founder of El Sistema in Venezuela, recognised In Harmony as part of the El Sistema worldwide network. In November 2011, the British government announced it would expand In Harmony across England by extending funding from the Department for Education and adding funding from Arts Council England. In May 2012, Arts Council England announced funding for four new In Harmony projects from 2012 to 2015. In July, Arts Council England said that the new projects would be delivered in Newcastle, Leeds, Nottingham and Telford & Wrekin, and that funding would also continue for In Harmony Lambeth and In Harmony Liverpool. Activities in Norwich continued as part of the independently-funded Sistema in Norwich programme.
Sistema England is a charitable company, chaired by Julian Lloyd Webber, that supports the In Harmony projects across England. It has been recognised by El Sistema founder José Antonio Abreu for its efforts in preserving the values and methodology of the Venezuelan programme, and it is part of the Sistema Europe working group.

96five Family FM

96five (call sign: 4FRB) is a community broadcast radio station operated by Family Radio Ltd in Brisbane, Australia. The radio stations continued operation is supported by sponsorship, fundraising and pledges.
Programming.
The radio station is an "independent" community Christian broadcasting station. Similar to radio stations in Melbourne Light FM and Sydney's Hope 103.2, Family FM has moved towards a mainstream sound and outward appearance, both in terms of product (programming) and branding.
The music and programming style strongly resembles that offered by Commercial Radio stations in these markets. The radio stations have a fully paid programming and administrative staff, and very limited opportunities are available for volunteers or direct community participation.
Family FM, in a manner similar to other capital city Christian operated radio stations, presents mainstream artists, alongside typical commercial radio elements such as Traffic Updates, Promotional Cars and Give-aways, Cash Give-aways, however offer very limited time to Christian program material. 
The Christian program material that the station does present is infused into what would be normally considered regular programming. Short 30 and 60 second spots promoting Christian ethics and values are occasionally placed between songs. 
Insight For Living is placed in a time slot unlikely to attract interest or criticism, and is heard from 5.30am to 6am Monday to Friday. Other longer programs are placed early on Sunday mornings. The remainder of the station's output emulates commercial radio formats, similar in Brisbane to 97.3 FM.
The radio station, rather than promoting what it does do, places emphasis on what it "does not" do. To demonstrate this point, the radio station stakes its position as "not" providing material to offend, or that is considered inappropriate to a wider Christian oriented audience.
96five Inspire DAB will saw the broadcast of inspire Digital, to shared with a contemporary mix of Christian and mainstream music content.
Self description.
Family FM (also identified as 96five) describes itself as being a "family-friendly broadcaster", with programming content that is suitable for all ages. 
The stations music playlist, consists of both contemporary Christian artists, and also mainstream artists. The station guarantees that listeners will hear no bad language or questionable content.
96five also features numerous family tips throughout the day, and a number of specialty programs such as Focus on the Family and Talking life that deal with Christian, Mental health and family issues. These segments are each no longer than a couple of minutes.
The station also conducts regular Outside Broadcasts at various events and locations, examples include Primary Schools, The Royal Brisbane Show Ekka and at feature open days, and from business as part of sponsorship packages. Regular segments with positive messages are also aired from a number of family and ministry figures.
Studios.
Family FM is based in the northern Brisbane suburb Alderley, in a shared facility with Cornerstone Christian Church, The Priceless Life Center and Harvest Rain Theater company. Their on-air block includes three studios, made up of an on air studio, back-up/recording studio and dedicated news room and studio. All three studios use automated music play-out software.
96five broadcasts from Broadcast Park, a shared broadcast facility on Mt. Coot-tha, which can be seen clearly from the Alderley studio complex.

Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study

Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study is the name of a UK Government feasibility study into a tidal power project looking at the possibility of using the huge tidal range in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel to generate electricity.
On 22 January 2008, the Government launched the feasibility study. The study, previously led by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) is now led by the new Department for Energy and Climate Change and includes representation from the Welsh Assembly Government and the South West Regional Development Agency.
Previous reports on tidal power in the Severn did not—and did not aim to—provide a detailed analysis of all tidal range technologies. This feasibility study aims to consider all tidal range technologies, including barrages and lagoons. The focus is on tidal range technologies as this is where the energy potential in the Severn Estuary is the greatest, as opposed to 'tidal flow' which is the current in moving tidal waters. The tidal range in the Severn Estuary is the second highest in the world and can rise as much as 14 metres, meaning it has the potential to generate more renewable electricity than all other UK estuaries. This could create up to 5% of the UK’s electricity, contributing significantly to UK climate change goals as well as European Union renewable energy targets.
The Government is carrying out the feasibility study to look at all the costs, benefits and impacts of a Severn tidal power scheme. The study, often incorrectly called the Severn Barrage, looks at all tidal range technologies—including barrages, lagoons as well as other technologies. A decision whether the Government will support the scheme or not will take place after a second public consultation in 2010. It was decided after much debate that the scheme would be closed forever and that this would not be brought up in future discussions to save time.
The first consultation of the feasibility study was launched on 26 January 2009 and closed on the 23 April 2009. It looked at the scope of the Strategic Environmental Assessment, the issues the feasibility study considered and the shortlisted schemes up for more detailed analysis in stage two.
History.
Previous schemes and studies.
Proposals for damming or barraging the Severn Estuary (and Bristol Channel) have existed since the 19th century for reasons such as transport links and flood protection. In more recent decades however, (1970s and 80s) there were a number of studies considering barraging the Severn estuary for electricity generation reasons.
These studies concluded in 1989 in the government policy document 'Energy Paper 57', which found that an ebb generation scheme (one that generates electricity as the tide goes out) between Lavernock Point and Brean Down, known as the Cardiff-Weston barrage was technically feasible. The annual output of electricity was estimated at approximately 17 terawatt hours (TWh). However, at the time Government decided a Severn Barrage was not a cost-effective option for generating electricity and plans were shelved.
A comprehensive history of studies and plans for a Severn Barrage can be found under Severn Barrage.
The Energy Review and the Sustainable Development Commission study.
In May 2006, with the growing evidence of climate change and rising fossil fuel prices, the Government called for a new in-depth study into the potential for tidal power from the Severn. The Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the Government’s independent advisory body on sustainable development, was commissioned to look at the issues arising around tidal power, with a particular focus on the Severn Estuary. Their study, 'Turning the Tide: Tidal Power in the UK', concluded that:
Aims.
The study aims to gather and examine evidence which will enable Government to decide whether it could support a tidal power scheme in the Severn Estuary and if so, on what terms. Building on past studies, the feasibility study will provide an up-to-date overview of all the key issues involved.
There are six key work areas which will be looked at closely in the study:
The study will run for roughly two years (until 2010) and will be a two stage process with a decision point at the end of each. The first stage concluded with a 3 month public consultation launched on 26 January 2009 and focused on the high level issues, the scope of the Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) and a proposed short-list of potential tidal power project options from the initial 10 schemes. Following consideration of the responses received to the consultation, the gathering of evidence and assessment will continue through phase 2. At the end of phase 2, a second and final public consultation will be launched and Government will make a decision on whether and how a tidal power project could be supported. In doing so Government will consider the costs, benefits, impacts and risks of a Severn tidal power project and whether these are acceptable.
Strategic environmental assessment.
As part of the feasibility study, A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) will take place. An SEA is a formal environmental assessment of plans or programmes which are likely to have significant effects on the environment. The assessment is produced in the form of an environmental report.
Proposed projects.
A list of ten proposed projects was published in July 2008. The feasibility study looked in further detail at the ten schemes and the consultation document published in January 2009 proposed that a short-list of 5 schemes 
should be the subject of more extensive research in phase two of the study. The 5 schemes are:
The Government response to consultation was published in July 2009. This confirmed detailed study in phase 2 would be carried out on the 5 schemes that were recommended in the consultation document. It also announced work to bring forward 3 further schemes that are currently in the very early stages of development.
A 2009 Paper by Atkins re-evaluated the potential energy which could be generated from the various locations, and concluded that, contrary to earlier studies and computations, the maximum power potential would come from an Ilfracombe-Gower barrage, much further west than any of the schemes the Feasibility Study considered. This different conclusion was attributed to several calculation elements which were neglected in previous numerical models.
Timeline.
"April to Autumn 2008" - Initial focus on the high level issues and potential tidal power options assessment.
"Late 2008" - Government decision on whether there are any issues that mean the project cannot proceed.
"January 2009" – Start of a public consultation on recommended short-list of schemes for further assessment, on the process employed to move from the long list to the short list and the scope of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA).
"Spring 2009 "- Second phase. Subject to the responses made to the consultation, the issues to be considered will be examined in more detail, the short list finalised and narrowed down to a preferred option or combination of options.
"2010" - Public consultation on the evidence and conclusions of the study. Following the consultation, Government will make a decision on whether it could support a tidal power scheme, and if so on what terms.
"Post 2010" - If the outcome of the feasibility study is a decision to proceed, extensive and further detailed work would be needed to plan and implement a tidal power project, and secure the regulatory consents that would be required.

Gerardus J. Sizoo

Gerardus Johannes Sizoo (8 November 1900 – 4 January 1994) was the first professor of physics at the Vrije Universiteit. He is notable for the establishment and development of the applied physics laboratory in 1930 and the establishment of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Vrije Universiteit.
Education.
His doctoral research expored the phenomenon of superconductivity at the University of Leiden, following the lead of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Wander Johannes de Haas. He completed his PhD in 1926, with a thesis entitled: "Onderzoekingen over den suprageleidenden toestand van metalen," under Wander Johannes de Haas.
Career.
In as early as 1929, it was decided that Sizoo act as professor at the newly established Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Despite his young age he was the only candidate who met the scientific requirements, the right beliefs, and had agreed to the task. Sizoo promoted the then emerging field of radioactivity, partly because there were no other laboratories in the Netherlands exploring this area depth. His own research focused on natural radioactive substances.
Sizoo faced a difficult relationship between the reformed religion and science, in the 1930s. He wrote many publications on this relationship. In 1943 the Vrije Universiteit closed its doors, and scientific work in the ensuing time was much more difficult, despite efforts by Sizoo to keep the laboratory equipment from the hands of German occupiers.
Shortly after 1945 Sizoo was one of the initiators of the creation of the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter. In addition, he held numerous positions in scientific institutes and committees. In 1965, at 65 years of age, Sizoo became an emeritus professor, and he continued writing on physics, the relationship between faith and science, and the significance of the science for the Christian foundation of the Vrije Universiteit.

Sirio Carrapa

Sirio Carrapa (born in Borgagne, Italy, 12 May 1952) is an Italian mystic and a unique Western Master of Surat Shabd Yoga or Sant Mat, who teaches and sets an example of practice of this spiritual path. He was a disciple of Sant Kirpal Singh and Sant Ajaib Singh, and he is acknowledged as a spiritual Master ("Sant" or Satguru), carrying on the work of his Masters.
His knowledge is not only theoretical, as he has long decades of personal experience and practice, which make his spiritual activity credible and lifelike.
He is also an expert in Ayurveda, he is an appreciated Ayurvedic therapist and teacher.
Biography.
He was born on the 12th of May, in 1952 in Borgagne, which is in one of the southernmost regions of Italy, Apulia. He lived there with his parents and four siblings until the age of 10, then in 1962 the family moved to Milan. He lived there until he moved to Tuscany, in the village Ribolla (Grosseto) in 1979, where he founded the "Sant Bani Ashram".
Meeting with his first Master.
In 1972, at the age of 19, he had his first spiritual awakening spontaneously, after which he started an intense practice of Yoga and meditation, wishing to keep up this level of consciousness and spiritual awareness. Eventually the following year springtime, in 1973 he travelled to India for the first time (via land through Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan which journey lasted for 1 month), to find a Master who can help him and be his support in this spiritual quest.
Not long after arriving in India, He met Sant Kirpal Singh from Delhi, in whom he recognized his Master and on that occasion, on the 25th of April in 1973 he got Initiation from the Great Master himself into the practice of Surat Shabd Yoga (the experience of the Inner Light and the Sound). Through this initiation he experienced such an immense and incredible upliftment in spirit and consciousness, that after his return home to Italy from India, He spent the next two years in the practice of continuous meditation completely. So his daily routine was continuous meditation, in complete retreat from the world.
Kirpal Singh was his first Master, whom he met and by whom he was initiated in 1973. He met Master Kirpal on two occasions, in 1973 and in 1974 and both times were incredibly uplifitng and fulfilling spiritually.
The second Master.
Master Kirpal left this world in 1974. At that time Sirio was very young and he felt the need to follow a living Master, because - as he told in an interview- he had to learn, how he has to do this spiritual work. He needed training. He was at a very high spiritual level, but being a young man, the process of becoming a real man was still ahead. He experienced this process with his second Master, who was also a disciple of Kirpal Singh. His name was Ajaib Singh and lived in the Tar desert in Rajasthan. With him Sirio had a 20-year long deep spiritual relation. He appointed Sirio to be His European representative in 1977, when he was only 25, and he gave authorization to Sirio to give initiations in his name. Since then he gives Initiation into this yoga tradition.
The foundation of the "Sant Bani Ashram" in Ribolla and spiritual retreats.
In 1977, when Sirio first met Ajaib Singh, told him about his intention to buy a piece of land and found an ashram there. He was very happy about it and told to Sirio that this will be a good service to his soul. So in the next year, Sirio bought 17 acres of land with an abandoned house that needed renovation. In that time he was living in Milan and in the next year, in 1979 he moved to Ribolla, founding the "Sant Bani Ashram" there in Ribolla, and he has lived there ever since.
Since then Sirio organizes spiritual retreats at this beautiful place every year more times, and even Ajaib Singh lead three programs here with hundreds of people participating (in 1980, 1984 and 1989). Such intense spiritual, meditation retreats with Master Sirio aren't only in the ashram: his disciples arrange programs for him all over the world, (mainly in Europe up to now, but he has also been invited to the USA, to Mexico and to Togu in Africa).
After the death of Ajaib.
Ajaib Singh died in 1997 and in 2001 Sirio felt a strong inclination and inner guidance to have three months in complete, continuous meditation. Obeying to this inner urge, he meditated at least fourteen-fifteen hours a day. Thus from the July of 2001 until September he didn't do anything else, just meditated through these hours every day. He went through an incredible upliftment of consciousness and had many inner experiences, which showed much, much stronger than ever before, that this is what he has to do. So, according to his Master's will he does this spiritual work since then.
There were many external signs as well from Ajaib during their intense spiritual relationship of twenty years, that his will was the Sirio carries on the spiritual work of his gurus. (One of the strongest external signs from Ajaib to express his wish that Sirio takes up the role of the Master later on was that in 1989 during the retreat in Sant Bani Ashram Ribolla, Ajaib wanted that Sirio gives the initiation despite the fact he was also present. This act is usually one of the ways of the Masters to show a succession.)
Furthermore Ajaib gave the indication to Sirio to lock the small wooden house of the Master - that was built in the Sant Bani Ashram for Ajaib - and use it the same way as he used the small underground room in India in which he meditated for long years following Master Kirpal's instructions. Sant Ajaib gave this instruction only to Sirio and not to any other disciple who were living in the Ashram at that time. Still nowadays this little house is used only by Sirio and he gives initiations and private interviews there. It is called the Master's house.
Consequently, some of the initiates accepted this successorship (after having inner experiences in meditation with Master Sirio).
By now there is big number of followers, disciples of Master Sirio, mainly from different countries of Europe (his biggest spiritual group is Hungarian) with whom nowadays there are a number of retreats every year, mainly in Italy (in the Sant Bani Ashram and other cities as well), in Hungary, in Romania (Transylvania) and in Germany. But he has disciples and followers from many other parts of the world, like UK, USA, Mexico, Togu (Africa). Master Sirio is giving a number of public lectures on Surat Shabd Yoga every year, fulfilling the invitation of his disciples.
It seems that nowadays there is a growing number of people who recognized in Master Sirio the Living Satguru and are his disciples and devotees.
Ayurvedic activity.
Master Sirio does not accept or asks for any money for his spiritual activity. He takes it as a service for humanity, since in his understanding "spirituality is a free gift of nature, such as the life, the air or water".
He earns his living from his profession, since he is a well known and appreciated Ayurvedic therapist in the area of Toscany where he lives. He is not only therapist, but he is teaching the practice of Ayurveda as well.
He first studied Ayurveda in 1995 from dr.Nanal and dr.Bhagwan Dass in Firenze. After that he started his own practice as an Ayurvedic therapist, but to make his knowledge and experience in it deeper, he also travelled to India, and studied and practiced the method in the Ayurvedic Hospital in Coimbator and since then he also became the teacher of Ayurveda.
He began teaching Ayurvedic massage in a school in Rome in 1999, where a big number of people learnt the practice of Ayurveda directly from him.
Later on he started an Ayurvedic center in Ribolla, where he lives, where people can go to visit him, retreat from the world and purify their body by getting effective therapies and treatments, combined with complex program (including Ayurveda, diet, yoga etc.) for the sake of renewing themselves on all levels of the human beings: body, mind and spirit.

Jim McGuinn

Jim McGuinn, born James Slusarek, is an American radio personality. He served as program director of the now defunct Y100 100.3FM (1997–2005) and its predecessor, WDRE in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1995–97), both of which changed formats after being bought by Radio One. McGuinn also served as Program Director for KPNT (1994–95), St. Louis, and WEQX (1990–94), Manchester, Vermont, beginning his career in commercial radio as a DJ at WWRX (1988–90), Providence, following time at his college radio station, WPGU (1984–88), Champaign, Illinois.
McGuinn took the Y100 brand online in 2004 with Y100Rocks.com, meant to serve as the internet reincarnation of Y100 after the public outcry that took place online after the station's modern rock format was abandoned. In August 2006, McGuinn merged Y100Rocks into WXPN's family of programming.
In April 2007 McGuinn became the afternoon drive time host for WXPN, following the "World Cafe" program by David Dye. He also served as the Program Director for Y-Rock On XPN, which exists both as programming on WXPN as well as a full-time internet radio operation.
Since January 2009, McGuinn has been program director of Minnesota Public Radio's 89.3 The Current.
Radio career as a Program Director.
As Program Director for Y-Rock On XPN.
McGuinn was responsible for merging the Y100Rocks brand with the executives at WXPN, chiefly Roger LaMay and Bruce Warren. The unique merging of the Y100Rocks brand into the WXPN family of programming occurred on August 30, 2006. The deal worked such that Y100Rocks continued under the moniker "Y-Rock On XPN" and while it would continue to broadcast on the internet 24/7, it would also be broadcast on WXPN 88.5FM in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights. The shows that simulcast on WXPN are hosted no longer by McGuinn as he now seves as the WXPN afternoon host.
With the merging of the two brands, McGuinn had succeeded in finding a permanent home for the displaced expatriates of Y100, who had been broadcasting online out of various apartment complexes in Philadelphia since Radio One silenced WPLY in February 2005. The executives at WXPN provided the Y-Rock staff - led by McGuinn as Program Director and run by a largely volunteer staff - with studio and office space in their University of Pennsylvania-provided headquarters at 3025 Walnut Street in Philadelphia.
In January 2009, McGunn became program director and host at Minnesota Public Radio's 89.3 The Current.
Musical career.
Prior to and concurrent with a career in radio, McGuinn played in rock bands, starting in high school and college as guitarist and songwriter with Reaction Formation, an '80s era indie rock band that toured the Midwest extensively and released several 7" singles and cassettes, some for Go2 Records, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based Susstones Records. McGuinn later played with short-lived acts 100 Faces, The Glitter Zombies (with Ric Menck and Paul Chastain of Velvet Crush), and Love Cactus. While with Love Cactus, McGuinn co-founded Trashcan Records with bandmate Chris Corpora. Trashcan released a series of cassettes that documented the fertile Champaign, Illinois, music scene of the late '80s, including early work from Jay Bennett's pre-Wilco band Titanic Love Affair, Bad Flannel, and Poster Children's "Toreador Squat", which McGuinn also co-produced.
After college, McGuinn appeared in more bands, most prominently as bassist with Philadelphia-based Cordalene, who released 3 EPs and a full-length album, "The Star-Ledger", between 2000 and 2004. Currently musical activities include membership in Philadelphia musical collective The Wayward Wind; McGuinn plays lapsteel and mandolin on their second album, "Wait for Green".

A shoulder injury caused him to miss most of the 2007 season, but he returned in 2008 as a reliever at Jacksonville. Elbert earned his first trip to the Majors when the Dodgers called him up from the minors on August 29, 2008.
Elbert made his MLB debut on August 29, 2008, pitching two thirds of an inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He pitched in 10 games out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in 2008, finishing the season 0–1 with an ERA of 12.00.
He spent most of 2009 in the minors and was selected as the Dodgers "Minor League Pitcher of the Year" after finishing a combined 4–4 with a 3.84 ERA in 18 starts for Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Albuquerque. He also appeared in 19 games in the Majors with the Dodgers, finishing 2–0 with a 5.03 ERA and appeared in relief in Game 3 of the 2009 National League Championship Series.
He began 2010 as a starting pitcher for Albuquerque and was promoted to the Dodgers on May 28. He walked three left-handed hitting batters in that game and was promptly optioned back to AAA. He made one more start for the Isotopes before abruptly leaving the team for unspecified reasons. He eventually returned to action by pitching for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League, where he was selected to the "Rising Stars Game". 
He began 2011 in the bullpen for Albuquerque and was called up to the Dodgers on May 11. Elbert pitched in 47 games for the Dodgers, mostly as a left-handed specialist. He finished with a 2.43 ERA in 33.1 innings with 34 strikeouts and also saved two games.
In 2012, Elbert appeared in 43 games for the Dodgers and had a 2.20 ERA in 32.2 innings. He also spent extended periods on the disabled list because of arm problems, which finally forced him to undergo season ending surgery in mid-September. He underwent another surgery on the elbow on January 23, 2013 due to continued pain in the area.
Due to his recovery from his injury, Elbert missed all of spring training and PRP Treatment in March delayed his intended return. He eventually began pitching in rehab games in the minors in May He seemed close to rejoining the Dodgers and as the last step in his rehab pitched in two games on consecutive days for the Chattanooga Lookouts, however he experienced some pain in his elbow after his last appearance. An MRI exam revealed that he had a complete tear of the ulnar collateral ligament. Elbert underwent Tommy John surgery on June 10, 2013 and was eliminated for the entire 2013 season.
Pitching style.
Elbert throws just two pitches regularly: a four-seam fastball at 90–94 mph and a Slider at 87–90. He throws the fastball a majority of the time against right-handed hitters, but only about half the time against left-handers. Elbert has also thrown a small handful of changeups to right-handers. He skews toward throwing the slider in 2-strike counts.

Henri Admirat

Henri Admirat (3 September 1744 – 17 June 1794) was a notable figure in the French Revolution. He was executed on the guillotine for attempting to assassinate Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois.
Admirat's assassination attempt.
Henri Admirat lived in the same building as Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois. He bore many grudges against the Revolution, not least for closing down the public lottery of which he had been an employee, and making him redundant. He decided to assassinate Collot and had lain in wait for his victim, armed with two pistols. Collot, returning from a late-night meeting of the Committee of Public Safety, was chatting with his governess on the stairway when Admirat struck. Admirat fired two shots at Collot at point-blank range, but both pistols misfired. Collot then defended himself with his sword and managed to prevent the would-be assassin from escaping from the building. Admirat barricaded himself in his flat and was later arrested by the passing National Guards patrol, but not before seriously wounding a man named Geoffroy who was helping the National Guards to gain entry into the flat.
Trial and execution.
Admirat was brought into the Revolutionary Tribunal and subjected to a trial that lasted only two minutes in which he could only answer. Admirat's sentence of death was a foregone conclusion. He never provided an explanation of the assassination attempt in public and his testimony, written in the secret Committee of General Security, an oppressive police body in the Revolutionary Government, is used by historians with extreme caution. On 17 June 1794, Admirat was guillotined at the Place de la Nation. His body is buried with fifty-three others in Picpus Cemetery.

Helly metric

In game theory, the Helly metric is used to assess the distance between two strategies. It is named for Eduard Helly.
Consider a game formula_1, between player I and II. Here, formula_2 and formula_3 are the sets of pure strategies for players I and II respectively; and formula_4 is the payoff function.
(in other words, if player I plays formula_5 and player II plays formula_6, then player I pays formula_7 to player II).
The Helly metric formula_8 is defined as
The metric so defined is symmetric, reflexive, and satisfies the triangle inequality.
The Helly metric measures distances between strategies, not in terms of the differences between the strategies themselves, but in terms of the consequences of the strategies. Two strategies are distant if their payoffs are different. Note that formula_10 does not imply formula_11 but it does imply that the "consequences" of formula_12 and formula_13 are identical; and indeed this induces an equivalence relation.
If one stipulates that formula_10 implies formula_11 then the topology so induced is called the natural topology.
The metric on the space of player II's strategies is analogous:
Note that formula_17 thus defines "two" Helly metrics: one for each player's strategy space.
Conditional compactness.
Notation (definition of an formula_18-net). A set formula_19 is an formula_18-net in the space formula_21 with metric formula_22 if for any formula_23 there exists formula_24 with formula_25.
A metric space formula_26 is conditionally compact if for any formula_27 there exists a "finite" formula_18-net in formula_26.
A game that is conditionally compact in the Helly metric has an formula_18-optimal strategy for any formula_27.
Other results.
If the space of strategies for one player is conditionally compact, then the space of strategies for the other player is conditionally compact (in their Helly metric).

The La France was a French Army airship launched by Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs in 1884. Collaborating with Charles Renard, Arthur Constantin Krebs piloted the first fully controlled free-flight with the "La France". The long, airship, electric-powered with a 435 kg battery completed a flight that covered in 23 minutes. It was the first full round trip flight with a landing on the starting point. On its seven flights in 1884 and 1885 the "La France" dirigible returned five times to its starting point.

The Cinema Book

The Cinema Book is a film studies text book first published by the British Film Institute (BFI) in 1985 as a resource for teachers. The first edition was based on the BFI Education Department's collection of film clips for use as study guides. However, at the time there were few film text books, and "The Cinema Book" was an unexpected success. Over the next decade it was adopted by many film studies courses around the world and translated into several languages.
By the time of the second edition in 1999, the film clip collection was deemed redundant and the book was transformed into an in-depth guide to film history and updated to include recent theoretical developments. A third revised edition appeared in 2007.
"The Cinema Book" is one of the last books to be published by BFI Publishing as an integral part of the British Film Institute. Amid some controversy, the institute entered into a partnership deal with global publishers Palgrave Macmillan and BFI Publishing staff were relocated to Macmillan's offices in London's King's Cross in January 2008.

Metcalf Gap

Metcalf Gap is a pass through the Palo Pinto Mountains in western Palo Pinto County, Texas. The bluffs of the mountains form an escarpment running southwest to northeast, intersected by the Gap, and rise some 250-300 feet (75-90 m) above the pastures to the southeast. The pass itself lies at an elevation of about . US 180 and SH 16, which are concurrent at this point, run east-west through the pass; immediately to the east of the pass, SH 16 splits off toward Strawn and runs southwest parallel to the line of hills.
For about 100 years from 1856 through the 1950s, there was a small community serving the ranchers in the area that shared its name with the pass; as recently as 1940 the town included a store, a school, and a population of forty. Both the town and the pass were named for J.J. Metcalf, an early rancher and surveyor, who surveyed, among other things, the townsite of county seat Golconda, now known as Palo Pinto. Today, only isolated ranch houses stand on the pastures outside Metcalf Gap.

SymbioCity

SymbioCity is the trademarked term for Sweden's approach to sustainable urban development. Established in 2008, the program's primary goal is to export Sweden's knowledge and experience with sustainable cities. It was created in order to assist Swedish environmental technology companies with their international marketing by creating a common trademark.
Gunnar Lund, Swedish ambassador to France, said in 2010, "The starting point for SymbioCity is the predicted growth of our population from six billion to nine billion in the next two decades".
SymbioCity aims to "get more for less", creating synergy by integrating different technologies and city functions.
For example, waste can turn into energy, waste water can turn into fuel, and the excessive heat from an industry can warm up a household. According to the SymbioCity approach, environmental and economic gains result from unlocking synergies between urban systems. The seven building blocks of SymbioCity are: Architecture; Energy; Landscape Planning; Traffic & Transport; Waste Management; Urban Functions, Industry and Buildings; Water Supply and Sanitation. Several hundred Swedish consultants, contractors and system suppliers are connected to SymbioCity.
SymbioCity is scalable, and adaptable to any climate.
SymbioCity as a trademark was launched in 2008, and is administered by the Swedish Trade Council.
The name SymbioCity is a play on words, combining "symbiosis" and "city".
The 2008 Environmental Performance Index ranks Sweden third in the world.

Singles event

A singles event is an activity or program made available specifically to the romantically unattached, often with the underlying or explicit purpose of fostering dating or relationships among attendees.
Logistics.
Singles events are frequently run by organizations focused on building stability in their areas, such as religious organizations and community groups.
Some local businesses, sports teams, and cultural establishment also hold singles events.
The themes of singles events can cover a broad spectrum. These can include, for example, ski trips, Academy Award viewing parties, dinners, holiday parties, art gallery visits, and Valentine's Day mixers.
Some of the most strongly attended such events are the Christmas Eve parties targeted at young Jewish singles in major cities in North America, particularly the Matzo Ball and its large city competitors.
Singles events have been an area of particular growth in singles-related commerce.
Praise.
Singles events have been praised as "ideal settings for meeting people" because attendees are ostensibly present to meet someone and are open to the idea of becoming romantically attached.
Criticisms.
General.
The attendees of singles events have been criticized as "needy folks without a lot to offer". Dating via religious-sponsored singles events has been criticized for fostering invasion of daters' privacy and undue expectations. Sex ratios of singles events have been criticized, with many either having too many women or too many men depending on location or targeted race, age, and income groups. As a result many events often have a policy to even out sex ratios before the event starts.
Meet/meat market.
Singles events, including those organized by religious organizations, have been criticized for frequently being meet/meat markets—places where attendees are rapidly sizing up members of the opposite sex with objectifying criteria, such as attractiveness, wealth, and fashion sense, before taking the time to get to know attendees on a deeper level.
By the 1970s, singles events had developed a reputation as a "ritual of lies and mistrust", replete with men in search of casual sex, cold and unfriendly women, and frequent misunderstandings.
The nature of meet markets has changed dramatically since the 1980s, becoming more inviting, and the term itself has largely become value neutral or positive.
Naming and 'Young Professionals' events.
The stigma that developed in the 1970s around singles events led some organizations to switch to the euphemism "young professionals events". (However other organizations specifically for young professionals insist that they are not "singles groups".)

Koło Fortuny

Koło Fortuny was the Polish version of "Wheel of Fortune". The show first ran from 2 October 1992 to 1 September 1998 and ran in a revival on TVP2 from 29 October 2007 to 2009, when it was put off the air.
For rules of the game, see the article entitled "Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)", as this article only describes the unique differences in the Polish version of the show. The 2007-09 run of the show was one of few versions to use a green podium instead of the traditional blue, using a red-yellow-green sequence. The original show used the reverse order of the American version's color sequence, with blue on the left, yellow in the middle, and red on the right.
Differences.
There was only one Toss-Up puzzle and three rounds before the Bonus Round in the 2007 version.
Toss-Up.
The toss-up was worth a dishwasher or a trip to a hotel in Poland. Whoever buzzed in and solved the puzzle first won the dishwasher or trip and began Round 1. If the first player was wrong, the next player in line got a shot at the puzzle. The puzzle board's border lighted up red, yellow, or green to show who had buzzed in.
Vowels.
Vowels are worth zł200, and needed to be purchased prior to spinning the wheel.
Prizes.
In Rounds 1 and 3, a purple wedge that had the letters "AGD" was placed on the wheel. In all three Rounds, two green or silver wedges that had "Wycieczka" were also placed on the wheel. Round 2 featured prizes that changed from show to show, labeled with the word "Nagroda".
A player who landed on a wedge, called a correct letter, and immediately solved the puzzle (à la the Jackpot Round in the United States) won the prize; otherwise, they needed to spin the wheel again or buy a vowel.
"AGD" represented home appliances worth zł5000, and "Wycieczka" represented a bonus trip to places such as Italy, Canary Islands, etc. "Nagroda" represents any other prize, ranging from multimedia to scooters. Other prize spaces include "Sklep Internetowy," which represented specific prizes related to the internet and computers, and "Skuter", which specifically represented scooters.
Penalty Spaces.
Bankrut (Bankrupt): This cost the player his or her turn plus all the money he or she earned in the round. Previous earnings were not affected.
Stop (Lose a Turn): Appropriately, the player's turn "stopped" and play passed to the next player. Scores were not affected under any circumstances.
The Bankrupt/$10,000/Bankrupt Wedge.
In Round 2, a wedge that says "Bankrut/10,000/Bankrut" was placed on the wheel. Unlike the US version of Wheel of Fortune, and like the Filipino version and other European versions, landing on the zł10,000 section earns spendable cash as normal. Since it is worth zł10,000, a Bankrupt is placed on each side, making it harder to hit. It is unknown whether the money was awarded in multiples or was given at a flat rate but more than likely the latter occurred.
Mystery Wedges.
In Round 3, two mystery wedges were placed on the wheel. One was hiding a Bankrupt, and the other was hiding zł10,000, added only when the player solved the puzzle before hitting Bankrupt. Like in the current US version, the player had to call a letter in the puzzle, then decide if he/she wanted to accept the zł500 per letter or reveal the mystery. The second mystery wedge then acted as a regular space worth zł500 for the rest of the round.
Bonus Round.
From 1992 to 1996, players who made it to the bonus round played for a car. From 1997 to 1998, they played for a collection of prizes usually valued at zł10,000. Although the Polish version did have a bonus round podium with envelopes like the American version did from 1989–2001, instead of prizes, all four envelopes contained three consonants and a vowel. All occurrences of the letters would be revealed and then the contestant would choose another three consonants and a vowel and then has 15 seconds to solve the puzzle (10 seconds from 1997–1998). Unlike the American version, the contestant was allowed only one guess of the puzzle. If time ran out or the contestant gave an incorrect answer, he/she did not win the bonus prize.
The 2007-2009 Polish bonus round was played just like the American version has been doing since 2001. The contestant spun a miniature bonus wheel filled with cars, trips, and cash prizes ranging up to zł50,000. The player received R, S, T, L, N, and E, selected three more consonants and a vowel, then had 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. This time, like the American version, the contestant was allowed an unlimited amount of guesses.
The Wheel.
The layouts from late 1992 into early 1993, with the currency used during Poland's period of hyperinflation. "Lose A Turn" was known as "Strata Kolejki" at this time.
The layouts from 1993 to about 1995, with a changed color scheme.
The layouts used in 1995, when Poland introduced their new złoty.
The layouts used from 1996 to about 1998, when Poland's 21 wedges were reduced to 20. Note the color pattern.
The layouts based on a March 2009 episode.

Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire

Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) is a personality test.
It was devised by C. Robert Cloninger.
A newer version of the questionnaire is called Temperament and Character Inventory.
As the name indicates TPQ seeks to measure three dimensions (traits) of the personality.
These personality traits are novelty seeking, harm avoidance and reward dependence.
Each have four subscales.
There are 100 true-false questions which form the basis for the computation of the traits. 
The personality test also exists in Chinese,
French
and German
versions
Neurobiology.
Cloninger suggested that the three dimensions, novel seeking, harm avoidance and reward dependence, was correlated with low basal dopaminergic activity, 
high serotonergic activity, and low basal noradrenergic activity, respectively.
Much research has gone into examining these links, e.g., with personality genetics.

White Guilt (book)

White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era is a book by American author Shelby Steele in 2006.
In the book, Steele argues that white guilt is much more than just a race problem.
Steele describes his experience growing up as a young black man in an era of racism and white dominance. From a young age he dreamed of becoming a "batboy" for an all-white baseball team. With segregation at large, Steele feared his dream would never become a reality, however, Steele spent many weeks watching and admiring the baseball players. After catching the coach’s attention as someone with immense passion for baseball, he was granted the position of batboy, his dream now becoming a reality. The high of achieving his goal soon became shattered when the baseball team was to play at a whites-only stadium. When reflecting back on this event, Steele states, "I am certain that racist rejections like this do not cause low self-esteem in their victims. They cause disenchantment with the world. My self-esteem was not diminished in the least by what happened to me on that Saturday morning." 
Throughout the years, Steele watched the era of white power transform into an era of white guilt, the underlying theme throughout Steele's book. Steele believes that the lack of time between transitioning from white supremacy to white guilt, ultimately led to the destruction of the civil rights era. According to Steele, since the transformation from white power to white guilt was presented to society with no cool-off period, the American people were not able to feel a sense of neutrality towards racism, and this is when bargainers came about: blacks in the political spotlight appealing to whites to take hold of white guilt and use it to their advantage. Steele talks about how being black can be an advantage due to how heavy white guilt is. Steele says that in today’s society this happens a lot, blacks appealing to white guilt to use it to their advantage and this is why Blacks and White together destroyed the promise of the Civil Rights Era.

John Duncan Gregory

John Duncan Gregory CB CMG (26 May 1878 – 29 January 1951) was a British diplomat.
Gregory was the son of Sir Philip Gregory. He was educated at Eton College and joined the Diplomatic Service in 1902. He was promoted Second Secretary in 1902. From 1907 to 1909 he worked at the British Embassy in Vienna. He later became Chargé d'Affaires in Bucharest, was posted to the Holy See in 1915, and was promoted Counsellor in 1919. In 1920 he was posted to the Foreign Office in London as Senior Clerk and Assistant Secretary, and in 1925 he became Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
He was the principal figure in the "francs case" of 1928, in which he and two other Foreign Office employees were accused of having used their position to speculate in foreign currencies. While he was cleared of doing anything illegal, he was held by an inquiry to have acted in a manner incompatible with his post and was dismissed from the Diplomatic Service.
Gregory was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours and Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1925 Birthday Honours.

Wingless localisation element 3 (WLE3)

The WL3 Wingless localisation element 3 (WLE3) is an RNA structure that localises the wingless mRNA in flies.
The structure consists of a stem, a bulge region, another stem and a loop.
The published structure was determined and refined through experiments.
Wingless localisation element 3 (WLE3) is a 53-nt (nt 518-570) apical localization 
element within the 3'-untranslated region of the wingless (wg) mRNA. It is shown to be sufficient and necessary for apical RNA transport in microinjection assays and transgenic reporters.
Indeed, deletion of WLE3 in an otherwise full-length wg 3'UTR completely abolishes apical localization. However, a minimal WLE3 monomer by itself shows weak activity on its own. The incomplete activity of 
a single WLE3 element indicates a requirement for additional elements or sequences.
Phylogenetic comparison of WLE3 elements predicts a highly conserved stem-loop structure in 
"Drosophila" species (using ALIFOLD) and deemed necessary for WLE function by mutational analyses.
Full WLE3 activity is dependent on appropriate downstream sequences and can also be blocked by 
downstream sequences. Targeted mutations on the sequence and structural aspects of WLE3 stem-loop 
were done and tested showing the distal stem to be most important, the central variable region 
while must be present its sequences and bulges appear to be unimportant and the WLE3 loop with 
two invariant residues is not required for localization.

New York Tugboat Race

The New York Tugboat Race is a contest for working tugboats held on the Hudson River every Fall on the Sunday before Labor day. It was founded in part by Captain Jerry Roberts, who also serves as its chief announcer. Boats race one nautical mile from 79th Street to Pier 84 at 44th Street in Manhattan. The race is the occasion for a dockside festival. Events currently include nose-to-nose pushing competitions, a line toss competition, and best mascot/costume contests between the crews. After the award, the spectators of the race can compete in events that include a knot tying competition, an on land line toss competition and a spinach eating competition. The spinach eating computation is in honor of the Popeye the sailor cartoon character. Spectators can also pay to get a seat on a tug boat during the events.
Similar contests are held on the Detroit River and the St. Mary's River.
History.
The Great North River Tug Boat Race and Competition, or as it is more commonly known the New York Tug Boat Race or the Hudson River Tugboat Race, was first held in 1991. The event put on by the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and headed by Captain Jerry Roberts. The original course started 79th Street Boat Basin and ended at Pier 86 or as it is also known the Intrepid Pier. The Intrepid Museum held the event for its first 13 years. Captain Jerry Roberts left the Intrepid Museum staff after the 2004 event.

Made up of mainly private properties It is approximately 5 miles directly from the city centre. It is bordered by Chapel Park, Westerhope, West Denton, Blucher as well as Abbey Farm estate and Abbey Grange estate.
Before 2005, Chapel House estate had a large middle school named Chapel House Middle School which catered for about 500 children in the area and beyond. However, this was closed in 2005 when the outer west of Newcastle switched to two tier education.
Similarly, Knoplaw Primary School and Milecastle Primary School (also within Chapel House) used to be first schools. 
Chapel House Middle Schools land is being currently built on for a new Knoplaw primrary School. A silverspade event was held on 07/07/09.
Thomas Bewick School and Walbottle Campus Lower School are no-longer situated here.
A campaign by local residents in 2011 led to the protection of Chadderton Field from planned development. It thus became only the second village green to be registered in the city, under the Commons Act, 2006.
Chapel House has a range of buses, (Service Number 40,63,72 and 38A) which enables people to get to the city centre within 35 minutes. There are 5 bus stops in the area as well as 3 bus routes each headed to the city centre. All services are provided by Stagecoach In Newcastle & all designated routes for low floor kneeling buses.

Although an investigation had just begun (which would find error in company policies as well as operational errors on that day), Ewing issued a statement the following day placing blame on the crew of the northbound train, which had ignored an order to take a siding to allow another train to pass. Ewing declared, "We are wholly at a loss to account for this gross violation of the order and the rules, except that it was an unexplained failure of the human agency."

Atolmis rubricollis

Atolmis rubricollis, commonly known as the Red-necked Footman, is a moth of the family Arctiidae. It is found in the summer in forested regions of Europe and northern Asia. This moth was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.
Description.
The Red-necked Footman is a small moth that is mostly charcoal grey but has a conspicuous orange thorax, part of which is visible behind the black head. The hindwings are a brownish-grey colour. The antennae and legs are black and the abdomen is yellowish-orange. The wings are tightly folded together around the body and have pleated, squared-off ends. The wingspan is and the length of the forewings is .
Life cycle.
The white eggs of the Red-necked Footman are laid in small groups in crevices in the branches. They grow to a length of about . Their head is black with a bold diagonal white stripe on either side. Their main colour is dark greenish-grey marbled with cream. Each segment bears six tiny red warts from which small tufts of hair grow. The caterpillars feed on lichens growing on the trunks and branches of trees, and can be found between August and October. They pupate before winter sets in and overwinter as grey-brown chrysalises buried among moss and leaf litter. The moths fly between May and July depending on their location. They are mostly nocturnal, being attracted to lights, but also sometimes fly by day.
Distribution.
The Red-necked Footman is found in Europe and Asia, including Siberia as far east as the Amur River and China. It is found in parts of Ireland, and in the United Kingdom is present in the south-westerly counties of England and Wales. Records from other parts of the United Kingdom probably represent accidentals and not breeding populations. It is a woodland species found in deciduous and coniferous woodland, especially on spruce trees, but also on pine, oak and beech. It likes to be near streams in cool wooded valleys in upland regions.

Medaglia d'Oro (racehorse)

Medaglia d'Oro (foaled April 11, 1999 in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse. 
Medaglio d'Oro was bred by Albert and Joyce Bell. He was sired by Ireland's 1991 Champion 2-Year-Old, El Prado, who was a son of the fourteen-time leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland Sadler's Wells, who in turn was a son of the 20th century's most influential sire and sire of sires, Northern Dancer. Medaglia d'Oro's damsire Bailjumper was a son of U.S. Hall of Fame inductee, Damascus.
The horse was sold to Edmund Gann after his winning three-year-old debut under trainer David Vance, then transferred to trainer Robert J. Frankel. 
Racing career.
Medaglia d'Oro finished second in his only race as a two-year-old in 2001.
Leading up to the 2002 U.S. Triple Crown series, Medaglia d'Oro won the San Felipe Stakes in California. In the first of the Triple Crown races, the 1¼ mile Kentucky Derby, Medaglia d'Oro was ridden by Laffit Pincay, Jr. to a fourth-place finish. In the ensuing 1³/16 mile Preakness Stakes, he ran eighth under Jerry Bailey then with Kent Desormeaux as his jockey, Medaglia d'Oro finished second in the longest of the series, the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes. From there, Medaglia d'Oro went on to win the Grade II Jim Dandy Stakes, the Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. Under jockey Jerry Bailey, Medaglia d'Oro ran second to Volponi in the 2002 Breeders' Cup Classic
In 2003, Medaglia d'Oro was first or second in all five starts. Of his three wins, he won the Grade I Whitney Handicap and ran second to Pleasantly Perfect in the 2003 Breeders' Cup Classic. Sent back to the track in 2004, the five-year-old Medaglia d'Oro raced twice. He won January's Grade I Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida then at the end of March, in what would be his last race, he finished second to Pleasantly Perfect in the Dubai World Cup at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in the United Arab Emirates.
Stud record.
In May 2004, Medaglia d'Oro was sold by agent Barry Irwin to Audrey Haisfield who retired him to stud duty beginning with the 2005 season. He stands at Darley Stud for a 2010 fee of $100,000 live foal. From his first crop born in 2006, he produced stakes winners, the most notable of which is the champion filly, Rachel Alexandra.

Fred Jowett (rugby player)

Fred Jowett (1879 - 5 October 1939) was a Welsh rugby union player who represented Wales and the British Lions. Jowett played club rugby for Swansea and county rugby for Glamorgan. His first and only cap was on 10 January 1903 at St Helens Ground in Swansea against England. He made his debut in an experienced team, with only George Travers of Pill Harriers earning his first cap alongside Jowett. The match was a one sided affair, with Wales winning 21-5, thanks to a hat-trick of tries from Jehoida Hodges. Although playing his part in an excellent win against England, Jowett was never selected again.
The next year Jowett was selected to represent Bedell Sivright's British Lions on their tour of Australia and New Zealand and was selected for one test.
Jowett was a high scoring wing, and his 1902/03 season tally of 42 tries for Swansea is still a club record to this day. In 1905 the draw of professionalism proved too strong, and Jowett headed north to play for Hull Kingston Rovers, severing his ties with rugby union forever.
During World War I, Jowett was a corporal in the Welsh ammunition column.

1988 British International Helicopters Sikorsky S-61N crash

G-BEID was a Sikorsky S-61N helicopter of British International Helicopters which made a controlled ditching in the sea northeast of Sumburgh on 13 July 1988 following an engine fire. There were no fatalities.
Accident.
The helicopter left the "Safe Felicia" semi-submersible oil rig in the Forties oilfield at 13:45 with 2 pilots and a full load of 19 passengers for the one hour flight to Sumburgh Airport on the Mainland of Shetland. 
At 14:28 the co-pilot (who was flying) reported hearing a muffled bang which was also heard by some of the passengers, from the area of the No. 2 engine transmission. Shortly after, the No. 2 engine's fire warning lights came on. The pilot immediately began a descent and transmitted a distress call.
About 48 seconds after the noise, the No. 2 engine was shut down and the fire extinguisher triggered. The No. 1 engine fire warning then also illuminated, while passengers saw oil leaking from the cabin ceiling.
The pilot advised the passengers to prepare for an emergency ditching and took control of the aircraft. The floats were deployed and a gentle ditching was made about 3 minutes after the initial noise had been heard, by which time the helicopter's cabin had filled with smoke. All 21 occupants evacuated on to liferafts and were then winched up into a Search and Rescue helicopter. After a strong fire consumed most of the floating helicopter, the remains broke up and sank.
Investigation.
A recovery operation was mounted using the DSV (diving support vessel) "Stena Marianos" which arrived on site on 16 July 1988. The aft fuselage section was raised the following day and the forward section shortly after. The recovery operation had to be ended on 19 July before finding the engines or transmission components due to the "Stena Marianos" having other commitments.
The recovery continued on 2 August using the DSV "Norskald", and the engines, main rotor, and transmission were located and raised on 5 August.
Cause.
It was concluded that the fire had occurred in the helicopter's main gearbox, probably resulting from the effects of a bearing failure in the No. 2 engine. A further factor was the lack of fire detection or suppression capability within the gearbox bay. The cause of the bearing failure could not be definitely established.
Safety recommendations.
The AAIB made a list of 27 safety recommendations to the CAA. These addressed improvements in maintenance, early detection of problems, emergency escape equipment, documention and training provisions, and firewall integrity. Most of these were accepted by the CAA.

Laver function

In set theory, a Laver function (or Laver diamond, named after its inventor, Richard Laver) is a function connected with supercompact cardinals.
Definition.
If κ is a supercompact cardinal, a Laver function is a function "ƒ":κ → "V"κ such that for every set "x" and every cardinal λ ≥ |TC("x")| + κ there is a supercompact measure "U" on [λ]<κ such that if "j" "U" is the associated elementary embedding then "j" "U"("ƒ")(κ) = "x". (Here "V"κ denotes the κ-th level of the cumulative hierarchy, TC("x") is the transitive closure of "x")
Applications.
The original application of Laver functions was the following theorem of Laver. 
If κ is supercompact, there is a κ-c.c. forcing notion ("P", ≤) such after forcing with ("P", ≤) the following holds: κ is supercompact and remains supercompact after forcing with any κ-directed closed forcing.
There are many other applications, for example the proof of the consistency of the proper forcing axiom.

Swedish labour movement

The labour movement in Sweden dates back to at least the 1850s, when Swedish workers initiated the organizing of previously spontaneous food riots into strikes, hence acting as an autonomous group. 
History.
Modern types of labour unions emerged in the 1870s. An event that is usually considered to be central in the early days of the Swedish labour movement is the lecture "Hvad vil Social-Demokraterna?" ("What do the Social Democrats want?") by August Palm, at Hotel Stockholm in Malmö 6 November 1881. Five years later, in 1886, Sweden's first national labour union, Svenska Typografförbundet, was founded. Another union of that sort, Svenska Postmannaförbundet, was founded later that same year.
The labour movement soon divided into two parts, a political one and an unionspecialized one. The union movement was organized in one central organization, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), founded in 1898, with the aim to organize all national labour unions in one central organization. Parallel to, but closely associated with this movement is the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP), founded in 1889. 
These two organizations has ever since dominated not only the Swedish labour movement but also the political life in general. One example of their close association is the fact that all members of LO was initially automatically made members of SAP. 
Even though LO has dominated labour relations in Sweden, the two other big confederations for unions, the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees, TCO, and the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations, SACO, are today almost as important participants as LO in the debate of labour economics. In 2008 for the first time the total number of active wage and salary members (i.e. excluding pensioner, students and self-employed) in TCO and SACO together surpassed that of LO.

History.
TV3 officially began broadcasting on 26 March 1970 at 10:00 local time, launched by then Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn and broadcasts from Bangkok. This broadcast area was only limited to Bangkok Metropolitan Area area during its early years.
On 26 August 1975, TV3 became the first commercial channel in collaboration with MCOT bringing Thais the live coverage of the Bangkok Southeast Asian Peninsular Games. The same thing was also done in 1997 (failed, now Modernine TV) and 2011 (passed, all matches now Modernine TV).
On 26 August 1972, TV3 became the first commercial channel in collaboration with MCOT bringing Thais the live coverage of the Munich Olympics. The same thing was also done in 1976 and 1980.
On 1 January 1985, TV3 launched its first teletext service known as "ข่าวเขียน". In 1996 the service's name was changed to "Infonet". It was shut down on 1 January 2008.
Between 1981 to 31 March 1986, TV3 had joint news program with TV9 (present-day Modernine TV). TV3 had its own news service again on 1 April 1986.
On 1 January 1987, TV3 television audio stereo transmissions began in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. It was the first channel in Thailand to adopt stereo broadcasting. It transmits using the Zweikanalton stereo transmission system over TV3's UHF broadcast in Bangkok. Later in the 1990s, the stereo transmission was introduced into their VHF broadcast. TV3 was also experimenting with bilingual transmission over Zweikanalton for a short period of time in the 1990s.
TV3 transmits for 6 hours, from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm, between 26 March 1970 to 31 December 1989. 17-hour broadcasting, from 8:00 am to 1:00 am, was introduced in 1990. TV3 once had 24-hour broadcasting shortly in 1997, but due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, it was lifted. 24-hour transmission is back since 1 January 2005.
Until late-2004, TV3 broadcasts for 19 hours a day, then 21 hours, and finally adopting 24-hour broadcasting on 31 December 2004.
On 1 January 2001, TV3 was the first channel in Thailand to broadcast a 3D-movie. The movie, Jaws 3, required the viewers to have a pair of anaglyph glasses that can either be bought from certain stores partnered with TV3 for the event or attained from elsewhere (i.e. a 3D comic book the viewer already has).
In 2013, TV3 is going to change DTT signal from DMB-T to DVB-T and broadcast in two channels, one in SD and one in HD. Currently, TV3 broadcast SD only.
Features.
Ever since its launch, TV3 has been the second leading television station in Thailand, the second highest audience share ever achieved by a Thai television station. In terms of advertising revenue, the company retains its leadership position and continues to produce strong revenue growth from advertisements. TV3 continues to upgrade its equipment for production and transmission, and its employees receive continuous exposure and training in television production. This has enabled TV3 to remain as the premier private commercial broadcaster.
TV3 form the largest media group in Thailand, collectively known as BEC-TERO. It is currently headed by Prasan Maleenond.
With Thailand on the track to economic recovery, there has been a correspondingly steady demand for local programmes, whether it be news, , magazines, talk shows, sports, documentaries, dramas or films. With a strong base of television producers have revolutionized local content production to admiral levels in the broadcast industry. The station has been a trendsetter by producing quality local production and has caught the attention and loyalty of Thais. Believing in the precept that local content is the way to go, TV3 continues to invest in people and equipment to produce quality local content. However, the station also broadcast a balance of quality foreign content movies, dramas, situation comedy, documentaries and sports. The station has a strong market position and reinforces its brand awareness amongst its viewers through various on air and ground events.
TV3 currently broadcasts under UHF (Ultra High) Frequency. In the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, the UHF channel is 32. It is widely seen as favouring the government and not giving enough coverage for the opposition.. TV3 is also currently testing digital broadcasting, using the Chinese DMB-T/H system. The coverage is limited to Bangkok City area only, as opposed to both NBT's DVB and DMB signals which are available throughout the Bangkok Metropolitan Area.
TV3 is also available over TrueVisions on Channel 1.
Criticism and controversy.
TV3 has brought some controversies to the Thai entertainment sphere, especially with the excessive advertisement space which lead to the anger of the audience.

History of Dunfermline

Dunfermline (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Phàrlain) is a former burgh and current town in Fife, Scotland. The town grew under the influence of Queen Margaret to be an important ecclesiastical burgh (a town with special privileges). Until the 17th century, the town was the royal capital of Scotland. The union of the Scottish and English crowns in 1603 saw the end of the town's special status, which led to decline.
Early history.
Pictish and Gaelic names in the Dunfermline area are multiple. For example, the "bal" (a dwelling) found in Balmule and Balclune; the prefix "caer" (a castle) found in Carnock (caer-knock), Cairneyhill and Keirsbeath and Pittencrieff and Pitreative from "pit". Dunfermline is derived from "Dun" (fortified hill), "fiaram" (bent or crooked) and "lin" (a cascade or pool). A reference of the city's name is found in the tower hill around which the rivulet crooks and drops over a 15 foot cascade of the Ferm burn.
One of the earliest records of the city was known for being used as a centre of the Culdees in 570 AD, based on a site near or on the grounds of the present Abbey. Written history of Dunfermline begins with King Malcolm III in the mid-11th century who would play a pivotal role transferring power from Forteviot in Perthshire to Dunfermline becoming the seat of power and capital of Scotland.
King Malcolm III accepted marriage to Queen Margaret in 1069 as his second wife after she met him in his royal residence which would became the site of Dunfermline Palace.
According to St Dunleum, there is a belief that they may have met previously. Margaret's Benedictine education - for which she brought as and became a devout catholic - encouraged him to convert the small Culdee church into a Benedictine priory to bring her faith to Scotland to replace the basic needs of the Culdees. The new church was inaugurated around 1072 with Lanfranc, then-Archbishop of Canterbury sending Benedictine monks on the insistence of Margaret who not only dedicated the priory to the holy trinity. Another dedication to the priory was also made to the "crucifix of the holy saviour" made of ebony, gold and silver and covered in gems from her own homeland.
King Malcolm III was killed at the battle of Alnwick, Queen Margaret died in Edinburgh Castle on 10 November 1093.
The body of the Queen was taken to Dunfermline for her burial on a site near the Rwde Awtre (the Altar of the Holy Cross or Rood) via the Queen's Ferry but this was journey was made with great difficulty particularly when the castle was under siege by Donald Bane with the only exit in the form of a secret door in the abbey church.
Creation and influence of Dunfermline Abbey.
The Benedictine priory was raised to the rank of an abbey in 1128 by David II, with Prior Geoffrey in place as the first abbot. During the course of several decades, the abbey gained power and wealth in Dunfermline with the dedication of 26 altars being gifted by the individuals and guilds and the bishop of Dunfermline controlled a large piece of land from Moray to Berwickshire close to the English border which included four burghs and three courts of regality.
The abbey was also given permission to dig the lands of Pittencrieff in 1291 for the extraction of coal for personal usage on a lease - the oldest record of not only coal mining but also Fife industry benefiting many people who would eventually depend on this livelihood as their source of work in West Fife.
There were five individual developments to the abbey all occurring between 1128 and 1450 with the construction of a nave around 1140; the expansion of the choir of the mastried church complete with a shrine in 1240 which was followed by major restoration work of the recetory partially assisted by Robert the Bruce - who died shortly after and was buried in the graveyard - in 1329 and then later with a new West Gave by Bishop Richard de Bothwell in 1450. Further work centered around the north-west tower of the nave between 1594 and 1599 by William Shaw.
The abbey though did have some rough patches with the force of the troops of Edward I causing substantial damage in 1303 which he claimed beforehand: "not a church, but a den of thieves...a thorn in the eye of the English throne" with another contribution by the reformation lords in 1560 causing the demolition of some parts - including the removal of shrine of St Margaret which has been labelled as maybe their worst act - deteriorating the state of the abbey further.
History of the town's name and Royal Burgh status.
The town's name was first recorded as ""Dunfermelitane"" in the confirmation charters by David I in 1128. The name of "Dunfermline" was not officially adopted until 1609 but references had been made in the seals and badges of the royal coat of arms. Dunfermline was credited as a "menus burgh" by David II with evidence suggesting that burgh of barony status took place between 1124 and 1147. Royal burgh status was later granted by James VI of Scotland in 1588.
The construction of six gates in Dunfermline in 1396 were to maintain the burgher's rights; the need for tolls and to a lesser extent to defend. These gates were: The Mill or Collieraw Port (East of Bruce Street); Rottenraw port (near the top of South Chapel Street); Crosswynd Port (now Crosswynd) East Port; Tolbooth Port (bottom of Bruce Street) and West Port (middle of St Catherines Wynd).
Dunfermline would remain as the capital of Scotland until the brutal murder of James II at Perthin 1436. The royal family felt safer in Edinburgh Castle, as burghs such as Dunfermline and Stirling could not provide protection in defense of the nobles.
Decline of royal status and birth of the linen industry.
The relocation of the Scottish courts to London being the result of the union of the crowns drawn up in 1603 saw the loss of the city's royal connections. A subsequent fire in 1624, saw a large part of the city in ruin, before being deprived of the eccestrial centre along with St Andrews by the Reformation. Dunfermline quickly sank into decline.
In the 18th century, the city impressed Daniel Defoe as showing the "full perfection of decay". The town would soon regained prosperity with the introduction of the weaving of linen damask - which would eventually become recognised as the world's leading producer - established by James Blake in 1718 after being inspired by having gained the experience of the special technique of one in Edinburgh as the way to take Dunfermline forward. Dunfermline became one of four main centres of the industry alongside Kirkcaldy, Dysart and Leslie in 1810. Although the first power looms in operation brought greater demand for the town's linen industry by 1825 as Dunfermline began to acknowledge the coming of the industrial revolution. The undemining success of the linen in Dunfermline was prompted by a report by the Ordnance Gazette in 1894 who said: "The damask manufacture of Dunfermline is probably unequalled in the world for design and beauty of finish". Among other industries that have largely contributed to the welfare of the town are dyeing, bleaching; soap (from 1790s); rope-making (from 1830s); iron founding ; textile milling; distillery and brewing.

Duke George Augustus of Mecklenburg

Duke George Augustus of Mecklenburg () (16 August 1748 – 14 November 1785) was a member of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and a German sailor and soldier.
Early life.
Duke George Augustus was born in Mirow the youngest child of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow and his wife Princess Elizabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His grandfather Adolf Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the founder of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
On 8 September 1761 his sister Charlotte married the King of Great Britain, George III. Following the marriage George Augustus moved to the Kingdom of Great Britain and after learning the English language volunteered to serve in the Royal Navy. He spent two years serving in the Navy before he was forced to leave due to illness brought on by the climate and life at sea. During his time in Great Britain George Augustus became a Doctor of Laws.
George Augustus developed a love of Britain and though a firm Protestant himself, he disapproved of the country's discrimination and intolerance of Catholics.
Imperial service.
After recovering from his illness George Augustus spent some time studying at the University of Leiden before being invited to enter into the service of the Queen-Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. He accepted the offer and was made a Lieutenant-Colonel. He was promoted to rank of Colonel after a fellow officer complained to Empress Maria Theresa that Duke George Augustus associated with socially inferior officers and that he had forgot that he was a German prince. The Empress who was only concerned if George Augustus had forgotten that he was Lieutenant-Colonel in her service, responded by promoting him to the rank of Colonel after the complaining officer admitted he was a good officer as she was only interested that he did his duty as an officer in her service.
He continued his rise up the ranks and a short while after being made a colonel he was made 'General of Horse' and was decorated with various honours. In 1780 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General and was appointed inspector of two carabinier regiments. He won the praise of Austrian Field Marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon in 1782 after carrying out Army manœuvres in Prague with 50,000 infantry and cavalry soldiers.
Duke George Augustus never married and died in Tyrnau in the Kingdom of Hungary at the age of 37. He was buried in Mirow in 1852.

Prospect research

Prospect research, also known as development research or fundraising research, is a process in fundraising wherein a researcher identifies and provides relevant information about potential donors to an organization. 
For complete information on the profession, visit the APRA (Association for Professional Researchers for Advancement) website: http://www.aprahome.org/
Prospect researchers are usually employees of universities, charities or other not for profit organizations. Some are freelancers, or work for private companies. Organizations generally employ prospect researchers to find and qualify potential "major" donors who have the resources to make a large gift to the organization, although the definition of a "large" gift can vary considerably. A prospect researcher will assess an individual's, company's or charitable trust or foundation's capacity and propensity to donate. Prospect researchers use a variety of resources, including public records, business and financial publications, and Internet databases.
Most prospect researchers adhere to a code of ethics to protect both the institutions they represent and the prospects they research. 
Prospect researchers will conduct research to evaluate a prospect's ability to give, also called capacity (how much the individual is worth) and warmth toward the organization, a.k.a. affinity (how close the prospect feels to the organization). Prospect researchers may also analyze data in a donor or constituent database to identify new potential major donors or to predict which groups of constituents are most likely to make major gifts.
Wealth ratings usually refer to a prospect's capacity to donate. One of the most common sources used by prospect researchers for this task are Rich Lists. The Sunday Times Rich List is widely referred to by prospect researchers, but its overall value is disputed. There is a large variety of algorithms that many scholars use in regards to a wealth score, most would agree in America real estate is the main indicator.
Research is generally conducted via the Internet, but also with subscribed databases like Factiva, LexisNexis and FAME. A researcher may also use government managed resources like Companies House, the Charity Commission or HM Land Registry. Other useful resources include Debrett's and Who's Who, which can provide good general background on any prospect.

Edmund A. Gann

Edmund A. Gann (October 10, 1923 – February 5, 2010) was an American businessman and Thoroughbred racehorse owner.
Early life and career.
Born in the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, while still a child, Edmund Gann's family migrated to California where his father built and operated a commercial fishing clipper. During World War II, he served with the United States Navy. Following his discharge, Edmund Gann went to work managing a grocery store his father had acquired as an investment. From there, he entered the fishing business with his brother Joseph and their company, Caribbean Marine Service Co. Inc., became a highly successful tuna-fishing fleet operator.
Tri-Union Seafoods.
In 1997, Edmund Gann partnered with Tri-Marine International, Inc. of Singapore and Thai Union International of Bangkok to create Tri-Union Seafoods LLC which acquired the San Diego, California based canned tuna processing and packing company, Chicken of the Sea. In 2000, Gann sold his twenty-five percent stake in Chicken of the Sea to Thai Union International.
Although the fishing industry has been where he had his principal investment, Edmund Gann also has had interests in the oil industry, banking, hardware, and real estate development.
Thoroughbred racing.
In the mid 1960s Edmund Gann became involved in thoroughbred horse racing by accident after a friend was unable to repay a loan and offered a racing mare, named Bold Producer, instead. With little alternative, Gann took ownership of the horse, which promptly won three straight races. Enamored with racing, he began building a solid stable by buying horses in the United States as well as in Europe. In 1975, he hired future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Robert Frankel as his trainer. For twenty-one years they worked closely and met with considerable success at racetracks across the United States.

Wallis &amp; Edward

Wallis & Edward (in Canada also known as Her Royal Affair) is a 2005 British made-for-TV movie, scripted by Sarah Williams, dramatising the events of the Edward VIII abdication crisis. It was billed as the first scripted account of the romance between Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII of the United Kingdom to view events from Wallis Simpson's point of view. Joely Richardson played Wallis, and Steven Campbell Moore, Edward. It is comparable to the 2002 "Bertie and Elizabeth", covering some of the same subject matter in a similar style, but from the point of view of Edward's brother Albert (George VI) and sister-in-law Elizabeth.

1918–19 Toronto Arenas season

The 1918–19 Toronto Arenas season was the second season of the Toronto franchise of the National Hockey League. After being operated on a temporary basis in the previous year, the team became a formal entity, known as the 'Toronto Arena Hockey Club.' The club played 18 games and suspended operations.
Regular season.
When Toronto won the Cup in 1917–18, a monkey wrench had been thrown into the other owners' scheme to get rid of Eddie Livingstone. His team was estimated now to be worth $20,000, and Livingstone demanded that. The Arena Gardens offered $7,000, but Livingstone sued the Arena and Charlie Querrie for the $20,000. A league meeting of the old NHA proved futile as heated arguments broke out between Livingstone and the other owners. The old NHA was extinguished. However, George Kennedy gave some ground, saying that if Livingstone dropped his lawsuits, he might be allowed in the league. In the meantime, Hubert Vearncombe, treasurer of the Toronto Arena Company formed the separate Toronto Arena HC. This separated the hockey club from the Livingstone lawsuits, though the franchise still used Livingstone's players without permission.
It was announced on February 18, that Ken Randall and Harry Meeking had signed with Glace Bay of the Maritime League with the Arenas' permission. The game that night was attended by only 1,000 fans watching a 4–3 overtime loss to Ottawa. After a follow-up game in Ottawa on February 20, lost 9–3, manager Querrie announced that the club sought to withdraw from the NHL season and this was agreed to by Ottawa and Montreal. The NHL season ended at 18 games, with Montreal and Ottawa to play off for the championship.
Playoffs.
The Arenas did not qualify for the playoffs.

Figliola

Figliola is a "frazione" (outlying area) of the "comune" of Crognaleto, in the Province of Teramo within the Abruzzo Region of Italy. It is located between the towns of Crognaleto, San Giorgio and Aiello in the Vomano Valley. Figliola faces the Gran Sasso and can be reached via a road that is only partially paved. 
According to some historians the village takes its name from the Italian word "Filiola" meaning a small stream of water. At one time the village was part of the feudal holdings of the Dukes of Atri. During the 17th century the village likely served as a refuge for brigand soldiers while their leaders took shelter in the a nearby castle located in San Giorgio. During some of the fiercer skirmishes the brigand likely fled to the Papal States just to the north in what today is Italy's Marche Region. In 1804 the village had only 36 people living there. Nine years later Figliola was assigned to the "comune" of Crognaleto. Today the village is completely uninhabited. 
Most of the houses in the village are constructed of stone. Although few people visit the village in the winter, several families have restored houses that serve as summer homes and are used primarily in the summer months. 
For religious purposes Figliola belonged to the church parish of Macchia Vomano. The village church is dedicated to Saint Mary Madelene.

Diana Bar

Diana Bar is a beach library and gallery in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. before being a public library it was a historic café with the same name. It is located in the south end of the city's main waterfront avenue, the Banhos Avenue ("Avenida dos Banhos", literally Baths Avenue).
It includes bar and Internet services, and is often used for exhibits and book presentations. The library is very popular, because of its beach view and large windows, in the summer it often gets over 800 visitors per day. The arts TV show, "Câmara Clara", of the public broadcaster RTP, was broadcast from there during the 2006 "Correntes d'Escritas" International literary meeting in Póvoa de Varzim.
A rose colored building, Diana Bar is surrounded by the beach except in the entrance by the Banhos Avenue. It has an egg-shape architectural conception, with large windows and a wide interior. It has an internal balcony around the building that functions as the second floor. Diana Bar's floor mimics the Portuguese pavement, for exteriors, and is a drawing of concentric circles.
History.
Diana Bar was built over the beach between 1938/1939, and due to its select nature, it soon became a writers meeting place and for intellectuals coming from various cities. It was where José Régio wrote some of his works, and still today, the table and chair that he often choose are exhibited with his portray. Diana Bar was where José Régio and Agustina Bessa-Luis often met, when she was living in Esposende and he in Vila do Conde. Agustina lived in Póvoa de Varzim earlier in her life, a town that she described as a "magical place in the beginning of my adolescence".
With the death of its founder, the building entered into decay for several years. In November 2001, Póvoa de Varzim City hall bought and restored the building. In the summer of 2002, Diana Bar was ready to reopened as a beach library for the general public, first only in the summer months, but given its popularity it soon started to offer its services all year around.

Northumbria Flames

The Northumbria Flames are an ice hockey club under the British Universities Ice Hockey Association, with a team entered into division 2 (2011 Season). They represent Northumbria University at home, away and national games.
History.
The club's aim has always been to help players develop while enjoying their hockey. With a little work, they also developed into an unstoppable force and won every match in the 2006-07 season to take the Northern League title - proving that the formula works.
The Northumbria Flames were originally part of a larger squad comprising students from both Newcastle and Northumbria universities. In 2001, due to financial disagreements between the two institutions the club split and the Flames were born.
In the early days the Flames traditionally played the underdogs to the league's top teams, but always turned in healthy performances against local rivals Newcastle Wildcats and at the end-of-season nationals tournament. As new players joined, the standard of play gradually improved and the numbers swelled until we were able to launch a B team (division 3) in 2006. We're now able to focus on pushing for glory with the A team and welcoming and developing rookies in the B team, ranging from roller hockey veterans to complete beginners.
2008 Club Reshuffle.
Over the summer of 2008, it was decided that from the following season, depending on the amount of new players, a third team is to be introduced. This third team will be another entry into Division 2, and will be named the B team. The B team of previous seasons is to be renamed the C team. The Northumbria Flames will then have two teams entered into Division 2, and one team in Division 3.
