Francesco Valiani

Francesco Valiani, (born 29 October 1980 in Pistoia), is an Italian football midfielder currently playing for A.C. Siena in Italy's Serie A.
Career.
Valiani joined Bologna in January 2008 and helped them to promotion after spending two-and-a-half seasons in Serie B with Rimini. His final game (and goal) for Rimini was on 2008-01-26 and, ironically, against the team he would join the next week. Bologna won the match 2–1.
On 31 August 2008 he made his Serie A debut by scoring the winning goal in a shocking 2–1 win for Bologna at San Siro against AC Milan. On 29 January 2010 Parma signed the midfielder from Bologna in return for winger Andrea Pisanu on joint ownership deals, both player tagged for €2.5 million. Valiani signed a 3½ year contract.
In June 2011 Parma acquired Valiani outright and co-currently Andrea Pisanu jointed Bologna outright. Co-currently Alessandro Elia and Riccardo Pasi returned to their mother club.
Elia was valued an aggressive price of €1.5 million While Pasi's 50% rights was valued an aggressive price of €1.6 million; Valiani cost Parma €2.8 million and co-currently Parma sold Andrea Pisanu outright for €2.5 million. The four deals made Bologna received €200,000 in net.
On 14 July 2012, Parma sold Valiani outright to fellow Serie A club Siena for just €100,000. In June and July 2012 Siena and Parma also made cash-less players only swap, namely: Brandão, Iacobucci, Pacini and Rossi of Siena for a total of €5.6 million; Coppola, Dellafiore, Doumbia and Galuppo of Parma also for a total of €5.6 million.

Arno B. Cammerer

Arno Berthold Cammerer (July 31, 1883 – April 30, 1941) was the third director of the U.S. National Park Service. 
Cammerer was born in Arapahoe, Nebraska in 1883. He was the son of a Lutheran pastor. He went to Washington, D.C in 1904 to work as a civil service bookkeeper, and earned a Bachelor of Law degree at Georgetown Law School in 1911.
The U.S. National Park Service's first director, Stephen Mather, recognized Cammerer's competence as executive secretary of the Fine Arts Commission, and appointed him as assistant director in 1919, replacing previous assistant director Horace M. Albright, who then became Director. He served as Mather's right-hand man in Washington and acted for him in his frequent absences over the next decade. After the project to found Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved expensive, Cammerer secured a promise from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to match $5 million in the acquisition of Shenandoah National Park lands. He advanced to the new rank of associate director on January 12, 1929.
Directorship of the U.S. National Park Service.
Cammerer succeeded Albright as director on August 10, 1933, the same day as the transfer of the national capitol parks, historic sites, memorials, and monuments from the War and Agriculture departments. Under his leadership the NPS tripled the number of areas served, increased visitations from two to 16 million, became involved with recreational area planning and management, began to survey and record historic sites and buildings outside the existing parks, and worked with Congress to pass the Historic Sites Act as well as a law establishing the National Park Foundation.
In 1938, he received the Pugsley Gold Medal. The Pugsley Award recognizes outstanding contributions to the promotion and development of public parks in the United States and is given out by the American Academy of Park and Recreation Administrators along with the National Park Foundation.
Strained relations with Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes impaired Cammerer's effectiveness and health; he stepped down in 1940 following a heart attack the previous year. He then became the service's eastern regional director.
Death and legacy.
After suffering another heart attack, Cammerer died on April 30, 1941. The official NPS biography says that "Cammerer's contributions to the National Park Service were legion."
Mount Cammerer, on the Northeastern fringe of the Great Smoky Mountains is named for Arno as he had played a prominent role in the acquisition of the park.

Hartford Dark Blues all-time roster

The Hartford Dark Blues were a Major League Baseball club in the 1870s, based in Hartford, Connecticut for three seasons and in Brooklyn, New York for one. Hartford was a member of the National Association (NA), – and a founding member of the National League (NL) in , when it played home games at the Hartford Ball Club Grounds. During the team played home games at the Union Grounds in Brooklyn and was sometimes called the Brooklyn Hartfords.
The team's owner, Morgan Bulkeley, who later became the first president of the NL in 1876, established the franchise in 1874; he gave the on-field captain duties to Lip Pike, who was also the starting center fielder. Among the other players signed by Hartford were pitcher Cherokee Fisher, who had led the NA in earned run average the two previous seasons, second baseman Bob Addy, and Scott Hastings.
After placing seventh among the league's eight teams, the team's roster was purged and captain duties were handed over to third baseman Bob Ferguson, who stayed in the role for the remaining three seasons of the franchise's existence. The change in personnel, which included the pitching additions of future Hall of Famer Candy Cummings and Tommy Bond, improved the team's results. With the team's pitching rotation stable, and the hitting of Tom Carey, Tom York, Dick Higham, and Jack Burdock, the franchise enjoyed second-place finishes in 1875 and 1876.
Following the departure of their pitching stars, Cummings and Bond, the team had to rely on Terry Larkin in 1877, who shouldered most of the pitching duties. The Dark Blues finished in third place, despite the hitting of John Cassidy, who batted .378. When Bulkeley moved his team to Brooklyn in 1877, he expected that he would make a better profit than he had in Hartford. The larger population of Brooklyn did not, however, respond in kind, and the Hartfords' fan base did not increase. He became disenchanted with his involvement in baseball, and with his interest in running the day-to-day operations of the team. Because of this and the lack of fan support, the team disbanded after the 1877 season.

Zax (Duke Power)

Zax was a cartoon robot employed by the Duke Energy (then called Duke Power) Corporation in the early to mid '80s to educate children on the dangers and how not to waste electricity. The voice of Zax was portrayed by Charlotte weatherman Larry Sprinkle.
History.
In 1984 Duke Power decided to release a series of Public Service Announcements to educate children on how to be safe and use electricity efficiently. These cartoon PSAs featured a small, eager to learn robot named Zax, and a group of children who constantly had to keep Zax from getting injured or killed by electricity.
In the late '80s to early '90s Zax seemed to have disappeared all together. There is no mention of Zax on the Duke Energy website. It's almost as if Duke Energy were trying to erase him from history. However, someone such as Zax who had such a profound effect on children of the '80s will never forget how much they learned from him. He now has an Official Facebook Page, at last!
The PSAs.
Zax appeared in a number of cartoon PSAs throughout the '80s. Only a 1989 Christmas PSA can be found online to watch here. Several PSAs that aired featured the following scenarios: Zax taking a bath with a hairdryer, stereo and portable TV all around the bathtub, the blonde boy, named Billy, from the group of children comes into the bathroom and tells Zax that he is not being safe and that he could be injured or killed by using electric devices by water. Another PSA featured after a tornado Zax and the children discover downed power lines and have to teach Zax that it's not safe for him to go near them that he could get "hurt or even killed!". All the PSAs ended with the same line: "This message brought to you by your friends at Duke Power."
Energy Conservation Kit.
In 1984 Duke Power issued a kit to teachers across the Carolinas to help educate the children in their classes on electricity. The kit came in a cardboard box with Zax on the lid of the box. Found inside the kit was a poster featuring several panels of how to conserve energy with Zax and his friends; a light switch faceplate featuring Zax reminding you to turn out the light when you leave the room; membership cards to be given to children who took Zax's pledge to be safe and not waste electricity; a film-strip and an audio cassette that featured an adventure of Zax and his friends; several mimeograph worksheets for children to do; stickers that featured the same panels used on the poster included.

Natalya Petrovna Bilikhodze (1900 – December 2000) is one of several women to make the claim that she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, who was killed with her family by Bolsheviks at Yekaterinburg, Russia on July 17, 1918. Bilikhodze's claim was presented at a press conference in Moscow in June 2002. Bilikhodze claimed that Anastasia was not shot, but fled to Georgia, where she later married. Bilikhodze had begun using the name Grand Duchess Anastasia in 1995. The video of Bilikhodze bringing forward these claims was shown on Russian television in June 2002. It was later revealed that the video had been made two years prior to that, and Bilikhodze herself had died in Podolsk and been dead since 2000. In January 2001, a commission of experts at the Central Clinical Hospital studied tissues from Bilikhodze's body and concluded that she was not related to the Romanovs.

Emerson Cavitation Tunnel

The Emerson Cavitation Tunnel is a propeller testing facility based at Newcastle University, UK. The tunnel is based in the department of Marine Science and Technology, and is currently the second largest cavitation tunnel in the UK, the largest being that owned by the Ministry of Defence at Haslar.
Capabilities.
The Emerson Cavitation Tunnel consists of a water circuit which flows in the vertical plane, within which propellers and other propulsion devices can be tested. The system is powered by a pump, with a four-bladed impeller and can produce a maximum water velocity of . The test area has a cross sectional area of allowing model propellers of up to in diameter to be tested. The pressure range of the tunnel can vary from a minimum of 7.6 kN/m2 to a maximum of 106 kN/m2. Cavitation numbers of 0.5 (minimum) to 23 (maximum) can be accommodated for. Measurements can be taken using a 3 Watt, water-cooled, Argon-ion laser, a hydrophone, and two dynamometers. A high-speed video camera is also attached with an imaging frequency of 0–50 frames per second. 
Funding for the tunnel's equipment is raised by numerous organisations, including the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Scottish Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde.
History.
The tunnel was first established at the University in 1949 after being disassembled and transported from Pelzerhaken, Germany after the Second World War. The tunnel arrived at the University in 1947 and over the following few years the tunnel was heavily modified. The tunnel - which was originally designed to operated in the horizontal plane - was converted into a vertical loop tunnel and the length was reduced by half. The original observation window was modified and two more added. Because of damage, a new impeller was constructed and numerous pieces of measuring equipment were added. This equipment included pitot tubes, a tachometer, stroboscopic lighting equipment, contact meters and a vacuum pump. The tunnel was connected to an electrical supply in 1949 and entered service late in 1950, after technical problems called for recalibration of some of the instruments. The Cavitation Tunnel is still housed in Newcastle University's old boiler house, where it was originally reconstructed.
The first research grant of £8,000 was awarded in 1950 for the testing of a new series of propellers, and was awarded by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR).
In the 1970s and 1980s, the tunnel was extensively modified and upgraded in order to improve the range of propellers that could be tested. The tunnel was also renamed to its current name, the "Emerson Cavitation Tunnel" after Dr Arnold Emerson, who was the tunnel superintendent and the driving force behind the upgrades.
Since the upgrades of the 1980s, few other modifications have been made to the tunnel itself. New computer-based data collection, interpretation and analysis technology has been added to aid with computational fluid dynamics. Data is also collected with the help of laser doppler anemometry (LDA) and phase doppler anemometry (PDA).

Charles Van Riper

Charles Gage Van Riper (1905 – 1994) was a renowned speech therapist who became internationally known as a pioneer in the development of speech pathology. A severe stutterer throughout his career, he is described as having had the most influence of any speech-language pathologist in the field of stuttering.
Biography.
Charles Van Riper, known to his family as Cully, grew up in Champion Township, Michigan. He was the son of Champion's physician, known as "Dr. Van". Charles began to stutter at two years of age, and had a "miserable childhood" growing up in the midst of local superstition about stutterers. Even though he stuttered throughout his schooling years, he did very well academically, reading voraciously and showing great talent for writing. He subsequently attended the Northern Michigan Normal School, and then the University of Michigan where he won honors for creative writing and graduated with a Master of Arts in English. After graduation, he taught high school English in Saline, Michigan, developing many techniques for dealing with his stuttering while teaching. Although he was regarded as a proficient and innovative teacher, the stress of his stuttering and his fear of speaking in many situations, made him unhappy at teaching.
A severe stutterer, Charles attended two institutes for stutterers, the Bogue Institute of Stammerers in Indianapolis and the Millard School in Milwaukee, but these institutions did little good; at the time, "nobody had actually taken the trouble to learn about stuttering, so nobody knew how to cure it". He subsequently joined a graduate program in speech pathology at Iowa, where he and other graduate students tried to develop "practical techniques" of a treatment for stuttering. These attempts proved successful, and after several years in Iowa, Charles received his Ph.D. in speech pathology.
In 1936, Charles was hired by the Western Michigan State Normal School in Kalamazoo. He founded and headed its speech clinic, and was the first chair of its speech pathology and audiology department. During his subsequent career he became internationally known as a pioneer in the development of the science of speech pathology; he worked with thousands of stutterers, did research, and published a large number of books, articles and films on the subject. Under the pseudonym "Cully Gage", Charles also wrote "The Northwoods Reader", a series of books based on life in Champion. 
Charles stuttered throughout his career despite trying almost every sort of stuttering therapy, ranging from rhythmic control, relaxation, slow speech, and breathing exercises, to psychoanalysis and hypnosis. He eventually managed to become very fluent even though he continued to stutter. Charles wrote in a letter to a newsletter that he had lived a "very successful and happy life", a result of an idea that came to him while hitch-hiking his way home from Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where he had spent a month as the hired man on a farm, pretending to be a deaf mute because his stuttering was so severe that he could not get any other employment: he met an old stutterer who said that he was "too old and tired to fight myself now so I just let the words leak out"; Charles realised that he should have been seeking a way of stuttering that would be tolerable both to others and himself, instead of avoiding and hiding his stutter.
Charles died in his home in Kalamazoo, after a long illness.
Career.
Charles Van Riper developed stuttering modification therapy between 1936 and 1958. This type of therapy focussed on reducing the fears and anxieties of adult stutterers, and added methods to modify the "core behaviors" of stuttering, to make them less physically stressful. This therapy is one of the most widely practiced stuttering treatments. Additionally, several of his books were the authoritative books on the subject for a number of years, namely "The Nature of Stuttering", "The Treatment of Stuttering" and "Speech Correction: Principles and Methods", the latter book being the first textbook in the field. Textbooks he authored have been used in both undergraduate and graduate courses in stuttering.
Charles approached stuttering from the viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, to become aware of everything he did from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.
Legacy.
Years after his death, Charles Van Riper's work continues to be referred to and analyzed. Methods in stuttering therapy that drew from his work have been called "Van Riperian therapy" and the "Van Riper Program", and his therapy methods have seen many applications, including uses in guides for speech therapists and in whole therapy programs. Even the verbal response patterns Charles used when conducting stuttering modification therapy have been analyzed: a study found that "Van Riper's therapy during these videotaped sessions relied less on Confrontation and Self-Disclosure verbal responses and more on instructional, informational, and educational verbal response modes".
Charles was the subject of the Western Michigan University's informal talk for emeriti and friends on November 14, 2007, which discussed his professional history and writings about his childhood. Moreover, an award has been named after him: the Charles Van Riper Award "recognizes the achievements of individuals who have known the anguish of stuttering and the success of achieving effective communication". A series of nine films that show several of his therapy sessions with an adult stutterer and discusses the long term effectiveness of the therapy, has been called a "classic".

USS Scanner (AGR-5)

USS "Scanner" (AGR-5/YAGR-5) was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1955 from the "mothballed" reserve fleet. She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Pacific Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
A Liberty ship built in Florida.
"Scanner" (YAGR-5) was laid down on 24 January 1945 by the J. A. Jones Construction Co., Panama City, Florida, as Liberty ship "Edwin D. Howard". She was launched on 27 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John E. Davidson, and delivered on 14 March 1945 to the Alcoa Steamship Company. She was acquired by the Navy from the U.S. Maritime Administration on 10 June 1955, renamed "Scanner", converted to a radar picket ship at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and commissioned on 30 January 1956 with Lt. Comdr. H. H. Pruett in command.
Radar picket duty.
"Scanner" departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 March 1956 for her home port, San Francisco, California, and commenced her first patrol in the Pacific Ocean in July 1956 with the seaward extension of America's early warning defense system. 
Fitted with sophisticated electronic search and tracking equipment, "Scanner" could detect, track, and report enemy aircraft at great distances, and control high speed interceptor aircraft in event of attack. She also carried out weather reporting duties during her three to four-week-long cruises.
Decommissioning.
"Scanner" was redesignated "AGR-5" effective 28 September 1958. She was decommissioned on 21 July 1965 at San Francisco and turned over to Maritime Administration Fleet custody on 26 July at Suisun Bay, California. Struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1965, she was transferred permanently to the Maritime Administration on 4 February 1966 and remained in the Suisun Bay reserve fleet until 3 October 1974 when she was sold for non-transport use.

<doc id="19090319" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19090319" title="Holonema">
Holonema

Holonema is an extinct genus of relatively large, barrel-shaped arthrodire placoderms that were found in oceans throughout the world from the Mid to Late Devonian, when the last species perished in the Frasnian-Fammian extinction event. Most species of the genus are known from fragments of the armor, but the Gogo Reef species, "H. westolli", is known from whole, articulated specimens. According to these specimens, species of "Holonema" lived by grazing on stony, horn-shaped, stromatolite-like algae called oncholite, apparently by snipping off the points with a specialized snout.
Species.
"H. rugosum".
"H. rugosum" is the type species. It was originally described as a species of the antiarch genus, "Pterichthys". Fossils are found in Frasnian strata of New York and Pennsylvania, and Givetian strata of Wisconsin and Michigan. It is a fairly large species, though the type specimen is of an 18 centimeter long median dorsal plate belonging to a small individual. Fossils of "H. horridum" and "Glyptaspis eastmani" may be this species. Fossils from Frasnian Iran ("H. cf. rugosum") may also belong to this species.
"H. arcticum".
A large species from Givetian-aged strata in Novaya Zemlya, Russia, known only from two plates from one individual's trunk shield.
"H. bruehni".
"H. bruehni" is a recently discovered species from the Middle Eifelian-aged Brandenberg stratum of Sauerland, Northwestern Germany. Juveniles had a dermal ornamentation of irregularly spaced tubercles, while the dermal surface of adults' armor were smooth.
"H. farrowi".
Known from fragments from the Givetian-aged "Traverse Group" stratum in Michigan. The median dorsal plates range up to 20 cm in length. The median dorsal plate is fairly broad at the posterior end, but narrows as one approaches the anterior end.
"H. haiti".
Known from fragments from the Givetian section of the Jefferson formation in Idaho. The median dorsal plate is estimated to be about 28 cm in length, and is very narrow compared to those of other species.
"H. harmae".
Found in the Givetian-aged Burtnieki beds of Estonia. It is distinguished from other species in that the spinal and subpectoral margins of the anterior-ventral plates meet at almost a right angle.
"H. obrutshevi".
Found in the Eifelian-aged Aruküla beds of Estonia. The median dorsal plate has a small, horn-like process, and the trunkshield is somewhat circular when viewed from the top or bottom.
"H. ornatum".
From the Givetian-aged Bressay flags of the Shetland Islands. Imperfectly known. Denison 1978 suggests that it may not belong to "Holonema".
"H. radiatum".
This is species is known primarily from the Frasnian-aged Shelon beds of the Baltic, and the Donetz Basin of Russia. Specimens and fragments from the Frasnian-aged Holy Cross Mountain of Poland, and the Givetian sections of the Fiskekløfta formation in Spitzbergen. It is a fairly large species with a moderately narrow median dorsal plate. The median dorsal plate averages about 30 cm in length.
"H. westolli".
This is the best-known species of the genus, known from numerous, often articulated specimens from the Frasnian-aged Gogo Reef. The species is very similar to "H. rugosum", but the trunk shield is comparatively more narrow. The median dorsal averages about 23 cm in length, and the average body length of living individuals are estimated to be around 150 cm.

Gradius ReBirth

Gameplay.
"Gradius ReBirth" is a side-scrolling 2D shooter much like previous "Gradius" games, and has been described as a "remix" of levels from past games rather than an entirely new game. The game features two modes: a standard game with unlimited credits and a Score Attack mode where players are only given a single credit to beat the game. Score Attack also supports online leaderboards. The game features 5 different types of ships to choose from, and five stages in total, with each (except the first stage) having its own original boss at the end.
Plot.
This game takes place in the Gradian Year 6664, two years before "The Silent Nightmare Incident". The planet Antichthon, a protectorate of the Gradian Empire, suddenly and mysteriously falls silent. A report was made by the Director General of the Space Science Agency, Dr. Venom, which mentions that Antichthon's mother computer was now under the control of the Bacterians.
Realizing that a threat from the Bacterians may be imminent, the Gradian Government deploys its Gradian forces to combat the threat. Among them is Special Colonel James Burton, who had defeated the Bacterians a few years ago. Armed with an A.I. program called Gaudie, James Burton sets out in the hyperspace fighter known as the Vic Viper, in the hopes that he can combat the new Bacterian threat. But little does James know that there's much more in store for him...
Development.
"Gradius ReBirth" uses the "Nemesis" titles for the MSX as its basis. The power meter and text display have also been updated. The music was composed by Manabu Namiki and consists of remixed music from previous "Gradius" games.
An update to the game was released on the Wii Shop Channel for free of charge. It improves some of the visuals and adds a new ranking board for the adjustments made to the score system. In addition to this, there are new music tracks and a few changes to the game's levels.
Reception.
"Gradius ReBirth" garnered positive reviews. IGN gave the game 7/10, praising the nostalgic retro design but finding the game to be punishingly hard for most players and the lack of multiplayer disappointing. Despite also praising the retro visuals and soundtrack, NintendoLife gave "Gradius ReBirth" 6/10.

Standing tall at the shoulders, it is a small subspecies that is only a little larger than its Japanese counterpart. The back is brown with a long dark vertebral strip flanked from indistinct white spots, the belly is snowy white. It has previously ranged from Yangtze River Basin all the way east to the coast, going as far south as the border with Vietnam. Today its small population of 300 is widely scattered along its former range, in remote mountains isolated by heavily populated lowlands. About 30 exists in the Tianmu Mountains in northern Zhejiang, 70 to 100 in southern Anhui, and 150 in northern Jiangxi. The population size in southern Guangxi is unknown, and a tiny population might exist in northern Guangdong as well. The population continues to decline due to poaching, and inbreeding is a matter of concern for the quality of its future population.

Touro (Portuguese for "bull"; Monument to the Peoples of Póvoa de Varzim; Portuguese: "Monumento às Gentes da Póvoa de Varzim") is a bronze sculpture in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. The monument is located in an intersection, a square also known as Touro, at the junction of Vasco da Gama Avenue and Repatriamento dos Poveiros Avenue.
The monument was built in 1995 by the sculptor Rui Anahory, who gained some fame due to this monument. The monument was built by the Rotary Clube of Póvoa de Varzim with the support of City Hall. 
Its popular name derives from the full-sized realistic and stylized sculpture of a bull, one of the elements of the monument, which lead some to relate the monument with bullfighting or the nearby bullring, hence the popular name of the monument and the square. The monument actually represents the peoples of Póvoa de Varzim, their unity and their differences: The sail and the fisherman representing the coastal people, the farmer and the bull, representing the inland people.

The Twelve Houses series

The Twelve Houses series is a fantasy novel series by Sharon Shinn. These books are notable for their marriage of two distinct genres: Sword and Sorcery and Romance. They take place in the mythical kingdom of Gillengaria which is ruled by good king Baryn. 
The land of Gillengaria is an island divided into twelve semi-independent fiefdoms each ruled by a great house. King Baryn has only one child, believed by many to be unfit to rule. The Twelve Great Houses are jockeying for position to be ready to contend for the throne when King Baryn dies. This jockeying is tearing the kingdom apart, and has brought it to the brink of civil war. 
In addition the general population is angry at the king for defending the mystics which they fear and despise. The mystics are people born to magical powers, usually of a quite limited scope such as being able to change shape, or being able to start fires. Any family of any rank can produce a mystic. Usually if the family is prominent the child is cast out.
In addition to the Mystics, and the Twelve Great Houses, there is a third power group, the King's Riders. The King's Riders are a band of fifty bodyguards who are fanatically loyal to the king. They are depicted as being extraordinary fighters, skilled with all weapons.
It currently consists of these books.
The first four books complete a story arc. The fifth book starts a new story arc.
Plots.
Mystic and Rider.
King Baryn sends Senneth on a mission to discover the mindset of the twelve marlords of Gillengaria about a potential revolution – and towards mystics. The king orders two of his best Riders to escort her - Tayse and Justin. Serramarra Kirra and her companion Donnal volunteer to accompany them. Along their journey they find Cammon and bring him with them.
The group discovers the southern marlords are more supportive of the idea of rebellion while the northern marlords stand with the king. Meanwhile, Senneth and Tayse fall in love. But first Senneth must convince Tayse he is not unworthy of her.
The Thirteenth House.
The king requests Senneth accompany his daughter on her first tour of Gillengaria. Everyone from their previous group – Tayse, Justin, Kirra, Donnal, and Cammon – comes with them. Kirra, however, is disguised as her sister, Casserah.
Dark Moon Defender.
Justin is sent to spy on Coralinda Gisseltess and her convent of Pale Mother worshippers. He meets and befriends Ellynor, a young Lirren girl sent to the convent to watch over her flighty cousin Rosurie. Justin later figures out that she is a mystic, and helps her escape from the convent.
Ellynor and Justin fall in love, but since Justin is outside the sebahta-ris, or clan network, of the Lirrens, their love would result in a fight to the death between Justin and a male relative of Ellynor’s. Senneth discovers that the two can be married if Ellynor declares her self bahta-lo – free of the clan.
Reader and Raelynx.
The king decides to attempt to divert the coming civil war by marrying his daughter off to one of the southern marlords. Cammon is assigned to read the intentions of Princess Amalie’s suitors. Unfortunately, he and the princess soon fall in love themselves.
The civil war, led by Coralinda Gisseltess, who has been trying to stamp out mystics and their magical practices, her brother, the lord of Gisseltess, and the lord of Fortunalt, ends with the death of King Baryn, and the deaths of the three leaders of the rebellion. Some Riders die in defense of King Baryn. Some of those who don't die resign from the Riders, because they feel that they failed in their principal duty.
Fortune and Fate.
This book starts a new story arc, with new characters.
This book introduces Wen, who is a former King's Rider. She failed to protect King Baryn during a rebellion for which she feels crushing shame. She is also suffering because of the marriage of Justin, a man she loved, to another.
Wen wanders over the country, looking for wrongs to right, but does not stay anywhere for very long. Eventually, she saves Karryn, the daughter of a rebel, from kidnapping and ravishment. Jasper Paladar, the uncle and guardian of Karryn, asks Wen to train a corps of bodyguards. She reluctantly agrees, and over time recovers from her heartbreak to fall in love with Jasper.
The action is divided between Wen's work to create a competent guard for Karryn, the heiress of Fortunalt, and a tour of the country by Cammon, the Queen's consort, with Tayse and other riders and guards, plus Senneth, Tayse's wife. Near the end of the book, when Cammon's tour has come to Fortunalt, and a plot to kill Karryn has been foiled, Tayse and Senneth come to believe that the main reason for making the tour was actually so Cammon and the Riders with him could help Wen come to terms with the fact that the King's death was not her fault, and to show her that she has much to offer and can find a permanent place of service and love.
Characters.
Senneth Brassenthwaite.
Senneth is a powerful mystic who specializes in the use of fire. She draws her power from the Bright Mother, or sun goddess. She is a former serramarra of the House of Brassenthwaite, but was expelled by her father at the age of seventeen after he killed her newborn illegitimate son in a fit of rage. After leaving her home, she wandered Gillengaria and eventually crossed into the Lirrens. She was adopted by one of the sebahta and had to declare herself bahta-lo to prevent herself from being married off by her well-intentioned adopted family. She went to Danalustrous to act as tutor to Kirra and Donnal for a few years, and began to serve the king. She later went back to Brassenthwaite to reconcile with her brothers. She is married to Tayse.
Tayse.
Tayse is a King’s Rider, one of the elite 50 soldiers selected to work for the king himself. His father and grandfather were Riders before him, and he never doubted his desired career. He is very quiet and solemn most of the time, and is an excellent warrior. He fell in love with Senneth despite their differences in rank and privilege, and they eventually marry.
Kirra Danalustrous.
Kirra is a stunningly beautiful serramarra who possesses the ability to shape-shift and heal. When she was young she learned about a young mystic like herself living in a village within Danalustrous and summoned him to live with her in Danan Hall. This mystic is Donnal, and from then on he becomes unwaveringly loyal to her. Kirra is very close to her father and younger sister, Casserah, but is constantly restless in contrast to their homebodyness. She tours Gillangaria disguised as Casserra and begins an affair with the regent Romar. She later leaves Romar and takes away his knowledge of their love for each other. After she leaves Romar forever, she realizes she loves Donnal.
Donnal.
Donnal is Kirra’s companion and protector. He loves her and is completely loyal to her. He also possesses the ability to shape shift.
Justin.
Justin is the son of a prostitute who died when he was ten. He spent his youth learning to fight and steal, when one day he tried to rob Tayse. Instead of killing him, the older man took Justin back to the palace and trained him as a King’s Rider. As a result, Justin is unswervingly loyal to Tayse and the king. He first meets Ellynor when she is molested on the streets by a low-ranking nobleman and he saves her. They begin to meet in secret and soon fall in love. He is attacked on the way home from visiting her and she saves his life with her healing powers.
Cammon.
Cammon has the ability to sense the emotions and intentions of others. He is also able to enhance the powers of other mystics and can communicate with people over long distances. He also has the ability to heal people's emotional truama. (This is discovered in Reader and Raelynx after King Baryn dies) He has lived outside Gillengaria with his parents who traveled between several countries. His family never lived in one place for long (The longest stay anywhere was only several months). He cites the fact that his parents did not pay much attention to him growing up and the constant moving to his loneliness. His father died when he was nineteen. After his father dieds, his mother arranged travel back to Gillengaria on a ship. To pay for the trip she arranged to work in the kitchens. She died on the trip back. As he had no money and his mother had died, the Ships Captain indentured him to a tavernkeeper. The tavernkeeper recognized him as a mystic and being a follower of the Pale Mother he put a slave collar and moonstone on him. This restricted his powers and burned him. He stayed there until he was rescued by Senneth’s group. Eventually, Princess Amalie and Cammon fall in love. Their friends invent a fictitious ancestry for Cammon, which allows them to marry.
Ellynor.
Ellynor is a native Lirren girl who comes to the Lumanen Convent to watch over her flighty cousin, Rosurie. She discovers she is a mystic and flees with Justin. She decides to declare herself bahta-lo so she can marry Justin. She returns to Gillengaria and is instrumental in winning the war.
Princess Amalie.
Princess Amalie is the daughter of King Baryn and his late wife. She shows an astonishing amount of calm and lack of fear. She is rather naïve, having lived in the palace her whole life. She is a mystic.
Relevance of the title.
The twelve houses referenced in the title are the twelve great noble houses of Gillengaria.

Russo-European Laika

Russo-European Laika (Russko-Evropeïskaïa Laïka) is the name of a breed of hunting dog that originated in the forested region of northern Europe and Russia, one of several breeds developed from landrace Laika dogs of very ancient Spitz type. The "Russo-European Laika" itself dates to a breeding program begun in 1944 by E. I. Shereshevsky of the All-Union Research Institute for the Hunting Industry, in Kalinin (now Tver) Province.
Breed recognition.
The "Russo-European Laika" is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in the S"pitz and Primitive types/Section 2: Nordic Hunting Dogs" Group. The breed is listed as breed number 304, along with two other Russian dogs, breed number 305, the Vostotchno-Sibirskaïa Laïka (East Siberian Laïka) and breed number 306, the Zapadno-Sibirskaïa Laïka (West Siberian Laïka).
Breed standard.
The "Russo-European Laika" is described as being of medium size, males being about at the withers and females about . The breed has prick ears and a sickle tail carried over the back. Temperament should be non aggressive. Colour can be any of the normal Spitz-type colours, but red and ticking on the legs is undesirable.
Temperament.
This is a lively breed that enjoys time spent in the great outdoors. As a hunter who frequently trees game, the Russo-European Laika uses its voice to alert the hunter to the treed prey (typically a raccoon or squirrel). It may use its voice freely in the house as well because it is easily excited about things going on around it. The Russo-European Laika has a strong love of family. Once bonded to them, it is quite territorial and makes an excellent guard dog. It is extremely tolerant of children, although not of strangers or other unfamiliar dogs.
Eager to please and with energy to spare, the Russo-European Laika benefits tremendously from training of any kind. Socialization must begin in puppyhood and continue throughout its life. Obedience classes or participation in a working association will give it a sense of purpose and the frequent exercise it requires. With those opportunities, it will learn quickly and become well balanced as a family dog.
Exercise.
An energetic and keen dog, the Russo-European Laika needs plenty of exercise; opportunities to run free and hunt are best. Without enough to do, it suffers from boredom and can become destructive.

Aalborghus

Aalborghus Castle () is a castle in Aalborg, Denmark. It is a half-timbered (bindingsværk) castle built by King Christian III from 1539 to around 1555 initially as a fortification. Soon it became the seat of the king's provincial governors in Northern Jutland, and after the introduction of absolutism, became used by the State County of Northern Jutland for taxes. 
A building had pre-existed at the site before Christian III's castle. It stood south of the castle and is mentioned in the first documentation of Aalborghus, dating back to 1340. It was owned by Margrethe I and was the death place of King Hans in 1513 who died in a horse riding accident.
Frederick I had originally intended to destroy the initial building around 1530 and moving to a different site to convert Aalborg's Franciscan monastery into a castle. However he left the decision to his son Christian III, who later decided to demolish the original in 1539 and contracted the royal architect Morten Bussert to build a new fortified castle north of the old site, near the Liim Fjord. A barrier wall was built alongside the fjord, and later in 1633, Christian IV built a north wing facing the port, which was used as a granary for the storage of food supplies such as corn. A western wing was built to the same effect later, holding other supplies such as meats and fish.
The southern facing wing was created between 1808 and 1809 but all that remains today of the original castle is the east wing. 
Between 1954 and 1964 the old granaries underwent full renovation by the Royal Inspector of Listed Buildings, Leopold Teschl, who converted them into council offices.

Dread Beat an' Blood

"Dread Beat an' Blood" is an album by Poet And The Roots released in 1978 on the Frontline label. It was produced by Vivian Weathers and Linton Kwesi Johnson. The "Poet" is dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson and "The Roots" are Dennis Bovell, Jah Bunny, Desmond Craig, Winston Curniffe, Everald Forrest, Floyd Lawson, John Varnom, Lila Weathers and Vivian Weathers. Most of the tracks first appeared in Johnson's 1975 book of poetry "Dread Beat an' Blood".
This album was the result of collaboration between Johnson, who had been active as a journalist and reggae critic as well as a poet, and Bovell a dub master and record producer. The combination of Bovell's heavy dub rhythms and Johnson's monotone intonation of his poetry created a whole new genre of reggae: dub poetry.
In subsequent re-releases of the album the artist is sometimes given as Linton Kwesi Johnson.
Johnson was the first person to accurately describe the situation of the black British youth in the inner cities in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This theme runs through most of the songs on this and his other albums but it particularly evident in the last vocal song on the album 'All Wi Doin' Is Defendin' which it is remarkably prescient as it foresees the Brixton riot (1981) in some detail and justifies it before it had even happened. All media commentators and politicians were shocked by this event. Not Linton Kwesi Johnson. Lyrics include "Send in the riot squad quick because we're running wild" "All we need are bottles and bricks and sticks" and these were indeed the principal weapons used by the 1981 rioters. "All Wi Doin' is Defendin' so get ready for war!" for Johnson was correct in seeing the forthcoming riot as an essentially defensive act by the black youth of Brixton after years of victimisation by the police.
The album was listed in the 1999 book "The Rough Guide: Reggae: 100 Essential CDs".

Trinity Episcopal Church (Detroit, Michigan)

Trinity Episcopal Church is located at 1519 Martin Luther King Boulevard in the Woodbridge Historic District of Detroit, Michigan. The church was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now known as Spirit of Hope.
History.
The Epiphany Reformed Episcopal parish was founded in 1878 as a place where Anglicans not pledged to the Episcopal bishop of Michigan might worship. In 1880, the congregation built a small frame church, and in 1889 changed their name to Trinity Episcopal.
James E. Scripps, owner of The Detroit News, was a member of the Trinity congregation. Scripps was born in London, and developed a fascination with historic English churches. He commissioned sketches of churches in England, and in 1893 put up $55,000 to build the current church building.
In 1896, Trinity members voted to unite their church with the Episcopal diocese of Michigan. In 1926, the parish house, which includes a chapel, dining room, gymnasium, offices and classrooms was constructed. As the neighborhood around Trinity changed, the church reached out to new constituents, including the Irish community. However, the declining population of the surrounding area led to a decline in the congregation.
In 2001, the nearby Jeffries Housing Projects were torn down; the Faith Memorial Lutheran Church, founded in 1956 to serve the community, found itself with a drastically reduced congregation. The congregations of Faith Memorial Lutheran and Trinity Episcopal began exploring the concept of merging, and in April 2006, the two joined to become the Spirit of Hope.
In 2007, Kathleen Brennan began the Spirit of Hope Urban Farm which was featured in the September/October 2011 "Natural Home & Garden" magazine.
Architecture.
James E. Scripps commissioned architects Mason & Rice to design this English Gothic style church. The floorplan of Trinity Episcopal Church is laid out in a cruciform pattern. The walls are two feet thick Trenton limestone, and the root is sheathed with copper. Smooth brown limestone used as trim offsets the white limestone used for the bulk of the walls. The central, supported by stone arches and buttresses, tower contains ten bells. The exterior holds over two hundred carvings, including gargoyles that serve as water drains. Inside the sanctuary, ten stone angels supporting the nave beams face inward; several windows contain stained glass, including a Tiffany, a LaFarge, and a window over the altar was created by Franz Mayer & Co. of Germany. A 1200-pipe organ manufactured by the Jardine Company of New York City is also inside.

Mecklenburg T 3

The Mecklenburg T 3 was a German, goods train, tank locomotive built for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway ("Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn") from 1884. Originally designated as the Class XVII it had an 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and was based on the Prussian T 3. 
These engines wree later taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 89.80 and incorporated into their renumbering plan.
A total of 68 examples of this locomotive were produced by various manufacturers between 1884 and 1906. Of these, 51 (the so-called T3a) corresponded to the older version of the Prussian T 3 with a regulator on top. The other 17 (the T3b) conformed to the more powerful version with a steam dome. Two of the latter locomotives were given a Walschaerts valve gear instead of the usual Allan valve gear. They were employed primarily on branch line and shunting duties. The last locomotive was retired by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany in 1963.

Resign-to-run laws

Resign-to-run laws are laws in several jurisdictions in democracies where a current office-holder cannot run for another office.
Examples.
United States.
Arizona.
Section 38-296 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, entitled "Limitation upon filing for election by incumbent of elective office" states: 
There is no definition of what constitutes a "formal public declaration," thereby creating an ambiguity that is currently a matter of controversy in Arizona.
Florida.
Section 99.012 of the Florida Statutes states: "No officer may qualify as a candidate for another public office, whether state, district, county or municipal, if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other, without resigning from the office he or she presently holds."
Georgia.
Article II, Section 2, Paragraph V of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia reads: "The office of any state, county, or municipal elected official shall be declared vacant upon such elected official qualifying, in a general primary or general election, or special primary or special election, for another state, county, or municipal elective office or qualifying for the House of Representatives or the Senate of the United States if the term of the office for which such official is qualifying for begins more than 30 days prior to the expiration of such official's present term of office."
Hawaii.
In 1978, Article II, Section 7 was added to the Constitution of Hawaii to include resign-to-run: "Any elected public officer shall resign from that office before being eligible as a candidate for another public office, if the term of the office sought begins before the end of the term of the office held."
Texas.

Outpost Centers International

Outpost Centers International (abbreviated OCI) is a non-profit umbrella organization for lay ministries supporting the Seventh-day Adventist Church. OCI's headquarters are located in Apison, Tennessee, USA, and it has member ministries on the six continents.
As a Christian organization designed to spread the Gospel, OCI's aim is to work in harmony with the Bible, the writings of Ellen G. White, and the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. OCI members work with local church leadership, seeking areas to strengthen the church and complement its mission.
History.
The roots of OCI can be traced back to the early 1900s when, with Ellen G. White's influence and support, E.A. Sutherland and P.T. Magan established the Madison School. Then known as self-supporting work, many new institutions sprang up around the world.
By 1982, Warren Wilson - then president of Wildwood Sanitarium and Hospital - realized these independent institutions would benefit by joining together. He envisioned an organization to facilitate the growth of self-supporting work, train and strengthen leaders, give encouragement, and form a network. Thus OCI was established.
OCI's name and calling are derived from a quote by Ellen G. White:
Headquarters.
The name "OCI" can refer to the headquarters office or the more than 80 ministries that are members of the organization. The purpose of the office is to link the members together in such a way that each ministry can benefit from both the leaders of OCI and the other member ministries.
The headquarters office also promotes the ministries, organizes annual leadership seminars for its members, and channels funds to the ministries. In addition, the office organizes the Educational Assistance Program for young people, and the Missionary Assistance Program for missionaries who are serving outside their home country.
Member Organizations.
OCI's members are located in various countries around the world. Member ministries pay dues and are required to meet a set of criteria and comply with OCI's standards. The ministries are varied, but each one focuses on spreading the Gospel where they are.
The ministries are grouped into five categories: Education, Evangelism, Health Food, Health Services, and Media. Most of the ministries fall into two or more of these categories, and many of them include an agricultural aspect, as well.

Bowen was first selected for Wales on 26 February 1887 in a Championship game against Scotland at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Wales, under the captaincy of Bob Gould, were decimated by a free running Scotland who scored 12 tries against Wales without reply. Despite this terrible result, Bowen was selected again two weeks later to face Ireland, this time led out by Tom Clapp. On this occasion Wales won even though their Irish opposition scored more tries. Bowen played against both Ireland and Scotland again the following season. His final game was at Landsdowne Road in a match that saw eight Welsh internationals play their last game for Wales.

International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend

The International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend (ILLW) is an annual event held on the third full weekend of August each year. The event was started by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple who were members of the Ayr Amateur Radio Group in Scotland. The event has developed into an international gathering of amateur radio operators from an estimated 54 countries.
Objective.
The objective of ILLW event is stated as "to promote public awareness of lighthouses and lightships and their need for preservation and restoration, to promote amateur radio and to foster International goodwill."
A classic example of what should not be allowed to happen to a lighthouse is shown here on YouTube featuring the lighthouse remains on Culebrita Island in Puerto Rico
Format.
The basic format of the event is that a local amateur radio club will set up a radio station either in, or near to, a lighthouse. They will then operate from that station over the whole or part of the weekend. The goal is to contact other amateur stations, particularly those operating from other lighthouse sites. Visiting public are invited to watch the operators and even use the equipment under supervision while visiting the lighthouse. YouTube has numerous video clips about the weekend which have been submitted by participants.

Nyzette Cheveron

Nyzette Cheveron (died 21 April 1605) was an alleged Belgian witch. She is one of the victims of the witch hunt which took place in the Ardennes in Belgium, then the Spanish Netherlands, particularly around the area of Chevron, around the years of 1604–1605, which is perhaps the most known witch hunt in Belgian history.
Nyzette Cheveron was arrested for witchcraft and interrogated violently; her confession was a very detailed description of a witch's sabbath. Her confession also led to the continuation of witch hunts in the area.
She confessed to have been a witch for thirteen years. She had a personal devil called Verdulet, who had come to her bed, gave her marks with his claws, had a body as cold as ice and had taken her to a great dance with other women and their devils. She gave the names of those women, which had been previously executed as witches. Whenever she disobeyed her devil, he had beaten her. She confessed to have cast black poison on the house of a priest and to have killed a cow with Emma Casis and Mme Sicquet. On the sabbath, she had danced, eaten and drank excessively; the women had played violins and rang bells. Her devil had made an enough poison to kill many people. She pointed out several other women, among them Anne Nouville.
After making her confession, she declared she was willing to die for this. She was judged guilty and sentenced to death. She was strangled and burned on the 21st of March 1605. Her confession led to the arrest of Anne Nouville, who also confessed to have met and had sexual relations with a devil called Macquet and attended a sabbath with other women. She in turn, also pointed out several women and was executed. The witch hunt in the Ardennes also spread to Habiemont, where Mariette Estante was killed, Les Forges, where Anne des Forges was tortured to confess, and Izier, where Maroie Bertrand (whose relative had been burned alive in 1586) was strangled and burnt in January 1606. In Chevron, several men and women were pointed out by Anne Stolano Chevron to have danced with devils at a sabbath and were sentenced to strangulation and fire, but she managed to escape.

Trace of Stones

Trace of Stones () is a 1966 East German film by Frank Beyer. It was based on the eponymous novel by Erik Neutsch and starred Manfred Krug in the main role. After its release, the film was shown only for several days, and then was shelved due to conflicts with the Socialist Unity Party, the ruling communist party in the German Democratic Republic. Only after 23 years was the film shown again, in November 1989.
Plot synopsis.
The film revolves around three characters. Hannes Balla is a talented, yet vulgar construction foreman. He leads a crew of about 20, all of which dress and act in a similarly delinquent fashion, to head a state-funded construction project. The Party sends secretary Werner Horrath to keep on eye on the construction site and get Balla to calm down. Entering the situation is Kati Klee, an ambitious technician who has come to the construction project against the advice of her superiors. What forms is a love triangle set against the personal politics of "The Party" as well as the work the three are supposed to be doing in benefit of the state. While the romance is the main focus of the film, socialist politics, particularly those working against corruption, lie prominently in the background. The party struggles to clean its ranks of the "morally defective" in order to get their projects done. In the end, the love triangle collapses while the lives of all three are worse because of it, ending with no one getting what they want. Not only that, but the work they were supposed to be doing suffered as a result. The film portrays going against the tenets of socialism as having a negative effect on their lives. By the end, they all realize this. Particularly Balla, who has matured greatly since the beginning of the film. He has become a much more disciplined socialist citizen. Overall, the portrayal of the party is a neutral one. They seem to be a nuisance, but in the end their existence is seen as justified. Balla is at first very critical of the party, but by the end has come to accept their role. While the film doesn't celebrate the party's role, it does not condemn it either. More importantly, the system of socialism is ultimately seen as a beneficial one.
Production.
The film version of "Trace of Stones" was based on the novel of the same name by writer Erik Neutsch. The novel was celebrated by the Socialist Unity Party (SED) of East Germany, and production of the film was expected to be free of the normal interference normally subjected to DEFA by the SED. Since the novel was 900 pages, some major alterations would need to be made to the story in order to make a film of reasonable length.
Initial screenings of the working print were attacked by high-ranking officials of the SED, much to the surprise of director Frank Beyer.  They took issue with the portrayal of "The Party" in the film.  While socialism is celebrated by the film, the party's role in it was viewed as neutral. The SED wanted their portrayal in the film to be one of a proactive agent of socialism. The SED, in an effort to create the illusion of studio autonomy, gave the film over to DEFA's internal approval process. It was approved, and the SED reluctantly allowed for distribution of the film.
11th Plenum and its aftermath.
Many films were banned by the SED as they were seen as anti-socialist. This changed however in 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell.

Russell Errett Dickenson (April 12, 1923 – February 19, 2008) began his NPS career as a ranger at Grand Canyon National Park in 1946 and served in a wide range of park and central office assignments — most prominently as head of National Capital Parks, deputy director, and Pacific Northwest regional director — before ascending to the directorship in May 1980. Having risen through the traditional ranks and enjoying the respect of his colleagues, Dickenson was enthusiastically welcomed to the job and supported in his effort to restore organizational stability after a succession of short-term directors. As when Walker's deputy, he preferred improving the service's stewardship of its existing parks to seeking new ones. The only Interior Department bureau chief to be retained by the Reagan administration in 1981, Dickenson obtained its support and that of Congress for the Park Restoration and Improvement Program, which devoted more than a billion dollars over five years to park resources and facilities. Dickenson retired in March 1985.
Dickenson was born in 1922. A Marine Corps veteran and graduate of Arizona State College, Dickenson worked his way up through the NPS ranks. A native of Melissa, Texas, he began his career in 1947 as a park ranger at Grand Canyon National Park and held field assignments in several other western parks. He also served as chief, Division of Resource Management in the Midwest Regional and in 1967, transferred to WASO as Chief of New Area Studies and Master Planning. He was Regional Director of the National Capital Regional from 1969 to 1973 and served as Deputy NPS Director from 1973 to 1975. Before becoming Director in 1980, Dickenson served as Pacific Northwest Regional Director for 4 ½ years. Dickenson has received numerous awards, including the Distinguished Service Award in 1972, for his work in urban park management.

Early career.
From 1946 to 1985 he served successively as Oakland's park superintendent, the East Bay Regional Park District's general manager, director of the California Department of Parks and Recreation under Governor Ronald Reagan, and general manager of the East Bay Zoological Society.

Following his appointment as the 12th NPS director in May 1985, Mott issued a "Twelve Point Plan" to protect the parks and their resources, better serve the public, and improve the service's management. He took a strong interest in park interpretation and returned the NPS to a more expansionist posture after a near-moratorium on park additions during President Reagan's first term. When the Bush administration replaced him with its own appointee in April 1989, Mott remained on the rolls as special assistant to the western regional director overseeing planning for the Presidio of San Francisco.

Hexaphenylbenzene

Hexaphenylbenzene is an aromatic compound composed of a benzene ring substituted with six phenyl rings.
It may be prepared through a Diels-Alder reaction by refluxing tetraphenylcyclopentadienone and diphenylacetylene in benzophenone or other high-temperature solvent.
Structure.
Due to steric congestion among the phenyl rings, the stable conformation of this molecule has the phenyl rings rotated out of the plane of the central benzene ring. In the crystalline form shown on the left, the molecule forms a propeller-like conformation in which the phenyl rings are rotated about 65°, while in the gas phase, they are perpendicular with some slight oscillations.

DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives

In 1922 the Deutsche Reichsbahn began to develop a renumbering plan to standardize the numbering of steam locomotives that had been taken over from the state railways ("Länderbahnen"). Its basis was the corresponding DRG classification system.
The first renumbering plan in 1922 envisaged more class numbers than the later plans. The development of this scheme was discontinued because it was seen that there would be problems in practically adopting it.
The second, provisional, renumbering plan of 25 July 1923 was very like the final version of 1925 in its basic structure. It incorporated space for the new standard locomotives ("Einheitslokomotiven") that were planned. The third and final renumbering plan of 1925 differed from its predecessor primarily in that all the locomotives retired up to that point – in some cases entire classes – were deleted; in addition several mistakes in the numbering were corrected. 
With the exception of Bavarian classes, new locomotives built after 1923 were delivered from the outset with their new operating numbers. The actual renumbering of older engines did not begin until 1926.
Locomotives that were seen as obsolete and which would therefore soon be retired, were given serial numbers from 7001 after their class number.

Inn at 97 Winder (Detroit, Michigan)

History.
John Harvey was a successful pharmacist in Detroit, but he is best known for his philanthropy in educating and feeding the city's poor children and orphans, beginning in the period just after the American Civil War and continuing into the early twentieth century. Harvey established Detroit's Industrial School and later the Sabbath Mission School to educate indigent children.
John Harvey died in 1905, but his widow lived in the house into the 1920s. In the 20s, Jesse Hobbs, an automobile worker, purchased the home. In 1938, the structure was converted into a rooming house; some of the larger rooms were partitioned.
Architecture.
John Harvey employed John V. Smith to design this house with its Second Empire, Queen Anne architecture, located in what is now Detroit's Brush Park Historic District. Originally completed in 1887, the John Harvey House is constructed of red brick atop an ashlar foundation with a mansard roof. The façade features a center entrance and wooden brackets supporting the sills of the multi-storied towers and window bays. The house has , eight marble fireplaces, and three-story staircase.
Developers purchased the John Harvey House in 1986, renovated the structure, and, in 2005, opened it as the historic Inn at 97 Winder with 10-room guest rooms.

Presentation Convent Girls High School

Presentation Convent High School Rawalpindi, is a missionary school located in Lalkurti area of Rawalpindi Cantonment, Pakistan.
In 1895 Mother Ignatius McDermott, Sr. Xavier Lonergan and Sr. Evangelist Coatsworth arrived in Rawalpindi from Madras. The first Mass was celebrated on 8 September 1895 and the school was opened on 1 October- with ‘three Sisters, three pupils’. The school was for children of Christian parents, the sons and daughters of army personnel, British and Irish. [http://www.presentationsistersunion.org/whereweare/default.cfm?loadref=6] Since then, thousands have attended Presentation Convent, belonging to all religious denominations.
History.
Today in Pakistan there are branches of this school catering for the educational needs of a total of around thirteen thousand children in Urdu and English-medium schools. These schools, which are managed by Pakistani and Irish sisters, are under the administration of the original Rawalpindi school.
There are Presentation schools in Rawalpindi, Murree, Jhelum, Sargodha, (Khushab District), Wah, Peshawar, Risalpur, Mingora (Swat) and Sindh.
The Presentation Convent Schools of Pakistan had their origin and inspiration in the Ireland of the 18th Century where the first Presentation Convent was founded by Nano Nagle in 1775. Nagle attempted to redress the societal ills she perceived by opening schools to teach the children the rudiments of education, thereby becoming one of the pioneers of popular education in Ireland. To ensure the continuity of her work Nano founded the Congregation of Presentation Sisters.
On 1 October 1995, the school celebrated its centennial with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as chief guest. She unveiled a centenary plaque and planted an evergreen tree. The Pakistan Post Office honored the centenary with a stamp depicting the school.
A student of the school secured third position in a speech contest and children’s art competition organised at the National Art Gallery as part of the Japan-Pakistan Friendship Fest 2007 by the Japanese Embassy in Islamabad.
At a ceremony at the Pakistan National Council Auditorium in Islamabad, Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani on 16 December 2008 presented a check for Rs. 50,000 to Sr. Julie Watson, the Principal of the Presentation Convent to celebrate the Christmas season.
On 2 November 2009 the school was shaken when a bomb planted by terrorists exploded 100 metres from the school. The window panes of most of the buildings were broken.
began in October 1895 with three students when the brave and courageous Mother Ignatius Mc Dermott with her two companions, Sr. Xavier and Sr. Elizabeth arrived in the northern part of the sub continent having responded to the vision of our foundress, Nano Nagle. Nano Nagle had shared over 100 years previously that she would readily go to any part of the globe to bring the gift of education to children.

M–sigma relation

[[Image:msigma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Black hole mass plotted against velocity dispersion of stars in the galaxy bulge. Points are labelled by galaxy name;
all points in this diagram are for galaxies which exhibit a clear, Keplerian rise in velocity near the center, indicative of the presence of a central mass.
The Mformula_1 relation is shown in blue.]]
The M–sigma (or M–σ) relation is an empirical correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion σ of a galaxy bulge and the mass M of the supermassive black hole at 
the galaxy's center. 
The M–σ relation was first presented in 1999 during a conference at the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris in France. The proposed form of the relation, which was called the "Faber-Jackson law for black holes", was 
Publication of the relation in a refereed journal, by two groups, took place the following year.
One recent study, based on a complete sample of published black hole masses in nearby galaxies,
Earlier work had demonstrated a possible relationship between galaxy luminosity and black hole mass, but that relationship had a large scatter. The much smaller scatter of the M–σ relation is generally interpreted 
to imply some source of mechanical feedback between the growth of supermassive black holes and the growth of galaxy bulges, although the source of this feedback is still uncertain.
Discovery of the M–σ relation was taken by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as a critical component of galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.
Origin.
The tightness of the M–σ relation suggests that some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like galaxy mergers and gas accretion that might be expected to increase the scatter over time.
One such mechanism was suggested by Joseph Silk and Martin Rees in 1998. These authors proposed a model in which supermassive black holes first form via collapse of giant 
gas clouds before most of the bulge mass has turned into stars. The black holes created in this way would then accrete and radiate, driving a wind which acts back on the accretion flow.
The flow would stall if the rate of deposition of mechanical energy into the infalling gas was large enough to unbind the protogalaxy in one crossing time. The Silk and Rees model predicts 
a slope for the M–σ relation of α=5, which is approximately correct. However, the predicted normalization of the relation is too small by about a factor of one thousand. The reason is that there is far more energy released in the formation of a supermassive black hole than is needed to completely unbind the stellar bulge.
A more successful feedback model was first presented by Andrew King at the University of Leicester in 2003. In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer as in the case of Silk & Rees's model. A “momentum-driven flow” is one in which the gas cooling time is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of α=4 for the M–σ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor c/σ ≈ 103 times larger than in Silk & Rees's relation.
Importance.
Before the M–σ relation was discovered in 2000, a large discrepancy existed between black hole masses derived using three techniques.
"Direct," or dynamical, measurements based on the motion of stars or gas near the black hole seemed to give masses that averaged ~1% of the bulge mass (the "Magorrian relation"). Two other techniques—reverberation mapping in active galactic nuclei, and the Soltan argument, which computes the cosmological density in black holes needed to explain the quasar light—both gave a mean value of M/Mbulge that was a factor ~10 smaller than implied by the Magorrian relation. The M–σ relation resolved this discrepancy by showing that most of the direct black hole masses published prior to 2000 were significantly in error, presumably because the data on which they were based were of insufficient quality to resolve the black hole's dynamical sphere of influence. The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass is now believed to be approximately 1:1000.
A common use of the M–σ relation is to estimate black hole masses in distant galaxies using the easily measured quantity σ. Black hole masses in thousands of galaxies have been estimated in this way. The M–σ relation is also used to calibrate so-called secondary and tertiary mass estimators, which relate the black hole mass to the strength of emission lines from hot gas in the nucleus or to the velocity dispersion of gas in the bulge.
The tightness of the M–σ relation has led to suggestions that "every" bulge must contain a supermassive black hole. However, the number of galaxies in which the effect of the black hole's gravity on the motion of stars or gas is unambiguously seen is still quite small. It is unclear whether the lack of black hole detections in many galaxies implies that these galaxies do not contain black holes; or that their masses are significantly below the value implied by the M–σ relation; or that the data are simply too poor to reveal the presence of the black hole.
The smallest supermassive black hole with a well-determined mass has M≈106 solar masses. The existence of black holes in the mass range 104 - 106 solar masses ("intermediate-mass black holes") is predicted by the M–σ relation in low-mass galaxies, and the existence of intermediate mass black holes has been reasonably well established in a number of galaxies which contain active galactic nuclei, although the values of M in these galaxies are highly uncertain.
No clear evidence has been found for ultra-massive black holes with masses above 1010 solar masses, although this may be an expected consequence of the observed upper limit to σ.

In 8-dimensional geometry, the 142 is a uniform 8-polytope, constructed within the symmetry of the E8 group.
Coxeter named it 142 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 1-node sequences.
The rectified 121 is constructed by points at the mid-edges of the 142 and is the same as the birectified 241, and the quadrirectified 421.
These polytopes are part of a family of 255 (28 − 1) convex uniform polytopes in 8-dimensions, made of uniform polytope facets and vertex figures, defined by all permutations of rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .
1_42 polytope.
The 142 is composed of 2400 facets: 240 132 polytopes, and 2160 7-demicubes (141). Its vertex figure is a birectified 7-simplex.
This polytope, along with the demiocteract, can tessellate 8-dimensional space, represented by the symbol 152, and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .

The 17280 vertices can be defined as sign and location permutations of:
All sign combinations (32): (280×32=8960 vertices)
Half of the sign combinations (128): ((1+8+56)×128=8320 vertices)
The edge length is 2√2 in this coordinate set, and the polytope radius is 4√2.

Fonville Winans

Theodore Fonville Winans was a noted American photographer whose black-and-white images captured south Louisiana people and places. 
Fonville was born on August 22, 1911, in Mexico, Missouri, died September 13, 1992, in Louisiana, and spent part of his childhood in Fort Worth, Texas, where, as a senior, in high school he purchased his first camera, a Kodak 3A model. Armed with this camera, Fonville shortly won $15 in a photography contest, which stirred his interest in pursuing photography as a career.
Early Cajun Images.
In 1928, Fonville moved to Louisiana to work in construction, and it was during this time that he fell in love with the state. Fonville began photographing the state's southern swamps and grassy coastal wetlands, as well as the people who inhabited them, most notably the Cajuns. "Louisiana was my Africa, my South America," he recalled. 
Fonville's timing was fortuitous, for as Ben Forkner noted, "Thanks to an absence of roads and bridges, and to a largely inward-turned and jealous identity, the Cajun settlements and outposts that Fonville found were irregular islands of a predominantly French-speaking culture that continued to resist the tidal floods of 'progress' and the 20th century. . . . Fonville appeared with his boat and camera the more remote strongholds of Cajun society could still give the impression of a private country at home in the midst of millennial swamp forests and endless river prairies, and only half-open to the modern world."
Anne Price has observed that Fonville's photographs from this period were a "human, cheerful record of a people who were self-sufficient enough to make their own way with dignity despite the times, . . . Fishermen, hunters, moss gatherers and other wetlands residents are seen at work and at play. His landscapes and seascapes are haunting and enduring, and his always accurate eye captures
the essence of time and place."
Fonville himself recalled of these images, "I didn’t take any of these pictures deliberately. I just took them for fun. None was on assignment. I wasn’t even a freelancer. I just took my camera and got pictures when I saw something interesting."
Later career.
In 1934 he became a student at Louisiana State University, where he majored in journalism and performed in the school's brass choir. He often photographed on LSU campus and had images published in the "Reveille" student newspaper and in the school's yearbook, "Gumbo".
Around 1940 Fonville opened his own photography studio in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. "I had a side porch I covered with tar paper," he recalled, "and made into a darkroom. I used my bathroom for plumbing fixtures. I used the dining room to make portraits. I photographed several important people, and word got around pretty fast." 
Fonville's wife did classic make-up for the subjects. Fonville photographed LSU student Joanne Woodward. He advised female subjects to wear a white, high necked, top, which he found more flattering. Fonville typically offered his subjects a drink to help them relax. 
Eventually he established a solid reputation as a wedding and studio portrait photographer, capturing images of local beauties and state politicians. Yet Fonville became best known for his images of south Louisiana's rugged outdoors, as well as its fishermen and swamp dwellers.
Fonville rode a bicycle and, in later years, he hosted challenging Sunday brunch/bicycle tours of Baton Rouge.
A portion of Fonville's work is stored in Hill Memorial Library, located on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.
In 1995, LSU Press issued "Fonville Winans' Louisiana: Politics, People, and Places", a collection of over one hundred images by Fonville with a foreword by Louisiana politico James Carville and an afterword by noted contemporary Louisiana photographer C.C. Lockwood.
In 1999, Fonville's studio joined the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="19091381" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19091381" title="Shim Gum Do">
Shim Gum Do

Shim Gum Do, translated as the ""mind sword path"", is a martial arts system of recent invention, originating in Korea. Shim Gum Do emerged from the enlightenment of the monk Won Gwang, born as Chang Sik Kim, during a 100 day meditation and prayer retreat at Hwagyesa temple in Seoul, South Korea in 1965. In 1971, Kim Changsik established the Korean Shim Gum Do Association and began teaching Shim Gumdo in South Korea. He moved to the United States in 1974, and, in 1978 he established American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association. The main temple, Shim Gwang Sa, was built in Boston, Massachusetts, and there the World Shim Gum Do Association was established as the center of Shim Gum Do Associations around the world. The central component of the system is a series of 330 forms (choreographed sequences of techniques) using the sword. The system also includes forms using two swords, a long staff, a short staff, and empty hands, as well as a series of 3000 self-defense techniques called Ho Shin Sul. 
Spread.
Chang Sik Kim, the founding master of Shim Gum Do, began teaching in Korea in 1971 and brought his martial art to the United States in 1974. Shim Gum Do schools have since been opened in Italy, Japan, and Poland. The current headquarters of the World Shim Gum Do Association as well as the American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association is Shim Gwang Sa temple located in Brighton, Massachusetts.
Training.
From the time of Kim’s enlightenment, training in Shim Gum Do sword techniques has focused on the use of a wooden practice sword, commonly called a ‘mokgum’ in Korean. After achieving the rank of black belt, Shim Gum Do sword students may use a Korean style steel sword, which has a single-edged blade and is closely related to the Chinese Tang dynasty single-edge swords or the Japanese katana. 
Shim Gum Do sword training is broken down into a progression of several series of forms. New students learn a series of basic forms and then move onto beginning defense forms before attaining their yellow belt. After learning 15 of these forms a student may test for a first dan (degree or ‘star’) black belt. Progression may continue through the beginning attack series and on through 14 different series of sword forms. In addition to sword forms, students may learn up to 330 empty-handed forms called Shin Boep (‘body dharma’). Advanced students may study Ssang Gum Boep (‘two-sword dharma’), Dan Bong Sul (‘short staff art’), or Jang Bong Sul (‘long staff art’), consisting of 50 forms each.
Philosophy.
Although the physical techniques of Shim Gum Do are intended by Chang Sik Kim to be effective fighting techniques, Chang Sik Kim teaches that the foundation of a clear mind and harmony between mind and body’s action is the most important thing a person can learn for defense. He argues that this ideal makes Shim Gum Do a non-violent martial art. In fact, spiritual aspects are highly emphasized in this martial art. It is typically practiced in spaces set up as Buddhist sanctuaries, and students have frequent opportunities for sitting in meditation and receiving dharma instruction.

2 41 polytope

In 8-dimensional geometry, the 241 is a uniform 8-polytope, constructed within the symmetry of the E8 group.
Coxeter named it 241 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 2-node sequences.
The rectified 241 is constructed by points at the mid-edges of the 241. The birectified 241 is constructed by points at the triangle face centers of the 241, and is the same as the rectified 142.
These polytopes are part of a family of 255 (28 − 1) convex uniform polytopes in 8-dimensions, made of uniform polytope facets and vertex figures, defined by all permutations of rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .

John Murray (boxer)

John Murray (born 20 December 1984, Manchester, England) is an English lightweight boxer. He is a former Scottish and Irish lightweight champion. He is trained by Joe Gallagher at the Denton Gym in Manchester and is the brother of former British Olympian Joe Murray.
Professional career.
Murray's first professional fight took place in September 2003 with a 4 round points win over journeyman Peter Buckley. Over the next two years Murray was busy in the ring scoring 15 more wins in 15 fights before in December 2005 defeating Ignacio Mendoza for the WBC World Youth lightweight title. He made one defence of his title against Moebi Sarouna and scored decent wins over Ben Odamattey and Lorenzo Bethea before defeating Dean Hickman at the Ice Arena in Nottingham for the English title. In October 2006 he was awarded the prestigious young boxer of the year award at a ceremony held in London, an award previously held by the likes of Ricky Hatton, Frank Bruno and Barry McGuigan.
British Champion.
Following the Hickman victory, Murray fought twice more against journeyman opponents before meeting Salford boxer Lee Meager for the vacant British lightweight title in July 2008. He won the belt after the referee stopped the fight in the 5th round. Following the fight Meager, a promotional stablemate, announced his retirement. The first defence of his title was made on 17 January 2009 at the Robin Park Centre in Wigan. Murray managed to keep hold of the belt after scoring an 8th round stoppage over Aberdeen's Lee McAllister.
Murray's second defence of the title on 13 June 2009 against Stoke fighter Scott Lawton ended before it had even begun when Murray weighed in for the contest 2oz overweight. Despite efforts to get down to the lightweight limit, Murray was unable to shift the weight and was stripped of the belt. The contest with Lawton still went ahead and resulted in a sixth round stoppage for Murray ensuring that he was still undefeated but no longer a champion. As punishment for failing to make the weight in a championship contest Murray, his trainer Joe Gallagher and his manager Mike Marsden were each fined £1500 by the British Boxing Board of Control.
Murray reclaimed the belt on 3 October 2009 after scoring a fourth round stoppage against former British and European champion Jonathon Thaxton at the Altrincham Leisure Centre. He had his fourth official British title fight on 7 May 2010 against Welsh boxer Gary Buckland this time in Widnes. The fight was also for the vacant European title and resulted in an 11th round stoppage win for Murray who was also able to keep his Lonsdale Belt for good. Murray having won the belt outright chose to vacate in order to defend his European crown with Gavin Rees winning the vacant title against John Watson on 6 November 2010.
European Champion.
Murray made the first defence of the European title on 25 September 2010 against the Ukrainian boxer Andriy Kudryavtsev at the Robin Park Arena in Wigan. Kudryavstev had previously fought for the title in 2009 losing to Anthony Mezaache in 12 rounds and had held a number of titles including the Ukrainian national title and the European External Union title. Murray wore down his opponent to score a 9th round stoppage after a high tempo contest. Speaking after the fight Murray said that he knew the fight would be tough after watching Kudryavstev on tape and said that now he wanted to fight the top guys in the lightweight division saying he'd love a ""world title shot before Christmas"". Murray's next fight however was to be on 2 April 2011, traveling to London's York Hall to defend against Spanish champion Karim El Ouazghari. Both fighters were warned and deducted a point during the fight which Murray eventually won on points over the 12 round distance. The fight against El Ouazghari was Murray's first since joining up with promoter Frank Warren and was described by some as a "scrappy" performance. Murray summed up by saying "It wasn't my best fight, it was like having my debut again. I have cleaned up at domestic and European level and I am looking at moving on". Warren himself said that he'd like to see a fight between Murray and Kevin Mitchell in the future saying "the fans would like to see, but the bottom line is that John is the champion and it's all about what he wants to do."
Kevin Mitchell fight.
Murray vacated the European belt in order to fight Kevin Mitchell who was not eligible to challenge for the title due to suffering a loss in his preceding fight with Michael Katsidis. Murray's trainer Joe Gallagher said that John should have been fighting for a world title but as the fight wasn't mandated then beating Mitchell would be a sure way of getting noticed. Mitchell himself had said that the fight represented a "last chance saloon" for him as the fight with Katsidis had resulted in a third round stoppage. Mitchell had cited "personal problems" as having marred his preparation for that fight. The two met at the Echo Arena in Liverpool on 16 July 2011 with Murray suffering a first career defeat via stoppage in the 8th round. Mitchell had hurt Murray in the 7th round and finally scored a knockdown in the 8th before the referee stepped in to call a halt to the fight in what was described as a "superb" contest.
World title shot.
On 7 October 2011 it was confirmed that despite a first career defeat in his previous fight Murray would take on Brandon Rios for the WBA Lightweight title on 3 December in New York City. Murray lost the fight by TKO in 11th round
However, Ríos was overweight and was subsequently stripped of his title and had to pay Team Murray $20000 from his purse. The vacant WBA Lightweight title is only able to be won by Murray.

Gabriel Wüthrich (born 28 August 1981 in Echallens) is a Swiss footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for AC Lugano in Switzerland. In May 2010 he signed a 2-year contract with Axpo Super League Club FC Luzern.
Career.
Wüthrich began his professional career at FC Biel-Bienne in 1999 before he moved to Neuchâtel Xamax in 2000. He battled for the Number 1 jersey for his first two seasons at Neuchâtel and eventually became the first-choice goalkeeper during the 2002/03 season. He left to join SR Delémont in 2003. However, the move did not seem to pay off as he was no-longer first-choice and was used in a rotation system, only playing once every few weeks. At the end of the season, he moved to FC St. Gallen in the Swiss Super League where he was back-up to Stefano Razzetti. FC Vaduz acquired his services in 2006 and he was the undisputed Number 1 during his first season but when Swiss Under-21 internationalist goalkeeper Yann Sommer joined the club on loan from FC Basel in 2007, his gloves were given up to the youngster. Sommer's loan was re-newed for another season in 2008, effectively ending Wüthrich's chances of making the first-team for another season. He left on 21 January 2009 FC Vaduz and joined on 28 January 2009 to FC Carl Zeiss Jena. After the season ended his contract, he left the club and signed later on 3 July 2009 with AC Lugano.

Dunya and Desi

Dunya and Desie () is a 2008 Dutch film directed by Dana Nechushtan. The film is based on the Dutch television series "Dunya en Desie" ("Dunya and Desie"), which aired in three series from 2002 to 2004, about the friendship between two Dutch teenage girls. The film was chosen as the Netherlands' official submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. It has received the Golden Film, a film award recognizing domestic box office achievements in the Netherlands.
Synopsis.
Dunya El-Benini and Desie Koppenol are teenagers and best friends, each nearly 18 years old. Dunya is of Moroccan ancestry, but was born in the Netherlands. She narrates the film, and begins by noting how Desie juggles multiple boyfriends. As a surprise birthday present for Dunya, Desie arranges for a driving lesson with a boyfriend, Pim. Dunya's parents generally object to Desie's behaviour. 
Desie works as a hairdresser and is also involved with her boss, Mike. However, in a moment of anger at Mike, she quits her job. When Desie misses her period, she gets a home pregnancy test, and it comes up positive. She thinks that Pim is the father. She learns from her mother, Monique Koppenol, that she was the result of an unplanned pregnancy when her mother was young. Her father abandoned them both soon after Desie was born, and moved to Morocco. Desie contemplates having an abortion and gets a referral, but at the last moment decides not to have an abortion.
On her 18th birthday, Dunya hears that she is to be married by arrangement to a cousin in Morocco. She and her family move to a new house in Morocco, which they find is uncompleted after they have arrived. Dunya sees her cousin to whom the marriage is to be arranged, and is not attracted to him at all. However, she sees a young man, Shamir, who is part of the house building crew, and finds him more attractive than her cousin.
Desie digs up a secret "treasure chest" of personal items of interest to both her and Dunya. In it is the address in Morocco of her father, Hans Schakel. Desie decides to go to Morocco to track down her father. She surprises Dunya and her family when she arrives unannounced at their house in Morocco. During her brief stay with Dunya's family, she scandalises the family by her behaviour and her dress. Tension develops between Dunya and Desie, and ultimately Dunya decides to accompany Desie on her search for her father, as she feels that Desie will not survive alone in Morocco. 
The two of them travel to Casablanca and into rural Morocco to search for Desie's father. They suffer the loss of Desie's luggage to two street con-men, and spend one evening in a Casablanca hospital after Desie shows signs of bleeding from the pregnancy. They learn that Desie's father did work in the city at the docks, but left that job years earlier and opened a gasoline station and restaurant away from urban areas. They continue to have fights and almost split up, but eventually reconcile and keep on the search for Hans Schakel. In the meantime, Desie's mother and her boyfriend Jeff are concerned over Desie's disappearance, and travel to Morocco in search of her.

Lansburgh's

Lansburgh's was a chain of department stores located in the Washington, D.C. area. The clientele were lower- to middle-income consumers.
History.
The first store, at 7th and E Streets, NW, in Washington, D.C. opened on October 30, 1860. The founders were James and Gustav Lansburgh. The company was known initially for supplying the black crepe used for the funeral of President Abraham Lincoln. Lansburgh's installed the first elevator (wooden) in a commercial building in the District of Columbia. The company remained family owned until its acquisition by City Stores, Inc. in 1951. At the time of its final liquidation in June 1973, the chain ranked eighth in the Washington D.C. retail market, with sales of $28.5 million.
Flagship store.
The initial Seventh Street flagship downtown store was located on and constructed in 1882, and was a work of architect Adolf Cluss. The store was greatly expanded in 1916, 1924 and 1941 out to Eight Street. During the 1970s and 1980s, the store building was used for offices and warehouse space. The former flagship store on 7th Street was at the forefront of the revitalized Penn Quarter section of downtown Washington, D.C.
Branch stores.
In 1955, Lansburgh's opened its first suburban branch at Langley Park, Maryland followed in 1959, with a $2.5 million, branch at Shirlington Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia. The chain was slow to open other suburban branches. The store at Tysons Corner International Shopping Center opened on October 19, 1969, after protracted battles regarding leases dating back to 1962. Because of that fight, the chain was slow to expand to other malls opening the Washington, D.C. suburbs. This was followed by the store at Rockville Mall on February 14, 1972, and a store at Springfield Mall (later Korvettes, then SpringFest Food Court/AMC) in March 1973.

CJRM-FM (defunct)

CJRM-FM was a French-language Canadian radio station located in Montreal, Quebec. It opened on September 30, 1965 and closed on June 24, 1968 due to financial difficulties.
The station broadcast on 98.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts using an omnidirectional antenna (class C1). It had a classical music format.
Licensed as one of the first standalone FM stations in Canada, the station's budget was so tight that it had only four employees (which was unusual at the time for a radio station), and it relied entirely on newspapers as a source for news bulletins. The station was plagued with serious technical and financial difficulties; listeners received the station with indifference. 
One consequence of the failure of CJRM-FM to succeed with its classical music format was that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected for decades new applications to open a private classical music station in Montreal. When the CRTC finally gave Jean-Pierre Coallier permission to open CJPX-FM in 1997, that station would turn out to be a success.
The 98.5 MHz frequency was reactivated in the Montreal area on April 9, 1977, when CIEL-FM (now CHMP-FM) went on the air.

National mysticism

National mysticism (German "Nationalmystik") is a form of nationalism which raises the nation to the status of numen or divinity. Its best known instance is Germanic mysticism, which gave rise to occultism under the "Third Reich". The idea of the nation as a divine entity was presented by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. National mysticism is closely related to Romantic nationalism, but goes beyond the expounding of romantic sentiment, to a mystical veneration of the nation as a transcendent truth. It often intersects with ethnic nationalism by pseudohistorical assertions about the origins of a given ethnicity.
National mysticism is encountered in many nationalisms other than Germanic or Nazi mysticism, and expresses itself in the use of occult, pseudoscientific, or pseudohistorical beliefs to back up nationalistic claims, often involving unrealistic notions of the antiquity of a nation (antiquity frenzy) or any national myth defended as "true" by pseudo-scholarly means. Notable instances of national mysticism include:

Hiram Burnham

Hiram Burnham (1814 – September 29, 1864) was an officer in the Union Army who commanded a regiment and then a brigade in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. He was killed in battle while assaulting Confederate positions near Richmond, Virginia, during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm.
Early life and career.
Hiram Burnham was born in Narraguagus, later Cherryfield, Maine, in 1814. He formed and led a militia company as its captain in the Aroostook War of 1839. He subsequently worked as a lumberman and owned a sawmill. Active in local politics, he held public office as a county commissioner and a coroner. Burnham is described as a burly man with a strong voice, able to make himself heard on a battlefield. He was born in Machias, Maine the son of John & Elizabeth(Libby) Burnham. He moved to Cherryfield in the early 1830s.
Civil War.
Service in the Army of the Potomac.
Early in the war Burnham became lieutenant colonel of the 6th Maine Infantry on July 16, 1861. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on December 12 of that year. He served with the Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula Campaign, starting out in Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's brigade in a division of the IV Corps under Brig. Gen. William F. Smith. This division later became part of the VI Corps. At the Battle of Crampton's Gap and the Battle of Antietam, Burnham led his regiment in the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps under Hancock. He led the same regiment under Brig. Gen. Calvin E. Pratt at the Battle of Fredericksburg, where the brigade was only lightly engaged.
In 1863, a "Light Division" of VI Corps, composed of five regiments, was organized under General Pratt. It was to be able to move rapidly. Instead of wagons, supplies were to be carried on mules. However, Pratt resigned his post and Burnham led the division from May 3 to May 11, including at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, where he was wounded, temporarily relinquishing command. The Light Division was among the first VI Corps units to cross the Rappahannock River on May 1, 1863 to draw Confederate attention away from the main crossing points of the Army of the Potomac upstream. The Light Division made up the rightmost column in Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick’s attack on Marye’s Heightson May 3. Although Burnham spoke "cheerfully" to his troops before they attacked, casualties were heavy—an estimated 30%.
Burnham's Light Division was the right flank anchor of Sedgwick's line when VI Corps stood on the defensive during the later stages of the Battle of Salem Church. Only lightly engaged, Burnham was able to send two regiments to help repel a Confederate attack on the left flank. The 6th Maine of Burnham's command was one of the rearguard units when the corps retreated across the Rappahannock River. The Light Division was dissolved after the Battle of Chancellorsville, and Burnham's regiment joined the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, VI Corps under Brig. Gen. David Allen Russell. In that capacity he was present in reserve behind Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg. A monument to the regiment stands on Howe Avenue behind the Round Top.
Service in the Army of the James.
Burnham was absent from Russell’s brigade at the beginning of the Overland Campaign. Having been promoted to the rank of brigadier general on April 26, 1864, he was assigned command of a brigade in the first Division of the XVIII Corps, Army of the James on April 28 of that year. General Burnham led the brigade until July 31, and then again from September 27 to September 29 during the Siege of Petersburg. He commanded the 1st Division briefly in between.
Burnham was killed at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm on September 29, 1864. His brigade had routed Confederate skirmishers from a cornfield on the Varina Road and pursued toward the Confederate earthworks. In preparation for the planned assault on Fort Harrison, the division’s commander, Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard, deployed Burnham’s brigade in the front of his column. Burnham was hit in the intestines by a bullet shortly after his brigade penetrated into the fort. He died shortly thereafter.
General Burnham was buried in Pine Grove Cemetery in Cherryfield.
The U.S. Army renamed the captured Fort Harrison as Fort Burnham in his honor.

Criticism of marriage

Criticisms of marriage are arguments against the practical or moral value of the institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony. These have included the effects that marriage has on individual liberty, equality between the sexes, the relation between marriage and violence, philosophical questions about how much control can a government have over its population, the amount of control a person has over another, the financial risk when measured against the divorce rate, and questioning of the necessity to have a relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities. 
History.
In 380 BC, Plato criticised marriage in the "Republic". He stated that the idea of marriage was a "natural enemy" of the "commonwealth," aiming for its own higher unity. 
In the industrial age a number of notable women writers including Sarah Fielding, Mary Hays, and Mary Wollstonecraft, raised complaints that marriage in their own societies could be characterized as little more than a state of "legal prostitution" with underprivileged women signing in to support themselves. Naomi Gerstel and Natalia Sarkisian wrote that marriage is also found to be often at odds with community, diminishing ties to relatives, neighbors, and friends. According to Dan Moller's "Bachelor's Argument", modern marriage can be compared to the act of "forging professional credentials." Over 40 percent of them fail and therefore should be avoided similar to any high-risk venture.
Commentators have often been critical of individual local practices and traditions, leading to historical changes. Examples include the early Catholic Church's efforts to eliminate concubinage and temporary marriage, the Protestant acceptance of divorce, and the abolition of laws against inter-faith and inter-race marriages in the western countries.
The decision not to marry is a presumed consequence of Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy. His well-documented relationship with Regine Olsen is a subject of study in existentialism, as he called off their engagement despite mutual love. Kierkegaard seems to have loved Regine but was unable to reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer and his passionate and introspective Christianity. 
A similar argument is found in Franz Kafka's journal entry titled "Summary of all the arguments for and against my marriage":
I must be alone a great deal. What I accomplished was only the result of being alone. 
As a high-profile couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir always expressed opposition to marriage. Marriage, understood existentially, proposes to join two free selves into one heading, thus denying the freedom, the complete foundation, of each self.
Presently, the high divorce rates are leading to questioning of the purpose of marriage. Some contemporary critics of marriage question why do governments (in Western countries) continue to support marriage, when it has such a high failure rate. Anthropologist Lionel Tiger wrote:
Since 2000 onwards, several Western countries have legalized same sex marriage. Some supporters of same-sex marriage argue that, apart from offering rights to gays and lesbians, the legalization of same-sex marriage might also help women in general, by dissociating marriage from traditional gender roles and stereotypical expectations of subordination of the wife to the husband, and therefore might improve the status of married women.
In response to the passage of California Proposition 22 and the current controversy regarding same-sex unions in the United States, a group of people have banded together to boycott marriage until all people can legally marry. The argument is that since marriage is not an inclusive institution of society, the members of the boycott refuse to support the institution as it exists.
In the West, cohabitation and births outside marriage are becoming more common. In the United States, conservative and religious commentators are highly critical of this trend. They are also often critical of present day marriage law and the ease of divorce. John Witte, Jr., Professor of Law and director of the Law and Religion Program at Emory University, argues that contemporary liberal attitudes toward marriage produce a family that is "haphazardly bound together in the common pursuit of selfish ends" exactly as prophecized by Nietzsche. In his "From Sacrament to Contract", Witte has argued that John Stuart Mill's secular and "contractarian" model of marriage, developed during the Enlightenment, provided the theoretical justification for the present-day transformation of Anglo-American marriage law, promoting unqualified "right to divorce" on plaintiff's demand, one-time division of property, and child custody without regard for marital misconduct. A Catholic professor Romano Cessario, in a review of Witte’s book published in an ecumenical journal the "First Things", suggested that a solution to the current crisis of marriage in the West, could come from the possible revival of the sacramental marriage among Christians, thus counterbalancing Nietzsche's pessimism (as echoed by Witte).
The symbolism of marriage.
Some critics assert that marriage will always remain a symbolic institution signifying the subordination of women to men. Clare Chambers points to the sexist traditions surrounding marriage and weddings; she writes:
The history of marriage in relation to women makes it an institution that some critics argue cannot and should not be accepted in the 21st century; to do so would mean to trivialize the abuses it was responsible for. Some critics argue that it is impossible to dissociate marriage from its past. Clare Chambers argues that:"(...) it is impossible to escape the history of the institution. Its status as a tradition ties its current meaning to its past". Past abuses of marriage are sometimes depicted in documentaries. A documentary in Ireland presented the story of elderly women who described their experiences with repeated acts of rape in marriage and the children born from these rapes, during the time when marital rape was not criminalized, contraception, abortion and divorce were all illegal, and the marriage bar restricting married women's employment outside home was in force. Marital rape in Ireland was made illegal in 1990, and divorce was legalized in 1996.
Violence against women.
The United Nations General Assembly defines "violence against women" as ""any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life."" The 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women noted that this violence could be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the "State" itself.
Critics of marriage argue that marriage encourages abuse, exploitation and subordination of women. Common concerns raised today focus on the health and general well-being of women, who, in parts of the world, have virtually no protection in law or in practice, against domestic violence within marriage. It is also nearly impossible for women there to get out of abusive relationships. Abusive practices are maintained and exacerbated by ideologies of ownership and entitlement in some cultures and the of women is undermined by a powerful symbolic act of subordination. According to Gerstel and Sarkisian, domestic violence, isolation, and housework tend to increase for women who sign marriage contracts. Those with lower income draw even fewer benefits from it. Bad marriages, according to Gerstel and Sarkisian, result in higher levels of stress, suicide, hypertension, cancer, and slower wound healing in women.
Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution which incites violence against women, both through acts perpetrated inside marriage (such as beating and rape inside marriage - which are tolerated in some countries and also legal in some countries) and through acts related to marriage traditions and customs (such as honor killings for refusing arranged marriages; forcing unmarried rape victims to marry their rapist/marriage by abduction; or stoning for sex outside marriage). In some parts of the world, the extreme stigma cast on women who have reached a certain age and are still unmarried often leads these women to suicide. Suicide is also a common response of women caught in abusive marriages with no possibility of leaving those marriages. Women who are faced with the prospect of forced marriage may commit suicide. Violence and trafficking related to payment of dowry and bride price are also problems. Dowry deaths especially occur in South Asia, and acid throwing is also a result of disputes related to dowry conflicts.
In various countries married men have authority over their wives. For instance, Yemeni marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.
In Iraq husbands have a legal right to punish their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".In the Democratic Republic of Congo the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.
Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse of women. They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm of male-female interaction: subordination of the woman to the man in exchange of subsistence. According to Sheila Jeffreys "the traditional elements of marriage have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women".She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women "feel they have no choice but to stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive".
Sexuality in marriage is also an area of concern. In various places, men have sexual authority over their wives, in law and in practice. The men decide when and where to have sex, and wives have no power to stop unwanted sex. In certain countries marital rape is legal, and even where it is illegal it is infrequently reported or prosecuted. Often, married women also cannot stop unwanted pregnancy, because in various countries modern contraception is not available, and in some countries married women need legal permission from the husband to use contraception (and even in countries where the husband's consent is not legally required in practice it is asked for), and abortion is illegal or restricted, and in some countries married women need the consent of husband for abortion. Therefore marriage leads to a situation which allows not only forced sex, but also forced pregnancy, and in some of these countries pregnancy and childbirth remain dangerous because of lack of adequate medical care.The effects of sexual violence inside marriage are exacerbated by the practice of child marriage; in 2013 an 8-years-old Yemeni girl died from internal bleeding after she was raped by her 40-years-old new husband. Sheila Jeffreys argues that the very institution of marriage is based on the idea that heterosexual sex is the absolute right of the man and the absolute duty of the woman; that men are entitled to demand sex on their terms and to coerce sex, and women are not allowed to ever refuse it. Lack of economic opportunity means that wives have no choice but to "allow sexual access to their bodies in return for subsistence".
Violence related to female virginity is another problem. In many parts of the world it is socially expected for the bride to be a virgin; if the husband has sex with his wife after marriage and she does not bleed (it is possible for a woman to "not" bleed when she has sex for the first time ), this can end in extreme violence, including an honor killing.
The common view of marital life as "private" and outside the sphere of public intervention allows violence to flourish. Elizabeth Brake writes that "“privacy” protects unequal divisions of domestic labor, domestic violence, and exclusion of health coverage for abortion and contraception." Mary Lyndon Shanley writes that police often "ignore complaints of domestic violence because they do not want to “intrude” on the private realm of the married couple".
Statutory.
A criticism of marriage is that it gives the state an undue power and control over the private lives of the citizens. The statutes governing marriage are drafted by the state, and not by the couples who marry under those laws. The laws may, at any time, be changed by the state without the consent (or even knowledge) of the married people. The terms derived from the principles of institutionalized marriage represent the interests of the governments.
Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution based on control, domination and possession, and that attempting to exercise control over another person's life is immoral and dangerous, and should not be encouraged by the state. Claudia Card, professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that:
Cultural attitudes relating to marriage.
Some commentators criticize government authorities for promotion of marriage. They also criticize the romanticized image that marriage is given in films and romance novels. 
Some critics argue that people cannot form an objective image of what marriage is if they are from early childhood indoctrinated into believing marriage is desirable and necessary.
The feminist approach.
Feminist activists often point to historical, legal and social inequalities of wedding, family life and divorce in their criticism of marriage. Sheila Cronan claimed that the freedom for women "cannot be won without the abolition of marriage." "The institution of marriage – wrote Marlene Dixon of the Democratic Workers Party – is the chief vehicle for the perpetuation of the oppression of women; it is through the role of wife that the subjugation of women is maintained". Andrea Dworkin said that marriage as an institution, developed from rape, as a practice.
Early second wave of feminist literature in the West, specifically opposed to marriage include personalities such as Kate Millett ("Sexual Politics", 1969), Germaine Greer ("The Female Eunuch", 1970), Marilyn French ("The Women's Room", 1977), Jessie Bernard ("The Future of Marriage", 1972), and Shulamith Firestone ("The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution", 1970).
Men's rights movement.
Some men's rights writers say that marriage in the West is unfavourable to men as well, particularly in the financial consequences of divorce. For example, the father's rights advocates point out that there is a continuing societal bias favoring women as custodial parents in the face of "no-fault" divorce laws, and that divorce is routinely unjust to men when the marriages fail. Some claim that this trend leads to men avoiding marriage, calling it a "marriage strike".

Owl and Weasel

Owl and Weasel was a newsletter published in London, England, by Games Workshop for board gamers, role-playing gamers and wargamers. It was published from February 1975 until April 1977, running 25 issues, and was edited by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. It was superseded by "White Dwarf", which has been published on a monthly basis .
The reasoning behind such a "cultishly-monikered" choice of title has been stated to be a mystery by the co-editors, although anthropomorphism may have been a factor. Belatedly, in a 2009 interview Steve Jackson stated that "it represented the characteristics you need to be a good games player: wise like an owl and crafty like a weasel", although this explanation had not been given in any previous editorial or interview.
History.
The publication was initially launched to run alongside their own business of producing hand-crafted wooden board games. Because of this, there was a clear stated interest in print regarding "progressive games" including computer gaming and abstract games. The magazine issued a clear message for British producers to challenge the major game producing countries of the United States and Germany in what was, at the time, a relatively "traditional" marketplace. Copies of early issues were also sent speculatively to anyone within the industry in order to help generate business and nurture longer-term connections and partnerships.
The sixth issue, a key point in Games Workshop's early history, was released as a "Dungeons & Dragons" special - a first in the UK - and issues #11 and #23 doubled as programmes for their early Games Days, leading to coverage in The Times both of these events and of their magazine.
The editors had expected that the publication would run on beyond issue #25 (in #23, for Games Day II, results for a competition were to be announced in #27), but it was soon after decided that a more professional image was required in order to move the company into a new "phase", in line with what TSR had carried out the previous year (when TSR transitioned their first periodical, "The Strategic Review", into the "glossy" roleplaying and wargaming magazines, "The Dragon" and "Little Wars").
Although "Owl and Weasel"'s circulation would be considered tiny by modern day standards (having only exceeded 200 "nicely", including 80 direct sales through hobby shops, by early 1976), its influence in expanding what were previously niche hobbies into the general British marketplace dominated by traditional games was considerable, and it played a key role in setting up Games Workshop for an extended period of rapid growth.
Content.
The first few issues covered mostly traditional games and wargaming as well as running postal games, attempting to create a games club and providing an alternative source for games news with a scope set deliberately as wide as possible. Later issues provided coverage of fantasy and roleplaying games in general.
In the beginning, promotion of Games Workshop's own hand-crafted games boards was supplemented by reselling of wargames and small press games. Marketing of fantasy and science fiction games was expanded first by an exclusive deal with TSR in mid-1975 and further following the return of Livingstone and Jackson from GenCon IX in August 1976. There they had signed-up additional exclusive European distribution rights for many American publishers which were still at an early stage of their development—in part owing to the apparent lack of any other European companies at that convention. Traditional boardgames such as Monopoly and Scrabble, whilst continuing to be covered in news items even after this expansion, were never sold through the pages of the magazine.
Although D&D, as the first modern-day commercial roleplaying game, had been introduced to Britain no later than Autumn 1974, such playing groups and societies as existed within the country were still on a local basis by 1975 or early 1976, sometimes co-existing with traditional wargaming societies. The aforementioned exclusive deal with TSR thus gave Games Workshop increased impetus to promote their flagship product by the creation of a nationwide D&D society which was carried out through the pages of "Owl and Weasel". The society was first proposed in issue #9, but did not commence until issue #12. This further increased the roleplaying content of the publication which had previously included variant rules and short essays on rules and gameplay. Although D&D society members provided tournaments for conventions such as Games Day, this arrangement was not run in as formal a manner as carried out, much later, by TSR's RPGA.
In addition to promoting early postal D&D gaming, other postal fantasy games were co-ordinated by veteran Diplomacy aficionado Don Turnbull, later of TSR (UK), who had recently been the inaugural inductee to the Origins Hall of Fame (for his work on postal gaming, having started the first British postal diplomacy magazine in 1969). Further articles on game mechanics by Turnbull were accompanied by contributions from other well-known hobbyists such as Hartley Patterson and American, Lew Pulsipher, as well as introducing new names whose works continued to be printed in Games Workshop's subsequent publication, "White Dwarf".
Editors.
Editorial responsibilities were shared between Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone on an issue-by-issue basis. Although the first couple of issues were edited by Jackson, later numbers were more usually edited by Livingstone. This trend continued through until he became the lead editor for the first 74 issues of "White Dwarf".

Wicked Annabella

"Wicked Annabella" is a song by English rock band The Kinks, appearing on their 1968 album "The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society". 
The song was written by main songwriter Ray Davies, although sung by lead guitarist Dave Davies in a rare departure from tradition. "Wicked Annabella" takes on a rather dark and sinister turn, featuring a dissonant melody and unsettling lyrics. 
The song is in stark contrast to the rest of the album, which mainly consists of up-beat, lilting tunes about English hamlet life and culture. "Wicked Annabella" features a loud, distorted guitar riff and a Mick Avory drum beat that carries the song. The song was covered later by an American band, The Ophelias.
The song is often cited to be an influence in the development of Grunge music, due to the its dark, low-key guitar riff and lyrics.

WEbook

WEbook (pronounced "we book") is an online literary community geared towards discovering new writers and helping them on their path to publication. It brings together writers, readers, and almost 80 literary agents, for the purpose of finding new talent, and helping them get published.
Initially the vision of Israeli entrepreneur, Itai Kohavi, WEbook launched in April 2008, with corporate offices based in New York City.
After a brief hiatus, on April 5, 2013, new owners re-opened WEbook to the public with a new publishing platform, where readers choose the stories they want to read and help get them published. WEbook.com claims to have been the first online community devoted to discovering new authors and uniting readers, writers and literary agents with unpublished manuscripts. Its latest move marks "a profound change of direction" for the website, for it sees WEbook become a publisher, enabling its readers to call the shots, finding and publishing books from within the WEbook community
Site description.
WEbook aims to retain the creative spirit of independent publishing and to match it with the invaluable talent-spotting prowess of a traditional publisher, fuelled by the passions of an engaged social community. Through its free Page to Fame programme, the decision-making is transferred to the WEbook audience, who will judge a book's quality and its commercial potential. If WEbook members read and rave about a particular book in the raw, it has a chance of being successful once published.
Readers who sign up to Page to Fame are given book openings, short stories, essays, poems and blog posts to read, and are able to choose their preferred genre so that an author's material is always matched with its target market. Readers then rate each written work on a five-point scale, with the ratings determining the work's progression to the next commissioning stage. Each time a book is elevated, a publishing professional will review the manuscript. The programme is "fair and anonymous" - a reader is unable to search for a specific work or author, preventing biased voting. Those readers who review in high volume will be promoted to Top Scouts and Expert Raters. After five rounds of intensive reviewing, the most popular texts will be published by WEbook, which provides a full-service publishing process with 85% royalties. WEbooks, as they are known, are available from WEbook's own online store, powered by the Albury BookShelf, both as digital downloads or printed editions. WEbooks are also available through all conventional booksellers.
There are now more than 140,000 registered users, 70% in the US and 20% in the UK. There are no subscription fees, and all services are free. "We have no intention of trying to up-sell services to the active user base - we don't think they'd appreciate it, nor do they feel they need it." 
WEbook also helps writers through AgentInbox, a free electronic author-to-literary agent query service. Authors are matched with literary agents who are interested in their manuscript's genre.
History.
WEbook started as a collaborative book publisher. WEbook published, "101 Things Every Man Should Know How To Do". "101 Things" was written by 28 different authors and greenlit for publication by the WEbook community. The how-to guide includes entries such as how to grow a beard, bribing the cable guy and looking good in a Speedo. It is currently being sold through online booksellers, as well as its own site.
Also, under the heading of "Jan 20 2009: True Stories, Real People, One Day", WEbook collected stories about Inauguration Day 2009. The book, which included entries from 58 authors, launched on President's Day 2009 through the WEbook website and online booksellers. All profits from sales benefited 826 National, a nonprofit tutoring writing and publishing organization.
Awards and recognitions.
In April 2008, WEbook was named one of the best online spots for writers to work together in Washington Business Journal
In October 2008, WEbook was profiled by E-Commerce Times as a "startup to watch"
In October 2008, WEbook was named one of the first publishers specializing in the online publishing genre by Forbes.com
In March 2009, WEbook was named among the best sites on the World Wide Web on BBC News
In August 2010, WEbook was named Finalist in Lead411's New York City Hot 125
Funding.
Founded in February 2007, WEbook received a Series A round of "between $1 million and $5 million" from Greylock Israel Partners—an early investor of Facebook, Digg and DoubleClick—in June 2007. One of the company's six angel investors included ICQ co-founder Yair Goldfinger, who is now a WEbook board member. In September, 2008 WEbook raised $5 million in funding. The round was led by WEbook’s new investor, Vertex Venture Capital and its existing backer, Greylock Partners Israel. The round also included investments from eight unnamed angel investors.

CHLP

CHLP was a French-language Canadian radio station located in Montreal, Quebec which operated from December 31, 1932 to November 15, 1957.
Opened by the now-defunct daily newspaper La Patrie, the station closed shortly after competitor La Presse, which had bought La Patrie in the meantime, transformed that newspaper to a Sunday-only publication. Since La Presse already had its own radio station (namely CKAC), it was felt that CHLP became redundant.
The station obtained its licence on October 28, 1930. It went on the air on December 31, 1932, only twenty minutes before the new year. At the time CHLP operated on 1200 kHz with only 100 watts.
On March 29, 1941, due to the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement, CHLP moved, like most stations in North America, to a new frequency (1490 kHz in CHLP's case).
The station's power was increased to 250 watts in 1942. Another power increase, this time to 1,000 watts, occurred in 1949, and the frequency was changed to 1410 kHz. The old 1490 kHz frequency was never reassigned in the Montreal area, as the now-defunct CFOX would occupy the neighbouring 1470 kHz frequency starting in 1960.
CHLP started to air some programming in other languages, most notably in Greek, during the 1950s. The station went off the air on November 15, 1957, at midnight.
The 1410 kHz frequency was reactivated on December 21, 1962, when CFMB, a new station, went on the air. CFMB moved to 1280 kHz in 1997; the 1410 kHz frequency will be reactivated since CJWI 1610 got CRTC approval to move to 1410.

1987 Los Angeles Raiders season

The 1987 Los Angeles Raiders season was the club’s 28th season in the NFL. They finished with a disappointing record of 5–10 (the team's worst finish since Al Davis arrived in 1963). It was only the sixth losing season in franchise history.
Offseason.
Since he did not sign with a team by the 1987 draft, Bo Jackson’s rights were forfeited by Tampa Bay and his name was thrown back into the draft. The Los Angeles Raiders selected Jackson in the 7th round with the 183rd overall pick. Raiders owner Al Davis supported Jackson and his baseball career and got Jackson to sign a contract by offering him a salary that was comparable to a full-time starting running back but allowing Jackson to only play part-time until the baseball season was done.
Regular season.
Joining the Raiders midway through the 1987 season, Bo Jackson rushed for 554 yards on 81 carries in just seven games. Over the next three seasons, Bo Jackson would rush for 2,228 more yards and 12 touchdowns: a remarkable achievement, in light of the fact that he was a "second string" player behind Raiders legend Marcus Allen.
Jackson turned in a 221-yard rushing performance on "Monday Night Football" in 1987 against the Seattle Seahawks. During this game, he ran over Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth, who had insulted Jackson and promised in a media event before the game to contain Jackson. He also made a 91-yard run to the outside, untouched down the sideline. He continued sprinting until finally slowing down as he passed through the entrance to the field tunnel to the dressing rooms with teammates soon following. Jackson scored two rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown in the game.

<doc id="19092009" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19092009" title="Duo LNB">
Duo LNB

A Duo LNB is a double low-noise block downconverter (LNB) developed by SES for the simultaneous reception of satellite television signals from both the Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E satellite positions.
It is a monoblock LNB, which comprises two feed horns with a single body of electronics containing the LNB stages along with switching circuitry to select which received signal is passed to the output(s).
Availability.
A Duo LNB can be purchased in most parts of Europe but it is particularly marketed to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech and Slovak Republics.
Duo LNBs operate as universal LNBs and are manufactured under various brand names, such as Maximum and Inverto, in single, twin-output and quad-output versions – with one, two and four outputs (independently selectable for polarisation and frequency band), respectively, for one, two or four receivers/tuners.
The Duo LNB is available in two versions - the original Duo LNB for dishes of 80 cm or 85 cm diameter and the Duo LNB II for dishes of 60 cm.
Background.
The Astra 23.5°E orbital position was established as a major source of direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasts for central and western Europe with the launch of Astra 3A at the end of 2007, and some channels moved there from other satellite positions (in particular 19.2° east) so viewers, who were unable to erect two dishes to receive transmissions from both positions, had to choose between them.
In particular, the Czech CS Link and Slovak SkyLink networks moved to Astra 23.5°E, and the Dutch Canal Digitaal launched a new thematic bouquet at 23.5° east in October 2007. The Dutch regional broadcasters all moved to Astra 23.5°E in September 2007, to be lost to viewers without access to the new satellite position.
The Duo LNB was introduced to enable a single satellite dish to be used to receive all the channels from 19.2° east and 23.5° east.
The ASTRA2Connect satellite internet service also operates from 23.5° east.
In May 2010 the Astra 3B satellite was launched to the Astra 23.5° east position to release the Astra 1E and Astra 1G satellites previously in that position for use at other orbital positions. The launch had been much postponed due to technical problems with the Ariane 5 launch rocket. In February 2011, Bulgarian DTH operator Satellite BG launched a package of more than 60 standard definition channels and 12 high definition channels using three transponders on Astra 3B, further increasing the appeal for viewers to receive both satellite positions.
Technology.
The basic technology behind the Duo LNB is not new. It takes advantage of the fact that signals hitting a dish off-axis will be focused (albeit with some diffusion) off axis in the opposite direction. So, with the dish aligned so that the central LNB is receiving one satellite, a secondary offset LNB can be aligned on the focus of a second satellite spaced away from the first.
This effect has been exploited for many years to receive signals from two satellites at once with a single dish, and two LNBs have been most commonly arranged on a dish in this way for reception of Astra 19.2°E and the Hot Bird satellites at 13° east, primarily for the abundance of TV channels from 19.2° east, and some additional channels (especially adult channels) from 13° east.
A monoblock LNB provide a convenient alternative to fixing and aligning two LNBs to a dish independently. The two feedhorns are positioned at the correct spacing for reception from the two satellites required and the DiSEqC switching system is used to select between the signals from the two satellites with commands from the connected receiver. In other respects, the monoblock LNB acts as a normal LNB to the connected receiver.
The required separation of the monoblock's feedhorns depends on the angular separation of the satellites to be received, the position of the receive site on the Earth's surface and the focal length of the dish. Fortunately, monoblock LNBs can be standardised for sites across Europe provided that a "standard" offset dish with a focal length/diameter (f/D) ratio of 0.6 is used.
Monoblock LNBs for 19.2° east and 13° east have been widely available for several years (indeed, the DiSEqC switching system was originally designed for just this setup). However, these do not function correctly for Astra 23.5°E and Astra19.2°E because these satellites are at a different angular separation.
In fact, it can be difficult to physically fit two separate LNBs onto a dish at the correct separation for Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E because their bulk may prevent the feedhorns sitting close enough together.
The Duo LNB is carefully designed with the correct spacing of the feedhorns, DiSEqC level 1.0 switching between the satellites and a low noise amplifier and conversion system.
Installation.
The Duo LNB is normally fitted with the feedhorn for Astra 23.5°E mounted on the dish's feedarm, and the 19.2°E feedhorn sticking out to the right - as viewed standing in front of the dish, with the satellites behind you. The Astra 23.5°E feedhorn is identified with a "23.5" marking on the casing. The dish is then aligned on the 23.5°E position, using a signal strength meter, in the normal way.
The Duo LNB is rotated in the feed clamp to a certain tilt angle to provide both the correct 'skew' angle for the feedhorns to align with the incoming signals, and the necessary height difference between the feedhorns to accommodate the different elevations of the two satellite positions. The correct skew angle and height difference depend on the position of the receive site on Earth's surface, and in most locations the tilt angle from the LNB is a compromise between their ideal settings. However, within Europe the single tilt angle adjustment provides sufficient accuracy for both settings for reliable reception.
The tilt angle for the Duo LNB at the receive site location may be found in maps or city tables (a scale is marked on the LNB casing) or found by adjustment with a signal meter connected.
By setting the correct tilt angle and aligning the whole dish in azimuth and elevation, the two feedhorns of the LNB are optimally aligned for both orbital positions.
Name Confusion.
The Duo LNB is a monoblock type LNB designed for accessing two satellite positions with a single dish and it should not be confused with a "dual LNB", which is the common (US) name for an LNB with a single feedhorn but two separate outputs.
A double LNB called just a "Monoblock" will usually be for reception of 19.2° east and 13° east, and not a Duo LNB suitable for Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E.

St Patrick's Stream

St Patrick's Stream or Patrick Stream is a backwater of the River Thames in England, which flows into the River Loddon near Wargrave, Berkshire. It leaves the Thames on the reach above Shiplake Lock near Buck Ait, downstream of Sonning.
It is believed that the stream was originally a branch of the River Loddon that flowed into the Thames. However when Shiplake Lock was built, the water level was raised to such an extent that it became an outfall. Evidence to support this includes a 13th-century charter stating, ""Where the Lodone falls into the Thames under the park of Suninges"", the contention that the stream is private and not public Thames water and the shape of the junction point which suggests a tributary rather than an outflow.

Mecklenburg XVIII

The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway ("Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn") grouped two, narrow gauge, steam locomotives taken over from the Doberan-Heiligendamm railway ("Doberan-Heiligendammer Eisenbahn" or "DHE") into the Mecklenburg XVIII engine class.
History.
For the opening of the long railway line from Doberan to Heiligendamm the DHE had procured two 'tramway' locomotives, which were given the numbers 1 and 2. The long section through the town in Doberan in particular made the procurement of such engines sensible. When the private railways were nationalised in 1890 the locomotives were renumbered to 1001 and 1002. Not long afterwards, it became clear that the locomotives were not able to cope with the rising levels of traffic as they could only haul a three-coach train. So in 1891 and 1898 Class XIX engines were procured. The tramway locos were retired in 1916.
Design Details.
The locomotives were designed as box frame engines ("Kastenlokomotiven") and had an outside plate frame with a well tank. The two saturated steam engines were on the inside, and the diagonally-oriented cylinders drove the rear coupled axle. The entire running gear was covered. Suspension was provided by leaf springs over the axle boxes. The boiler was horizontal. The firehole was located on the right hand side. In order to keep the minimise the impact when driving through Doberan, exhaust steam was expelled through a condenser. The footplate was located on the right hand side and could be used for driving both forwards and backwards due to the good visibility it afforded. Reversing the Joy valve gear was achieved using a lever working a crossed eccentric rod.

The Miracle of Father Malachia

The Miracle of Father Malachia () is a 1961 West German black-and-white film directed by Bernhard Wicki and starring Horst Bollmann. The film is based on the 1938 novel "Father Malachy's Miracle" by Bruce Marshall and tells the story of a supposed miracle in a West German town that is soon exploited and sensationalized by the media and profiteers. The film won several awards and was the official West German submission to the 34th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.
Plot.
Next to a church in a prosperous German industrial town is the Eden bar, a night club and brothel. The Eden bar is a thorn in the side of the worldly innocent monk Father Malachia (Horst Bollmann), who is praying to God that he will close the bar. The prayer is heard and the building and the bar and all people inside vanish and reappear on an island in the North Sea. This apparent miracle draws the attention of the media, politicians and scientists, all trying to find rational explanations. The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, both fearing a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappareance of the Eden bar would turn out to be a fabrication.
Meanwhile believers from all over the world pilgrimage to the former location of the bar. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the towns people, profiteers and journalists trying to make a profit from the sudden influx of pilgrims and the miracle. This includes the sale of holy water, Malachia Stollen and miniature models of the Eden bar. A young woman, who was in the bar during the night the bar vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors are buying the island where the Eden bar reapparead, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people.
Father Malachia is confronted with interview requests by journalists, pilgrims beleaguering the church and is hoping to meet the Father Malachia. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for a miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy, and is heard by God who returns the Eden bar to its original location.
Production.
Wicki based his film on the 1938 novel "Father Malachy's Miracle" by the Scottish accountant and writer Bruce Marshall. He wrote the script together with the screenwriter Heinz Pauck, planning to not only adapt the original novel, but also to expose the "social structure of our saturated " (). Writing the script took more than six months, whereas the actual filming took five months.
For the main role of Father Malachias Wicki cast the stage actor Horst Bollmann, who had never played in a film. Other important roles were played by experienced film actors such as Richard Münch or Günter Pfitzmann. Supporting actors were often lay actors who played a role corresponding to their real profession, as for example journalists, press photographers or businessmen. Several known people had cameo appearances in the film, including the German translator of "Justine", Maria Carlsson as a socialite, the humorist and graphic artist Loriot as a playboy and the film journalist Kurt Habernoll as a sausage vendor.
The film was shot completely on location and not a single scene was shot on a studio set. Most scenes were shot in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr Area. In total 95 different locations were used, including several industrial sites and the Musiktheater im Revier. A small part of the footage showing monks and priests was shot in advance at the Eucharistical World Congress in Munich. To increase the authenticity of the film Wicki used real brand names such Miele, König-Pilsener, Coca-Cola or Telefunken. Some brand names featured in fictional slogans that were used by those trying to make a profit from the miracle, for example "The girl that witnessed the miracle flies around the world with PAA". () or "Stay on earth — drive Borgward" ().
The film was planned to have its premiere at the International Film Festival in Berlin. As it was not yet completed the selection committee of the film festival saw only a raw cut of the film. This led to speculation in the tabloid press of a race against the time and that Wicki had collapsed at the cutting table due to the time pressure. Ultimately the film was finished only seven hours before it premiered at the festival.
Distribution and responses.
Upon release the film received positive, albeit not enthusiastic reviews by the German press. The Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote, against the background of the artistic and economic stagnation of the German film industry that Wicki is "a kind of Messiah ... who did not only have to prove himself and others his talent, but also had to show that the film industry has a right to exist." (). Die Welt wrote that "the cinema of this country [Germany is not yet finished" ().
The film won several awards. Nationally, "The Miracle of Father Malachia" won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival in 1961, and three German film awards in the categories Best Actor, Best Set Design and a "Filmband in Silber" for Best Feature Film in 1962. In 1961 it also won the price of German Film Critics, the "Goldene Muschel mit Perle" in the category Best Actor and the Bambi for best artistic achievement in the category German film.
Internationally the film won the Prize of the City at the Valladolid International Film Festival in 1963. It was also chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 34th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination.

East Fork.
The East Fork Pasayten River originates at Dollar Watch Pass and flows west, picking up the outlet stream from Big Hidden Lake just over halfway to its eventual meeting with the mainstream of the Pasayten just upstream from the Canada/United States border.
Mainstream.
The Pasayten River Proper begins at Three Forks, where the West and Middle Forks converge to form the mainstream. The Pasayten, prior to crossing the border, is joined by the East Fork. The river, after crossing the border, continues to flow north. The Pasayten River flows just east of E. C. Manning Provincial Park before joining the Similkameen River.

During shooting for "Poove Unakkaga" Viji experienced hip and back pain and she had to undergo an operation of her spinal chord in 1996 at the Chennai Apollo Hospitals. The operation failed and doctors found an acute infection in the wound caused by the surgery. After more surgeries, Viji suffered temporary paralysis. She filed a lawsuit on Apollo Hospitals which returned Rs 30,000. Viji recovered after a corrective surgery and made a comeback to films in 2000 with "Simmasanam". Vijayakanth who had acted with Viji in many films gave her an opportunity to star in the film and had promised to give her a role in his next film "Vaanchinathan" also, but "Simmasanam" ultimately remained her last film.
On 27 November 2000, Viji committed suicide in her home in Chennai. Her suicide note blamed a failed love affair with director A. R. Ramesh, who was already married. The Hindu reported that the prosecution case was that Ramesh promised to marry her but refused later and that three days prior to her death, Ramesh met Viji at a function and abused her. Ramesh, his wife, A. R. Sumathi, and his friend, Chinnasamy were charged with "abetting the suicide" of Viji and acquitted by the Mahila Court.

XBRL International

XBRL International (XII) is the international standards organization which develops and maintains the XBRL Specification. It is a not-for-profit consortium of agencies and companies internationally, working together to build the XBRL language standard, and support and promote XBRL's adoption. As of February 2008, the XII had approximately 650 members. XII is the organization responsible for the XBRL taxonomy that will used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for US public companies after 2010.
Mission.
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox says "The centerpiece of our regulatory approach is giving investors the information they need to make wise decisions. We have an opportunity to exponentially improve the way we perform that mission."
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers consultant Walter Hamscher, who began his work with the XML standards consortium XBRL International from its inception, the mission of XII's international members is to facilitate a standard for the transfer of financial information along the business information supply chain. Hamscher says that by creating a common framework, the flow of information to investors and other users is accelerated.
History.
XBRL was originally the work of the AICPA as a way to advance financial reporting and facilitate the global exchange of financial data. In response to the new standard, XBRL International was created to ensure compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards in business reporting. The consortium was created to collaborate on a set of core principles and components which make up the XBRL standard business reporting language and to prevent XBRL from growing into many different forms that might confuse the users of financial data. 
In 2008, the SEC mandated the use of XBRL reporting for US public companies. XBRL US, a division of XBRL International, was chosen to develop a single taxonomy for SEC financial reporting.
In May 2008, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox thanked XBRL International for "continued leadership in growing interactive data into its preeminent role as the computer language of business and financial reporting for the world".
Membership.
The consortium is governed by its membership, which comprises about 650 organizations. XII members consist of jurisdictions, either provisional or established, organized under the rules of the organization. XII also accepts direct members and associations members. Jurisdiction members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities and in some cases individuals. There is no provision for individual membership directly with XII.
Organizations are members of and pay membership fees to XBRL jurisdictions. As of August 2008, there are 16 established jurisdictions, seven provisional jurisdictions, and one affiliated organization (XBRL Europe).
Administration.
XII comprises several working groups having jurisdictional and international focus. A Steering Committee chosen from jursidictional and at-large representatives, sets the overall direction of the specification and coordinates these working groups.
XII has a Board of Directors and a Board of Advisors. Technical direction of the standards owned by XII is controlled by the XBRL Standards Board. The Best Practices Board is responsible for collecting, evaluating and disseminating best practices in XBRL implementation.

Conservation conveyance

The Conservation Conveyance is a 2003 statute, Title 10 of the United States Code, section 2694(a), authorizing military departments to convey surplus real property to states, local governments, or private, land-acquiring non-profit conservators for perpetual conservation use. 
The Conservation Conveyance is unique to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), allowing it to transfer closed military bases into permanent conservation status. According to a January, 2005 Report by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), titled "Military Base Closures: Updated Status of Prior Base Realignments and Closures (BRAC):" “This method was used by DOD for the first time in September 2003 to transfer property for natural resource and conservation purposes. Under this method, the U.S. Army transferred almost from the Sierra Army Depot, California, to the Honey Lake Conservation Team, which is made up of two nonprofit organizations—the Center for Urban Watershed Renewal and the Trust for Public Land—and two private-sector companies. This is the largest single transfer of surplus BRAC property that the Army has undertaken. Nearly 22 percent of the BRAC acreage transferred to nonfederal users in the prior rounds was accomplished through this method.” The Army describes its first experience with the Conservation Conveyance in an article titled "Army Finds Success in New Method of Returning Land to Civilian Use". [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/23/3322-army-finds-success-in-new-method-of-returning-land-to-civilian-use/]
The Conservation Conveyance was created by Rebecca R. Rubin, founder and President of Marstel-Day, LLC as a technique for transferring closed military bases into permanent conservation status, an accomplishment for which she received the Association of Defense Communities’ 2008 Private Sector Leader of the Year Award. To date, approximately of land have been permanently conserved using this approach. Ms. Rubin also hosts an audio program entitled “Vital Voices of the Environment” in which she interviews environmental thinkers and planners of our times, each of whom offers a perspective on the key issues now and for the environmental future of our planet.

Duke Charles of Mecklenburg

Duke Charles of Mecklenburg () (30 November 1785 – 21 September 1837) was a member of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and a Prussian soldier who served in the Napoleonic Wars. From 1827 until his death he was President of the Prussian State Council.
Early life and entry into the army.
Duke Charles Frederick Augustus of Mecklenburg was born in Hanover where his father Duke Charles of Mecklenburg was the governor. His mother was Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt, his fathers second wife who died shortly after his birth on 12 December. On 2 June 1794 his father succeeded Adolf Friedrich IV as the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
Duke Charles entered into the Prussian service at a young age. By the age of 19 he held a commission as a Captain and by 1806 he had been promoted to the rank Major. He fought for his brother in law King Frederick William III of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition accompanying the king in his flight following the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. For his services in the Saale campaign Duke Charles was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.
1813.
By 1813 he had been promoted to the rank Major General and was in command of brigade attached to the force of General Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg. Duke Charles led his brigade at the Battle of Katzbach. During this campaign while commanding a small column he managed to hold off an attack by French forces who had superior numbers for a whole day before being ordered to withdraw during the night. Shortly after this engagement Duke Charles was instructed by Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher to keep open the communication with the forces of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron and Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken. Shortly after setting out with his brigade he was attacked by three French columns. Although vastly outnumbered he managed to hold his ground until he seized an opportunity and placing himself at the head of one of his battalions he managed to drive the French back. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.
The next action he saw was when the Prussian army crossed the Elbe at Wartenburg on 13 October. Given orders to outflank the right wing of the French, Duke Charles took his brigade across the Elbe and attacked the village of Bleddin and succeeded in driving the French out, taking nine of their cannons and a number of prisoners. On 16 October he fought with distinction at the Battle of Möckern. Leading his brigade in a bayonet charge against the French batteries and columns he succeeded in forcing the section of the line they attacked back but at the cost of his whole brigade almost being taken out with Duke Charles and the other officers all being wounded in the charge.
Later that year Duke Charles was appointed to command the "1st of the Line" the oldest regiment of foot in the service.
Later years.
In 1815 Duke Charles was appointed a Lieutenant General and Commandant of the Royal Guards and Grenadiers. He was later appointed President of the Prussian State Council in 1827. 
Duke Charles never married and died in Berlin at the age of 51.

It began as a room in the New City School, opening one afternoon a week, but as the book collection of the library increased, space quickly became a concern. Funding also became a concern, particularly in 1950 when the New City School was no longer able to provide space or finances for the library. With grants and public donations, including a donation of land by the New City Fire Department, the library broke ground on a free-standing building on May 3, 1952. The library opened to the public on July 11, 1953, remaining opening for 12 hours each week. 
As library membership and book collections continued to grow, the library expanded its hours and staff, also increasing its capacity with the addition of a trailer in the early 1960s. When the New City Fire Department deemed the building safe for occupancy only by 14 patrons at a time in 1965, a vote was held to appropriate sufficient funds for the library to purchase a new location, to which it moved on January 2, 1967. In 1977, the library purchased of land. After budget was approved for the construction of a much larger building in December of 2007, ground was broken in November 1978. The new facility contained as well as a generous allocation for parking for 120 cars. With community support, the library took possession of its new property on January 19, 1980. Over subsequent years, the building has been expanded with additional, including a children's wing, a circulation lobby and a basement which houses a technical services department and an audiovisual department. The current facility hosts over 200,000 volumes in .

Trails in Lincoln, Nebraska

An extensive network of trails in Lincoln, Nebraska are available for recreation there.
The Antelope Valley Project provides a hub for the system. Project trails parallel the new Antelope Valley Parkway and provide connections to other trails. Capitol Parkway and its trail network connect to the Antelope Valley Project at J Street. Other trails utilize abandoned railroad rights of way. Some trails have been specially constructed. Still others, run through Wilderness Park—miles of more primitive recreational trails exist there. At the Haymarket the Homestead Trail heads south to Marysville, KS.
Major trails.
Antelope Valley Parkway.
This extensive transportation, flood control and park complex, is the new hub of Lincoln's trails. A trail lines the Antelope Creek flood control channel from Military Road on the north to an extension connection of the Billy Wolff Trail on the South. The Parkway trails and connections to other trails, are made possible by a series of underpasses and bridges. The MoPac Trail intersects the Antelope Valley Project trail between W and Y Streets. The Jamaica North Trail is another of several convenient trails connected through the project.
Holmes Lake Trail.
Virtually surrounding Holmes Lake, the trail connects with the Billy Wolff Trail south. The resulting trail complex, runs Northeast to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, City Campus.
Billy Wolff Trail.
The trail runs from Holmes Lake, along Antelope Creek and Capitol Parkway, to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus. In 2010, the intersection of South Street and Capitol Parkway will be revised to provide a pathway uninterrupted by streets continuing on and connecting to the Antelope Valley Parkway hub for the city network of trails.
Rock Island Trail.
Connected to the Bill Wolff Trail, the Rock Island Trail extends from Antelope Park, South to Wilderness Park. Through a series of underpasses and bridges, e.g. Highway 2 and South 14th bridges, the trail runs virtually uninterrupted by streets and highways. There is a crossing at Calvert Street (little auto traffic), another on Essex Road (even less auto traffic), and finally a crossing at Old Cheney Road (pretty busy), near 14th Street.
Jamaica North Trail.
The Jamaica North Trail uses of abandoned Union Pacific Rail track. This trail runs through southwest Lincoln neighborhoods, connects to the Homestead Trail, to the Haymarket and provides access to the UNL City Campus. Eventually the Homestead trail will leave the Haymarket and connect to Marysville, KS, to the South.
Other trails.
Additional trails include: Murdock Trail, John Dietrich Trail, MoPac Trail, Boosalis Trail, Superior St. Trail, Roper West Park Trail, Wilderness Park Trails, Bison Trail, Levee Trail, Antelope Creek Trail and Homestead Trail.

United Southeast Asian Cultural Association

United Southeast Asian Cultural Association, aka USEACA is a non-profit organization that has a goal in preserving the Southeast Asian culture and tradition. USEACA is the first organization in Washington State to bring together different martial art and dance instructors to organize annual cultural events. These events offer the public a glimpse of Southeast Asian culture, traditional kickboxing (Muay Thai, Pradal Serey, Muay Lao), and traditional dance performances (Khmer classical dance, Thailand Traditional Dance, and Laoatian traditional dance). 
USEACA was an idea brought up in 2006 when three men (Master John, Srab Sroeuy, and Lo Heit) talked about how nice it would be to have an organization that would unite traditional martial art and traditional dance instructors and somehow showcase the relationship between Southeast Asian traditional cultural dance and martial art. From what was an idea a year prior, became the birth and reality of USEACA in 2007. Since then USEACA has grown and added new members, which include Bokator and Filipino Kali stick fighting instructors, as well as two traditional dance instructors (Khmer Classical/Folk Dance and Thailand Traditional Dance).

Powerhouse Arts District, Jersey City

The Powerhouse Arts District is a historic warehouse district in Downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, which takes its name from the unused generating station Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse currently undergoing an extensive stabilization effort. Since the millennium the section is called WALDO, an acronym for Work And Live District Overlay, an 11 block section of historic warehouses, some of which have been redeveloped, and is still used on maps and in local parlance. Once part of the no longer extant Horseshoe Section, the neighborhood's informal borders are Newport to the north, Exchange Place to the east, Paulus Hook to the south and Harsimus Cove to the west. 
The landmarked Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse is at Provost St. between 1st and Bay Sts. The Pavonia-Newport, Harsimus Cove, and Harborside stations of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and the Grove Street (PATH station) are nearby
WALDO and PAD.
WALDO was the name of a planning strategy adopted into Jersey City zoning in 2002 per a proposal written by the Urban Land Institute, and was deleted from the zoning on January 24, 2007. As the name implies, the purpose was to most effectively re-use an eight block area of industrial buildings, and transition them to include more residences, without zoning them a purely residential use. Currently, most zoning codes do not allow industrial and residential uses to co-exist on the same lot. The district also aimed at retaining the high bulk, low rise industrial buildings which were threatened by development of high rise towers in the area.
The plan indicated that roughly half of the apartments built in the existing industrial buildings in the eight block neighborhood must go to artists. Under the district plan, two industrial buildings were renovated into loft apartments, and one new building, Waldo Lofts, was constructed. During the district's lifespan, there were several attempts to bring in more housing and studios for artists, to make the area more pedestrian friendly, and to bring in art schools or museums. There were also been proposals to turn the Powerhouse into residences, shops, galleries, and museum space.
Most of the proposals for retail and gallery space never materialized or found tenants, and as a result the eight blocks of industrial buildings remain much the same as in 2002 when the district began. As well, the city approved new zoning for a large development on First Street which deviated from the district plan. New zoning is proposed for several other blocks. Most proposed developments are higher rise structures, and the majority of capital investment in the district favors high rise development. These factors led to WALDO being removed from the zoning ordinance.
Waldo Yards.
An older "Waldo" not this section of Jersey City has existed since long before the zoning strategy. This is Waldo Avenue, which runs south from Newark Avenue to "The Island" a remnant outcropping of Bergen Hill, which in turn overlooks the Waldo Yards, originally used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Jersey City Branch, and now by Port Authority Trans Hudson mass transit trains.

Waldo Avenue is named for Samuel Waldo who built and owned three attached brownstone homes located on the NW corner of Magnolia and Waldo Avenues. Today, the three structures still stand.

Bushbuckridge

Bushbuckridge () is a city and municipality in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. The name was given because of the large herds of antelope that were found there in the 1880s. The town grew around a trading store which opened in 1884. Tobacco, cotton and vegetable farming takes place in the surrounding countryside.
In 1994, when South Africa was divided into nine new provinces, the Bushbuckridge area was included in Limpopo province. The citizens of the town and surrounding areas were in a dispute with the government because they wanted to be part of Mpumalanga province, since Nelspruit (the capital of Mpumalanga) is much closer to them than Polokwane (the capital of Limpopo). In 2006 the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa transferred the area to Mpumalanga.

<doc id="19092449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19092449" title="Niccolò da Poggibonsi">
Niccolò da Poggibonsi

Frà Niccolò da Poggibonsi () was a Franciscan monk who made a famous pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1345–50, which he described in Italian in his "Libro d'oltramare".
From Poggibonsi in Tuscany, Niccolò, with seven companions (six of whom eventually returned home), departed for Venice, from where he embarked for a sea voyage to Cyprus. He sojourned for some months on the island in the service of King Hugh IV. He then left for Jaffa, and from there visited the shrines in Jerusalem (where he served for four months in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) and the myriad holy sites of Palestine. He went as far as Damascus intending to visit "Babylonia" and "Chaldaea" (probably Baghdad), which he never did.
He left by ship from Beirut and stopped in Egypt, where he visited Alexandria, "Babylonia" (probably Fustat, Old Cairo), New Cairo, and the places in Sinai mentioned in the Old Testament. There he also visited the ancient Saint Catherine's Monastery. He continued north to Gaza and there turned back towards the Nile delta, where he took a ship from Damietta to Cyprus.
In Cyprus he boarded a ship for Italy. The ship followed an adventurous course, taking him by the Anatolian coast of Ottoman Empire, to call in the port of Tripoli, and near Poreč on the Adriatic, where he was captured by brigands but managed to escape. He arrived safe in Venice late in 1349 and went to Ferrara, where he was detained until the spring of 1350, when he finally, after five years of wandering, returned to Poggibonsi.
Upon his return Niccolò recounted his travels in the "Libro d'oltramare" ("Book of Outremer"). Rich in detail, it describes the sights, the distances on the roads, the tolls paid, and the indulgences associated with various shrines. His descriptions of buildings and cities are unusually detailed, and the picture he paints of Jerusalem was based on four months residence there. His entire pilgrimage was extraorinarily long by the standards of the time. This is probably attributable to his desire to see sites that lacked the facilities for receiving pilgrims, for visiting far-off sites in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, and his financial difficulties (his first stay in Cyprus necessitated by the need to raise cash). Organised trips departed regularly from Venice, bringing pilgrims to Jerusalem and its suburbs (like Mount Tabor), but Niccolò eschewed typical tourism.
Niccolò informs us that the house of the Virgin Mary at Nazareth, long a Christian holy place, was destroyed, possibly by the Mamelukes sometime after 1289, when it was last recorded standing. When Niccolò visited the site, all that remained was a cove with three walls. Niccolò is also an important witness to a supposed Mongol conquest of Jerusalem in 1300, since he records that the Mongols removed a gate (the "Golden Gate") from the Temple of Jerusalem (today the Dome of the Rock) and had it transferred to Damascus.
The "Libro d'oltramare" was translated into German around 1467 by Gabriel Muffel of Nuremberg, who was probably working out of Passau. An illuminated manuscript (Egerton 1900) of the German translation from 1467, purports to be a description of Muffel's visit to the Holy Land in 1465. The earliest manuscripts of Niccolò's "Libro" are unillustrated, but the Egerton 1900 has 147 miniatures. The "Libro d'oltramare" was first published anonymously in an Italian translation based on the German in Bologna in 1500. This version, the "Viazo da Venesia al Sancto Iherusalem", contained 145 woodcuts and twenty-six printings before 1600.

Grim Sleeper

Grim Sleeper is the nickname for an alleged serial killer in Los Angeles, California, believed to be responsible for at least ten murders, one suspected and one attempted murder in Los Angeles since 1985. The attacker was dubbed the "Grim Sleeper" because he appears to have taken a 14-year hiatus from his crimes, from 1988 to 2002.
On July 7, 2010, a suspect, Lonnie David Franklin Jr., 57, was arrested. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has charged him with ten counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, and special circumstance allegations of multiple murders in the case. A grand jury indictment was issued on March 23, 2011. Franklin has been in jail since his arrest awaiting trial; the large quantity of evidence in this case, some dating back thirty years, had caused a lengthy pretrial discovery. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who is assigned to the case, has said she wants the final pretrial hearing to happen in June 2014, with the trial commencing soon thereafter.
Investigation.
After police discovered several dead women in alleyways and dumpsters in South Los Angeles, California during the mid-1980s, community members formed the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders (co-founded by women's rights activist Margaret Prescod) and pressed police to set up a task force, to change the name of the series of killings to the South Side Slayings, they made and handed out thousands of flyers about the murders and distributed them in South LA but as far as Beverly Hills. The Coalition also pressed the city to establish a reward. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Los Angeles Police Department began investigating the murders setting up the "Southside Slayer" task force. At the time, the police thought that the murders were committed by one person labelled the "Southside Slayer". These crimes were announced to the public on September 23, 1985.
Eventually, according to LAPD and the Sheriff's detectives realized that several serial killers were murdering women. Amongst their other murders, Louis Craine committed at least two of the murders, and Michael Hughes, Daniel Lee Siebert and Ivan Hill at least one each. A separate series of killings commenced with the murder of Debra Jackson, with a different MO involving a firearm. These became known, misleadingly, as the "Strawberry murders". A Sheriff's detective Ricky Ross was initially arrested for the "strawberry murders" but was later released due to what police officials said was an error in ballistics. Two decades later the perpetrator of these crimes was named Grim Sleeper due to a long period of apparent inactivity between crimes.
In May 2007, the murder of Janecia Peters, 25, was linked through DNA analysis to eleven, possibly twelve, unsolved murders in Los Angeles, the first of which occurred in 1985. The "800 Task Force" was then formed, consisting of seven detectives. After a four-month investigation, the "LA Weekly" investigative reporter Christine Pelisek broke the news of the secret 800 Task Force, the linking of Peters' killing to a string of murders going back 23 years, and the fact that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief William J. Bratton had been silent on the killer's existence. The mayor and chief never issued a press release nor warned the South Los Angeles community of the killer's continuing activities. In some cases, the alternative newspaper was the first to inform the families that their daughters had long been confirmed as victims of a serial killer.
In March 2009, Christine Pelisek of the "LA Weekly" did an extensive interview with Enietra Washington, the sole survivor of the Grim Sleeper's attacks. She described him as "a black man in his early 30s [...] He looked neat. Tidy. Kind of geeky. He wore a black polo shirt tucked into khaki trousers." She also described him as a "thin, neat, polite and well-groomed African-American guy."
He owned "an orange Ford Pinto with a white racing stripe on the hood." "looked like a Hot Wheels [toy car," the survivor recalled. He offered her a ride. After she refused, "He told me, ‘That is what is wrong with you black women. You think you are all that.'" He was persistent. After some banter back and forth, she got into his car.
She "was impressed by the car’s interior. The gear-shift handle was memorable, pimped out with a ping-pong-sized marble ball. The inside was all-white, with white diamond-patterned upholstery." When she mentioned a party, he deftly invited himself and she said he was welcome to come. He then said that he needed to stop briefly at his uncle's house:
"They wound through residential roads in his sporty car, ending up on a street whose name she did not take note of. The polite stranger parked outside a mustard-colored house partly obscured by hedges, got out, walked up to the house, briefly talked to someone inside, and returned about ten minutes later." They began arguing, when "He suddenly pulled a small handgun out of a pocket on the driver’s side of the Pinto, and shot her in the chest as he drove along the residential streets." The killer apparently documented his attacks with a Polaroid camera: "She blacked out, but was startled awake by the bright flash of the camera. The man had taken her picture and sexually assaulted her. She remembers grabbing at him, and the two struggled. She pleaded to be taken to a hospital. He refused. Despite her half-conscious condition, she’s almost certain he told her he couldn’t take her to a hospital because he didn’t want to get caught."
In late August 2008, the same week the "Weekly" broke the sole survivor's story with information on the Grim Sleeper's body count of thirteen victims, an aide to Police Chief William Bratton said he was too busy to comment on the case.
In early September 2008, officials in Los Angeles announced that they were offering a $500,000 reward to help catch the killer, who has murdered at least ten women and a man in two sprees over the past twenty years.
On November 1, 2008, a story about the "Grim Sleeper" appeared on the television program "America's Most Wanted". The program stated that the killer was most likely a black male but did not want to rule out anyone.
On February 25, 2009, for the first time, Chief Bratton held a press conference regarding the case at which police formally gave the killer the "Grim Sleeper" nickname chosen by "L.A. Weekly". Bratton then released a call from the 1980s made to a 911 operator in which a man reports having seen a body, which later turned out to be a victim of the Grim Sleeper, getting dumped by the killer, with a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.
In December, 2009 after community pressure including from the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders, the LAPD re-released the original police sketch of the Grim Sleeper, based on the description given to them in 1988 by his only known survivor Enietra Washington: the sketch shows a black male with pockmarks across both cheeks.
In December, 2009 the LAPD also released three age-enhanced composite drawings showing the markedly different faces of three middle aged black males.
On November 3, 2011, it was reported by Reuters that the police now also considered Lonnie David Franklin a suspect in six more slayings. The police are investigating two of the six additional female victims tied to the case as potential victims and were killed during a 14-year lapse between an initial spate of "Grim Sleeper" murders that ended in 1988 and several more that began in 2002. Of the remaining four slayings, two are of women whose bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two are victims who were reported missing in 2005 but whose bodies were never found, police said. Detectives said they linked Franklin to the six additional killings after reviewing hundreds of old case files and seeking the public's help in identifying a collection of 180 pictures of women and girls that were found in his possession.
Arrest.
On July 7, 2010, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that an arrest had been made. District Attorney Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr., a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1989 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the police department. The arrest of Franklin reportedly was due, at least in part, to the use of familial DNA analysis.
Police had been unable to find an exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes associated with the Grim Sleeper and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database. Thus, police searched the database to try to find stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to the profile from the crime-scene evidence to allow police to infer a familial relationship between the person who left the DNA at the crime scenes and the similar profile stored in the database.
Police eventually located similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a felony weapons charge. According to Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link. One Los Angeles undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where the suspect ate. He collected dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA. The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match. Saliva found on victims' breasts was used to obtain a DNA match thus linking Franklin to the murders.
Law enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was never collected. In 2003, he was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. When he was on probation, his DNA was supposed to enter the DNA database. In 2004, voters approved of Proposition 69. The law states that DNA must be collected for all people charged with a crime. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. On July 2005, Franklin was on unsupervised probation. During that time, Franklin's DNA never entered into the system. Probation officers did not collect DNA samples from people that are on unsupervised probation between the periods of November 2004 and August 2005. During that period, the probation department also did not have the resources to immediately collect samples. Officers did not collect samples until August 2005.
Franklin has a criminal record dating back to 1989. He was convicted of two charges of stolen property, one charge of misdemeanor assault, and one charge of battery. He served time for one of the charges of stolen property. He is charged with 10 murders and 1 attempted murder. He is held without bail and could face the death penalty if convicted. He is not charged in the death of an 11th suspected victim, an African American man. There is no DNA evidence in that case.
On December 16, 2010, the Los Angeles Police Department released 180 photos of women found in Franklin's home. Police officials released the images after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. "These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further," said Chief Charlie Beck of the LAPD. In all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.
The images show mainly African American women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude. Police believe Franklin took many of the pictures, which show both conscious and unconscious individuals, and date back up to 30 years. The photos were released in an effort to identify the women with the help of citizens.
Victims.
The known killings began in 1985 in South Los Angeles, California. The Grim Sleeper took a 14 year hiatus after his last murder in 1988 but began murdering again in 2002. His last confirmed murder was in January 2007. All of his victims were found outdoors, a few miles from downtown Los Angeles.
All but one of his victims were black females. One of his suspected victims was a black man. Many of his victims were prostitutes. One witness recalls that Franklin would frequently bring prostitutes into his home. The Grim Sleeper would have sexual contact with victims before strangling or shooting them. He would shoot all of his victims with a .25 caliber gun. Franklin took several photographs of nude prostitutes and kept them in his garage.
These are the Grim Sleeper's known victims in chronological order of attack:
‡ One of the Grim Sleeper's suspected victims, though there is no DNA evidence to support this claim. Being the only suspected male victim, it is believed that Steele either knew about Grim Sleeper's history of murders, or that he was friends with one of the victims.<br>
‡‡ Enietra "Margette" was told to use her middle name as her last name for her protection, but has since come forward as Enietra Margette Washington. Attacked on November 20, 1988, she is the only known survivor.

One or the Other of Us

One or the Other of Us () is a 1974 West German film directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It was Petersen's first theatrical feature film, and was based on the novel of the same name by Horst Bosetzky, published anonymously under his pseudonym -ky. The film is a psychological thriller and focuses on the intense conflict between a university professor and a blackmailer. The film features Klaus Schwarzkopf and Jürgen Prochnow as the two main characters and won two Bundesfilmpreise.
Plot.
Ziegenthals (Jürgen Prochnow), a failed student, makes ends meet as an academic ghost writer. By accident he discovers that the respected professor of sociology, Rüdiger Kolczyk (Klaus Schwarzkopf), has plagiarized his doctoral dissertation by translating the work of an American scholar. He decides to blackmail Kolczyk and to ask for 10,000 DM and additional monthly payments of 1,500 DM. Kolczyk initially agrees, but vows to Ziegenhals that "only one of us will survive". Looking for a way to fight back, Kolczyk tries to gather information about Ziegenhals from Miezi (Elke Sommer), a prostitute and a housemate and friend of Ziegenhals. As Miezi has saved enough money she is thinking of leaving her profession. At the same time her violent ex-boyfriend and former pimp, Kalle Prötzel (Claus Theo Gärtner), has been released from prison; he murders her and steals her savings. During the investigations the police finds out that Miezi had an appointment with Kolczyk and discovers the payments Kolczyk makes to Ziegenhals. Being the main suspects in the murder investigation only increases the hatred between Kolczyk and Ziegenhals, who fight with all means available. Kolczyk, learning that Ziegenhals thinks that Kolczyk wants to kill him, starts playing with Ziegenhals' mind. For example, he sends him a package with an alarm clock, making Ziegenhals think that he has received a mail bomb. Ziegenhals meanwhile befriends Kolczyk's daughter Ginny (Kristina Nel) and makes her his lover. Although this forces the both to have to pretend in public that they are friends, the final disaster cannot be averted.
Production and distribution.
"One or the Other of Us" was Petersen's first theatrical feature film. Petersen had already directed several high profile films for television, including four episodes for the Tatort television series. Klaus Schwarzkopf and Jürgen Prochnow had already played in some of Petersen's Tatort productions. The script was based on the novel of the same name written by Horst Bosetzky, a professor of sociology. At this time the identity of Horst Bosetzky was unknown as due to his position as a professor he published under the pseudonym -ky. "One or the Other of Us" was shot in October and November 1973 in Berlin and Sylt. The film was shot in Eastmancolor on 35 mm in an 1.66:1 aspect ratio.
The film made its theatrical debut on 22 February 1974 at the Gloria-Palast in Berlin. It was first showed on television on 12 February 1982 on ZDF. The film was released on VHS in 1998 and on DVD in 2008 in Germany.
Awards and honors.
"One or the Other of Us" won two Bundesfilmpreise in 1974:
It was also chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 47th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination.

Dock11

Dock11 (Dedicator of cytokinesis), also known as Zizimin2, is a large (~240 kDa) protein involved in intracellular signalling networks. It is a member of the DOCK-D subfamily of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which function as activators of small G proteins. Dock11 activates the small G protein Cdc42. 
Discovery.
Dock11 was identified as a protein which is highly expressed in Germinal center B lymphocytes. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of this protein in the spleen, thymus, bone marrow and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Dock11 is expressed at lower levels in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, C2C12 myoblasts and Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells. Dock11 mRNA has also been detected in the pars intermedia. 
Structure and Function.
Dock11 exhibits the same domain arrangement as other memebrs of the DOCK-D/Zizimin subfamily and shares the highest level of sequence identity with Dock9. It contains a DHR2 domain which mediates GEF activity and a DHR1 domain domain which may interact with membrane phospholipids. It also contains an N-terminal PH domain which may be involved in its recruitment to the plasma membrane. Dock11 binds and activates nucleotide-free Cdc42 via its DHR2 domain and has also been reported to mediate positive feedback on active, GTP-bound Cdc42, although this interaction required a small N-terminal region of Dock11 in addition to the DHR2 domain. Cdc42 in turn regulates signaling pathways that control diverse cellular functions including morphology, migration, endocytosis and cell cycle progression. Gene expression studies have suggested that Dock11 may have a role in the development of pituitary and testicular tumours.

Pike's Opera House

Pike's Opera House, later renamed the Grand Opera House, was a theatre in New York City on the northwest corner of 8th Avenue and 23rd Street, in Chelsea, Manhattan. It was constructed in 1868 on a grand scale, for distiller and entrepreneur Samuel N. Pike (1822 - Dec.7, 1872) of Cincinnati at a cost of a million dollars and survived until 1960 as an RKO movie theater. Public housing was built in its place as part of an urban renewal project.
History.
Pike's Opera House opened on January 9, 1868, on the property of Clement Clarke Moore, whose house "Chelsea" has given its name to the neighborhood; Pike bought up the leases to the land and secured residual right from the Moore heirs. Its frontages were 185 feet and 80 feet. The grand auditorium was seventy feet from the parquet to its dome. In six proscenium boxes and three tiers of seating, it could accommodate 1800, but over 3500 were known to have gained admittance at some popular performances. Pike's Opera House opened with a performance of "La Traviata" which was followed, in quick succession, by seven operettas by Jacques Offenbach in the space of four months, but the theatre succumbed after its first season of competition with the Academy of Music on 14th Street.
Fisk and the Grand Opera House.
Jim Fisk and Jay Gould bought Pike's theater in January 1869 and renamed it the Grand Opera House. Fisk extended the repertory to include more operetta— Offenbach's "La Périchole" had already received its American premiere there, 4 January 1869— and plays, like Sardou's "La Patrie", expressly translated for the theater. Vehicles for his mistress Josie Mansfield are often reported, though her name does not appear in the detailed cast lists in Thomas Allston Brown's "History of the New York Stage"; her house west of the theater on 23rd Street was connected to the theater, it was reported, by a subterranean tunnel.
Fisk's murder.
At the time when Fisk and Gould's failed attempt to corner the market in gold resulted in "Black Friday", September 1869, Fisk barricaded himself in his second-floor premises at the opera house, which served as headquarters for his Erie Railway. When he was shot by his partner, Edward S. Stokes, Fisk's body lay in state in the grand lobby.
Poole and Donnelly.
In 1876, when the authorities began cracking down on theatre fire safety, the Grand Opera House was the only theatre to pass inspection, but a rapid series of managers had been unable to make a financial success, its overhead swallowing profit, "the house was considered, in theatrical parlance, a 'Jonah', and it was almost impossible to find any respectable manager who would take it," the historian of New York's theater recorded in 1903. When John Poole and Thomas Lester Donnelly rented it in 1876, it was with the proviso that "a small percentage of the profits should go to the Erie Railway company". The new management lowered the price of admission and catered to the popular tastes of New York's "west side": "Uncle Tom's Cabin" (in blackface) and Buffalo Bill were among the first season's attractions; theatrical productions were accompanied by "specialty acts".
RKO cinema.
For its conversion to the second RKO 23rd Street Theater, Thomas W. Lamb Associates converted it in modern style. it opened 4 August 1938 with a double bill of "Having a Wonderful Time" and "Sky Giant". It closed for demolition, 15 June 1960 and was gutted by fire 29 June.

Community Safety Accreditation Scheme

Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons.
Powers.
A Chief Constable may grant some or all of the following powers to an Accredited Person as part of a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme:
The powers available to individuals accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme are less than those of a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO). 
The Act also makes it a criminal offence to assault, resist or obstruct an Accredited Person in the execution of their duty, impersonate an Accredited Person, or for an Accredited Person to suggest that they have powers which exceed the powers they actually hold.
Requirements for accreditation.
A person accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme has to be assessed as suitable to exercise their extra powers, trained in their use and capable of carrying them out. The Act also requires that the organisation employing an accredited person must be 'fit and proper' and that they must have a satisfactory complaints procedure in place.
An accredited person remains under the control of their normal employer, and is not managed by the police force. Therefore if an accredited person breaks the law, their employer, rather than the police, could be sued.
The law requires that an accredited person wears a uniform approved by the police when exercising their powers, and that they also carry with them a badge with the logo shown and detailing the powers which they are entitled to exercise.
Examples.
Common examples of people granted powers under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme include security guards, community, parish, park and dog wardens, beach patrols, trading standards officers, and housing association staff.
In the Avon and Somerset Constabulary area, examples of Schemes include:
In the Essex Police area, employees of a number of organisations have been accredited:
In the Hertfordshire Police area, accredited persons include:
In the Nottinghamshire Police force area:
Discussions are also underway to use the Scheme to give marshalls of on-road cycling events the power to stop and direct traffic.
The Railway Safety Accreditation Scheme Regulations 2004 give the Chief Constable of the British Transport Police the power to establish similar schemes on the railway network.
Vehicle and Operator Services Agency employees can be given the power to stop vehicles in order to check for vehicle and driver compliance (mainly goods and passenger carrying vehicles), a right which until 2003 was only held by police officers.
Statistics.
An audit published by the Home Office in August 2008 showed that 21 out of 42 police forces had granted Accredited Person status to a total of 1,406 people in 95 organisations. 19 of the employing organisations were private companies. Essex Police had accredited the most people, 291 individuals in 25 organisations. 
The powers which had been granted most widely (by more than 20 forces) were the power to seize alcohol from a person aged under 18 in a designated place, the power to seize tobacco from a person under 16, and the power to require the name and address of a person acting in an anti-social manner.
In addition, 255 officers of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency had been granted powers to stop lorries for checks on vehicle and driver compliance across England and Wales.
Controversy.
Some commentators have criticised the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme for conferring police-like powers on non-police officers. Amongst the criticism levelled at the Scheme are that it is an "unjustified extension of surveillance powers" and "snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens".
The Police Federation, the organisation representing police officers, also opposes the Scheme, referring to it as "another way of bringing in private policing".

Hazel Kirke

Hazel Kirke is a play in four acts written by American actor and dramatist Steele MacKaye. The play was written between 1878 and 1879 in the town of Dublin, New Hampshire. MacKaye meant it to be expressly for New York City's Madison Square Theatre, which MacKaye had recently renovated and completely remodeled. Originally titled "An Iron Will", the play toured Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington until renovations on the Madison Square Theatre were complete. It premiered there on February 4, 1880 and the original production became immensely successful; it starred actress Effie Ellsler in the title role and ran for 486 consecutive performances before closing May 31, 1881.
Because MacKaye revolutionized the concept of multiple companies performing the same production simultaneously, by 1883 the play had been performed more than two thousand times. By the mid-1910s the play had been produced in England, Australia, Japan, and elsewhere. In 1916 it was adapted into a film starring Pearl White and produced at the Whartons Studio in Ithaca, New York.

Quantum no-deleting theorem

In physics, the no-deleting theorem of quantum information theory is a no-go theorem which states that, in general, given two copies of some arbitrary quantum state, it is impossible to delete one of the copies. It is a time-reversed dual to the no-cloning theorem, which states that arbitrary states cannot be copied. This theorem seems remarkable, because, in many senses, quantum states are fragile; the theorem asserts that, in a particular case, they are also robust.
The no-deleting theorem, together with the no-cloning theorem, underpin the interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of category theory, and, in particular, as a dagger symmetric monoidal category. This formulation, known as categorical quantum mechanics, in turn allows a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to linear logic as the logic of quantum information theory (in exact analogy to classical logic being founded on Cartesian closed categories.)
Overview of quantum deletion.
Suppose that there are two copies of an unknown quantum state. A pertinent question in this context is to ask if it is possible, given two identical copies, to delete one of them using quantum mechanical operations? It turns out that one cannot. The no-deleting theorem is a consequence of linearity of quantum mechanics. Like the no-cloning theorem this has important implications in quantum computing, quantum information theory and quantum mechanics in general.
The process of quantum deleting takes two copies of an arbitrary, unknown 
quantum state at the input port and outputs a blank state along with the original. Mathematically, 
this can be described by:
where formula_2 is the deleting operation which is not necessarily unitary (but a linear operator), formula_3 is the unknown quantum 
state, formula_4 is the blank state, formula_5 is the initial state of 
the deleting machine and formula_6 is the final state of the machine.
It may be noted that classical bits can be copied and deleted, as can qubits in orthogonal states. For example, if we have two identical qubits formula_7 and formula_8 then we can transform to formula_7 and formula_10. In this case we have deleted the second copy. However, it follows from linearity of quantum theory that there is no formula_2 that can perform the deleting operation for any arbitrary state formula_12.
Formal statement of the no-deleting theorem.
Let formula_13 be an unknown quantum state in some Hilbert space (and let other states have their usual meaning). Then, 
there is no linear isometric transformation such that 
formula_14, with the final state of the ancilla being independent of
formula_13.
Proof.
The theorem holds for quantum states in a Hilbert space of any dimension. For simplicity, 
let us consider the deleting transformation for two identical qubits. If two qubits are in orthogonal states, then deletion requires that 
Let formula_18 be the state of an unknown qubit. If we have two copies of an unknown qubit, then by linearity of the deleting transformation we have 
In the above expression, the following transformation has been used: 
However, if we are able to delete a copy, then, at the output port of the deleting machine, the combined state should be 
In general, these states are not identical and hence we can say that the machine fails to delete a copy. If we require that the final output states are same, then we will see that there is only one option:
and
Since final state of the ancilla is normalized for all values of formula_25 it must be true that formula_26 and formula_27 are orthogonal. This means that the quantum information is simply in the final state of the ancilla. One can always obtain the unknown state from the final state of the ancilla using local operation on the ancilla Hilbert space. Thus, linearity of quantum theory does not allow an unknown quantum state to be deleted perfectly.

Sultanate of Damagaram

The Sultanate of Damagaram was a powerful pre-colonial state in what is now southeastern Niger, centered on the city of Zinder.
History.
Rise.
The Sultanate of Damagaram was founded in 1731 (near Myrria, modern Niger) by Muslim Kanouri aristocrats, led by Mallam (r. 1736–1743). Damagaram was technically a vassal state of the decaying Kanem-Bornu Empire, but quickly came to conquer all its fellow vassal states of western Bornu. In the 1830s, the small band of Bornu nobles and retainers conquered the Myrria kingdom, the Sassebaki sultanates (including Zinder). By the 19th century, Damagaram had absorbed 18 Bornu vassal states in the area.
Zinder rose from a small Hausa village to an important center of the Trans-Saharan trade with the moving of the capital of Damagaram there in 1736. The large fortress of the southeast central city (Birini) was built shortly thereafter, and became a major hub for trade south through Kano and east to Bornu. The Tuareg encampments and trade houses of the Hausa town ("Zengou") expanded with this trade.
Apex.
Damagaram had a mixed relationship with the other major regional power, the Sokoto Caliphate to the south. While it provided aid to the animist Hausa led refugee states to its west (in what is now Niger) who were formed from the rump of the states conquered by the Sokoto Caliph, Damagaram also maintained good relations with its southern neighbors. Damagaram sat astride the major trade route linking Tripoli to Kano, one of the more powerful Sokoto sultanates, which provided the economic lifeblood of both states. An east west trade from the Niger River to Bornu also passed through Zinder, making relations with animist neighbors like Maradi or the Gobirwa as profitable, and thus important. Damagaram also covered some of the more productive of Bornu's western salt producing evaporation mines, as well as farms producing Ostrich feathers, highly valued in Europe.
In the mid 19th century, European travelers estimated the state covered some 70,000 square kilometers and had a population over 400,000, mostly Hausa, but also Tuareg, Fula, Kanuri, Arab and Toubou. At the center of the state was the royal family, a Sultan (in Hausa the "Sarkin Damagaram") with many wives (an estimated 300 wives by visitor Heinrich Barth in 1851) and children, and a tradition of direct (to son or brother) succession which reached 26 rulers by 1906. The sultan ruled through the activities of two primary officers the: "Ciroma" (Military commander and prime minister) his heir-apparent the "Yakudima". By the end of the 19th century, Damagaram could field an army of 5,000 cavalry, 30,000 foot soldiers, and a dozen cannons, which they produced in Zinder. Damagaram could also call upon forces of the allied Kel Gres Tuareg who formed communities near Zinder and other parts of the sultanate.
French conquest.
When the French arrived in force in the 1890s, Zinder was the only city of over 10,000 in what is today Niger. Damagaram found itself threatened by well-armed European incursions to the west, and the conquering forces of Rabah to the east and south. In 1898, A French force under Captain Marius Gabriel Cazemajou spent three weeks under the Sultan's protection in Damagaram. Cazemajou had been dispatched to form an alliance against the British with Rabah, and the Sultan's court were alarmed at the prospect of their two most powerful new threats linking up. Cazemajou was murdered by a faction at the court, and the remainder of the French escaped, protected by other factions. In 1899, the reconstituted elements of the ill fated Voulet-Chanoine Mission finally arrived in Damagaram on its way to revenge Cazemajou's death. Meeting on 30 July at the Battle of Tirmini, 10 km from Zinder, the well-armed Senegalese-French troops defeated the Sultan and took Damagaram's capital.
With colonialism, came the loss of some of Damagaram's traditional lands and its most important trade partner to the British in Nigeria.
The French placed the capitol of the new Niger Military Territory there in 1911. In 1926, following fears of Hausa revolts and improving relations with the Djerma of the west, the capitol was transferred back to the village of Niamey.
The brother of Sultan Ahmadou mai Roumji had earlier sided with the French, and was placed on the throne in 1899 as Sultan Ahamadou dan Bassa. Following French intelligence that a rising by Hausa in area were preparing a revolt with the aid of the Sultan, a puppet Sultan was placed in power in 1906, though the royal line was restored in 1923. The Sultanate continues to operate in a ceremonial function into the 21st century.

Wang Libin (; born March 31, 1963 in Shaanxi Province, People's Republic of China) is a former male Chinese basketball player and an active basketball coach.
Wang started his playing career at the age of 14 and was one of the most talented frountcourt players in Asia. 6'8", Wang was not only a powerful inside player with solid footwork and impressive mobility but also a stable long range shooter. Some dubbed him as "Asia's number one centre" during his prime in the 1980s. As a member of the China men's national basketball team he competed at 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and was the flag bearer of the Chinese Olympic Team at the opening ceremony. Due to power struggles within China's basketball authorities, however, he was banned from playing for the national team at the age of 25—shortly after he competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics.
After this forced "retirement", Wang accepted the invitation by a semi-professional club based in Tokyo, Japan to play there. In 1993, he moved to play for the Tera Electronics club in Taiwan and retired there after a decade-long "post-retirement" career as overseas professional player. Owning a restaurant named after his triple-double ("大三元") record in Taipei, Wang later served in ESPN Star Sports as a basketball analyst/commentator in Mandarin Chinese. He also participated in the training of the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team.
In 2004, Wang returned to his hometown, Xi'an, to coach the Shaanxi Kylins, a professional team in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). After two unsuccessful seasons coaching in the CBA, Wang resigned as the Kylins head coach and accepted another commission to coach the Northwestern Polytechnical University varsity team.

Punschkrapfen

Punschkrapfen or Punschkrapferl (punch cake) is a classical Austrian confection of pastry with a fine rum flavor. It is similar to the French pastry, the petit four.
Today, one can find Punschkrapfen in every pastry shop and bakery in Austria.
Composition.
It is a cake filled with cake crumbs, nougat chocolate, apricot jam and then soaked with rum. The cake is cut into 1-1/2 inch square cubes, covered with so called Punschglasur (punch icing), a thick pink rum sugar glazing and often drizzled with chocolate and a cocktail cherry on top. Nowadays, there are also Punschkrapfen in cylindrical form.
History.
It is highly disputed who made the first Punschkrapfen and where it came from. Maybe it was introduced to Vienna in the Middle Ages by the Avars or the Ottoman armies had brought the Punschkrapfen to Vienna (the Second Turkish Siege) or it was invented by an imperial court confectioner.
Trivia.
It is said that the Punschkrapferl renders the typical Austrian character: red outside, brown inside, and always a little smashed.
"Punschkrapferl" is a term often used by Austrians to describe Nazi politicians who joined the Social Democrats after World War II. These politicians are said to be pink (a color associated with socialism) on the outside and brown (a color associated with Nazism) on the inside.
Robert Menasse suggested satirically that the Punschkrapfen should become the Austrian National Symbol.

The album.
Continuing from the first album in the series, part II is equally ambient (as opposed to the more breakbeat led material of their albums and archive series), but features strings, choir sounds and synthesiers, in contrast to the more abstract, sample-based nature of the original album. There are a few low-fi type tracks with subtle beats, similar in sound to tracks from Aphex Twin's ""Selected Ambient Works..."" series. The strings mentioned are Goldenthalian in sound and weave into the electronic ambience. The album features contributions by Max Richter, Daniel Pemberton, Chris Margory, Robert Fripp, Colin Bell and Will White.

John George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau

John George I of Anhalt-Dessau (9 May 1567 – 24 May 1618) was a German prince of the House of Ascania. From 1586 to 1603 he ruled the unified principality of Anhalt jointly with his brothers. After the partition of the principality in 1603, he ruled the principality of Anhalt-Dessau from 1603 to 1618.
John George was much appreciated by his subjects and considered learned abroad, particularly in the subjects of astrology and alchemy. He possessed a remarkable library with over 3000 volumes.
Life.
Early life.
John George was born in Harzgerode on 9 May 1567 as the eldest son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his first wife Agnes, daughter of Wolfgang I, Count of Barby-Mühlingen.
In 1570, the death of John George's last surviving uncle, Bernhard VII, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, left John George's father as sole ruler of all the Anhalt states, which were finally unified for the first time since their first partition in 1252.
Joint prince of Anhalt.
After the death of his father in 1586, John George inherited the unified principality of Anhalt jointly with his younger brother Christian I and his five half-brothers according to the family law of the House of Ascania, which mandated no division of territories among the heirs. Because his half-brothers were still minors at the time of their accession, John George acted as regent.
Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.
In 1603 an agreement was drawn up between John George and his surviving brothers to divide the territories of the principality of Anhalt among them. John George received Anhalt-Dessau, as well as the "Seniorat"; nonetheless, he maintained a regency over all of the newly created principalities until 1606, when his brothers took over the government in their lands. As a ruler, he maintained Reformation policies in his state and vigorously pursued the abolition of the traditional customs and liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church.
The Fruitbearing Society.
On 24 August 1617 at Schloss Hornstein (later Wilhelmsburg Castle) during the funeral of their sister Dorothea Maria, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, John George and his younger brother Louis of Anhalt-Köthen created the Fruitbearing Society. The Prince of Köthen was appointed its first leader. 
Death and succession.
John George died in Dessau on 24 May 1618 at the age of 51. He was succeeded as Prince of Anhalt-Dessau by his eldest surviving son, John Casimir.
Marriages and Issue.
Marriages.
In Hedersleben on 22 February 1588 John George married Dorothea (b. 23 March 1561 – d. Dessau, 23 February 1594), daughter of John Albert VI, Count of Mansfeld-Arnstein. They had five children.
In Heidelberg on 21 February 1595 John George married for a second time to Dorothea (b. Kaiserslautern, 6 January 1581 – d. Sandersleben, 18 September 1631), the only surviving child of John Casimir of Simmern, third son of Frederick III, Elector Palatine. They had eleven children.

1998 Miami Dolphins season

The 1998 Miami Dolphins season was the team's 33rd as a member of the National Football League. The Dolphins improved upon their previous season's output of 9–7, winning ten games. The team qualified for the playoffs for the second straight year.
The "2012 Football Outsiders Almanac" states that the 1998 Dolphins had the single biggest defensive improvement (from the previous season) from 1991–2011.
As with the 1985 Bears, the Dolphins defeated a team (the Broncos) widely tipped a few weeks earlier to beat their unbeaten 1972 season, although this time the Dolphins were not defending their status as the only unbeaten team since the Giants had already beaten the Broncos. Owing to the fact that before the admission of the Texans in 2002, scheduling for NFL games outside a team’s division were subject to much greater influence from table position during the previous season, that game was the first time the Dolphins had opposed the Broncos since that same 1985 season.

<doc id="19093030" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19093030" title="Sieur de Bruno">
Sieur de Bruno

Sieur de Bruno was a French adventurer and diplomat of the 18th century. He took an important role in developing French influence in Burma, and in leading French efforts at supporting the Mons during their conflicts against the Burmese.
The Governor-General of French India Joseph François Dupleix had started to show interest in Burma since 1727, on account of the country's abundance in teak and crude oil. As a result, a French shipyard was established in the city of Syriam in 1729, building ships for Pondicherry. The shipyard was abandoned in 1742 due to the revolt of the Mon.
Envoy in Burma.
A few years later, a Mon envoy visited Dupleix requesting French help in the fight against the Burmese. Dupleix promised men and munitions and dispatched Sieur de Bruno with the objective of developing French influence in the country. He arrived at Pegu in July 1751. Sieur de Bruno reported back that a few hundred French troops would be able to take control of the Irrawaddy Delta, triggering an official request by Dupleix to the French court to obtain the necessary military support. Sieur de Bruno obtained a treaty and formed an alliance between France and the Mons.
Governor Saunders of Madras attempted to counter the French moves in the region by sending a military force to survey the island of Negrais under Captain Thomas Taylor. He also tried to negotiate the cession of Syriam to the British. The Mons firmly opposed these attempts at British encroachment under the counsel of Sieur de Bruno, who had considerable influence at the Mon court and was especially on excellent terms with the Heir Apparent. Saunders finally decided to occupy Negrais forcibly, occupying the island on 26 April 1753.
However, Dupleix's proposals to take control of the Irrawady delta were rejected by the French government, strongly limiting his capacity to intervene there.
Participation in the Burman-Mon conflict.
Following their 1740 revolt against Burmese rule, the Mon sacked Ava in 1752, and overran most of Burma, putting an end to the Toungoo dynasty. Soon however, the Burmese were able to repeal the Mons under the leadership of Alaungpaya. The Mons had to retreat, as Alaunpaya first recovered northern Burma, capturing the city of Ava on January 14, 1754. By February 1755, Central Burma was secured. The Burmese soon threatened the capital of Pegu, as well as the city of Syriam.
In Syriam, Sieur de Bruno was helping the Mons in organizing their defense. Sieur de Bruno was insistently requesting more help from Pondicherry. He acted as a military advisor to the Mons, and French warships participated in fighting against the Burmese in Syriam and Dagon (ancient Rangoon).
Alaungpaya on the other hand was asking the British for guns and ammunitions. Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756. Sieur de Bruno and the other French with him were captured and tortured. Two French ships, "Fleury" and "Galathée", with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya, when Alaungpaya forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed and the 200 sailors forced to join the Burmese army Sieur de Bruno was roasted to death. From the two ships, Alaugpaya managed to put his hands on 35 ships guns (24 pounders), five field guns, 1300 muskets, and a large quantity of ammunitions. France was precluded from further intervention in Burma, with the advent of the Seven Years' War in Europe (1756–1763).
The French troops with their guns and muskets were incorporated in the Burmese army as gunners, and played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They were treated well and received Burmese wives. They became an elite corps, which was to play an important role in the Burmese battles against the Siamese and the Manchus. One of them, the Chevalier Milard, was ultimately nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty.
When they reached old age, the French soldiers were able to retire in Shwebo villages, with the spiritual support of a priest. To this day, some Catholic villages are still extant in the area where an awareness of some European ancestry remains.

Kera Tamara () was the daughter of the Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander and his second wife Sarah-Theodora. Kera Tamara was a sister of Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir. She was born in the 1340s and originates from the Shishman dynasty.
The first husband of Kera Tamara was despot Constantine. According to one theory he was the despot of Velbazhd Constantine Dragash whose daughter Helena Dragash married the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II and became mother of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI. However, that theory has been dismissed by the historians because in 1371 Kera Tamara was already a widow while Constantine Dragash died in 1395. Therefore, despot Constantine who was depicted in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander next to the Bulgarian princess was another man.
As early as 1371 when Ivan Alexander died and Ivan Shishman inherited the throne, in the capital Tarnovo arrived ambassadors from the Ottoman Sultan Murad I to arrange his relations with the new Emperor of Bulgaria. The Sultan who was obviously familiar with the beauty of Kera Tamara and the fact that she was a widow demanded her to become his wife as a guarantee for the peace between the two counties. Ivan Shishman managed to divert his demand and prolonged his decision for seven years. On that occasion an anonymous Bulgarian chronicle from the 15th century records:
However, in 1378 when his attempts to stop the Turks failed, Ivan Shishman reluctantly sent Kera Tamara in the harem of the Sultan in the Ottoman capital Bursa. She kept her Christian faith. In the Boril Synadnik her fate was praised as a self-sacrifice:
The grave of Kera Tamara remains today in Bursa in the family tomb of the Ottoman dynasty next to the grave of Murad I and the visitor know it as the place of "the Bulgarian Empress Maria". According to Kera Tamara's will, her tomb remained uncovered and barley was sowed on her grave.

Todd Palin

Todd Mitchell Palin (born September 6, 1964) is an American oil field production operator, commercial fisherman and champion snowmobile racer, winning the Tesoro Iron Dog race four times. He is also the husband of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice-presidential nominee of the Republican Party.
Early life and education.
Palin was born and raised in Dillingham, Alaska to James F. "Jim" and Blanche Palin (née Roberts).
In 1982, Palin graduated from Wasilla High School, which is the same alma mater of his wife and their eldest two children, son Track and daughter Bristol. He has taken some college courses but does not have a degree.
Career.
Palin was a union member and belonged to the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (United Steelworkers).
For eighteen years, he worked for BP in the North Slope oil fields of Alaska. In 2007, in order to avoid a conflict of interest that related to his wife's position as governor, he took a leave from his job as production supervisor, when his employer became involved in natural gas pipeline negotiations with his wife's administration. Seven months later, because the family needed more income, Todd returned to BP. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest, this time, he accepted a non-management position as a production operator. He resigned from his job on September 18, 2009, with the stated reason as a desire to spend more time with his family.
He is also a commercial salmon fisherman at Bristol Bay on the Nushugak River.
Public life.
Voter registration.
Palin first registered to vote in 1989. From October 1995 through July 2002, except for a few months in 2000, he was registered to vote as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party. In late August 2008, "The Politico" reported that Palin was registered to vote as an independent (undeclared), and had never registered as a Republican. In her memoir, ', Sarah Palin confirms this, writing, "My husband... isn't registered with any party, for sound reasons, having been an eyewitness to the idiosyncrasies of party machines." Sarah Palin reaffirmed that Todd is not a registered Republican again in her February 6, 2010, keynote address to the national Tea Party convention in Nashville, Tennessee.
Husband of the Governor of Alaska.
Palin was First Gentleman (or "First Dude," as he was often nicknamed) for two and a half years. Early on in that role, he encouraged young Alaskans who could not afford college to consider jobs in the oil and gas industry as an effective training ground, and advised the Governor on workforce development issues for the natural gas pipeline she supported.
In February 2010, the state of Alaska released to msnbc.com reporter Bill Dedman about 1,200 e-mails, which totalled 3,000 pages, that Palin exchanged with state officials. Almost 250 additional ones were withheld by the state, under a claim that executive privilege extends to Palin as an unpaid adviser to the government. Gregg Erickson, columnist for the "Anchorage Daily News", said, in September 2008, that Palin "obviously plays an important role… I've seen him in the governor's office and I know that she's conducted interviews in the governor's office with him present." The emails showed Palin discussing a wide range of activities: potential board appointees, constituent complaints, use of the state jet, oil and gas production, marine regulation, gas pipeline bids, wildfires, native Alaskan issues, the state effort to save the Matanuska Maid dairy, budget planning, potential budget vetoes, oil shale leasing, "strategy for responding to media allegations," staffing at the mansion, pier diem payments to the governor for travel, "strategy for responding to questions about pregnancy," potential cuts to the governor's staff, "confidentiality issues," Bureau of Land Management land transfers and trespass issues and requests to the U.S. transportation secretary.
Other.
As of late 2009, Palin was a community volunteer who worked in youth sports, coached hockey and basketball.
He was a judge in the 2008 Miss Alaska pageant.
In August 2012, Palin became a contestant on the NBC celebrity reality competition series "Stars Earn Stripes".
Champion snowmobile racer.
Palin is a four-time champion of the Tesoro Iron Dog, the world's longest snowmobile race, which traces the path of the Iditarod race with an extra journey of several hundred miles to Fairbanks added.
Palin has competed in the Tesoro every year since 1993. His racing teammate is Scott Davis, with whom he won in 2007. He has previously raced with Dusty Van Meter in the race, and they were co-champions in 2000 and 2002. In 1995, Palin partnered with Dwayne Drake for his first win.
In 2008, from defending his Tesoro Iron Dog championship, he was injured and broke his arm when he was thrown 70 feet from his machine. He was sent to the hospital but managed to finish in fourth place.
Personal life.
On August 29, 1988, Palin eloped with his high school girlfriend, Sarah Heath. The Palins have five children: Track Charles James (b. April 1989), who has enlisted in the United States Army and deployed to Iraq on September 11, 2008; Bristol Sheeran Marie (b. October 1990); Willow Bianca Faye (b. 1994); Piper Indy Grace (b. 2001); and Trig Paxson Van (b. April 2008), who has Down syndrome; and two grandchildren: Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston, born in 2008 in Palmer, Alaska, to Bristol and Levi Johnston and Kyla Grace Palin, who was born to son Track and his wife, Britta, in 2011.
Palin fishes and holds a Private Pilot Certificate. He also owns his own aircraft, a Piper PA-18 Super Cub.
Palin's stepmother, Faye Palin, ran unsuccessfully in 2002 for the position of Mayor for Wasilla, Alaska, to succeed Palin's wife, Sarah, who was term-limited. Faye Palin, who is pro-choice and a registered Democrat, lost to Dianne M. Keller, a candidate endorsed by Sarah Palin.
In 2012 film "Game Change", Todd is portrayed by actor David Barry Gray.
Public Safety Commissioner controversy.
Todd Palin's name has appeared in news reports regarding the firing of Commissioner Walt Monegan and the actions of Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten. At one point, Todd Palin brought information prepared by himself and a private investigator to Monegan.
On September 12, 2008, the Alaska Legislature subpoenaed Palin to testify on his role in the controversy. On September 18, the McCain/Palin campaign announced that Todd Palin would refuse to testify because he does not believe the investigation is legitimate. State senator Bill Wielechowski said that the witnesses could not be punished for disobeying the subpoenas until the full legislature comes into session, then scheduled to be in January 2009.
On October 10, 2008, Palin was cited in special investigator Stephen Branchflower's report to the Legislative Council. One of Branchflower's four main findings was that Governor Palin violated Alaska's Ethics Act when she "wrongfully permitted Todd Palin to use the governor's office...to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired." Blanchflower also states: "Todd Palin is not an employee of the (Alaska) executive branch, so his conduct is not a violation of (the Ethics Act)." and " . . . I make no finding as to Mr. Palin's conduct.".

New York (film)

New York is a 2009 Bollywood directed by Kabir Khan, produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films, and screenplay by Sandeep Srivastava. Visual effects are by Visual Computing Labs, Tata Elxsi Ltd. It stars John Abraham, Katrina Kaif, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Irrfan Khan. "New York" begins in 1999, ends in 2008, and tells the story of three students studying at the fictional New York State University whose lives are changed by 9/11 and its aftermath.
Plot.
"New York" begins in the United States in 2008, with the arrest by the FBI of Omar Aijaz (Neil Nitin Mukesh) after guns were found in the trunk of a taxi cab he owned. Omar, a young Muslim man originally from Delhi, is then taken into custody and interrogated by FBI Agent Roshan (Irrfan Khan) (also a Muslim man originally from South Asia who has been living in the United States for twenty years). Omar then discovers that he was set up by the FBI in order to force him to spy on a former college friend, Samir Shaikh (John Abraham), whom he hasn't seen in seven years and who the FBI believes is a terrorist. In the process, Omar discovers that Sam has married Maya (Katrina Kaif) (whom Omar had a crush on in university and another friend) and finds out that Samir and Maya have a young son, Danyal (Aidan Wagner).
Roshan orders Omar to tell him everything he knows about Samir. The film then flashes back to September 1999, when Omar begins his studies at (the fictional) New York State University. He is befriended by his international student counselor Maya and learns that though she was born and raised in New York, she is fluent in Hindi because of her mother's interest in Bollywood films. Omar also meets Sam, another Indian American who is also Muslim and fluent in Hindi due to the fact that his father is a professor of Indian studies. Over the next two years, all three become inseparable friends and gradually Omar falls in love with Maya. When Omar realises that she loves Sam, however, he distances himself from them both. Their carefree days finally end with the onset of 9/11.
After finishing his story, Omar agrees to help Roshan (rather reluctantly), if only to prove that both he and Sam are innocent. He reunites with Maya and Sam and stays in their house, all the while spying for the FBI. Omar learns that Maya is a civil rights activist who is helping one of Sam's employees, Zilgai (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) overcome his experience as a former 9/11 detainee. Zilgai was eventually released due to lack of evidence and has been having difficulty adjusting back to "normal" life.
As time progresses, Omar feels satisfied that he can find nothing to warrant the FBI's suspicions and is ready to leave when a series of events forces him to reconsider. In the process, Omar learns from Sam that ten days after 9/11, Sam was arrested and detained for a period of nine months as a suspected terrorist, a charge which everyone, including the FBI and Roshan, now agree was incorrect. Though he was eventually released due to lack of evidence, the impact of being detained and tortured permanently changed Sam in ways which are difficult for those surrounding him to understand, leaving him with feelings of deep resentment towards the FBI. Omar thus finds that Sam ultimately resorted to plans for terrorism as a means of revenge.
In addition, Maya is unable to help Zilgai resolve the trauma of being a detainee. After a routine traffic stop escalates and an NYPD police officer gives Maya a very rough full-body search, Zilgai becomes agitated. He drops Maya at her home and eventually kills the police officer the same night. After being declared a fugitive, Zilgai leads the police on a long chase ultimately ending in his suicide.
The climax of the film rests upon the attempts of Maya, Omar, and Roshan to prevent Sam from committing an act of terrorism by telling him that if he perpetuates towards terrorism, others will suffer as he has. Finally convinced, Sam surrenders and aborts his attempt to bomb the FBI building. However, the moment he drops his cell-phone (which was originally intended as a detonator for the bomb) he is shot and killed by FBI snipers. The cell phone falls benign to the ground without activating anything. Maya, who was running toward Sam, is also killed by stray gunfire and Omar, bereft of speech, breaks down. Six months later, he is later comforted by Roshan who explains to him that; everybody was right in their place, but the timing was wrong. As for Sam, the path he chose killed him. Everybody has moved on after 9/11, as its high time. Omar has adopted Danyal, and Roshan has received commendation for aiding in the anti-terrorism cause. They reconcile each other. The film ends with all three of them going out for pasta and a side note describing the after effects of 9/11.
Themes.
"New York" explores the aftermath of 9/11. In a June 2009 interview with the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), director Kabir Khan argued that the film "is based on part of the political canvas of 9/11, but it speaks of prejudices after the great human tragedy. It is a definite and very relevant subject about post-9/11 prejudices that have increased after the attacks [...] We have in fact divided time in a pre- and post-9/11 world in the film to highlight its obvious repercussions in times to come. The repercussions of the attacks are still very strongly felt globally and will continue to do so." Khan continued to state that the film had the full support of the "New York Film Commission," " as it is not an anti-something film. It is a very balanced story and not a jingoistic film." In a separate interview with IANS, actor John Abraham argued that, "in its own strange way, "New York" begins where "Khuda Ke Liye" ended. That’s the interesting part of the film [...] Each director has his own way of interpreting and researching the plight of legal detainees." Abraham continued by suggesting that this is why Khan and Shoaib Mansoor offer different interpretations of these events in their respective films.The plot of this movie is similar to the season 1 and episode 21 of TV series lost. "New York" was the first Indian film which focused on this theme, later followed by Karan Johar's "My Name is Khan", starring Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, "Kurbaan", starring Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor and "Vishwaroopam", starring Kamal Hassan and Andrea Jeremiah.
Production.
Production began in September 2008 and filming lasted over a period of 100 days. Most of the shoot took place in New York although some of the scenes which took place in New York were actually shot in Philadelphia. "New York" is the first Hindi film to have a production schedule there. In preparation for his role as an American Muslim of Indian origin, Abraham studied the Quran (he had likewise studied Sanskrit and learned to play the flute for his role in "Water"). Khan had to submit his script for approval from U.S. authorities before making the film. He stated: "We had to submit the script to seek permission to shoot in Guantanamo as well as in the States and we got their green signal to go ahead very easily. The film may be about 9/11 and what happens post it, but they did not object to our theme and did not even raise any questions. The US officials were very cooperative and we shot for around three days at this high-profile prison."
Release.
Box-office.
According to NASDAQ, "New York" grossed a record Rs 350 million during its first three days in India, with theatres at their highest occupancy since January at 80–85%. During its first week, it ranked number one in the box office in India and grossed Rs 618.9 million worldwide, and was declared a hit. Its total gross in India after a 6-week run was Rs .
"New York"'s opening weekend was highly successful in India and the Middle East. It also proved popular in Australia and did well in the UK and U.S. Of its opening in India, Khan commented: "I always believed that "New York" will be a word of mouth film which would open on a decent note and then show an increase in business with every passing day. When I was told by friends and people from industry that it had opened to a houseful response in the very first show at so many places across the country, even I was taken aback." 
It is the sixth highest grossing film of 2009. It grossed Rs. .
Critical reception.
"New York" was well received by a number of critics. Subhash K. Jha gave "New York" a rave review arguing that "New York" "is what cinema in contemporary times should be, must be, though it seldom is" and designates it "an important film" which "cares about the prejudices that have taken over the world. Jha also states that, "stereotypical portrayals of the cultural diaspora are fortunately rare in this piece of contemporary art which has plenty of heart, a heart that never overflows in an embarrassing torrent of emotions." Devansh Patel, film critic for London's "Hounslow Chronicle," gave "New York" five out of five stars stating that it is, "the most thought provoking movie Yash Raj Films has ever come up with." Nikhat Kazmi of the "Times of India" gave it four out of four stars, describing "New York" as, "an extremely taut and highly emotive piece of political drama [...] topical, meaningful, and entertaining, all at the same time." Taran Adarsh of "Bollywood Hungama" gave it four out of five stars arguing that "New York" is "one of the finest films produced by this premier production house, Yash Raj [...] the screenplay is its biggest star, without a doubt. Given the fact that "New York" isn't one of those routine masala fares, Kabir has injected songs only when required. Cinematography is striking." Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film "a must watch" and gave it four out of four stars. He states: "When a hardcore commercial flick gets a standing ovation and a huge round of applause at the end of the show, you know that there is something definitely right that the director has done. In this regard, Kabir Khan can take a bow because he has done exceedingly well in making a film that is not frivolous, has a message and still carries enough commercial ingredients to reach out to masses as well as classes." Mayank Shekhar of the "Hindustan Times" argues that comparing "New York" "to Mark Pellington’s "Arlington Road" would be grossly unfair. If anything, this is a much better movie than that 1999, part-spooky conspiracy theory. The central theme itself is closer to Shoaib Mansoor’s "Khuda Kay Liye" (2007), and you can sense how the superior execution here makes all the filmmaking difference." Additionally, Shekhar describes "New York" in NDTV as, "an A-list film that gets a straight A." Sandhya Iyer of the "Sakaal Times" gave the film three and a half out of four stars arguing that ""New York" manages to be gripping, thanks to an excellent screenplay. Most importantly, the story has the right mix of realism and drama – one that Kabir Khan unfolds with quiet confidence." Mathures Paul of "The Statesman" states: "Finally, here’s a film that entertains and makes viewers think." 
"New York" received mixed reviews from other critics. Rachel Saltz of "The New York Times" states: "While Mr. Khan’s depictions of American life occasionally seem silly and the plot has some crater-size holes, "New York" is continually fascinating. It benefits from the performance of Irrfan Khan, who adds layers of complexity to his character." Lisa Tsering of the "Hollywood Reporter" argues that "although the film is a routine thriller with few surprises, it deserves attention because its topic, even eight years after Sept. 11, is one that many South Asian Americans still take very seriously." John Anderson of "Variety" suggests that "New York" has "a certain amount of silliness early on" but is "a courageous movie in many ways, and a surprising one."Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film two out of five stars and states: ""New York" has its heart in the right place and its intentions are entirely honorable [...] but because the film is constructed from such a sloppy script, that point is lost under all the creative liberties and convenient short-cuts that the screenplay takes."
New York is rated 35/100 on Metacritic, citing generally unfavorable reviews. 
High profile screenings.
"New York" was the opening film for the 33rd Cairo International Film Festival, 10 November 2009. The film's director, Kabir Khan, was in attendance and addressed the audience at the end of its screening. "New York" was also screened at the Pusan International Film Festival in October 2009. Yash Chopra of "New York's" Yash Raj Films won the Asian Filmmaker of the Year award.
Soundtrack.
Released on 10 June 2009, the soundtrack for "New York" has composed by Pritam, Julius Packiam and Pankaj Awasthi. Lyrics are penned by Sandeep Shrivastava and Junaid Wasi.
Home video.
The DVD for "New York" was released on 8 August 2009. Joginder Tuteja of "Bollywood Hungama" gave the DVD four out of five stars. The DVD includes (but is not limited to) 2.5 hours of special features such as: "Making of the Film," "Deleted Scenes," "New York Special – Zoom TV,"
"The New Yorkers – CNN-IBN," and a number of music videos.

Kyneburga, Kyneswide and Tibba

Saints Kyneburga, Kyneswide and Tibba were female members of the Mercian royal family in 7th century England.
Lives.
Kyneburga and Kynewide.
Kyneburga (d. c. 680) (also called Cyneburh; the name being also rendered as "Kinborough" and in occasional use as a Christian name ) and Kyneswide (Cyneswitha) were sisters, the daughters of King Penda of Mercia (who remained true to the Anglo-Saxon religion). She was eldest daughter of King Penda of Mercia. Although her father was an opponent of Christianity, She and all her siblings converted. 
Bede wrote that Penda tolerated the preaching of Christianity in Mercia itself, despite his own beliefs:
This was begun two years before the death of King Penda. Their mother was Queen Cyneswide. Tibba is believed to have been a relative.
Kyneburga married Alhfrith of Deira, co-regent of Northumbria (who attended the Synod of Whitby in 664), but later founded an abbey for both monks and nuns in Castor, in the Soke of Peterborough. She became the first abbess and was later joined by Kyneswide and Tibba. Kyneswide succeeded Kyneburga as abbess and she was later succeeded by Tibba. She was buried in her church, but the remains of Kyneburga and Kyneswide were translated, before 972, to Peterborough Abbey, now Peterborough Cathedral.
She had been one of the signatories, together with her brother Wulfhere, of the founding charter of Burh Abbey, dated 664, per William Dugdale's "Monasticon". (Burh Abbey was later dedicated to St Peter, becoming "Peterborough"). She was much esteemed as a saint by the monks of Peterborough, and features as one of the saints remembered annually on 6 March in several ancient Peterborough-produced Kalendars, (a section of a psalter).
She died on 15 September AD 680 and was buried at Castor, Cambridgeshire where she soon became revered as a saint. In in 963 her body was moved to Peterborough, with those of her sister, Cuneswitha, and their kins woman, Tibba. Her remains were transferred to Thorney some time latter. Her feast day is celebrated on the 6th March.
She is remembered in a chapel at Peterborough Cathedral, the 12th century St. Kyneburga parish church in Castor, Cambridgeshire, Lady Conyburrow’s Way (a ridge in a field near Castor), Kimberwell spring, Bedfordshire, the villages of Kimberley, Norfolk and West Yorkshire.
It should be noted that there was another lady by the name of Kyneburg, the wife of Oswald of Northumbria.
Tibba.
Tibba, patron saint of falconers, is believed to have lived in Ryhall, Rutland, in the 7th century. She was buried there, but in the 11th century her relics were translated to Peterborough Abbey, by Abbot Ælfsige (1006–1042). According to legend, St Tibba was a niece of King Penda. The remains of a small hermitage associated with the saint can be seen on the west side of the north aisle of Ryhall church.
A 19th-century book refers to a holy well at Ryhall dedicated to Saint Tibba, though the location cannot now be identified, and there is similar doubt about the location of a well said to have been dedicated to Tibba's alleged relative, St Ebba.
Burial.
Originally buried at Castor, Cambridgeshire their relics were bought in the 10th century by Peterborough Abbey under the direction of "Abbot Aelfsi of Peterborough", as part of a policy of relic acquisition by the Abbey. However, many of the numerous relics at the abbey were lost or destroyed in the reformation.

Two and a Half Men (season 5)

The fifth season of "Two and a Half Men" originally aired on CBS from September 24, 2007, to May 19, 2008. A total of only 19 episodes were aired due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Unlike the previous seasons, the Season 5 DVD came without a gag reel.

Ye Olde Salutation Inn

Ye Olde Salutation Inn is a public house dating from around 1240 that lays claim (along with Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn and The Bell Inn) to being the oldest in Nottingham.
History.
The current building was constructed as a workshop for a tanner with living accommodation above in 1240 on the site of an old alehouse known as "The Archangel Gabriel Salutes the Virgin Mary". The name led local historian J. Holland Walker to speculate a connection with the local Carmelite monastery but no documentary has been found to support this.
Borough records from 1440 record a private dwelling belonging to John Alastre on the site.
During the English Civil War (1642–1646) both factions established recruiting rooms in the Inn. Following the Puritan victory the authorities objected to the religious implications of the sign and the Inn was renamed "Soldier and Citizen". The original name was restored along with the Monarchy in 1660.
An investigation by the Thoroton Excavation Society in 1937 dated the caves to the 9th century and concluded that they were part of a Saxon farm later used for servants accommodation and brewing.
Extensions to the pub in 1966 included the hanging of a wrought iron hand outside that was stolen that same night.
The Inn was featured along with its rivals Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn and The Bell Inn in a 1998 episode of the Channel 4 TV series History Hunters which used records, building architecture and timbers, and local legends to decide which was truly the oldest.

<doc id="19093485" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19093485" title="SS Kentuckian">
SS Kentuckian

SS "Kentuckian" was a cargo ship built in 1910 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I she was known as USAT "Kentuckian" in service for the United States Army and USS "Kentuckian" (ID-1544) in service for the United States Navy. After her Navy career, she reverted to her original name of SS "Kentuckian".
She was built by the Maryland Steel Company as first of three ships ordered by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. In World War I, USAT "Kentuckian" carried cargo and animals to France under charter to the U.S. Army. When transferred to the U.S. Navy in December 1918, a month after the Armistice, USS "Kentuckian" was converted to a troop transport and returned almost 8,900 American troops from France. Returned to American-Hawaiian in 1919, "Kentuckian" resumed inter-coastal cargo service.
Shortly before World War II, "Kentuckian" was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and sailed between Trinidad and African ports, between New York and Caribbean ports, and in transatlantic convoys through mid 1944. In mid-July 1944, the ship was scuttled as part of the breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.
Design and construction.
In the second quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—"Kentuckian", "Georgian", and "Honolulan". The contract for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of "Kentuckian", including financing costs, was $58.33 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $579,000.
"Kentuckian" (Maryland Steel yard no. 104) was the first ship built under the contract. She was launched on 19 March 1910, by Miss Nancy Johnson, the daughter of U.S. Representative Ben Johnson (D-KY), who christened the ship with sparkling spring water from the Kentucky farms of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. The completed ship, delivered to American-Hawaiian on 1 June, was , and was in length (between perpendiculars) and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of . "Kentuckian" had a single quadruple-expansion steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of .
Early career.
When "Kentuckian" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Kentuckian" sailed in this service but it is not clear from sources whether on the east or west side of North America.
After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.
In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Kentuckian", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again. "Kentuckian"s exact movements from this time through early 1918 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.
World War I.
At some point after the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army chartered "Kentuckian" for transporting animals to Europe in support of the American Expeditionary Force. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of "Kentuckian", for other ships this typically meant that any passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.
Details about "Kentuckian"s first animal transport journey are not known, but her second trip began 14 March 1918 when she sailed from Newport News, Virginia, with 848 animals for Saint-Nazaire, where she unloaded all but the four animals that had died or were destroyed during the voyage. On 24 April, during a convoy crossing in Army service, Naval Armed Guardsmen on "Kentuckian" sighted a torpedo heading towards the second ship behind her in the column. Opening fire on the torpedo, the gun crew claimed the hit that caused the torpedo to explode short of its intended target. Further details of "Kentuckian"s Army service are not available.
With the signing of the Armistice on 11 November, the fighting came to an end and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. To that end, "Kentuckian" was acquired by the United States Navy on 16 December, and commissioned on 28 January 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Carrol E. Higgins, NAR, in command. Before she could begin returning troops, though, "Kentuckian" had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications "Kentuckian" underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Similar modifications on a fellow American-Hawaiian cargo ship, the two-years-younger , took three months, but it is not known how long "Kentuckian"s refit took.
"Kentuckian" departed New York for her first trooping voyage on 2 March, picking up nearly 2,000 soldiers at Saint-Nazaire—among them some 1,500 men of the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 91st Infantry Division, and a number from the U.S. 33rd Infantry Division—before returning to New York on 1 April. Her arrival on another trooping run in June returned 1,860 men, including over 1,500 members of the 345th Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division. An officer of that unit brought back a black police dog named Pat, who, purportedly, had been the personal dog of Germany's Crown Prince Wilhelm. Another trip in July returned another 1,852 men from Saint-Nazaire. In all, "Kentuckian" made a total of five trooping runs from France, bringing back 8,895 men by the time she completed her last trip on 31 August at Norfolk, Virginia. She was decommissioned on 15 September and returned to American-Hawaiian the same day.
Interwar years.
"Kentuckian" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Kentuckian" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, "Kentuckian" was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker "Los Alamos" near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. "Kentuckian" had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in "Kentuckian"s number two cargo hold, which resulted in the delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. "Kentuckian" made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.
For the most part, "Kentuckian" primarily carried general cargoes whose contents were not noteworthy. One exception occurred in July 1929, when "The New York Times" reported that "Kentuckian" was carrying, "Pirate", an R-class racing yacht to races at Larchmont and Marblehead. The newspaper reported that "Pirate" was the first West Coast designed and built yacht to race in the East.
Unlike , a fellow American-Hawaiian ship that was plagued with labor difficulties, "Kentuckian" seems to have escaped much of the maritime labor turmoil of the mid-1930s. One incident was reported by the "Los Angeles Times" in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of "Kentuckian"s crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.
World War II.
Shortly before the United States entered World War II, "Kentuckian" was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), but continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. On 19 November 1941, "Kentuckian" sailed from New York for Durban, where she arrived on 21 December. "Kentuckian" spent the next two months sailing between ports in South Africa and Mozambique, calling at Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and East London in the former, and Lourenco Marques, and Beira in the latter, before heading to Trinidad from Cape Town on 28 February 1942. Arriving at Trinidad three weeks later, she made her way up to Boston by early April, before putting in at New York for about six weeks. Sailing from New York in late May, "Kentuckian" joined a southbound Hampton Roads, Virginia – Key West, Florida convoy. She left the convoy before Key West and headed back across the Atlantic to Cape Town, where she arrived on 7 July. "Kentuckian" spent the next month sailing between Cape Town, East London, and Durban. "Kentuckian" concluded her second trip to Africa when she sailed for South America on 1 August. 
After a three-week crossing of the South Atlantic, "Kentuckian" arrived at Paramaribo on 22 August, where she took on a load of bauxite and made her way to New York, where she docked on 20 September. The cargo ship slowly made her way south, calling at Charleston, Key West, and Guantánamo Bay along her way to Trinidad, where she arrived on 5 November. Sailing 11 November, "Kentuckian" began her third and final trip to Africa. She arrived at Freetown on 25 November and called at Bathurst and Takoradi over the next two months before returning to Trinidad on 31 January 1943. Sailing from Trinidad on 4 February, she called at Guantánamo Bay and Baltimore on her way to New York, where, arriving in late March, she prepared to begin transatlantic convoy sailings to the United Kingdom.
On 1 April, "Kentuckian", loaded with grain and general cargo, departed as a part of Convoy HX-232, the 232nd New York – Halifax – Liverpool convoy. Developing some unreported problem, she returned to New York on 3 April. The problem must have been minor, because she sailed as part of Convoy HX-233 three days later. This convoy was attacked by no fewer than eight German submarines, which resulted in the loss of only one ship, the British cargo ship "Fort Rampart", and the sinking of "U-175" by convoy escorts. There is no evidence that "Kentuckian" played any direct part in the sinking of the German submarine, but, nevertheless, members of her Naval Armed Guard were awarded a battle star for actions in the convoy from 16–18 April. "Kentuckian" arrived at Liverpool on 21 April. Over the next ten months, "Kentuckian" made nine more convoy crossings between the UK—where she called at Liverpool, Swansea, Milford Haven, Methil, Loch Ewe, Immingham, and Belfast Lough—and New York. She ended her tenth North Atlantic crossing when she arrived at New York on 16 February 1944.
Sailing from New York on 26 February, "Kentuckian" made two circuits between that port and the Caribbean, calling at Nuevitas, Cuba, and Manatí, Puerto Rico, and making stops at Key West and Philadelphia along the way, before putting in at New York on 15 April. "Kentuckian" departed the United States for the final time on 19 May and headed for Milford Haven. After arriving there on 3 June, the cargo ship arrived at Barry via Plymouth, Belfast Lough, and Falmouth, on 27 June. Departing Barry on 8 July as a part of Convoy EBC-35, "Kentuckian" arrived at Arromanches on 10 July and was scuttled there as part of a breakwater protecting the mulberry harbor constructed there in support of the Normandy invasion.
In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for "Kentuckian" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled (like "Kentuckian"), or were to be retained by the government.

Guillermo Vargas Aignasse

Guillermo Vargas Aignasse (born in 1943, disappeared 1976) was an Argentine Peronist politician, serving as a provincial Senator in Tucumán Province from 1973 until his disappearance in 1976. In 2008, two former generals were jailed for life for his disappearance.
Vargas Aignasse was born and raised in Andalgalá, Catamarca Province, and was a physicist by profession, teaching in the discipline until his election to the Provincial Senate of Tucumán in 1973. He was elected on the Frejuli ticket that brought Peronists back to power, and was associated with the left-wing faction of Peronism, having belonged to the center-left FANE (National Student Associations Front). Amid the worst climate of violence in the country, Tucumán Province was placed under martial law in January 1975, after which Operativo Independencia, a counterinsurgency offensive, was launched by presidential order. The installation of General Antonio Domingo Bussi as its commander in December coincided with Vargas Aignasse's investigation of provincial Police Chief Colonel Antonio Arrechea on reports of drug trafficking.
The 1976 military coup, on March 24, resulted in Vargas Aignasse's arrest by provincial police, who had their detainee turn in all documentation regarding the Arrechea case. Days later, his brother, Rodolfo, was allowed to see the prisoner from above a patio, following which, per police testimony, he was released from prison on 5 April and 'kidnapped by parties unknown' while being taken home in an official car. He was later reportedly seen alive and in pain by a number of witnesses, though his wheareabouts afterwards remained unknown. 
Unable to do so until after the return of democracy in 1983, Rodolfo Vargas Aignasse filed a missing persons case on February 6, 1984. Ultimately, and despite the unwillingness of numerous witnesses to testify, Bussi was arrested for ordering Vargas Aignasse's abduction, on October 15, 2003. During the trial that formally began on July 2008, former trade union leader Juan Antonio Palavecino testified that he had seen Vargas Aignasse in Tucumán police headquarters showing signs of torture on April 6, 1976, one day after his supposed kidnapping, and contrary to the official story. Bussi and former General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez were found guilty of Vargas Aignasse's forced disappearance and sentenced to life imprisonment on August 28. 
Rodolfo Vargas Aignasse was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1987, and the disappeared lawmaker's son, Gerónimo Vargas Aignasse, is currently a member of the Chamber.

Digital Promise

Digital Promise, also known as the National Center for Research in Advanced Information and Digital Technologies, is a non-profit organization originated by the U.S. Congress as part of the 2008 re-authorization of the Higher Education Act. Its mission is to help bridge the digital divide in education, especially in areas of new media and Internet use. 
History.
More than a decade ago, the Carnegie Corporation of New York joined with the Century Foundation to launch the Digital Promise Project, an initiative to recommend policies that could harness breakthrough technologies to advance the public good.
At the request of Congress, the Digital Promise Project, in partnership with the Federation of American Scientists, developed a road map for transforming teaching and learning with technology. This road map was the basis for Section 802 of the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, authorizing the National Center for Research in Advanced Information and Digital Technologies, also known as Digital Promise.
Digital Promise is an independent, bipartisan nonprofit, signed into law by President George W. Bush and launched in September 2011 by President Barack Obama. Initial board members were appointed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, whose department provided start-up funds and support. 
Mission.
Digital Promise is an independent, bipartisan nonprofit authorized by Congress "to support a comprehensive research and development program to harness the increasing capacity of advanced information and digital technologies to improve all levels of learning and education, formal and informal, in order to provide Americans with the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the global economy."
League of Innovative Schools.
Despite islands of innovation across the country, America's public education system is largely resistant to the kinds of technological advances that have revolutionized other parts of 21st-century life. Meanwhile, it is increasingly difficult for school district leaders to understand how to make the most of cutting-edge digital tools and innovative approaches. 
To overcome these challenges, Digital Promise launched the League of Innovative Schools, a national coalition of school district superintendents dedicated to harnessing technological innovation to drive better results to students. The League represents a wide array of school districts - large and small, urban and rural, low-income and middle-class. Overall, it consists of 32 districts and education agencies, serving 2.5 million students in 21 states. 
Upon joining the League, members sign a charter committing to share what's working and what's not working when it comes to digital innovation, making the League a professional development resource for innovative superintendents. Beyond professional development, the League offers educators the opportunity to collaborate with both the entrepreneurs who are building new tools, and the researchers who are evaluating them. 
Funding.
Digital Promise was launched with public and private funding from sources including the U.S. Department of Education, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and its range of corporate partners.

Then, in the 1990s, coal-mining industry of the city of Walbrzych collapsed and lacking sponsors, Gornik declined. Good times returned in the 2006/2007 season, when Gornik, with a new sponsor and under the name "Victoria-Gornik", won promotion to the elite Dominet Basket Liga. However relegated to Second League in 2008-2009 season.

Omega1 Aquilae

Omega1 Aquilae (ω1 Aquilae, ω1 Aql) is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. With an apparent visual magnitude of 5.2 it is a faint that that can be seen with the naked eye in dark skies. From the annual parallax shift of 7.86 mas, the distance to this star can be estimated as , give or take a 20 light year margin of error.
The spectrum of this star fits a stellar classification of F0 IV. Typically, a luminosity class of IV means that the star is in the subgiant stage. It is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 115  km/s. This is causing an equatorial bulge that is 5% larger than the polar radius.

Oldenburg G 1

The Oldenburg Class G1s were German steam locomotives procured by the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways ("Großherzoglich Oldenburgische Staatseisenbahnen") from 1867 to 1877. They were intended to work both as tank engines as well as with a tender. 
Design.
The G1 class were 0-4-0 locomotives, a configuration chosen for its simplicity and cheapness of construction. It had horizontal outside cylinders and a number of original design features, including a radially-stayed, round-top firebox and a small 'regulator box' that replaced the usual steam dome. 
The locomotive frame was designed as a box with riveted steel plates that enabled it to double up as a feedwater tank, an arrangement known as the "Krauss system". It had an Allan valve gear. The connecting and coupling rods were made of fluted I-section steel, the first time such a form had been used, although Belpaire in Belgium was developing the same idea, independently, at the time.
The first engine, "Landwührden".
At the world exhibition in Paris in 1867 the first locomotive, named "Landwührden" (see table photo), won a gold medal for excellence and design of workmanship. This engine - which was also the first one built by Georg Krauss of Munich and therefore had the works number I – was withdrawn from service in 1900 and may be viewed today in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. It is the only surviving locomotive from the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways.
Retirement.
Nineteen of the engines were to have been taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 51.70, but this did not happen because by the time the final renumbering plan was drawn up in 1925, all the locomotives had been retired.
Importance.
According to Ransome-Wallis, "there is no doubt that this locomotive was, in many ways, an important 'landmark' in the history of locomotive development in Europe."

Sarcopenic obesity

Sarcopenic obesity is a medical condition which is actually a mix of two different ailments. It is a situation wherein a person shows an increase in fat mass and a reduction in lean mass.
Etymology.
The term is a mix of two different words- Sarcopenia and Obesity. "Sarcopenia" meaning loss of muscle and "Obesity" which is the increase in fat percentage.
Causes.
The disease is caused due to a variety of reasons:
Symptoms.
The symptoms are basically the same as that of sarcopenia and obesity. The individual may show a BMI that is appropriate and healthy to his or her age but will look fat in appearance.
Problem of Diagnosis.
The problem of diagnosing a person with the condition is hard as there is no reference value for the appropriate lean mass. This is because healthy people tend to show variations in their composition due to their body types.
Cure.
An appropriate weight training and weight loss program can help to improve the patient's condition.

History of the National Hockey League (1992–present)

The National Hockey League (NHL) has endured a tumultuous period of history in recent years. It has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 30 today as the league expanded across the United States. Repeated labour conflicts interrupted play in 1992, 1994–95, 2004–05 and 2012–13; the second lockout caused the entire 2004–05 NHL season to be canceled, the first time in North American history that a sports league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Five franchises have relocated during this time: the Minnesota North Stars became the Dallas Stars (1993), the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche (1995), the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes (1996), the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes (1997), and the Atlanta Thrashers became the second franchise known as the Winnipeg Jets (2011).
In 1993, the Montreal Canadiens celebrated the Stanley Cup's 100th anniversary with their 24th championship. They remain the last Canadian team to capture the trophy. The 1994 New York Rangers broke the Curse of 1940, winning their first title in 54 years. The NHL's southern expansion, often maligned by Canadians and fans in the Northeastern United States, has led to championships by the Dallas Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Carolina Hurricanes and Anaheim Ducks in the last decade.
Manon Rheaume became the first female player in the NHL when she suited up for the Lightning in a 1992 pre-season game. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non-Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with more than 1,700 points and two championships, and now owns the Pittsburgh Penguins. Today's NHL is led by arguably its two biggest young stars: Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals.
The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in 1996, while NHL players first competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics. To promote itself worldwide, the NHL played regular season games in Japan in 1996, and throughout Europe since 2007. The league played its first outdoor regular season games with the Heritage Classic between the Canadiens and the host Edmonton Oilers in 2003, and the Winter Classic, held on New Year's Day from 2008 on in Buffalo, New York, Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Increased use of defence-focused systems contributed to decreased scoring in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by the 1990 expansion plan. The league has attempted several times to alter its rules to increase scoring. It began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime in 1999, hoping to reduce the number of tie games. In 2005, ties were eliminated altogether as the penalty shootout was introduced to ensure that all games have a winner.
Background.
As the 1990s began, players were uneasy with the closeness between National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) executive director Alan Eagleson and the teams' owners. As a result, Eagleson stepped down in December 1991, and was replaced by Bob Goodenow. Four years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicted Eagleson on charges of racketeering, fraud, embezzlement, kickbacks and obstruction of justice over allegations that he stole millions of dollars from the NHLPA. Eagleson pleaded guilty in 1998 in a plea bargain and was fined US$1 million and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He subsequently resigned from the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Four months after replacing Eagleson, Goodenow and the NHLPA launched the first NHL strike on April 1, 1992. It lasted ten days and resulted in the players receiving larger playoff bonuses, increased control over the licensing of their likenesses and improved rights to free agency. It also led the owners to dismiss league president John Ziegler and replace him on an interim basis with Gil Stein. Goodenow called the strike a major moment, stating "I don't think the owners took the players seriously and it wasn't until the strike that they understood the players were serious." As part of the deal, the league also agreed to have each team play two games per season for the following two years in neutral site locations, partially to help gauge markets for potential expansion.
Desiring a fresh start, the owners replaced Stein with Gary Bettman in February 1993. Formerly a senior vice president of the National Basketball Association, Bettman replaced the position of president with that of commissioner. He was given the task of selling the game to the American market, ending labor unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing the league.
Expansion.
The Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators joined the league in as part of the owners' 1990 plan to expand the NHL to 28 teams within a decade. The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rheaume played a period of an exhibition game for them on September 23, 1992. Rheaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game. She also became the first woman to sign a professional hockey contract, doing so with the Lightning's farm team, the Atlanta Knights. One year later, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL's 25th and 26th franchises. They were established as part of the NHL's attempt to regain a U.S. network television presence by expanding into southern North America. The league expected that bringing in Blockbuster Video's Wayne Huizenga to own the Panthers, and The Walt Disney Company to own the Mighty Ducks would raise its profile. The NHL's southward push continued in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas to become the Dallas Stars.
The NHL celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup in 1993. That year's finals featured Patrick Roy and the Montreal Canadiens against Wayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings. After losing the first game, the Canadiens rallied from a late deficit to win game two in overtime after the Kings' Marty McSorley was penalized for using an illegal stick. Montreal scored on the power play, sending the game into overtime. Montreal won games three and four in overtime en route to winning the series in five games. The Canadiens won an NHL-record ten consecutive overtime games in the 1993 playoffs.
The New York Rangers ended their "Curse of 1940" after 54 years by winning the 1994 Stanley Cup in seven games over the Vancouver Canucks. The Rangers' championship was the last hurrah for the great Edmonton Oilers dynasty of the 1980s, as there were seven ex-Oilers on the team, including Mark Messier, who became the first (and to this date, the only) player to win Stanley Cups as the captain for two franchises, having captained the Oilers to the last of their five Stanley Cups in . The Rangers' victory also resulted in the first Russian names to be engraved on the Stanley Cup: Alexei Kovalev, Alexander Karpovtsev, Sergei Nemchinov, and Sergei Zubov. The global audience of 285 million in 120 countries that watched the Rangers' victory included a huge European audience, including those watching across the former Soviet Union. This Stanley Cup win was the highest-rated single CBC Sports program in history to that point.
1994–95 lockout.
Four months later, the players were locked out by the owners due to the lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104 days and resulted in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners wanted to control salary growth and insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and salary arbitration. The union instead proposed a luxury tax system that would penalize teams that spent above a set figure on player salaries. The negotiations were at times bitter, as defenceman Chris Chelios famously issued a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that he should be "worried about family and [his well-being", because "some crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way."
The lockout entered its fourth month in January 1995 and approached a deadline that would have canceled the season when the two sides agreed to an 11th-hour deal. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap, but the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts, changes to the arbitration system and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant a player the unrestricted right to choose where he played until age 31. The deal was initially seen as a victory for the owners.
The agreement was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian dollar, led the Winnipeg Jets to relocate to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996, becoming the Coyotes one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver, Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche. Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada, and citing the cost of doing business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars, the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in 1996. The Hartford Whalers became the third former World Hockey Association team to relocate in 1997, becoming the Carolina Hurricanes.
Dead puck era.
Following the 1994–95 lockout, the NHL entered a prolonged period of offensive decline. Throughout the 1980s, 7.6 goals were scored per game on average. That figure had dropped below six goals per game by the 1994–95 season, and to 5.19 by 1998–99. There have been many arguments put forth as to what caused this decline. A common claim is that the drop in offence was due to dilution of talent caused by 1990s expansion, a position former player Brett Hull endorsed. Increased use of the neutral zone trap and similar defensive systems were also blamed. The New Jersey Devils have often been criticized for popularizing the trap, using it to win the Stanley Cup in 1995, and again in 2000 and 2003. This period has been called the dead puck era.
The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in 1996, an NHL-sanctioned eight team international tournament featuring the top professionals in the world. The inaugural tournament saw the United States upset the favoured Canadians in a three-game final. That same year, the Avalanche won their first Stanley Cup in their first season in Denver, sweeping the Florida Panthers. One year later, the Detroit Red Wings ended a 42-year drought, capturing their first Stanley Cup since 1955. The team's celebration was cut short, as defenceman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov were seriously injured when their limousine crashed six days following the victory. The Red Wings dedicated the 1997–98 season to the two. Upon repeating as champions in 1998, they brought Konstantinov, who had suffered severe brain damage in the crash, out in a wheelchair to celebrate with the team on the ice.
The NHL added four expansion teams to increase the total number of clubs to 30. Continuing its expansion into the southern United States, the Nashville Predators joined the league in 1998, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers in 1999. The Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets then began play in 2000.
On April 16, 1999, Wayne Gretzky played his final NHL game, retiring as the league's all-time scoring leader and holding 61 NHL records. His number, 99, was retired league-wide the following season. The usual three-year waiting period between a player's retirement and his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame was waived, and he was inducted in 1999. 
For marketing reasons, the NHL agreed to participate in the Winter Olympics starting in 1998. NHL players first competed at the Nagano Games. Led by goaltender Dominik Hasek, the tournament was won by the Czech Republic. Hasek, who finished the tournament with a 0.97 goals-against average and a .961 save percentage over six games, was the leading goaltender of the 1990s. His run of consecutive Vezina Trophies from 1994 to 1999 was interrupted only once, in 1996 by Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals. Hasek won another Vezina Trophy in 2001, and two consecutive Lester B. Pearson and Hart Trophies in 1997 and 1998.
The Panthers' trip to the Stanley Cup final in 1996 began a trend in which southern-based teams frequently appeared in the championship round. The Dallas Stars won the 1999 Stanley Cup over the Buffalo Sabres in controversial fashion: Brett Hull scored the Cup-winning goal in overtime of game six despite arguments that his foot was in the goal crease, which under the rules at the time would have disallowed the goal. The Stars returned to the finals in 2000, falling to the New Jersey Devils. The Hurricanes first played in the finals in 2002, losing to the Red Wings, while the Mighty Ducks reached the final in 2003, falling to the Devils. In 2004, the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames to win the Cup. The Lightning win in 2004 was seen as the end to the Devils/Avalanche/Red Wings Stanley Cup era, as all three teams won a combined 8 Stanley Cups between 1995 and 2003.
The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL's first regular season outdoor hockey game, the Heritage Classic, on November 22, 2003. The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then-record crowd of 57,167 fans who endured temperatures as low as .
Mario Lemieux.
When they selected him as the first overall draft pick in 1984, the Pittsburgh Penguins hoped that Mario Lemieux would improve the team's fortunes on the ice, and increase interest in the team in the Pittsburgh market. Lemieux, who had scored 133 goals in his final season of junior hockey, recorded his first NHL goal in his first game on his first career shot against the Boston Bruins. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux scored five goals, one in each of the five different ways possible: even strength, on the power play, short handed, on a penalty shot and into an empty net, a feat no player in league history has duplicated. 
Injuries and illness plagued Lemieux throughout his career. He played only 26 regular season games in 1990–91 after surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back, but returned in time to score 44 points in the playoffs in leading the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup. Lemieux continued to struggle with back trouble the next season, though he still won the scoring title, and his second consecutive playoff MVP award in leading the Penguins to their second championship in 1992. In 1993, he was diagnosed with cancer. Lemieux endured 22 radiation treatments in 30 days to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only 12 hours after his final treatment, Lemieux returned to the Penguins, scoring a goal in his first game back. A second surgery on his back cost Lemieux most of the 1993–94 season, and the entire 1994–95 campaign. As a result of his injuries, Lemieux retired in 1997. He was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame; the three-year waiting period was waived by the Hall.
Inspired by his son Austin's desire to see him play, Lemieux returned to the NHL in 2000–01, earning an assist on a Jaromir Jagr goal 33-seconds into his return, and scoring one himself in the 2nd period. He also became the first player-owner in NHL history; he had bought the Penguins in the summer of 1999 to save them from bankruptcy. Lemieux finished the season with 35 goals and 76 points in 43 games. Lemieux continued to battle injuries, missing the majority of the first-half of the 2001–02 season, however he returned to action in time to captain Team Canada to its first gold medal in 50-years at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Injuries again forced his retirement, as Lemieux finally ended his career on January 24, 2006 with 690 goals and 1,723 points in 915 games. Despite his injuries, it has been argued that Lemieux was the greatest player in NHL history. Hall of Famer Bobby Orr said that Lemieux was the most skilled player he had ever seen, while Mike Gartner said that if he had remained healthy, Lemieux would have scored 1,000 goals.
2004–05 lockout.
By 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown much faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. Upon the expiry of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), Gary Bettman announced that the players were again locked out to start the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, he announced the cancellation of the entire season: "It is my sad duty to announce that because a solution has not yet been attained, it is no longer practical to conduct even an abbreviated season. Accordingly, I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation of play." The NHL became the first North American league to cancel an entire season because of a labor stoppage.
As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led union president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin to take charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new CBA. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues, a 24% rollback on salaries, and unrestricted free agency beginning after seven years of service.
The loss of the 2004–05 season led the NHL to institute a special lottery to determine the order of the 2005 draft, as there were no standings to base a drafting order from. The Pittsburgh Penguins won the lottery, and selected Sidney Crosby, a highly prized prospect whose arrival to the NHL had been greatly anticipated. Crosby and the Washington Capitals' Alex Ovechkin, the 2004 first overall pick, were expected to become the faces of the NHL as the league entered a new era. Ovechkin was named the Calder Memorial Trophy winner as rookie of the year in 2005–06, while Crosby's presence helped Pittsburgh's attendance increase by 33%, over 4,000 fans per game.
Recent Years.
In the 2005–06 season, Ovechkin and Crosby began their careers. In their first three seasons, they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies; Crosby captured both in 2007 and Ovechkin in 2008. The 2006 Stanley Cup Finals was the first time that franchises that originally played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) met in the Stanley Cup Final, as the Oilers lost a seven-game series to the Hurricanes. The following season, the Senators lost the finals in five games to the Ducks. The three-year streak of Canadian teams in the finals was halted in the 2007–08 season, when the Red Wings defeated the Penguins for their fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. The Penguins returned the favor in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals, winning in Game 7 for their third Stanley Cup, most by any post-1967 expansion team. Two Original Six teams ended lengthy Stanley Cup title droughts within the next two years, with the Chicago Blackhawks ending a 49-year drought against the Flyers in six games of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Boston Bruins ending a 39-year drought against the Canucks in seven games of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. In the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, the Los Angeles Kings won their first Stanley Cup in their 45-year history when they defeated the New Jersey Devils in six games, in a series where for the first time, two American-born captains (New Jersey's Zach Parise and Los Angeles' Dustin Brown) met in the Finals. The Kings became the first eighth seed in either the NHL or the NBA to win a championship while also becoming the first NHL team to lead 3–0 in all four playoff series. The Blackhawks would win another Stanley Cup in , beating the Bruins in six games. The 2013 Final was the first to feature two Original Six teams since 1979.
The success of the Heritage Classic led the NHL to schedule more outdoor games. The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings. On January 1, 2010 at Fenway Park in Boston the third Winter Classic was held with the Bruins defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in overtime. The following year the Winter Classic was held in Pittsburgh's Heinz Field, with the Washington Capitals beating the Penguins 3-1, and on January 2, 2012 (January 1 of that year was a Sunday), the New York Rangers defeated the Flyers 3-2 at Philadelphia's Citizens Bank Park. For the 2013–14 season, six outdoor games are scheduled in five cities, beginning with the 2014 NHL Winter Classic at Detroit's Michigan Stadium, and then the 2014 NHL Stadium Series at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Yankee Stadium in New York City, and Soldier Field in Chicago, before concluding with the 2014 NHL Heritage Classic at Vancouver's BC Place.
Intending to promote the game world wide, the league sent the San Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames to begin the 1998–99 season with two games in Tokyo, Japan. Since 2007, the NHL has been sending teams to Europe to start each season. The Los Angeles Kings met the Ducks at the O2 Arena in London, England to start the 2007–08 season. A year later, four teams were sent to Prague, Czech Republic and Stockholm, Sweden. One of those teams, the Rangers, also participated in the inaugural Victoria Cup, defeating the Kontinental Hockey League's Metallurg Magnitogorsk 4–3 in a single game. Another four teams opened the 2009–10 season in Stockholm and Helsinki, Finland. In 2010, Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics, the first time an NHL city has hosted the event since the league began participating. The NHL's participation in future games remains in doubt, as it has expressed a desire not to participate in the 2014 games in Sochi, Russia. The players, however, strongly favour continued participation in the Olympics. The third World Cup of Hockey is expected to take place in 2011, seven years after the 2004 tournament.
Due to the 2010 Olympics, the Canucks underwent the longest road trip in NHL history, with 14 games over 6 weeks, from January 27 to March 13, 2010, to allow General Motors Place to be used for ice hockey during the Winter Games. It marked the first time that an NHL-sized rink was used during the Winter Olympics. GM Place was "Canada Hockey Place" during the games, as the IOC prohibits advertising, including corporate sponsorship, within Olympic venues.
Despite these successes after the lockout, a couple of teams still had financial difficulties. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 after incurring several hundred million dollars of losses. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market. However, the NHL still has not finalized a deal with any new owner. Keeping the team afloat for now is the City of Glendale, Arizona, home of the team's Jobing.com Arena: after paying $25 million to the NHL to cover the club's losses for the 2010–11 season, another agreement was reached for the city to pay another $25 million for the 2011–12 season.
After also suffering financial losses and ownership struggles, the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts to expand into the southern United States.
2012–13 lockout.
The NHL again entered lockout in 2012, cancelling the first 526 games, about 43% of the season, until at least December 30, 2012. Just after 5 am on January 6, 2013, after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating, the NHL and the player's union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. The first games of the season were held on January 19.
Rules and innovations.
Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season, the NHL decided that beginning in the 1999–2000 season, in any game tied after regulation time, both teams would be guaranteed one point, while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point. The theory was that rather than playing conservatively to earn a point for a tie, teams would press for the extra point for the overtime win. In the 2005–06 season the NHL eliminated tie games altogether, as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five-minute overtime period. The shootout has proven controversial; critics have called it a gimmick, and expressed fierce opposition to any suggestion of using it to decide playoff games, though the league has not pushed for this to happen. It has also been argued that teams are playing it safe, taking no chances in regulation in order to bring the game to overtime, where they are each guaranteed a point. The shootout also has many supporters, among them Phoenix head coach Dave Tippett, who stated that many fans enjoy it.
The shootout was one of several rule changes made in 2005 as the league attempted to increase offence following the lockout. The two-line pass rule was eliminated, allowing teams to pass from their defensive zone to anywhere in the neutral zone. Previously, such passes could only be made to their own half of the neutral zone. The rule was intended to encourage long breakout passes and create more breakaways. Teams that commit an icing infraction are no longer allowed to make a line change before a faceoff, and goaltenders are now prohibited from playing the puck in the end-zone corners behind the goal line. They are allowed to play the puck directly behind the net, within the trapezoid marked by diagonal lines from the goal line to the end boards.
One of the most controversial changes was the league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction penalties. The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on "clutching and grabbing". The tighter regulations have met with complaints about the legitimacy of some calls, that players are diving to draw penalties, and that officials are not calling enough penalties.
The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring. Teams combined to score 6.1 goals per game in 2005–06, more than a goal per game higher than in the 2003–04 season. This represented the highest single-season increase in offence since 1929–30. However, scoring has rapidly declined since, approaching pre-lockout totals in 2007–08.

Freemasonry in Belgium

Freemasonry in Belgium comprises several Masonic obediences, a federation and a confederation. These include Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain and Lithos Confederation of Lodges. 
History.
Freemasonry began in Belgium whilst the region was ruled by Austria, and later came under influence from Freemasonry in France (following the area's annexation) and the Netherlands (in the period between 1815 and 1830). When the state of Belgium was formed in 1830, Freemasonry there expanded greatly, but faced dramatic changes and challenges over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today.
Grand Orient of Belgium.
The Grand Orient of Belgium (French: Grand Orient de Belgique, Dutch: Grootoosten van Belgie G.O.B.) is for men only and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry.
It was founded in 1833, three years after the independence of Belgium, and joined the Grand Orient of France and other Continental jurisdictions in not requiring initiates to believe in a Supreme Being.
In 1989 the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium and the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain signed an agreement of mutual recognition.
Grand Lodge of Belgium.
The Grand Lodge of Belgium (French: Grande Loge de Belgique, Dutch: Grootloge 
van België, G.L.B.) is for men only, and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. It was founded in 1959 by 5 lodges of the Grand Orient of Belgium in order to regain recognition by the United Grand Lodge of England. When in 1979 this recognition was lost again, 9 lodges founded the Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium. In 1989, the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium and the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain signed an agreement of mutual recognition.
Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium.
The Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium (French: "La Grande Loge Régulière de Belgique", Dutch: "Reguliere Grootloge van België", R.G.L.B.) is for men only and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. It was founded on 15 June 1979 by 9 lodges after the Grand Lodge of Belgium lost its recognition from the United Grand Lodge of England. Today it has nearly 50 lodges throughout Belgium.

<doc id="19094445" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19094445" title="Jungian Type Index">
Jungian Type Index

The Jungian Type Index (JTI) is an alternative to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Introduced by Optimas in 2001, the JTI was developed over a 10-year period in Norway by psychologists Thor Ødegård and Hallvard E: Ringstad. The JTI was designed to help capture individuals' preferred usage of the psychological functions identified by Carl Jung in his book "Psychological Types", such as thinking vs feeling and sensing vs intuition. 
The JTI's questions and methodology for identifying the preferred functions differs from the MBTI. For example it eliminates word pairs, which can be troublesome to translate from English into other languages. (In many languages, the sentence context frames the meaning of a word, while in English the words themselves may denote more meaning.)
The JTI has almost completely replaced the MBTI in Denmark, since the main Danish re-seller, Center for Ledelse, stopped licensing the MBTI at the end of 2004. Instead it licenses the JTI, which is asserted to be a qualitative improvement over the MBTI. As an emerging product, the JTI is also cheaper to license. In Norway and Sweden, the JTI is also gaining users, in conjunction with other tools that complement the JTI for career development and coaching.
Critical points.
The JTI utilizes the P/J dichotomy as a means to differ between a given type's dominant and auxiliary function, a technique that was developed by Myers and Briggs, and used by most Jungian practitioners in understanding type dynamics. This is especially critical as the authors do not credit Myers in their list of references, all while relying on her contribution.

Saxon XII H2

The Saxon Class XII H2 steam locomotives (also nicknamed "Sächsischer Rollwagen" or 'Saxon rollers') were bought by the Royal Saxon State Railways ("Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen") specifically for the mountainous areas of Saxony. They were built by Hartmann between 1910 and 1927 in Chemnitz. The design of this passenger train locomotive was carried out in parallel with that of the express train classes, the Saxon X H1 and Saxon XII H. A total of 159 examples of this powerful locomotive were built by 1922. 
The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 124 of these engines as the DRG Class 38.2-3 (the others had been lost during the First World War or had to be given away as reparations) and gave them operating numbers 38 201 to 38 324. In 1927, ten more were built. These were given operating numbers 38 325 to 38 334. 
During the Second World War 15 of the Class XII H2s that had been given to France returned to Germany and were stationed again in the Reichsbahn division of Dresden. From 1938, however, the majority of these locomotives were working out of locomotive depots ("Bahnbetriebswerken" or "Bw") in the Sudetenland. As a result, after the war only about a half the original fleet of these engines was left in Germany. Five of the locomotives returned from France went into the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn where they were allocated operating numbers 38 204 and 38 351 to 38 354. The last ones had been withdrawn by 1971. 
Even the surviving museum locomotive, number 38 205 is currently not working. This engine is owned by the DB Museum at Nuremberg and has been loaned to the Saxon Railway Museum in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. 
The first 15 vehicles were originally equipped with Saxon sä 2'2' T 16 tenders. Later they ran with Saxon sä 2'2' T 21 tenders as did all the subsequent locomotives.

Duboisia myoporoides

Duboisia myoporoides, or Corkwood, is a shrub or tree native to high-rainfall areas on the margins of rainforest in eastern Australia. It has a thick and corky bark.
The leaves are obovate to elliptic in shape, 4–15 cm long and 1–4 cm wide. The small white flowers are produced in clusters. This is followed by globose purple-black berries (not edible).
Uses.
The leaves are a commercial source of pharmaceutically useful alkaloids. The same alkaloids render all plant parts poisonous. The leaves contain a number of alkaloids, including hyoscine (scopolamine), used for treating motion sickness, stomach disorders, and the side effects of cancer therapy.

Morane-Saulnier AI

The Morane-Saulnier AI (also Type AI) was a French parasol-wing fighter aircraft produced by Morane-Saulnier during World War I.
Development and design.
The AI was developed to replace the obsolete Morane-Saulnier Type N. Its engine was mounted in a circular open-front cowling. The parasol wing was swept back. The spars and ribs of the circular section fuselage were wood, wire-braced and covered in fabric. The production aircraft were given service designations based on whether they had 1 gun (designated "MoS 27") or 2 guns (designated "MoS 29").
Operational history.
A number of escadrilles were created to operated the AI, but by mid-May 1918, most of the aircraft were replaced by the SPAD XIII. The aircraft became an advanced trainer, designated "MoS 30".
Fifty-one MoS 30s were purchased by the American Expeditionary Force as pursuit trainers.
Survivors.
Three AIs are flown by Jean Salis at La Ferté-Alais.
An original AI is part of the Fantasy of Flight collection in Polk City, Florida. This particular aircraft was sold to the United States Army Air Service in 1918. This aircraft, along with several others, was shipped to McCook Field in Ohio for testing. Surviving the test programs of the early 1920s they eventually were sold to private pilots. This AI ended up in the Tallmantz Collection and was acquired by Fantasy of Flight's owner Kermit Weeks when he purchased the collection in 1985. It was sent to England and restored by Personal Plane Services in the late 1980s.
Another original AI aircraft is in the collection of Cole Palen's Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, and was formerly flown in the weekend airshows there for some time.

Wood River (British Columbia)

The Wood River is a tributary of the Columbia River in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The river's lower reach is flooded by Mica Dam on the Columbia River, until its inundation the river was formerly a tributary of the Canoe River. The lower Wood River is called Wood Reach, which is connected to Canoe Reach, the flooded lower portion of the Canoe River. Both are part of the Mica Dam's reservoir, Kinbasket Lake.
Course.
The Wood River originates in Fortress Lake in Hamber Provincial Park. Its headwater streams drain the western slope of the Continental Divide. The Wood River flows generally southwest to join the Canoe and Columbia Rivers in Kinbasket Lake.
History.
In 1811 David Thompson crossed the Continental Divide at Athabasca Pass and descended the Wood River to reach the Columbia River. His party built a boat at Boat Encampment, located near the confluences of the Wood, Canoe, and Columbia Rivers.
