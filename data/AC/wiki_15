Barkisland

Barkisland is a village in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. It is east of Ripponden, south of Sowerby Bridge and south-west of Halifax town centre. Barkisland has one school, a village church, a post office and a local Cricket Club which play in the Huddersfield league. There are two pubs in Barkisland, The Fleece and The Griffin.
History.
A ten thousand year old axe has been discovered near Ringstone Reservoir, providing evidence of human activity in the area now known as Barkisland dating back to the Stone Age. The origin of the name is in dispute. In a book of place names printed in 1944 it was stated that Barkisland derived from it being a settlement ('land') of a chieftain called 'Barkis'. While much earlier, in 1789, the Rev John Watson, vicar of Ripponden church between 1754 and 1769, theorised that "Barsey or Barkesey are Anglo-Saxon words meaning low-lying enclosures where birches grow. It also is the Anglo-Saxon for a district where there are wolves." 
The parish of Barkisland was recorded on 1 July 1837 as part of the Halifax Registration District. It was abolished as a distinct parish on 1 April 1937 and merged with the neighbouring parish of Ripponden.
Industry.
Bower's Mill was built in the 18th Century as a water-powered fulling mill. it has also been used as a corn mill, a worsted mill and a woolen mill. Textiles manufacturer J&S Taylor Ltd occupied the mill from 1882 to 1991 before moving production to Sowerby Bridge. The mill has now been converted for smaller businesses.
Barkisland Mills is a 6 storey building which was used for textile production in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the start of the 21st century it was converted into residential apartments. There was also a Bottomley's mill in Barkisland. Its presence as a cotton mill was recorded when a fire broke out there on 13 January 1871.
Governance.
Barkisland is a village in the civil parish of Ripponden, which is part of the Ryburn ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England.
Geography.
Barkisland is situated on a hilltop that gently rises from Greetland in the north-east and declines westwards to Ripponden and eastwards to Stainland. The hill continues to climb southwards towards Scammonden.

A Girl Cut in Two

A Girl Cut in Two (French: La Fille coupée en deux) is a 2007 French drama and thriller film directed by Claude Chabrol and starring Ludivine Sagnier, François Berléand, and Benoît Magimel. The film was released in France on August 8, 2007 and a limited release in the United States beginning on August 15, 2008.
Plot.
The film revolves around two men who vie for a single young woman, Gabrielle Deneige. Gabrielle, a local weather woman, is in her twenties and lives with her mother, who works in a little bookstore. Charles Saint-Denis is a famed author who has just written a new book. Seeming to shy away from the public eye, he lives in the countryside of Lyon with his wife. At a party after a television interview about his new novel, Charles first spies young Gabrielle, then attends a book signing in the bookshop where Gabrielle's mother works. After a little flirting, Charles gives Gabrielle a copy of his book and an invitation for her to attend an auction with him. She agrees. The local scion of a pharmaceutical company, Paul Gaudens, enters the store and confronts Saint-Denis, then sees Gabrielle. 
Paul invites her to dinner with him. She agrees to go. While they are at dinner, Charles meets with friends, one of whom speaks about his daughter dating a man Charles' age, and how he handles the situation. Charles asks him about the auction on Saturday. The scene cuts to the exterior of the restaurant, where Gabrielle thanks Paul for the meal. He offers to take her home, but she indicates it isn't far and that she's on her scooter. Paul tells her she's "amazing, honestly." Gabrielle puts him off, telling him that she likes him, but not to pressure her. She walks to her motorbike and drives off. Paul shows he is unhappy at not getting what he wants. He spots a parking ticket on his car, snatches it off, and tosses it on the ground. The audience sees more and more that Paul is a spoiled rich kid with serious issues about getting what he wants.
The following Saturday, Gabrielle attends the auction with Charles, where he bids on a love letter, then bids on and wins an illustrated manuscript written by an erotomaniac. He presents the document to Gabrielle, commenting that if she doesn't like to read, she can look at the pictures. The audience will later realize this is his initial effort to let her know what his interests are. They return to Charles' flat in the city; he pours champagne, she asks him to kiss her, and they have sex. Afterward, Gabrielle comments that she must have seemed clumsy to him. He responds, "I'll teach you." She observes that she probably wasn't the first he'd brought to the flat, and he answers that she could be the last. She admires a photo on the wall, which Charles says is of Lisbon. She asks if he'll take her there someday, then abruptly asks him the time. She realizes she is late for work and rushes to dress. Gabrielle asks Charles about meeting later that night, and he tells her, "Whoa, little girl," and that she's moving too fast. He says he's not a free man, having been married for 25 years, and is 30 years older than she is. She indicates this doesn't bother her, they quarrel, and she throws the manuscript at him and storms out.
At the TV station, after the weathercast, her boss, Phillipe, asks her to a party with him that night to meet some people. He has her find an appropriate dress in wardrobe. At the party, they're sitting at a table when a young man comes up to tell his boss (Phillipe) that another employee, Emilie, is drunk. Phillipe tells the young man to leave her alone, as he's about to fire her in five minutes. Then Phillipe turns to tell Gabrielle something, but she excuses herself. She goes over to the bar and asks for champagne, and Paul shows up. He leads her to the dance floor where he tells her that her boss is charming. Gabrielle realizes that Paul arranged for her to be invited to the party, and she excuses herself and leaves, starting to walk home (because she'd come to the party in Phillipe's car).
Paul and his friend (and caretaker?) Frank follow Gabrielle out, and Paul gets increasingly insistent with her until he is actually physically restraining her with a hand on her throat. Frank drags him away from her, but Gabrielle is shaken by Paul's boorish behavior, and the viewer grows more aware of undercurrents with this character that do not bode well for the future. The scene cuts to Charles listening to music; he calls himself an idiot. Then we see a shot of Gabrielle's mother tucking her safely into bed like a little girl.
At the television studio, Gabrielle's colleague suggests she's in line for a job (the one formerly held by Emilie?). Gabrielle says she'll let the producer approach her when she is called to her dressing room by a woman who says that someone's waiting there and she thinks it's important.
In her dressing room, she is greeted by Paul and a large bouquet of flowers. He apologizes for his behavior, saying he was drunk and asking for forgiveness, which she gives. He intimates that he can improve her work situation for her, being friends with the boss, and she tells him to stay out of her business. Because of her independence, he guesses, then professes his love again. She asks him where his pride is, and he says pride doesn't matter. She admits she likes him a little, and he expresses his joy that she loves him, and she stresses "likes." Suddenly, another bouquet of multi-colored roses arrives—this time with a card with two words: "Come. Charles". While Paul stands there chewing on his fingers (something he does almost constantly), Gabrielle grabs her coat and runs out. Paul picks up the card, sees the name on it, and rips it up, furious that his rival has taken Gabrielle. When Gabrielle arrives at Charles' flat, he apologizes and they again have sex.
Time passes, during which we see Charles "initiating" his young lover into increasingly open sexual behavior, Gabrielle telling her mother about the relationship (during which her mother observes "I always knew you'd snag a father" and Gabrielle tells her about Charles' marriage, which makes it sound like the age-old situation of a married man who wants to have his cake and eat it, too), Gabrielle working in her new job as a talk show host, and Paul lunching with his mother, sisters, and Frank. At the restaurant, where Charles is lunching with his wife and his friend Capucine, Paul causes two small scenes, first at Charles' table, and then by haranguing his mother for her failings as a mother (chewing on his fingers the whole time) until his mother asks Frank to take him away.
After the lunch scene, Gabrielle behaves in a way that suggests she is losing some of her sexual inhibitions, and Charles asks her whether she feels humiliated. She says that she doesn't, and he tells her he loves her more than he's ever loved anyone. But then he indicates he's feeling restless, and takes to the sex club where his friends are. We later learn that Charles asks Gabrielle to perform sexual acts on his friends to show how liberated she is (a nod to the remark about Marquis de Sade in the beginning of the film). Perhaps taking this step with his lovers is Charles' way of preparing to drop them, as after that Charles then leaves the country (telling Gabrielle he'll be gone four or five days, but his wife he'll be gone a month), has his wife change the locks to his flat, and ends contact with Gabrielle. Gabrielle is crushed by these acts and stops functioning. With her daughter stuck in a virtual catatonic state, Gabrielle's mother has an idea (after Gabrielle's uncle remarks that in "Sleeping Beauty," the rich prince whisked away the sleeping princess). She calls Paul and invites him over.
We next see Paul and Gabrielle in Lisbon. But Paul feels that he cannot make her forget Charles and creates a shouting scene in a bar one afternoon, then rushes out. Gabrielle stays and drinks, then goes to Paul's. Gabrielle tells Paul that they should be just friends. Furious, Paul begins to shout and tells Gabrielle that he never wants to see her again. Gabrielle, drunk, goes to see Paul and tells him she will marry him. He agrees and they are soon engaged. Paul's mother detests Gabrielle. Charles learns of Paul and Gabrielle's engagement on the local news. At the gown fitting, Charles talks to Gabrielle. Gabrielle tells Charles that she loves him and she won't marry Paul if Charles leaves his wife. Charles won't agree, and Gabrielle marries Paul. 
Gabrielle obviously does not fit into the Gaudens family. On their honeymoon, Paul, experiencing some of the sexual expertise Gabrielle has acquired, grows more and more jealous. He knows about her night at the sex club with Charles' friends and that Charles is impotent. Paul, disgusted, threatens Gabrielle with a small pistol. He puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger, revealing that it is not loaded. Later, Paul and Gabrielle attend a benefit dinner at which Paul's mother is present. Charles is there also and while he is delivering the keynote address, Paul walks on the stage and shoots Charles for "perverting my wife."
Gabrielle is called to testify against Charles and his sexual depravity. She refuses, until the third lawyer hired by the Gaudens gets her to go talk to Paul's mother. Here we learn that Paul may have killed his older brother in the bathroom when Paul was three years old. Gabrielle tells the truth in court. When she goes to visit Paul, who received only seven years in prison, he denies her. When Gabrielle goes to see Paul's mother, she tells Gabrielle that she was played and will soon receive divorce papers from Paul. Gabrielle will also not get any money from the Gaudens. Gabrielle seems flippant and tells Paul's mother that she is keeping the car that Paul gave her, because she needs it. 
The movie ends with Gabrielle being sawed in two and reappearing in her uncle's magic show.

Roving Boy

Roving Boy (1980–1983) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse. Bred and raced by Robert E. Hibbert, Roving Boy was a descendant of Man o' War on his sire's side. His dam's grandsire was the undefeated Italian racing superstar, Ribot.
Trained by Joseph Manzi, Roving Boy was the dominant juvenile in California whose earnings in 1982 of $800,425 set a world record for a two-year-old. He was a winner of four important West Coast races including the Grade I Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita Park and both the Del Mar and Hollywood Futuritys. His 1982 performances earned Roving Boy U.S. Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors.
A winterbook favorite for the 1983 U.S. Triple Crown series, in late January 1983 Roving Boy suffered a cannon-bone fracture in his left front leg that kept him out of racing until the fall. On his return to the racetrack, Roving boy won the Alibhai Handicap at Santa Anita Park but, similar to what happened to Eight Belles in the 2008 Kentucky Derby, after crossing the finish line he broke both hind legs. Surgery was not successful and the colt had to be euthanized.

Tommy Hamilton

Tommy Hamilton (born 1935 in Bray) is a former Irish football player who played as a forward.
His first club was Manchester United whom he joined in 1953 where he began playing as an inside forward for the third team and reserves. Hamilton was not prepared for being conscripted so he came home to sign for Shamrock Rovers F.C. in November 1955 and made his debut against Waterford at Kilcohan Park on the 6th of November in a League of Ireland Shield match.
The following season he was the League's top scorer.
Hamilton scored twice for Rovers in the European Champion Clubs' Cup. After scoring at OGC Nice he was ruled out of the home leg due to tonsillitis. He played three times in Europe for the Hoops.
He won two caps for the Republic of Ireland making his debut in a 2-0 win over Czechoslovakia on 5 April 1959 in Ireland's first ever European Championship qualifier at Dalymount Park. His second and final cap was in the return game at Tehelne pole, Bratislava on the 10th of May. He also won one Republic of Ireland B national football team cap in 1960 scoring both goals in a 2-1 win over Iceland.
Tommy finished up scoring 44 League goals and 9 FAI Cup goals as well as his 2 European strikes. He represented the League of Ireland 20 times in his seven years at Milltown scoring once.
His last competitive game for the Hoops was the 1962 FAI Cup final in which he scored twice. This made up for being bizarrely dropped for the 1957 and 1958 finals.
He shared his benefit with Maxie McCann against Sunderland at Dalymount Park on 30 April 1962. That match was Tommy Hamilton's last match for Rovers as he joined Cork Hibernians in a player-exchange deal that brought Jackie Mooney to Milltown.
The following week he won the Soccer Personality of the Year Award.
Hamilton spent three season there before moving to Limerick F.C. where he made another Cup Final appearance losing to Rovers. 
He retired in January 1969.

Mick Kearin

Mick Kearin (born in Kildare) is a former Irish football player who mainly played as a wing-half, after starting his career as a forward.
He started off with St Patrick's Athletic F.C. at 17 before joining Bohemians F.C. in 1963 as an amateur. 
Bohemians struggled in the league, winning a handful of games, but the arrival of Sean Thomas as manager was soon to change things, "It was major news – Sean Thomas had managed Shamrock Rovers and brought them phenomenal success."
There were offers to turn professional and semi-professional by the likes of Derry and Glentoran and Waterford.
"The Derry one I was nearly going to take because it was full-time but Sean Thomas said that Shamrock Rovers was the offer to accept – they were the club in the country – they were in Europe every year. Sean said, "Don't mind these other teams – they can promise you ten pounds a week more than what Rovers are offering, but after a month they mightn't have any money."
In the end he went to Rovers in May 1966 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1966/0521/Pg003.html#Ar00321:405C6B43FC83] for four times the amount they'd originally offered. The most memorable European tie Mick played in was against FC Bayern Munich in 1966. Rovers drew 1-1 at Dalymount Park but it was the return match played in below freezing temperature in Munich that almost caused German hearts to crash. With a minute to the final whistle the score was 2-2, and qualification was beckoning for Rovers on the away goals rule (this was a Bayern team peppered with World Cup winners like Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller – and their club had already sold 40,000 tickets for their next European game – that's how sure they were that Rovers would be a push-over). The silence of the crowd was deafening as they say, the relief palpable when Der Bomber netted the winner.
A six-week summer team to promote the advent of professional soccer in the USA in 1967 saw Mick play against South American teams, and also against the likes of Sunderland, Wolves, Hearts and Stoke City amongst others. By now Mick was very well established and written often off in the national newspapers. 
His seven-year stay at Glenmalure Park included scoring twice in eight appearances for Rovers in Europe [http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/europeanresults.php].
Kearin earned one international cap for the Republic of Ireland national football team on 10 October 1971 in a 6-0 defeat to Austria in a European Championship qualifier in the Linzer Stadion [http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/matchdetails.php?id=133]. Mick won three amateur caps for the Irish national team: against Scotland home and away, and Iceland away. He represented the League of Ireland XI four times while at Milltown.
He scored in the 1969 FAI Cup final replay [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1969/0424/Pg003.html#Ar00300:1ED1C422E1E322C1BC2331D808C13B12217E0FF1811571A01F62A72202BD1B26361DE64B1706E419B6F91F47B02217C52D52A53032BB3022A43042BA2713382A034D2703A229C3B72B64002E34162604C428B4D929B50C2A05212A050C2CB5212955EA2C05FF2DD6CC3076E13276DD3516F23E938741539D07717F0F019D18A1C21E41E01646361A164B27576D2A577D3933873CF39D].
He rejoined Bohs in January 1973 and later played for Athlone Town F.C..

Blanco Canyon

Blanco Canyon is a canyon located in the U.S. state of Texas. Eroded by the White River into the Caprock Escarpment on the east side of the Llano Estacado, the canyon runs for in a southeasterly direction, gradually widening from its beginning in southwestern Floyd County to across at its mouth in southeastern Crosby County. It also gradually deepens from at its beginning to 300 to 500 feet (91 to 150 m) at its mouth. There is one side canyon, five-mile long Crawfish Canyon, which was cut by Crawfish Creek as it feeds into the White River from the west.
Blanco Canyon is one of several canyons that have been cut by rivers into the east face of the Llano Estacado, including Yellow House Canyon, Tule Canyon, and Palo Duro Canyon.
History.
The canyon was long suspected, but only confirmed in the 1990s, of having been used as a campsite by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado and his army twice in spring of 1541 while on his El Dorado expedition. The water and timber afforded by the White River and the trees growing along its banks would have provided an ideal campsite in the 16th century. Indeed, although the river is mostly dry now due to pumping, local anecdotes maintain that fishing was possible in the river until the mid-20th century. The canyon valley still appears fertile, and cottonwood trees line the creek bed.
It was also, on October 10, 1871, the site of the main skirmish of Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie's initial campaign against the Plains Comanches, known as the Battle of Blanco Canyon. On this same campaign, Mackenzie established a supply camp named Anderson's Fort on a curved ridge a short distance southeast of the canyon mouth; it is now on the National Register of Historic Places.
Shortly thereafter, once the Plains Indians had been forced onto reservations, the nearby site of Mount Blanco on the east rim of the canyon was established in 1877 by Henry Clay Smith and his wife, the former Elizabeth Boyle, as the first permanent white settlement on the West Texas plains, and the first post office west of Fort Griffin. Early settlers were attracted to the site for the same reason as Coronado had been - the ready supply of wood and water, which were rarities in the area.
In 1948, the District Nine of the Caprock-Plains Baptist churches established the Plains Baptist Assembly in the canyon as a recreational retreat for area churches. By 1986, the site encompassed and 65 buildings. Today, it runs year-round and features facilities for camps, retreats and conferences.
Floydada's country club is also located in the canyon.
Access.
The canyon is crossed north-to-south by U.S. Highway 62 near the canyon's beginning, and east-to-west by Farm to Market Road 193 and U.S. Highway 82, the latter being near the canyon's mouth. Where U.S. 82 crosses the White River, a roadside park with facilities and hiking trails has been built.

Zamma

Zamma is a two-player abstract strategy game from Africa. It is especially played in North Africa. The game is similar to Alquerque and draughts. The board is four Alquerque boards combined together to form a square board. The initial setup is also similar to Alquerque, where every space on the board is filled with each player's pieces except for the middle point of the board. Furthermore, each player's pieces are also set up on each player's half of the board. The game specifically resembles draughts in that pieces must move in the forward directions until they are crowned "Mullah" (or "Sultan") which is the equivalent of the king in draughts. The Mullah can move in any direction. In North Africa, the black pieces are referred to as men, and the white pieces as women. In the Sahara, short sticks represent the men, and camel dung represent the women.
The game goes by several names such as Damma, Srand, and Dhamet. In Mauritania, the game is referred to as Srand or Dhamet. It is a national game. Mauritania's version is different from the other variants in that the pieces captured are instantly removed from the board, whereas, in other variants the removal of captured pieces is deferred.
Goal.
The player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner.
Equipment.
The board is a 9×9 square grid, or a 8×8 square board with pieces played on the intersections with diagonal lines running throughout the board. Each player has 40 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.

Abdul Aziz (cricketer)

Abdul Aziz (born 1941, Karachi, Sind and died 17 January 1959, aged 17, Karachi) was a Pakistani cricketer. A wicket keeper and opening batsman, Abdul Aziz played eight first-class matches for Karachi, before he died after being struck by a ball. He was a student at S. M. College and worked for the Pakistan State Bank.
Whilst batting in the first-innings of the Quaid-e-Azam final against Pakistan Combined Services, Aziz was struck over the heart by a slow off break from Dildwar Awan "While preparing to receive the next ball, Aziz fell to the ground and never regained consciousness, dying "en route" to hospital. It is believed the blow aggravated an existing undiagnosed heart condition. A player who does not bat in an innings is recorded in the scorecard as "absent"; in some scorecards, Aziz is recorded as "absent dead" in the second innings.
Aziz's death was the third instance of the death of a cricketer during a first-class cricket match, succeeding those of Maurice Nichol and Charlie Bull in the thirties. George Summers died in 1870 of a head injury sustained in a match, but he died four days after it.
Two of Aziz's brothers also played first-class cricket: Abdul Kadir played one match for North-West Frontier Province; Abdur Rasheed played 28 matches between 1953/54 and 1964/65.

La Garita Mountains

During the Oligocene epoch, a series of caldera building eruptions of titanic proportions, some as large as VEI-8, devastated what is now Colorado and raised up the mountain chain, part of the San Juan Mountains. The La Garita supervolcano's mega-colossal eruption created 5000 km3 of tephra, the largest eruption known. The volcanic hotspot has been dormant for millions of years and is now of no danger to anyone.
Today, they are one of Colorado's lesser known, but more picturesque wilderness areas, the La Garita Wilderness is, in fact, one of the state's original five. "La Garita means "the lookout" in Spanish, and this wilderness amply deserves the name. From the summit of this wilderness's single fourteener (14,014 foot San Luis Peak), climbers can gaze across the upper Rio Grande Valley and down the long stretch of the San Luis Valley. About 35 miles of the Continental Divide lie well above a sprawling forestland that provides ideal habitats for huge numbers of elk and mule deer.

<doc id="18878718" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18878718" title="Primasius of Hadrumetum">
Primasius of Hadrumetum

Primasius (died around 560) was bishop of Hadrumetum and primate of Byzacena, in Africa. One of the participants in the Three Chapters Controversy, his commentary on the Book of Revelation is of interest to modern scholars for its use of the lost commentary of Ticonius on the same book of the New Testament. According to M.L.W. Laistner, his disciples included the African theologian Junillus.
Life.
Of his early life nothing seems to be known, but in 551, after he had become a bishop, he was called with other bishops to Constantinople and took part in the Three Chapters Controversy. He shared the fortunes of Pope Vigilius and helped to condemn Theodorus Ascidas, bishop of Caesarea, the chief promoter of the controversy, and fled with Vigilius to Chalcedon. 
He declined to attend the Fifth Ecumenical Council at Constantinople in the absence of the pope, and was the sole African to sign the papal "constitutum" to Justinian; he was ingloriously crushed with his leader.
Works.
While at Constantinople, Primasius studied the exegesis of the Greeks, and his fame is chiefly due to his commentary on Revelation. This work, divided into five books, is of importance both as a witness of the pre-Cyprian Latin text of the Book of Revelation used by the North African church, and as aiding in the reconstruction of the most influential Latin commentary on Revelation, the exegetical work of the Donatist Ticonius. The text and exegesis of Revelation 20:1-21:6 are taken without attribution from Augustine of Hippo's "De civitate Dei", 20.7-17. 
The work of the Ticonius was considered by Primasius a piece of treasure adrift and belonging of right to the Church, needing only to be revised and expurgated. Ticonius had developed the theory introduced by Victorinus, to examine the different words and imagery used in different passages to convey the same message. Primasius followed this exegetical method very closely, but differed from Ticonius on the greater message of the text. Where Ticonius believed Revelation should be read in terms of the struggle of the Donatists with false brethren and gentiles, Primasius held the conflict properly lay between the Church and the world. 
Of special interest is a letter of Augustine to the physician Maximus of Thenae preserved by Primasius, in which the four philosophical cardinal virtues are combined with the later three so-called theological virtues, making the number seven, in a manner nowhere else known of Augustine.
The first edition of Primasius's commentary was by Eucharius Cervicornus (Cologne, 1535; reprinted, Paris, 1544), but the most complete and still the most valuable is that of Basel, 1544, which is based on a very ancient manuscript of the Benedictine Monastery of Murbach in Upper Alsace. The same monastery, according to a manuscript catalogue, possessed a work "Contra haereticos", which is no longer extant, and alludes to other works, especially one on Jeroboam. The commentary on the Pauline epistles and on Hebrews ascribed to Primasius by Migne is spurious.

<doc id="18878731" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18878731" title="Operation Eagle">
Operation Eagle

Operation Eagle () was an Egyptian military campaign in the Sinai Peninsula, that was launched in August 2011 to confront the Sinai insurgency. The campaign was aimed against Islamist insurgents, who had been attacking the Egyptian security forces in the Sinai and using the area as a base from which to attack Israel since early 2011. Successive Egyptian operation against insurgents in 2012, named Operation Sinai, was initially referred as the second part of Operation Eagle.
Background.
Historic perspective.
Sinai was an integral part of Egypt since the inception of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in the early 19th century. Israel briefly captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War. As part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, in 1982 Israel withdrew from the peninsula. Among the treaty's other provisions was an agreement that the peninsula would be left effectively demilitarized.
Early Islamist attacks.
The security situation in the Sinai began deteriorating early in 2011, as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Since February to August of that year, the Egypt–Israel pipeline in El-Arish was attacked five times by saboteurs.
On 30 July, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six.
On 2 August, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al-Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai.
Operation.
August 2011.
On 14–15 August 2011, having obtained prior approval from Israel's government, Egypt deployed 2,500 troops and 250 armored personnel carriers in key locations in the Sinai. The move marked the first time Egypt has deployed military forces on such a scale since its treaty with Israel in 1979. The objectives of the operation are to confront Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs threatening Egypt's national security and to restore law and order.
On 15 August, Egyptian security forces swept through a house known to be used by five leading Islamist figures. One of the five was killed; the remaining four were taken into custody.
On 16 August, a group of gunmen believed to be affiliated with jihadist movements attacked an Egyptian army checkpoint. Egypt's forces suffered no casualties in the assault.
On 17 August, two Bedouins were killed in southern Sinai. Their families blamed Egyptian police for their deaths, but the police said it was not involved in the incident.
On 18 August, a coordinated attack was staged upon Israeli military and civilians from Sinai, resulting in 6 Israeli civilians and two soldiers and 5 Egyptian soldiers killed, as well as 10 attackers.
On 26 August, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that Israel will agree for Egypt to employ thousands of troops in the Sinai.
Aftermath.
Following the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack, forces from Egypt’s army and the police engaged in an operation against armed men who have been targeting security personnel in North Sinai. A number of clashes between armed men and security forces at several security checkpoints in the Sinai occurred during this time. Initially, the press related to the 2012 operation as the continuation of Operation Eagle, though later turning to an Egyptian official name Operation Sinai (2012).
Egyptian security sources have said that over 2,000 Islamic militants reside in the Sinai region. The military said that the goal of the operation is to "restore security by pursuing and targeting armed terrorist elements in Sinai."
Reactions.
Israel.
The 1979 Camp David Accords, which established peace between Egypt and Israel, mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized.
During the beginning of the operation in 2011, Israel allowed the deployment of thousands of troops in the Sinai, with helicopters and armored vehicles, but not tanks.
During the beginning of August 2012, when Operation Eagle intensified, Israel approved a request from Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak to allow Egypt to deploy attack helicopters in the Sinai.
However, concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld, and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai, which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said, "We must make sure that every detail is upheld, otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned."
On the same day, Israeli daily "Maariv" reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the White House, protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel, and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979, which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The Israeli daily "Maariv" reported was reinforced by an article in The New York Times, which stated that Israel was “troubled” by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them. Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula, Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship. The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel’s security for decades according to the New York Times. Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai, and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat.
Israel has not issuesd a formal complaint, and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts, as well as mediation from the U.S., to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt.
On 24 August 2012, a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai. "Al Hayat" reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel. Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary, and is needed for security and to fight terrorism. However, an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place.
In late August 2012, Egyptian President Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone, and "there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces." Morsi added that the campaign was in "full respect to international treaties," although the Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai.
On 8 September, an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai.
United States.
According to CNN, in a move to increase security in the Sinai, help Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, and reassure Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is offering Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area, which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel. The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The United States is also offering increased intelligence sharing, including satellite imagery and drone flights, as well as cellphone intercepts and other communications among militants suspected of plotting attacks.
On 22 August, the State Department urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai. The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism, but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai, according to the 1979 Camp David Accords. The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai, while ensuring that "lines of communication stay open."
On 23 August, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel, and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai.
Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai.
The Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, a 1650-strong international organization created in 1979 during the Camp David Accords with peacekeeping responsibilities, kept a low profile during the intensification of Operation Eagle in 2012. A representative for the organization said that "we are unable to respond to queries from the media at this time" in response to whether Egypt asked permission to move weaponry into the Sinai, and whether Israel granted it.

Cadac Electronics

Cadac Electronics plc (Company No. 01389378 Date of Incorporation: 15 September 1978)
are a manufacturer of sound mixing desks for live music productions, theatres, recording and broadcast. Cadac desks presently are most famous for large scale musicals such as ""Phantom of the Opera"" (from 1984 till 2008), ""The Lion King"", ""Mamma Mia!"" and ""We Will Rock You"" but historically from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s were installed in famous recording studios around the world including Lansdowne Studios, Manor Studios, Wessex Studios, Scorpio Studios and George Harrison's Friar Park Studio. Clive Green retired in 2005. In early 2009 the assets and IP of the company were purchased by Mr. Xianggui Wang of the Soundking group, China.
History.
In 1967 Clive started working with Adrian Kerridge at London's Lansdowne studios, working on replacing all the valve parts for an old EMI desk with solid state technology and modifying the desk for 8 track recording. 
In 1968 Terry Brown (a sound engineer at Lansdowne and Olympic) was asked by Barry Morgan and Monty Bason to set up the new Morgan studios. He asks to buy the designs for the new desk Clive and Adrian have been working on. Clive suggests that he builds the desk for Terry, and gets together with Adrian, David Bott an engineer from "TVT", and Charles Billet of Audix (who made the frames for the desks) so Clive, Adrian, David And Charles ... CADAC is born. The first desk is delivered to Morgan, then many more in the years to come, as this is the beginning of a long relationship between Cadac and Morgan. These are 8 track split console designs with no automation and transformer balanced inputs and outputs. Many desks are still in operation in studios all over the world. The last studio desk to be installed is still at Air Edel Studios in London. Air Edel A new website with photographs is soon to be published showing the recording studios and desks.
In 1984 a sound engineer, Martin Levan, from Morgan Studios is asked to put on a live show, "Little Shop of Horrors" and the first desk is built for live theatre. (As seen in the book "the Sound of Theatre" by David Collison, published by PLASA)
Many theatres all over the world use Cadac desks and to name a few current theatrical shows using Cadac desks in the West End include: Billy Elliot, We Will Rock You, Hairspray, Jersey Boys, Lion King, and Wicked and on Broadway: 13, Avenue Q, Chicago, Guys and Dolls, Gypsy, Hairspray, Jersey Boys, Lion King, Mary Poppins, Pal Joey, South Pacific and Wicked.

Synechocystis

Synechocystis is a genus of cyanobacteria primarily represented by the strain "Synechocystis" sp. PCC6803. "S." sp. PCC6803 lives in freshwater and is capable of both phototrophic growth by oxygenic photosynthesis in sunlight and heterotrophic growth by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation during dark periods. It is able to effectively anticipate transitions of light and dark phases by using a circadian clock.
Growth and use as a model organism.
Cyanobacteria are model microorganisms for the study of photosynthesis, carbon and nitrogen assimilation, evolution of plant plastids, and adaptability to environmental stresses.
"Synechocystis" sp. PCC6803 is one of the most highly studied types of cyanobacteria as it can grow both autotrophically or heterotrophically in the absence of light. It was isolated from a freshwater lake in 1968 and is easily transformed by exogenous DNA. The photosynthetic apparatus is very similar to the one found in plants. This organism also exhibits phototactic movement.
Genome.
The genome of "Synechocystis" sp. PCC6803 is contained within one chromosome (3.57 megabases), three small plasmids (5.2, 2.4, and 2.3 kilobases) and four large plasmids (120, 106, 103, and 44 kilobases).
Light-activated heterotrophy.
"Synechocystis" sp. PCC6803 can live completely heterotrophically in the dark, but for yet unknown reasons requires a minimum of 5 to 15 minutes (blue) light per day. This regulatory role of light is intact in both PSI and PSII deficient strains.
NDH-2 is a regulatory quinone:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase global analysis of circadian gene expression indicates that translation genes are expressed at the early subjective day.
Some glycolytic genes are regulated by "sll1330" under light and glucose-supplemented conditions. One of the most important glycolytic genes is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase ("fbaA"). The mRNA level of "fbaA" is increased under light and glucose-supplemented conditions. But in "Δsll1330", "fbaA" is not increased under same conditions.

Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws

The Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws was a treaty signed on July 12, 1861 between the Choctaw and Chickasaw (American Indian Nations in Oklahoma) and the Confederate States of America. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with Cherokee chief John Ross, which was concluded in 1861. The treaty was ratified and was proclaimed on December 20, 1861 by the Confederacy. The Choctaw and Chickasaw also duly ratified the treaty.
Some Choctaws identified with the Southern cause and a few owned slaves. In addition, they well remembered and resented the Indian removals from thirty years earlier and poor service they received from the federal government. The main reason the Choctaw Nation agreed to sign the treaty, however, was for protection from regional tribes. 
Terms.
The preamble begins with, 
[[File:Holmes Colbert.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Holmes Colbert was a commissioner for the Chickasaw Nation. Colbert developed the Chickasaw Nation's constitution in the 1850s.
The treaty had 64 terms. The following abbreviated terms of the treaty were:
Signatories.
There were a total of 36 signatories.
Commissioner of the Confederate States: Albert Pike
Commissioners of the Choctaw Nation: R.M. Jones, Sampson Folsom, Forbis Leflore, Geo. W. Harkins, jr., Allen Wright, Alfred Wade, Coleman Cole, James Riley, Rufus Folsom, William B. Pitchlynn, McKee King, William King, John P. Turnbull, William Bryant.
Commissioners of the Chickasaw Nation: Edmund Pickens, Holmes Colbert, James Gamble, Joel Kemp, William Kemp, Winchester Colbert, Henry C. Colbert, James McM. Lish, Martin W. Allen, John M. Johnson, Samuel Colbert, A. Alexander, Wilson Frazier, C. Columbus, Ashalatobbe, John E. Anderson.
Aftermath.
From about 1865 to 1918, Mississippi Choctaws were largely ignored by governmental, health, and educational services and fell into obscurity. In the aftermath of the Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, freedmen and Union sympathizers. 
The Confederacy’s loss was also the Choctaw Nation’s loss. The Choctaw Nation, in what would be Oklahoma, kept slavery until 1866. After the Civil War, they were required by treaty with the United States to free the slaves within their nation. Former slaves of the Choctaw Nation were called the Choctaw Freedmen. After considerable debate, Choctaw Freedmen were granted Choctaw Nation citizenship in 1885. In post-war treaties, the US government also acquired land in the western part of the territory and access rights for railroads to be built across Indian Territory.

Pierre-François Jumeau

Pierre-François Jumeau (31 October 1811 Rémalard) – 13 August 1895 Boulevard Beaumarchais, Paris), was the founder in the 1840s of the French firm Jumeau, that produced bisque dolls and china dolls. His second son Emile-Louis Jumeau, born in 1843, began assuming management of the company in the 1870s.
Pierre-François Jumeau.
Pierre-François's family owned a fabric shop in Rémalard, south-west of Paris, in 1837. On a business trip to Paris he met and eventually married in January 1841 the niece of one of the few dollmakers in France, Lucius-Junius Herissey. Jumeau gained invaluable experience by joining the Herissey business, which had good prospects due to the improved French economy and the growth of international markets. 
In 1841 Jumeau was in partnership with Louis-Desire Belton, but started his own business a few years later after the death of his wife in 1844. By 1848 Jumeau had become the foremost doll manufacturer, had won a bronze medal at the 1849 Paris Exposition and was invited in 1851 to take part in the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London where he won a First Place Medal, the dresses being singled out for praise. The Jumeau dolls were widely acclaimed, winning numerous awards at international exhibitions. The first dolls were papier-mâché and were unmarked, causing present-day attribution problems, so that only a small number of Jumeau dolls made before the 1870s can be identified with certainty. In the 1850s glazed porcelain dolls had been added to the firm's inventory, but the bisque dolls were its greatest success, and the company acquired a reputation for the beauty, grace, elegance and quality of its products. 
In 1872, Pierre-François, unhappy with the dolls' heads from Germany, started a porcelain factory at Montreuil to produce his own heads and began supplying other dollmakers. 
From his marriage to Adèle Amélie Aumoitte, Pierre-François produced two children, Georges Eugène (1841–1873) and Emile (born 18 April 1843). Adèle died on 16 May 1843 following Emile's birth. In 1854, Pierre-François married Adélaïde Elisa Mayo who died in 1888.
Emile-Louis Jumeau.
Jumeau's second son Emile-Louis, born in 1843, who built the "Château Jumeau" or "Villa Jumeau" in Longny-au-Perche in 1866, began assuming management of the company and in 1877 he introduced the "Bébé Incassable", with a head made by Jumeau, the face of a young girl and a fully articulated composition body. Jumeau's dolls were fashionably dressed in the styles popular at the time, and often had shapely mature figures. As with modern Barbie dolls, large ranges of clothing styles and accessories were made available. In 1878 the company was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition, an honour which was proudly advertised on all their products. Further awards followed at the International Exhibitions in Sydney in 1879 and Melbourne in 1880. In 1885, at the Antwerp Exhibition, Jumeau's dolls won the "Diplôme d’Honneur", an award subsequently commemorated by being stamped on every doll made. The golden age of the company spanned the period from the late 1870s to the late 1890s when the company employed over 200 workers with an annual output of 100 000 dolls. 
Emile-Louis' expansion into the international market pushed sales to new heights. In 1879 the Emperor's sculptor, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse was commissioned by Jumeau to fashion an epicene head, to be used as that of either boy or girl. Carrier-Belleuse is reputed to have used a portrait of King Henry of Navarra at age four as model and the design became known as "Jumeau Triste". Emile-Louis becomes a Knight of the Légion d’Honneur in 1889. Henri Lioret, a French watchmaker and pioneer in the manufacture of talking machines, helps the firm develop "Bébé Phonographe", the talking doll in 1894.
The plant at Montreuil outside Paris put together the finely featured heads with glass eyes, composition bodies (originally wood or kid-leather) with jointed limbs and articulated fingers. Here they also produced hats, gloves, shoes, muffs, stockings and underwear for the dolls. Emil-Louis' wife, Ernestine Jumeau, working from the Rue Pastourelle, decided on designs and fabrics that would complete the elaborate costumes that made the Jumeau firm's dolls a household word. 
French dollmakers were eventually forced to close down by cheaper German dolls appearing on the market in the 1890s. As a final attempt at economic survival, they joined forces as the Société Française de Fabrication de Bébés et Jouets (SFBJ). When the Jumeau company finally wound up its business in 1899, the remaining stock was taken over by the SFBJ. This included large numbers of bébés, heads, bodies, costumes and other components, making attribution to Jumeau or SFBJ extremely difficult of dolls turned out during the transition period. 
Jumeau dolls are usually marked with a simple number, although the body may also be stamped. The "Tete Jumeau" is marked 'Depose Tete Jumeau' behind the head. 
The Jumeau models included "Deposes", "E. J. Bébés", "Triste", "Portrait Bébé", "Poupée de Modes", "Bébé Phonographe" and "Tete Jumeau Bébés". Some of the earlier models are much sought-after and reproduction of Jumeau dolls supports a thriving industry.

Eleo Pomare (20 October 1937 – 8 August 2008) was a Colombian-American modern dance choreographer known for his politically charged productions depicting the black experience.
He and his mother moved from Colombia to the United States in 1947. Pomare attended New York’s high school of performing arts, founded a company in 1958, dismantled it to travel to Europe to study and perform with Kurt Joos and Harold Kreutzberg, then returned to the United States in 1964 when he revived and expanded his company. Notable productions include "Missa Luba" in 1965, "Blues for the Jungle" in 1966 (portraying life in Harlem), "Las Desenamoradas" in 1967 (based on Federico García Lorca's play "The House of Bernarda Alba" set to jazz by John Coltrane), and "Narcissus Rising" in 1968 (a sensational solo portraying the psychology of a motorcycle gang member).
Pomare is often considered the angry black man of modern dance, although he does not consider himself angry or bitter. He is rather, "telling it like it is." "I'm labeled...angry...because I will not do what they want from a black dancer. They want black exotics... I have something to say and I want to say it honestly, strongly and without having it stolen, borrowed or messed over." 
The impact of Eleo Pomare as writer, dancer and choreographer has definitely helped many gain an understanding of the black experience.
Pomare died of cancer in Manhattan.

Russian fist fighting

Russian fist fighting (Russian - Кулачный бой "Kulachniy boy" "fist fighting, pugilism) is the traditional bare-knuckle boxing of Russia.
History.
The earliest accounts concerning the sport date to the 13th century.
Supposedly, fist fighting was practiced even prior to the Christianization of Kievan Rus', at celebrations dedicated to Perun.
Metropolite Kiril, in 1274, created another one of many personally-instituted rules, declaring expulsion from Christianity for any of those who fist-fight and do not sing a prayer or hymn at the burial of someone who died during a fist fight. The government itself never supported, but also never opposed fist fighting.
Russian boyars used the sport as mass entertainment, and acquired the best fighters for competitions.
The fights most often took place in holiday times and in crowded places. In winter it took place on ice. First the young children fought, then every pair was more grown up than the previous, ending with the last and most notable fist fighters.
In two orders released in 1684 and 1686 fist fighting was forbidden, but the sport continued to live.
All regions had their heroes at the sport, but the region with the most famous ones historically is Tula.
There are documents saying Peter the Great liked to organize fist fights "in order to show the ability of the Russian people".
In 1751, a mass fist fight took place on a street in Saint Petersburg, about which the Empress Elizabeth of Russia found out. After that the Empress forbade the organization of fist fights on the territory of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
During the reign of Catherine the Great, the popularity of fist fighting was growing again, and it is said that Count Orlov was a good fist fighter himself and even invited notable fist fighters to compare powers.
In 1832, Nicholas I of Russia completely forbade fist fights as "harmful fun".
Legacy.
In 1941 the most important then Soviet specialist in Boxing, K.V. Gradopolov, wrote a book about the right way to fight with fists. In that book, he offered a new exercise, called "group boxing", and he mentioned it was an ancient Russian sport (what he was talking about, was the "Stenka na Stenku" version).
Rules and types.
Every region in Russia incorporated different rules unlike the sport of boxing. In some places they fought with bare arms, while in other they stretched the sleeves over the fists. There were cases where participants would cheat by putting iron under their sleeves.
There are three types of Russian fist fighting: the first is the singles type, a one-on-one fight; the second type is a team fight also known as "wall on wall". The third one, "catch drop", was the least practiced. There were several versions of the singles fight. One version was like modern boxing, where one fighter hits the other wherever he wants or can. The other version is when the fighters take turns hitting each other. Escaping from a punch, answering it not on turn, and moving aside were not allowed; all that could be done was to use the hands to try to protect one's own body. Victory could come in few cases: when one of the fighters falls, till first blood, or till one of the fighters gives up.
The "wall-on-wall" fight (with anywhere from dozen to several hundreds participants) was performed strictly by rules and could go on for hours. Both "walls" had a chief fighter, who served as a tactician and a commanding officer. "Walls" themselves were tight straight formations 3-4 ranks deep. Repeated attacks were performed, aiming to push the opposing "wall" out of the game area. Basic tactics were used, such as breaching using heavy fighters (who were usually held in reserve), encircling, false retreat and others; but as a rule, tight wall formation never broke. Tactics also included battle planning. The "wall-on-wall" fights, while performed for entertainment, were in fact close to military training. For example, notable ethnographer V. Gilyarovsky recalled that during his voluntary service in an infantry regiment soldiers often staged wall-on-wall fistfights with factory workers.
A famous phrase in Russian, "Do not hit a man when he's down", has roots in that sport.
Fist fighting in Russian popular culture.
As for centuries fist fighting was so popular and was such a part of Russian folk life, it occurred frequently in Russian literature and art.
The most famous portrayal of a Russian fistfight is in Mikhail Lermontov's poem, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov. There, the fistfight tales place as a form of honor duel between an oprichnik (government police agent) and a merchant. It is notable that, according to Lermontov, both characters use combat gloves ('rukavitsy' — reinforced mittens). Though it may be an example of poetic license, the poem states that the first connected blow by Kalashnikov bent a large bronze cross hanging from his opponent's neck, and the second fractured the opponent's temple, killing him. The fight also features in the opera "The Merchant Kalashnikov" by Anton Rubinstein (1880).
In the 19th century Sergei Aksakov watched famous fist fights in the Kaban frozen lake in Kazan, and later wrote about them in his "Story about student life". Some decades later, at the same lake, the young future opera-singer Feodor Chaliapin took part in a similar fight: "From one side came we, the Russians of Kazan, from the other side the Tatars. We fought hard without feeling sorry for ourselves, but never broke the historic rules of not to hit one that is already down, not to kick, and not to keep iron up one's sleeves". Later, the young Chaliapin was attacked in a fight over a girl, but thanks to knowing fist fighting he won. He wrote: "He jumped to beat me, and even though I was afraid of the police, learning fist fighting at the frozen lakes of Kazan helped me, and he humiliatingly lost".
The Russian poet Sergei Yesenin in his autobiography notes "About myself" told that his grandfather taught him fist fighting.
One of the heroes in the book "Thief" by the Soviet novelist Leonid Leonov said: "In childhood, it happened, only in fist fights I found real friends... And was never wrong! Because only in a fight the whole human nature comes out".
Claims have been made that the Russian nobility favoured fistfights over duels, but on the other hand it has been suggested that the nobility actually were against fistfights and preferred weapons.

Hunt Report

The Hunt Report was produced by a committee headed by Baron Hunt in 1969 to "examine the recruitment, organisation, structure and composition of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Ulster Special Constabulary and their respective functions and to recommend as necessary what changes are required to provide for the efficient enforcement of law and order in Northern Ireland." Robert Mark was also a member of the committee.
His recommendations resulted in the reshaping of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the formation of the Ulster Defence Regiment.

American Independence Museum

The American Independence Museum is a historic house museum located in Exeter, New Hampshire. Its campus includes two buildings: the Ladd-Gilman House, a registered National Historic Landmark built in 1721 by Nathaniel Ladd, and the Folsom Tavern, built in 1775 by Colonel Samuel Folsom. The museum was opened in 1991 after a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence known as a Dunlap Broadside was found in the Ladd-Gilman house, 200 years after its arrival in Exeter. It is the centerpiece of the museum’s collection. The museum’s mission is “Connecting America’s Revolutionary past with the present.”
History.
The American Independence opened in 1991, six years after a Dunlap Broadside was found in the attic floorboards of the Ladd-Gilman House. In August 1985, an electrician was wiring for a security system, when he pulled from under the attic floor old newspaper clippings and the Broadside. The electrician contacted the Society, who had the document authenticated. The Society opened the museum to educate visitors about the Declaration and the American Revolution. Since the museum’s opening, the museum has restored the Folsom Tavern, adding additional material and space to the museum. The museum now focuses on Revolutionary history and the role of Exeter and the Gilman family in the forming of the new nation.
Ladd-Gilman House.
The Ladd-Gilman House was the home of an 18th-century merchant family whose members played key roles in the birth of the United States. Nicholas Gilman, Sr. served as the New Hampshire state treasurer during the American Revolution when the capital of New Hampshire moved from Portsmouth to Exeter. Eldest son John Taylor Gilman read the Declaration of Independence to the citizens of Exeter in 1776 and later became New Hampshire governor for 14 non-consecutive terms between 1794 and 1805, and then again in 1813 to 1816. Nicholas Gilman, Jr. was a member of the Continental Army and a signer of the U.S. Constitution. In the early 20th century, the Society of the Cincinnati of New Hampshire purchased the building from the Gilman family and used the building as its meeting house, before converting the building into the museum. There are 7 rooms in the house open to the public for tours, with later additions now housing museum administration and a research library.
Folsom Tavern.
Exeter was the capital of New Hampshire when Colonel Samuel Folsom built his tavern in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, it was the site of many passionate political debates and was a popular spot with men of the town after. It was originally located on the corner of Court and Mill streets (now Front and Water streets). The New Hampshire chapter of the Society of Cincinnati formed in the tavern in 1783. George Washington stopped at the tavern for a collation on November 4, 1789, during his tour of the states. After Col. Folsom’s death in 1790, the tavern was willed to his widow and his two daughters who continued to operate the tavern, and became known as “Widow Folsom’s Tavern”. It stayed in the Folsom family until 1856.
In 2004, the tavern was moved to its current location on museum grounds, at the intersection of Spring and Water Streets. Extensive restoration on the building included the installation of a new roof and clapboards. Interior restoration began in 2006, after receiving a grant from New Hampshire's Land and Community Heritage Investment Program. The tavern opened in 2007, and is now part of the museum's regular tour. It is also used as a programming location for the museum, and is often rented out by third parties.
Collections.
The museum's collection of historical artifacts includes the Dunlap Broadside, two rare draft copies of the U.S. Constitution and a Badge of Military Merit (the original Purple Heart), awarded by General George Washington to soldiers demonstrating extraordinary bravery. Some of the museum’s other collections are period furniture, decorative arts from the 18th and 19th centuries, 18th century weaponry, military ephemera, letters, documents, and portraits of American statesmen.
Dunlap Broadside.
In 1985, the Broadside of the Declaration of Independence was found in the upstairs floorboards when electricians were wiring a security system for the house. This particular copy was the 23rd copy found, and now one of 26 existing copies. These copies of the Declaration were printed by John Dunlap, the night of July 4th. Dunlap was asked to print at least 150 and no more than 200 copies of the broadside. One was to go to each of the state capitals, military encampments, and several sent to England to inform King George III. The museum's particular broadside reached Exeter on July 16, 1776, and was read by John Taylor Gilman, the eldest son of the Gilman household, to the people of Exeter. 
Programming.
The museum is open seasonally, June through October, Thursday through Saturday, from 10am to 4pm. Guided tours of the Ladd-Gilman House and Folsom Tavern are available at 10 am, noon and 2 pm; self-guided tours are available until 3 pm. The museum hosts a variety of public programs; the largest is the American Independence Festival, held annually during July. The Festival engages thousands of visitors in the nation's 18th century heritage.
American Independence Festival.
The American Independence Festival, previously known as the Revolutionary War Festival, is an annual festival produced by the American Independence Museum. The Festival, held the 3rd Saturday in July, commemorates the original reading of the Dunlap Broadside in Exeter on July 16, 1776. The opening celebration starts with a parade of reenactors and a reading of the Declaration of Independence to festival-goers. The original Dunlap Broadside is displayed in the museum during the Festival. In addition, artisans engage visitors with traditional crafts; craft and local non-profit booths and food vendors round out the event. The event attracts thousands of visitors every year.
The next American Independence Festival is July 20, 2013.

Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick album)

Heartbreaker is a 1982 album by Dionne Warwick, her fourth for the Arista label.

"Heartbreaker" is one of the most successful albums of Warwick's career. It is her most successful international album, having sold an estimated three million copies worldwide. In the United States, the album was certified Gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies. It also stands as Warwick's biggest success in the United Kingdom, where it reached #3 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified Platinum.
The title track, which was the album's lead single, hit the Pop Top 10 as well as #1 Adult Contemporary in the United States and was a global smash. Follow-up singles "Take The Short Way Home" and "All The Love In The World" were also successful.
Production.
The songs of "Heartbreaker", with the exception of the final track, a cover of "Our Day Will Come", were initially recorded by Barry Gibb in February 1982 as a set of demos for the album. (These demo recordings were eventually released in 2006 as the album "The Heartbreaker Demos".) Warwick recorded the songs during the spring of 1982, and the album was released to massive acclaim and success that fall.
The LP was originally issued as number AL-9609 in the Arista Catalog.
The Heartbreaker Demos.
The Heartbreaker Demos is a demo version of the album by Barry Gibb. Originally circulating on tape among collectors and later also on CD the album saw a legitimate and wide release on iTunes in October 2006. The album does not include the non-Gibb composition "Our Day Will Come".

Mitević made a statement about the nature of state media in Serbia under Milošević's guidance: "The things that happened at state TV: warmongering, things we can admit to now: false information, biased reporting. That went directly from Milošević to the head of TV".

The Liga Colombiana de Radioaficionados (LCRA) (in English Colombian Amateur Radio League) is a national non-profit organization for amateur radio enthusiasts in Colombia. The organization was founded in 1933 by Italo Amore, Gustavo Uribe, Roberto Jaramillo Ferro, and other radio enthusiasts. At the time, all radio transmissions were authorized by the Ministry of Posts, who opposed a private amateur radio service. With LCRA lobbying efforts, private radio broadcasts were authorized in Colombia in 1936, and amateur radio was first licensed in Colombia in 1939.
Key membership benefits of LCRA include the sponsorship of amateur radio operating awards and radio contests, and a QSL bureau for those members who regularly communicate with amateur radio operators in other countries. LCRA represents the interests of Colombian amateur radio operators before Colombian and international telecommunications regulatory authorities. LCRA is the national member society representing Colombia in the International Amateur Radio Union.

Robert Crawford (Scottish poet)

Robert Crawford FRSE FBA (born 1959) is a Scottish poet, scholar and critic. He is currently Professor of English at the University of St Andrews.
Early life.
He was born in Bellshill and grew up in Cambuslang. He was educated at a private school in Glasgow, Hutchesons' Grammar School and at Glasgow University, where he received his M.A. degree. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford where he received his D. Phil.
Family.
His paternal grandfather was a Minister in the Church of Scotland and he considers himself a "Christian with a Presbyterian accent, rather than a Protestant", which he feels has rather assertive overtones in the contemporary West of Scotland. He has written on the relationship between science and religion as well as religious poetry.
Themes.
His main interest is in Post-Enlightenment Scottish literature, including Robert Burns and Robert Fergusson, but he has a keen interest in contemporary poetry, including Edwin Morgan, Douglas Dunn and Liz Lochhead. He is a prolific and successful poet himself, and concerns himself with the nature and processes of creative writing. He has a particular interest in the work of T. S. Eliot and other aspects of Modernism.
He is interested in the relationship between literature, particularly poetry, and modern science, including Information Technology. He says he shares an appreciation of ‘"poetry and science as kinds of discovery quickened by observation and imagination’". He even goes so far as to claim that 'It "is part of the poet's delight even duty, to use such words and experience in poetry'".
The geography and place names of Scotland feature very prominently in his own poems and he takes a lively interest in the developing politics of contemporary Scotland. As well as science, politics, religion, landscape, and environment and spirituality, his poems deal with gender and sex (particularly married sex).
Language.
Crawford writes in a modern English, with a few nods to dialect words, with an occasional made-up word, or one borrowed from technical science. The main forms he uses are short and lyrical. He has translated from the 17th Century Latin of the Aberdeenshire poet Arthur Johnston.
He was a founder of the international magazine "Verse" in 1984, and worked as poetry editor for the Edinburgh publisher Polygon in the 1990s. With Simon Armitage, he is co-editor of The Penguin Book of Poetry from Britain and Ireland since 1945 (1998) and with Mick Imlah he co-edited The New Penguin Book of Scottish Verse (2000). He publishes poetry, and occasional works of criticism in the London Review of Books and the Times Literary Supplement.
Awards.
He has won several prizes, notably <br>
1988 Eric Gregory Award<br>
1993 Scottish Arts Council Book Award for "Identifying Poets"<br>
1999 Scottish Arts Council Book Award for "Spirit Machines"<br>
2007 Saltire Society's Scottish Research Book of the Year for "Scotland's Books; The Penguin History of Scottish Literature,"<br>
He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
In August 2011 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.
Reviews.
His work has met with critical acclaim. 
The voice of this poetry is engaging and likeable.<br>
- Peter McDonald, Literary Review
His Selected Poems is a revelation. Crawford is a very fine poet indeed. This book is aglitter with surprise, with new ways of seeing, of hearing, and of feeling... This astounding collection, rich also in wit, is a book to be homesick for.<br>
- Candia McWilliam, The Scotsman <br>
Hugh MacDiarmid once wrote a poem which contained the line: "Scotland small? Our multiform, our infinite Scotland small ?" Over the past dozen years, Robert Crawford has devoted much industry to soothing MacDiarmid's incredulity. Crawford specialises in poems about Scottish places and people, eulogising not only literary figures but scientists and engineers, such as Henry Bell, James Clerk Maxwell and John Logie Baird, men associated with railways, steam and primitive models of the television. The native genius blends with native chippiness in lines such as: "When World War II ended / Baird equipment broadcast victory in the Savoy / But not one diner said cheerio when you faded".
Leaving this aside, what's appealing about Crawford is the musicality of his language, the surety of his lines and use of enjambement, all abundantly on display in his new "Selected Poems". The pieces included here from his first collection, "A Scottish Assembly" (1990), still feel fresh and energetic, the work of a young writer in the best sense -- inventive, varied, alive with the possibilities inherent in the act of putting words together.
This is primarily a book about contemporary poetry, and what poetry can do now, as seen through its engagement with aspects of contemporary science. It is only fleetingly a book about ‘science and poetry’, where the relationship between two kinds of discipline might be propounded, and it is all the better for letting such moves remain incidental.
Robin Purves has found him a bad poet:
In his collection of essays, "Identifying Poets", Robert Crawford claims to use Bakhtin to examine "the way 20th Century poets construct for themselves an identity which allows them to identify with or to be identified with a particular territory" (1) and how they "come to be taken as spokespeople for these territories". (2) A skim through the contents page of his first book of poems, A Scottish Assembly, ...an orgy of naming which at least suggests, before I have examined a single poem in detail, that Crawford's own poetic project is an attempt to "construct for an identity which allows [him to identify with or to be identified with a particular territory" (3), a strategy which ought to result in him being "taken as spokes" (4) for the territory called Scotland, if the argument in Identifying Poets is to believed. The following essay reads Crawford's poem "Scotland" in an attempt to isolate the points where its rhetoric and syntax go hand-in-hand with a mystificatory and unreflective politics of place.

Shan Women's Action Network

The Shan Women’s Action Network (: abbreviated SWAN), is an organization of Shan women active in Shan State and Thailand, working to attain gender equality and achieve justice for Shan women in the struggle for social and political change in Burma.
Through its affiliation with local, regional and international women's organizations, SWAN establishes common platforms to promote the role of women from Burma in the struggle for democracy and human rights in the country.
Set up on 28 March 1999 by a group of Shan women seeking to address the practical and strategic needs of Shan women, SWAN established the informal networks already in place between the various Shan women’s projects, therefore strengthening and supporting them. The network is also a founding member of the Women’s League of Burma (WLB), an umbrella organization comprising twelve women’s groups from Burma.
Objectives.
The Network’s main objectives are: 
The Shan women's network would also be able to coordinate with other women's organizations from Burma, as well as GOs and NGOs working with women locally, nationally and internationally.
Currently the network is engaged in several programs designed to improve the situations of many Shan women, in areas such as education, health, women’s empowerment, crisis support and income generation.
Recognition.
On 31 October 2005, SWAN activist Charm Tong visited the White House to discuss the Burmese political situation with US president George W. Bush, National Security Advisor Stephen J. Hadley and other senior US officials. "I am very happy ... to break the silence of what is happening to the people of Burma", she told reporters afterward. Congressman Tom Lantos, co-founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, predicted that Charm Tong's 50 minutes with Bush "would reverberate around the world". "The Irrawaddy" wrote in December of that year that lobbyists were attributing Bush's subsequent "outspokenness on Burma" to "the Charm Tong Effect".
For her work with SWAN in investigating and publicizing abuses against Shan women by the Burmese military, Charm Tong received the "Marie Claire Women of the World Award" in 2004 and "The Reebok Human Rights Award" in 2005.> She also received the 2007 Student Peace Prize, which was awarded to her at the International Student Festival in Trondheim. In 2008, she was given a Vital Voices Global Leadership Award in the area of human rights, which was presented to her by Laura Bush.

<doc id="18879306" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18879306" title="Keller v. State Bar of California">
Keller v. State Bar of California

Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1 (1990), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that attorneys who are required to be members of a state bar association have a First Amendment right to refrain from subsidizing the organization’s political or ideological activities.
Introduction.
Attorneys licensed to practice in California are required by law to be members of, and pay dues to, the State Bar of California. In this action, 21 California attorneys sued the State Bar, objecting to the agency's use of its members' dues to fund political and ideological activities that the members did not support. The attorneys argued that such use of their compulsory dues violated their right to freedom of speech and freedom of association, or more precisely, the freedom "not" to associate, under the First Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Facts of the case.
In 1982, when the complaint in this case was filed, the State Bar of California was an active voice on political issues, both within California and nationally. The State Bar lobbied on matters pending before the legislature and before other state agencies, filed briefs in politically charged cases, and convened a Conference of Delegates to adopt resolutions taking positions on highly contentious political and ideological issues. 
The objecting attorneys challenged the use of their dues for (1) lobbying on issues such as gun control, the death penalty, special education, exclusions from gift taxes, voter approval of low-rent housing projects, and immigration; (2) filing amicus curiae briefs in cases involving the constitutionality of a victim's bill of rights, the power of a workers’ compensation board to discipline attorneys, a requirement that attorney-public officials disclose names of clients, and the disqualification of a law firm; and (3) the adoption of resolutions by the State Bar's Conference of Delegates endorsing a gun control initiative, disapproving the statements of a United States senatorial candidate regarding court review of a victim’s bill of rights, endorsing a nuclear weapons freeze initiative, and opposing federal legislation limiting federal-court jurisdiction over abortions, public school prayer, and busing. The plaintiffs asked for an injunction forbidding the State bar from using mandatory dues for ideological or political purposes.
Prior history.
The trial court granted summary judgment to the State Bar, ruling that, as a government agency, the Bar itself had a First Amendment right to engage in political speech. This ruling was reversed by the California Court of Appeal, which, in a published decision, found that the State Bar's activities were similar to those of a labor union, and its authority to use mandatory dues for political or ideological purposes was similarly constrained. This opinion in turn was reversed by the California Supreme Court in 1989. That court found that the State Bar functioned essentially as a government agency, and scrutinizing the Bar's activities under the First Amendment would impose an "extraordinary burden" on the organization's mission. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in 1989.
Decision of the Court.
In a unanimous decision by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that attorneys may be compelled to belong to the State Bar, but that their mandatory dues could be used only to regulate the legal profession or improve the quality of legal services available to the people of the state. Reasoning that membership in the State Bar was analogous to membership in a labor union, the Court held that the Bar would have to implement the procedures established in Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson, that is, the objectors were entitled to an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.
Subsequent history.
The State Bar was slow to comply with the "Keller", decision, resulting in a follow-up lawsuit in 1991 brought by the second-named plaintiff in "Keller", Raymond L. Brosterhous, and 40 other attorneys who objected to the Bar’s continued use of their dues for political and ideological activities. This litigation eventually resulted in a court order that the Bar’s Conference of Delegates, lobbying, special activities designed to promote the careers of women and minorities, and other social and political programs could not constitutionally be funded by compulsory Bar dues.

<doc id="18879321" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18879321" title="American Dream Demonstration">
American Dream Demonstration

In banking, the American Dream Demonstration (ADD) was a program proxy developed to test the potential impact of Individual Development Accounts (IDA) and ran from 1997-2002. During its tenure, the ADD program demonstrated through 2,377 accounts, that IDAs can be delivered effectively by a wide range of community organizations and financial institutions. The ADD initiative was evaluated by eight different research methods including implementation assessment, participant case studies, cross sectional-survey, monitoring, in-depth interviews, cost analysis, experimental impact evaluation and assessment of community effects.
Individual families.
During the six-year ADD demonstration, 2,364 low-income individuals became accountholders. It was evaluated that those with the lowest incomes in ADD’s saved more than those who earned more, with 46% were below the poverty line and 21% at less than half of the poverty line. Incomes averaged $9,843 for a single person and $16,687 for a family of three—116% of the federal poverty level. The median annual household income was $16,296. 
Of those 2,346 individuals who wished to withdrawal after an average of 2 years of savings in 2002, 28% of accountholders bought homes, 23% started their own business, 23% paid for post-secondary education, 18% repaired their homes, and 7% saved for retirement.
Private partners.
ADD developed a parallel account structure which keeps matching funds in an account accessible only to the program staff for private financial institutions which eliminated fraud and misuse of funds. 
Over 80% of accountholders approved of the withdrawal restrictions, and grew their IDA’s five times as large in savings than they would have in any other liquid bank account and savings they had before opening their IDA. Together, accountholders saved a total of $1,248,678—an average net savings of $19.07 a month over a span of two years. Average and total gross savings were much higher—$40 per month for a total of $2,530,538. 
By the end of 2001, accountholders had saved an average of $528 and the matching funds brought this up to $1,543. With the matching funds, ADD generated total savings of $3,648,149.
Impact of ADD.
ADD’s delivery of significant data propelled federal and state governments to implement additional IDA policies. As a result, more than 20,000 IDAs have opened in more than 500 community partnerships throughout the country. Currently, a federal legislation is in the works that would reach nearly hundreds of thousands and potentially millions of accountholders.

Bolton Parish Church, East Lothian

Bolton Parish Church is a church in Bolton, East Lothian, Scotland. It is part of the Church of Scotland and (along with Saltoun Parish Church) serves the parish of Bolton and Saltoun.
History and features of the church.
The earliest church at Bolton was erected in around 1240. It was placed under the superiority of the Canons of Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh, and remained so for the next three hundred years. By 1804 the church had fallen into disrepair and the heritors agreed that something must be done.
In January 1805 the heritors met and decided that a new church should be built instead of repairing the old one, and that the new church should be capable of containing 250 people. By the end of 1809 the new church was built. In 1930 the pulpit was moved to its present position at the side of the East window, the choir was removed and other changes were made. In 1957 a central aisle was introduced and this further reduced the seating.
In the church porch is a Victorian "graveguard", a contrivance designed to thwart body-snatchers who sought to steal from the graveyard newly buried corpses for sale to the medical schools in Edinburgh. The graveguard and its accessories are on display in the church porch.
Buried under the church's aisles are the Lords Blantyre and the Stuarts of Eaglescairnie.
A notable possession of Bolton Church is the Bolton Hearse, a horse-drawn vehicle believed to be the earliest surviving piece of Scottish coachwork still in existence. The hearse is kept in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

Jane Wiedlin (album)

Jane Wiedlin is the debut album by Jane Wiedlin, released in 1985 on I.R.S. Records. It was her first solo album after leaving New Wave group The Go-Go's. The track "My Traveling Heart" dealt with Wiedlin's feelings about the breakup of the band.
"Blue Kiss" was released as the lead single, reaching 77 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 30 on Hot Dance Club Play. The album itself reached 127 on the Billboard 200.
Critical response.
In "Rolling Stone", Joyce Millman wrote: "Wiedlin's taste for the offbeat and her punchy pop know-how as well as the record's pinball-arcade bustle of guitars, synths and sound effects keep things fizzing. Wiedlin's thin, childlike voice is a problem, however; she doesn't have much range or lung power, and when she strains to shout, she detracts from otherwise first-rate songs. But Wiedlin has the savvy to know when and how to dish out a joke at her own expense".
Stewart Mason on allmusic states: "Aside from the unfortunately slick mid-'80s production, Jane Wiedlin's 1985 solo debut is probably the best solo album by any ex-member of the Go-Go's. The singles 'Modern Romance' and 'Blue Kiss' really should have been hits (they're certainly better than most of Belinda Carlisle's solo work), and the best of the album tracks trade the pertness of the Go-Go's for a slightly more mature, world-weary vibe".

He has completed investigative and web journalism training at several institutions, including the International Journalism Summer School in London and the Online Journalism course at the Berlin-based Centre for investigative journalism.
Career.
Krenar Gashi's investigative work has stretched from investigating fake personal documents in Kosovo, weapons smuggling, to investigations on war crimes and groups of ethnic Albanian fighters operating in Kosovo. 
In 2006 Gashi led a BIRN an undercover investigation into illegal activities of passport smugglers in Kosovo and the network of passport scams which describe the current identification documents situation in Kosovo. In the investigation Gashi examined the market that the racketeers have set up, posing as mediators between ordinary people and complex government institutions in the region.
The investigation on Kosovan passports was republished by "Korieri Newspaper" in Albania, Focus Agency in Bulgaria, "Epoka e Re", "Gazeta Express", "Koha Ditore" and "Kosova Sot" in Kosovo, "PCNEN" in Montenegro, Hotnews, Euractiv and "România Liberă" in Romania, B92, Beta, Tanjug, "The Belgrade Times" and "Danas" in Serbia.
In 2007 BIRN published Gashi's investigation that revealed the booming illegal weapons’ market in Kosovo. The major findings of the report were that there is a growing market of illegal trade of weapons in Kosovo and that this market is being stimulated by lax laws of the international administration.

Following this widely-republished investigative report, the UN administration in Kosovo, UNMIK, initiated changes in legislation about weapon possession and also altered the licensing procedures. 
His latest investigative work, include reports that look into several separate groups of ethnic Albanian fighters operating in Kosovo and corrupted officials within the Government of Kosovo. Apart from these reports, Gashi has covered intensively all ongoing events in Kosovo through numerous analytical articles.
In the days leading up to the 17 February 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Gashi served as Kosovo stringer for many media, including "The New York Times", BBC and ORF. He was Kosovo correspondent for London's "Financial Times", where he still writes occasionally. His investigative reports for BIRN's Balkan Insight have been republished elsewhere in the media and have made the front pages of newspapers in the region.
In May 2009, Gashi joined KIPRED to serve as Research Director of Kosovo's leading think tank.

Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica

Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica is a convent for Cistercian nuns, situated in Trzebnica () north of Wrocław, in Silesia, Poland, founded in 1203. After few decades of abandonment in the 19th century, it is an abbey of the Sisters of Mercy of St. Borromeo since 1889.
History.
The abbey was established by the Silesian Piast duke Henry I the Bearded and his wife Saint Hedwig of Andechs (), confirmed by Pope Innocent III. The legend of its foundation relates that once Duke Henry when out hunting fell into a swamp from which he could not extricate himself. In return for the rescue from this perilous position, he vowed to build the abbey. With Hedwig's consent, her brother Ekbert of Andechs, then Bishop of Bamberg, chose the first nuns that occupied the convent. The first abbess was Petrussa from Kitzingen Abbey; she was followed by Gertrude, the daughter of Hedwig. The abbey was richly endowed with lands by Duke Henry. When Hedwig became a widow in 1238, she went to live at Trzebnica and was buried there. 
Up to 1515, the abbesses were first princesses of the Piast dynasty and afterwards members of the nobility. It is said that towards the end of the thirteenth century the nuns numbered 120. The abbey also became a mausoleum of many rulers of the fragmented Silesian Piasts. In 1672 there were 32 nuns and 6 lay sisters, in 1805 there were 23 nuns and 6 lay sisters. The abbey suffered from all kinds of misfortunes both in the Middle Ages and later: from famine in 1315, 1338, 1434, and 1617, from disastrous fires in 1413, 1432, 1464, 1486, 1505, 1595, and 1782. At the Protestant Reformation, most of the nuns were Poles, as were the majority until during the eighteenth century. The abbey of Trebnitz suffered so greatly during the Thirty Years War that the nuns fled across the border on the territory of the mostly unaffected Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as they did again in 1663 when the Turks threatened Silesia.
In 1742, in the aftermath of the First Silesian War and the Treaty of Breslau, Trebnitz found itself under the governance of Protestant Prussia and started to suffer from political discrimination. The last abbess, Dominica von Giller, died on 17 August 1810, and on 11 November 1810, the abbey was suppressed and secularized by order of King Frederick William III. The building, which was very extensive, was sold later and turned into a cloth factory. In late 19th century, the ruined abbey was bought by Knights Hospitaller and later by female order of Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo as a hospital conducted by the sisters. 
Abbey church.
The church, a basilica with pillars in the late Romanesque style, to which Baroque additions were made from 1741. It features several paintings with scenes from the life of St. Hedwig by Michael Willmann. After the secularisation of the abbey, it became the Trebnitz parish church. 
The grave of St. Hedwig is located in a chapel to the right of the high altar, donated by her grandson Archbishop Ladislaus of Salzburg in 1267. The grave of Duke Henry I, her husband, is in front of the altar.

Vanessa Harding

Leslie Culton (born October 11, 1970) better known by her ring name Vanessa Harding, is a semi-retired American professional wrestler and manager who has competed in North American independent promotions throughout the early 2000s including Full Impact Pro, Future of Wrestling, the Heartland Wrestling Association, Ohio Valley Wrestling and NWA Florida. She has also had short stints in Ring of Honor, World League Wrestling and Women's Extreme Wrestling. She is also known as Elle Cee, where she has appeared in several adult films, such as on the bangbus.com website.
Professional wrestling career.
Training.
Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Harding frequently moved around up until adulthood. While living in Zephyr Hills, Florida, she became interested in professional wrestling after seeing Dusty Rhodes on "Championship Wrestling from Florida". However, it was after she began regularly watching wrestling with an ex-boyfriend that she began to consider a career in professional wrestling. Hardy received much of her initial training from independent wrestlers Black Knight and Robbie Chance, however she also received training from others on the independent circuit including Mana (of the Samoan Island Tribe), Navy Seal, Pat Powers, Al Hardeman, Virgil and Dory Funk, Jr., among others. Harding later attended the IWA wrestling school.
2003–2005.
She moved to St Petersburg, Florida and began managing wrestlers in Southeastern promotions. Harding began to build a solid reputation as a heel manager frequently using typical outside interference such as holding a leg down or more direct attacks including using the ring ropes to choke another wrestler, kicking him while outside the ring or using an eye gouge or neckbreaker. Among those she managed included Robbie Chance and The Heartbreak Express in Full Impact Pro. She also managed The Nighthawk in Southern Championship Wrestling and the National Wrestling Alliance.
Later, as a wrestler, she also faced Luna Vachon on September 25, 2003. In October, Harding appeared in IPW Hardcore where she managed Mideon in his feud with Antonio Banks, and later Danny Doring, for almost a year before leaving to continue training. The following year, Harding managed Lexie Fyfe in her feud against Malia Hosaka and appeared on several PPV events for Woman's Extreme Wrestling. She also worked for Major League Wrestling as "Ring Girl".
In mid-2004, Harding took part in the first-ever professional wrestling national tour of the People's Republic of China. Organized by NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, the tour began with its inaugural show, "The Brawl at the Wall", held in Beijing near the Great Wall of China. Between August 15 to September 10, "The Great Brawl of China" tour visited Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Wrestlers who appeared on the 4-week tour included former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, The Barbarian, Glacier as well as NWA MACW Junior Heavyweight Champion Rikki Nelson, Chris Hamrick, Andrue Bane and Bruiser Bradley. Female wrestlers, the first to compete in China, included Malia Hosaka, Brandy Wine, Jenny Taylor and Amber Holly. Harding and So-Cal Val also made their NWA MACW debuts on the tour. In September 2004, Harding was introduced as Ms. Blue (or Ms. Blu) in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) as the newest member of manager Kenny Bolin's stable "Bolin Services" in September 2004. Later that year, in Georgia Championship Wrestling, she would also make a failed attempt to defeat GCW Women's International Champion Christie Ricci on November 27, 2004.
On February 25, 2005, Harding made a one-time appearance for Ring of Honor in Dayton, Ohio as a valet and manager for Jimmy Rave and The Embassy. Later, she interfered in a match between Rave and A.J. Styles causing Styles to be pinned after Harding sprayed bug spray into his eyes. Feuding with Lady Victoria in the World Wrestling Alliance in late February, Harding defeated Syren by disqualification at an event for Hoosier Pro Wrestling on March 5, and in a tag team match with Fantasia, lost to Team Blondage (Krissy Vaine and Amber O'Neal) at a show for Carolina Championship Wrestling in Lenoir, North Carolina a week later. After a near 15 minute match, Fantasia was pinned by O'Neal while Vaine helped hold her down. Returning to Hoosier Pro Wrestling, she would defeat Lady Victoria in a singles match and later in a mixed tag team match teaming with Beech to defeat Lady Victoria & Robbie Chance on April 2. In one of her last appearances on OVW television on June 4, Harding fought to a no contest with Alexis Laree after Laree and Mike Mondo became involved in an altercation in which she slapped Mondo after he had kissed her. At the Independent Association of Wrestling supercard "Clash at the Cove", Harding lost to Jacqueline in a three-way match with Krystal Carmichael for the IAW Championship at Coveleski Stadium in South Bend, Indiana on June 25. Harding left OVW in August planning to take a year off from competition. On September 2, Harding appeared at the 2005 Dragon*Con against Lexie Faye at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta Hotel. The following night, Harding was eliminated by Lady Victoria in a three-way dance with Lexie Fyfe.
2006–2008.
In January 2006, Harding began touring Italy appearing with Nu-Wrestling Evolution losing to Nikita on January 29, 2006. On March 25, 2007, Harding faced Hellena Heavenly at the "Heartbreakers" supercard. In August 2008, Harding made an appearance for Lady Victoria's "Ringin' Wet & Wild" show at the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Held at the Buffalo Chip Campground, Harding faced Christie Ricci, Sybil Starr and Lady Victoria in matches held at several locations at the campground and amphitheater.

<doc id="18879580" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18879580" title="Pikachurin">
Pikachurin

Pikachurin, also known as agrin-like protein (AGRINL) and EGF-like, fibronectin type-III and laminin G-like domain-containing protein (EGFLAM), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "EGFLAM" gene.
Pikachurin is a dystroglycan-interacting protein which has an essential role in the precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites. The binding with dystroglycan (DG) depends on several factors (glycosylation of DG, presence of divalent cations, presence of other proteins).
A non-correct binding between pikachurin and DG is associated with muscular dystrophies that often involve eye abnormalities.
Discovery and nomenclature.
Pikachurin is an extracellular matrix-like retinal protein first described in 2008 in Japan by Shigeru Sato et al., and named after Pikachu, a character of the "Pokémon" franchise. The name of this "nimble" protein was inspired due to Pikachu's "lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects".
Pikachurin was initially identified in a microarray analysis of gene expression profiles of the retinas of wild-type and Otx2 knockout mice. A RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that Otx2 regulates the expression of pikachurin, it was known because there was an absence of expression of pikachurin in the Otx2 mice retina, so it indicates that Otx2 regulates pikachurin. The localization of pikachurin to synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse was determined using fluorescent antibodies. Tissue targeting of gene disruption of pikachurin was used to determine that this protein is necessary for proper synaptic signal transmission and visual function. α-dystroglycan was shown to interact with pikachurin through immunoprecipitation.
Pikachurin-dystroglycan interaction.
Dystroglycan ligand with other proteins is essential. Glycosylation of dystroglycan is necessary for its ligand binding activity. Mutations in glycosyltransferase enzymes cause abnormal glycosylation of dystroglycan. This hypoglycosylation is associated with less binding with other proteins and causes some congenital muscular dystrophy. Pikachurin is the most recently identified dystroglycan ligand protein and is localized in the synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. The binding between dystroglycan and pikachurin requires divalent cations. Ca2+ produces strongest binding; Mn2+ produces only faint bindings and no binding with Mg2+ alone. Dystroglycan has different domains that allow multiple Ca2+ sites to form a stable pikachurin-dystroglycan connection. This shows that pikachurin can form oligomeric structures; and suggests the possibility of clustering effects can be important in modulating pikachurin-dystroglycan interactions.
Another thing to be considered is that the presence of NaCl (0.5M) strongly inhibits interaction between DG and other ligand proteins but has a modest inhibitory effect with pikachurin-DG ligand. This shows that are differences between the binding of pikachurin-DG binding and DG binding with other proteins.
Pikachurin seems to have more domains to bind with DG than other proteins. For example, experiments in ligand competition shows that presence of pikachurin inhibits laminin-111 binding with DG, but high concentrations of laminin-111 do not inhibit pikachurin binding to DG.
Function.
The protein is colocalized with both dystrophin and dystroglycan at the ribbon synapses.
Pikachurin, along with laminin, perlecan, agrin, neurexin, binds to α-dystroglycan in the extracellular space. As such, pikachurin, as well as the other previously-mentioned proteins, is necessary for the proper functioning of dystroglycan. Pikachurin is necessary for the apposition of presynaptic and postsynaptic termini in the ribbon synapse; deletion of pikachurin causes an abnormal electroretinogram, similarly to the deletion of nestin.
Ribbon synapse relation.
Synapse formation is crucial for the mammalian CNS (central nervous system) to function correctly. Retinal photoreceptors finish at the axon terminal which forms a specialized structure, the ribbon synapse, which specifically connects photoreceptor synaptic terminals with bipolar and horizontal cell terminals in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina.
It is clear that Pikachurin, an extracellular matrix–like retinal protein, is localized to the synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. It is demonstrated that with a lack of Pikachurin, there is an improper apposition of the bipolar cell dendritic tips to the photoreceptor ribbon synapses, resulting in alterations in synaptic signal transmission and visual function. The function of Pikachurin remains unknown, but it is a fact that pikachurin is critically involved in the normal photoreceptor ribbon synapse formation and also in physiological functions of visual perception.
Associated pathologies: muscular dystrophies.
Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) such as muscle-eye-brain disease are caused by defective glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) exhibit defective photoreceptor synaptic function. Pikachurin plays an essential role in CMD. Precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites which are realized due to Pikachurin may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal electrophysiological abnormalities observed in muscular dystrophy patients. The muscle-eye-brain dystrophy is caused by mutations in POMGnT1 or LARGE. These two genes mediated a post-translational modification on O-mannose, which is essential for pikachurin binding to dystroglycan, so people who suffer muscle-eye-disease have an hypoglycosylation of pikachurin-α-dystroglycan interactions.
Therapeutic applications.
Since pikachurin seems to provide better visual acuity, Sato et al. of the Osaka Bioscience Institute believe that the protein could be used to develop a treatment for and other eye disorders.

Bomb Harvest

Bomb Harvest is a 2007 documentary film directed by Australian filmmaker Kim Mordaunt, and produced by Sylvia Wilczynski. It explores the consequences of war in Laos as it follows an Australian bomb disposal specialist, training locals in the skill of detonating bombs while trying to stop villagers, particularly children, from finding them and using them for scrap metal.
During the Vietnam War, Laos was the target of the heaviest US bombing campaign, making Laos the most bombed country in history: from 1964 until 1973 more than two million tonnes of bombs were dropped, including 260 million cluster munitions. An estimated 30 per cent of the bombs dropped did not detonate. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) continues to kill and injure people, and prevent them from using land, including growing food. UXO are a key factor in the poverty and stifling the development of the country's.
"Bomb Harvest" explores how three generations of people have been left to deal with the consequences of the air war, and depicts the bravery of those trying to clear up its remnants.
The film crew spent two months on the ground with bomb disposal teams from the Mines Advisory Group as they dealt with live bombs, in areas of Laos which have never been filmed in before. The film premiered at the 2007 Sydney Film Festival, and won a Children's Advocacy award at the 2008 Artivist Film Festival.

ABC motorcycles

ABC motorcycles was a British motorcycle manufacturer established in 1914 by Ronald Charteris in London. Several British motorcycle firms started up with the name "ABC", including Sopwith. The All British Engine Company Ltd. of London was founded in 1912 and later changed to ABC Motors Ltd. 
With chief engineer Granville Bradshaw, Charteris built a range of engines throughout the First World War. From 1913 ABC produced motorcycle engines.
In 1918, ABC made a motorcycle with a 500 cc flat-twin engine mounted with its cylinders across the frame, several years before BMW adapted the design. Bradshaw challenged BMW's use of his patented design in 1926. In 1919 ABC also produced the Scootamota – an early motor scooter. The company stopped producing motorcycles after 1923 because of competition from cheaper manufacturers.
Development.
ABC had always had a close association with the Sopwith aircraft company and in 1919 they jointly exhibited the Sopwith 390 cc horizontally opposed twin-cylinder overhead valve (OHV) machine at the annual Motor Cycle show. It aroused a lot of interest with innovative front and rear leaf springs and "expanding" brakes, wet sump lubrication, and a four-speed gearbox. It was also one of the first motorcycles with a duplex cradle frame. One thing it did not have, however, was any form of starting mechanism; the rider had to "paddle" or bump start to get the engine going. 
The ABC 400 was made under licence by the Sopwith Aviation & Engineering Co in Kingston-upon-Thames and 2,200 were produced. Later models had improved valve gear, speedometers, and electric lighting. Sidecar outfits were also produced as optional extras.
In 1920 a new company, ABC Motors (1920) Ltd was formed to make aircraft engines, light cars, and motorcycles, all with a flat-twin engine designed by Bradshaw.
Models.
ABC 400 cc.
Produced between 1919 and 1925, the ABC 400 had a 398 cc horizontally opposed twin-cylinder overhead-valve four-stroke engine, four-speed gearbox with an H-gate and was fitted with an advanced (for the time) carburettor from Claudel-Hobsob to give a top speed of .
ABC 500 cc.
French manufacturer Gnome & Rhone produced an improved 493 cc version of this machine under licence until 1925. 
Between 1920 and 1924 they produced over 3,000 of the 'French' ABC but relatively few have survived.
ABC Skootamota.
The Bradshaw-designed Skootamota was an early scooter built by Gilbert Campling Ltd. and sold as the ABC Skootamota. 
The Skootamota handled well and was very stable despite small wheels. The single-cylinder 123 cc engine was located above the rear wheel and drove it by chain. Early Skootamotas had exhaust over intake (EOI) engines but later versions had OHV engines. The saddle and spacious footboard provided rider comfort. The Skootamota, quickly imitated by competitors, had a top speed of just , so ceased production in 1922.
Demise.
The shift from producing aircraft to making motorcycles was more difficult than ABC expected, and their costs – and prices – were higher than the new competitors emerging after 1920. They stopped producing motorcycles after 1923, although some production continued in Germany until 1925. Another company called ABC, unconnected to Charteris or Bradshaw, produced 247 cc and 269 cc motorcycles with Villiers engines in Birmingham between 1922 and 1924.

Şaban, the Turkish is a popular cinema character, portrayed by the legendary Turkish actor Kemal Sunal. Both figures rose to fame hand in hand, as the commoner clean-hearted looks of Şaban on the screen became very popular among Turkish citizens, and the two names had been used interchangeably, similar to the connection between The Tramp and Charlie Chaplin. The character sometimes appeared as "İnek Şaban" (Şaban the Geek), most significantly in the popular film series Hababam Sınıfı.

Richards v. Mackall, , was an appeal from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to the High Court on whether or not an appeal from that Court to this Court may be allowed by that Court sitting in special term.
Chief Justice Waite delivered the opinion of the Court.
Then follows a citation in proper form, signed by the chief justice of the court, bearing the same date as the order allowing the appeal. This citation was served October 7, 1884. Next in the transcript is the following:
Then follows a supersedeas bond in due form, and at the foot these words:
The transcript in this case shows that the appeal was allowed by the court, undoubtedly sitting in special term. This, we think, may be done. An appeal in a proper case is a matter of right. The decree appealed from was the decree of the supreme court, and the court, while sitting in special term, was still the supreme court, and, as such, capable of allowing an appeal to this Court from one of its final decrees, though rendered at general term. As the general term had closed, it was quite proper to apply to the court sitting in special term for the allowance of the appeal. The allowance by the court while in session at special term would not do away with the necessity of a citation because the allowance would not have been made at the same term in which the decree was rendered. Yeaton v. Lenox, 7 Pet. 221; Railroad v. Blair, 100 U. S. 662. As the allowance was made by the court, it was quite regular for the chief justice to sign the citation. The transcript also shows that the bond was approved by the court. It seems to have been presented to the court on 10 July and approved the next day. What was done was, according to the transcript, "In the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia."
Even if the citation was not served in time, which we do not decide, the failure to serve will not work a dismissal of the appeal. Dayton v. Lash, 94 U. S. 112.
The last ground of the motion to dismiss was not relied upon in argument. The effect of what has been done was to allow a separate appeal by Alfred Richards.
The motions were overruled.

HMT "Amethyst" was a naval trawler requisitioned by the Admiralty prior to the Second World War. She was sunk in the second year of the war.
"Amethyst" was built as the commercial trawler "Phyllis Rosalie" by Smiths Dock Company, South Bank-on-Tees and was launched on 15 January 1934. Her first owners were the Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co Ltd, based at Fleetwood. In 1935 she set a number of records for catches landed at Fleetwood, and was present at HM King George V's Silver Jubilee Spithead Review, representing the port of Fleetwood. She was sold later that year to the Admiralty, who had her converted into an anti-submarine warfare trawler with the addition of ASDIC and a 4 in gun. They classed her and a number of other trawlers as the Gem group, and the name "Amethyst" was selected. 
She continued to serve during the Second World War, but on 24 November 1940, whilst under the command of T/Lt. the Hon. W.K. Rous, RNVR, she struck a mine in the Thames Estuary and sank. There were no casualties, and the survivors were landed at Southend, where they were briefly arrested under the suspicion of being survivors from a sunken German craft.

Walker &amp; Gillette

Walker & Gillette was an architectural firm based in New York City, the partnership of A. Stewart Walker (1876–1952) and Leon N. Gillette (1878–1945), active from 1906 through 1945.
Biographies.
Walker was a native of Jersey City, New Jersey, and graduated from Harvard University in 1898. Leon Gillette, born in Malden, Massachusetts, had attended the University of Pennsylvania and worked in several New York firms, such as Howells & Stokes and Warren & Wetmore, and had also attended the École des Beaux-Arts from 1901 through 1903. The two joined forces in 1906. 
Walker's wife, Sybil Kane Walker, was a decorator who worked with her husband on at least one commission. Her father was Grenville Kane, banker and longtime presence in the exclusive enclave of Tuxedo Park, New York, where Walker & Gillette received important early commissions. 
On the death of Gillette in 1945, Walker continued in business as 'Walker & Poor' with Alfred Easton Poor (the son of one of their Long Island clients). Their notable commissions include the 1950 Parke-Bernet Galleries Building in New York City. After Walker's 1952 death, that firm would eventually become known as 'Swanke Hayden Connell'.
Company history.
The firm was prolific and stylistically versatile. Their commissions are not clearly attributable to one partner or the other, apart from one source identifying Gillette as solely responsible for the Grasslands Hospital in East View (Valhalla), New York, several buildings in White Plains, New York, multiple buildings in the planned city of Venice, Florida, and a housing project in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
Until about 1920, most of Walker & Gillette's work amounted to two kinds of society residences: New York City townhouses, and suburban mansions. The latter as of 1915 were a step below the great Gilded Age Newport mansions of 30 years prior, but still elaborate enough to sometimes require 20 or 30 rooms, multiple outbuildings, and customized features. Their clients were bank presidents, industrialists, socialites, and railroad heirs. 
Connected to the community of Tuxedo Park, New York through Walker's father-in-law, the firm designed numerous residences, including the 1908 Mary E. Scofield house, "Sho-Chiku-Bai", with landscape design by Takeo Shiota, as well as several additions to existing houses. Their 16 houses on Long Island were designed for clients like Irving Brokaw, Ralph Pulitzer, Charles Lane Poor, and William R. Coe. As to the townhouses in the city, the firm is credited with some fine examples and "the last great mansion to be built in New York", the 1932 Regency-style Loew house on East 93rd. 
Walker & Gillette ventured into commercial architecture in 1921 with great success. Their New York Trust Company Bank at 100 Broadway, a conservative and modest skyscraper apart from its adventuresome marble color scheme inside, began a series of about a dozen neo-classical branch banks in the New York area through the late 1920s. Their 1927 National City Bank branch on Canal Street is likely the most significant. Then came a number of major skyscrapers, notably the Industrial Trust Tower in Providence, which remains the tallest building in Rhode Island, and the Fuller Building in New York, among others. 
One prominent civic commission was the seamless extension, to north and south, of the New-York Historical Society building on Central Park West between 76th and 77th Streets, carried out in 1938. York and Sawyer's central block dating from 1908 was extended and sympathetically completed by pavilions on either end. This project stands among the last examples of Beaux-Arts architecture completed in the city and in the entire country. In sharp contrast the firm's most theatrical modernist building came the same year. That was the Electrical Products Building for the 1939 New York World's Fair, where an arch-headed blue slab tower intersected with a stepped curved structure, housing demonstrations of radical new uses of electricity: shaving, mixing cake batter, and home sewing.

Sheaf extension

In sheaf theory (an area of mathematics), a sheaf extension is a way of describing a sheaf in terms of a subsheaf and a quotient sheaf, analogous to a how a group extension describes a group in terms of a subgroup, and a quotient group.
Definition.
Let "X" be a scheme, and let "F", "H" be sheaves (of modules) on "X". An extension of "H" by "F" is a short exact sequence of sheaves
Note that an extension is not determined by the sheaf "G" alone: The morphisms are also important.
A simple example of an extension of "H" by "F" is the sequence
where the second arrow is the inclusion and the fourth arrow is the projection onto the second summand. This extension is sometimes called trivial.
Properties.
As with group extensions, if we fix "F" and "H", then all (equivalence classes of) possible extensions of "H" by "F" form an abelian group. This group is isomorphic to the Ext group formula_3, where the identity element in formula_3 corresponds to the trivial extension. 
In the case where "H" is the structure sheaf formula_5, we have formula_6, so the group of extensions of formula_7 by "F" is also isomorphic to the first sheaf cohomology group with coefficients in "F". 
Generalization.
The definition of an extension and the correspondence between extensions and Ext groups can be generalized to abelian categories, of which sheaves of modules are special instances.

Bill Pursell studied classical composition under Howard Hanson at the Eastman School of Music and earned a master's in composition in the mid-fifties. His symphonic poem "Christ Looking Over Jerusalem" (the first movement of "Three Biblical Scenes for Orchestra") was the inaugural recipient of the Edward B. Benjamin Prize in 1953. Later that decade, he worked with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra and taught at Tennessee State University and Vanderbilt University. In 1962 he signed with Columbia Records, who released a full-length album of his entitled "Our Winter Love" the following year. The album reached #15 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the popularity of the title track, which hit #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in addition to hitting #4 on the Adult Contemporary chart and #20 on the Black Singles chart. The arrangements for the album were made by Bill Justis and Pursell, and the orchestra was conducted by Grady Martin.

Graciela Casillas

Graciela Casillas (born 1957) is an American former boxer and kickboxer who competed in the bantamweight division. After training in several traditional martial arts, Casillas began competing as a kickboxer 1976 and in 1979, she became the first fighter to hold world titles in both boxing and kickboxing by taking the World Women's Boxing Association's and the World Kickboxing Association's bantamweight championships.
Noted for her punching power and also as one of the first American fighters to incorporate low kicks into their arsenal, Casillas retired undefeated in 1986. She is considered a pioneer of women's combat sports.
Early life.
Casillas was born as one of eleven children to Mexican parents in Oxnard, California. She took up taekwondo at the age of fifteen when the church she attended began offering self-defence classes. After the classes were discontinued, she began training in hwa rang do and then American Kenpo karate. It was at her karate school where she was introduced to kickboxing.
Career.
After going 6-0 with all of her wins by knockout as an amateur, Casillas turned professional in 1977. On July 13, 1979, she defeated Karen Bennett by unanimous decision at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California to win the WWBA World Bantamweight (-53.525 kg/118 lb) Championship in what was her professional boxing debut.
Later that year, on December 23, she beat Irene Garcia to take the WKA Women's World Bantamweight (-53.5 kg/117.9 lb) title in Las Vegas, Nevada. This made her the first person to hold world titles in boxing and kickboxing simultaneously.
In a controversial bout in Chicago, Illinois on October 6, 1981, Casillas went the distance with Cheryl Wheeler. Initially, it was announced that Wheeler won on the judges' scorecards to take the WKA bantamweight title but it was later overturned to a win for Casillas.
She retired undefeated in 1986 with a record of 31-0, 18 KOs.
Personal life.
Casillas has spent the years following her retirement from competition developing her own eclectic martial art of Shen Chun Do, "the way of the warrior spirit". 
Originally a student of taekwondo and full-contact karate she earned a 3rd degree black belt in Kenpo as well as Kodenkan Jujitsu. Casillas trained under Grandmaster Angel Cabales and became the first woman instructor for Cabales Serrada Eskrima. She later studied Jeet Kune Do under Sifu Dan Inosanto and Arnis under Grandmaster Bobby Taboada and her husband Sensei Ernie Boggs. She has been President of the United States Sport Jujitsu Trade Association and an assistant coach to the USA Jujitsu Team. She was awarded Black Belt Magazine's and Inside Kung-Fu Magazine's "Woman of the Year" in 1989 and inducted into the Martial arts Hall of Fame. She has been credited as the designer of the Boxing Skirt.
In 1996 Casillas designed a knife known as the Ladyhawk, manufactured by Masters of Defense (MOD) as a collaboration with Microtech Knives and marketed as a self-defense knife designed for women. Impetus for this design came after Casillas stabbed one of two attempted rapists, using the thug's own knife after disarming him.
Casillas has appeared in the films "Full Impact" (1993) and "Fire in the Night" (1986).

Jason Kenny

Jason Francis Kenny, OBE (born 23 March 1988) is an English track cyclist, specialising in the individual and team sprints. After winning multiple World and European Junior titles in 2006 and achieving medals in the under 23 European championships in 2007, Kenny was selected ahead of Ross Edgar to compete for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Along with Chris Hoy and Jamie Staff, he won a gold medal in the team sprint, breaking the world record in the qualifying round. He also finished behind team-mate Chris Hoy in the final of the individual sprint, gaining a silver medal.
In January 2012, he gained his first world championship title, after Grégory Baugé's results were nullified after a backdated 12-month ban for missing a drugs test, and the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) promoted Kenny to the gold medal. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he won gold medals in both the team sprint and in the individual sprint, beating Baugé in the final.
Early life.
Kenny attended Mount St Joseph Business & Enterprise College in the Farnworth area of Bolton. In the run-up to the London 2012 Olympic Games Kenny visited the school and praised the support he had received from his PE teachers. Jason has one older brother.
He studied at the University of Birmingham.
Future Stars series.
Kenny's first taste of major track competition came when he competed in the Future Stars series, a junior competition held as part of the Revolution series at the Manchester Velodrome. Kenny competed in a number of the ad-hoc events during the first season of the Revolution in 2003/2004. In the second season, he competed in the first fully fledged Future Series competition, taking part in a number of sprint and endurance events for 15–16-year-olds, during the season of 4 track meetings. The series gives youngsters the chance to compete in front of a crowd from an early age, it is noted for showcasing the majority of Britain's young talent. When the 2004/2005 season finished in February 2005, the 16 year old Kenny finished in the top 10 in the final standings.
2005–2007.
During the 2005/2006 racing season, Kenny went on to compete for Great Britain at a junior level as a sprinter and won world titles at the junior world championships. In the 2006/2007 season, he competed at a senior level for the team and took part in a number of World Cup Classics events across the world and Revolution events in Manchester, pitting himself against some of the world's best Sprint riders.
In the Revolution events in the 2007/2008 season, Kenny beat some of the world's best sprinters, including reigning world champion Theo Bos.
2008.
Kenny made his debut in the world championships in 2008, finishing fifth overall in the sprint competition.
In the Olympic Games, Kenny managed to make the team sprint squad, replacing the established Ross Edgar at man 2 in the team just before the Games. The team defeated the French team that had beaten them to the world title in Manchester only months earlier by over half a second. In the sprint competition, Kenny reached the final, but was defeated by his teammate Chris Hoy 2-0. 
Kenny's rise as a cyclist has been rapid. He progressed from competing in a domestic junior series to Olympic Champion in only 3 and a half years. He has taken full advantage of the excellent modern day set up in the Great Britain squad to excel from a very early age. He is considerably further ahead, in terms of ability and achievement, than senior riders like Hoy and Craig MacLean were at his age.
Kenny was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to cycling.
2012 Olympics.
At the London 2012 Olympic Games Kenny won gold in the team sprint with Chris Hoy and Philip Hindes, setting a new world record in the London Velopark. He also won gold in the men's sprint final, avenging his previous losses to Bauge with a 200m time of 10.308s in his final lap.

North Fork, Idaho

North Fork is an unincorporated community in Lemhi County, Idaho.
Its name is derived from confluence of the south-flowing North Fork of the Salmon River with the north-flowing main Salmon River, which makes a near-right angle turn here to flow westward across the state to Riggins. US 93 serves the community, connecting it with Salmon to the south and Lost Trail Pass to the north.
Longtime families in the community include Cummings, Prestwich, Randolph, Hughes, Smith, and Maxwell. The community of North Fork is built around the “North Fork Store” which also houses a post office and small liquor store. There are two hotels and a U.S. Forest Service Station.
The community area includes a non-domination Christian Church .5 miles South East of North Fork and a small private Catholic Chapel some 5 miles North just off U.S. Highway 93 North.
Notable creeks with trails and stunning vistas include:
Trail Gulch, Fourth of July, Hull Creek, Hughes Creek, Lick Creek, Ditch Creek, Burns Gulch, Indian Creek, and Ulysses Lookout.
Lewis and Clark traveled through this area and met with a local Indian man, Toby, who got the expedition lost crossing into Montana. Historians believe that they found Toby and enlisted his help as a guide at the confluence of the North Fork and Salmon rivers, or at the mouth of what is now known as “Hull Creek,” named after homesteader John Hull. A monument once stood to commemorate this meeting. This led to the name of the Idaho/Montana mountain pass, "Lost Trail." Also named from this, is the "Lost Trail Mountain Ski Area."
The elevation of North Fork is 3620 feet (1103 m) above sea level.

Japan during the Siberian Intervention

The of 1918–1922 was the dispatch of troops of the Imperial Japanese Army to the Russian Maritime Provinces as part of a larger effort by western powers and Japan to support White Russian forces against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War.
Background.
On August 23, 1914, Japan declared war on Germany and as a result of the treaty with Britain, Japan became a member of the Entente powers and found itself on the side of its former enemy, the Russians. In February 1917, internal discord led to the overthrow of the Tsar and the formation of a Provisional Government. The Provisional government, in turn, was overthrown in the October Revolution and the newly formed Bolshevik government signed a peace treaty with Germany. This led to the collapse of the Eastern Front.
Japanese Participation.
The Japanese were initially asked by the French in 1917, to intervene in Russia but declined the request. However, in February 1918, a "Siberia Planning Committee" was formed by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and the Army Ministry with the aim of exploring the possibility that the Tsarist collapse was an opportunity to free Japan from any future threat from Russia by detaching Siberia and forming an independent buffer state. The Army proposed attacking on two fronts, from Vladivostok to Khabarovsk along the Amur River and also via the Chinese Eastern Railway to cut off the Russian Trans-Siberian Railway at Lake Baikal.
The Japanese government, then under the civilian leadership of Prime Minister Hara Takashi refused to undertake such an expedition and it was not until the following year that events were set in motion that led to a change in this policy. 
In July 1918, President Wilson asked the Japanese government to supply 7,000 troops as part of an international coalition of 25,000 troops, including an American expeditionary force, planned to support the rescue of the Czech Legion and securing of wartime supplies stockpiled at Vladivostok. After heated debate in the Diet, the administration of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake agreed to send 12,000 troops, but under the command of Japan, rather than as part of an international coalition.
Once the political decision had been reached, the Imperial Japanese Army took over full control under Chief of Staff Yui Mitsue and extensive planning for the expedition was conducted. The Japanese eventually deployed 70,000 troops - far more than any of the other Allied powers had anticipated. Furthermore, although the Allies had envisioned operations only in the vicinity of Vladivostok, within months Japanese forces had penetrated as far west as Lake Baikal and Buryatia, and by 1920, "zaibatsu" such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and others had opened offices in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur and Chita, bringing with them over 50,000 civilian settlers. After the international coalition withdrew its forces, the Japanese Army stayed on. However, political opposition prevented the Army from annexing the resource-rich region. Japan continued to support White Movement leader Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak until his defeat and capture in 1920, and also supported the regime of Ataman Semenov, whose unstable government collapsed by 1922. In March and April 1922, the Japanese Army repulsed large Bolshevik offensives against Vladivostok. Public opinion in Japan mounted against the cost of the Siberian Intervention, which had absorbed over half the national budget for two years. On June 24, 1922 Japan announced that it would unilaterally withdraw from all of Russian territory with the exception of northern Sakhalin island (held until 1925), which had been seized in retaliation for the Nikolaevsk Incident of 1920 by October.
Effects on Japanese politics.
Japan's motives in the Siberian Intervention were complex and poorly articulated. Overtly, Japan (as with the United States and the other international coalition forces) were in Siberia to safeguard stockpiled military supplies and to "rescue" the Czech Legion. However, the Japanese government's intense hostility to communism, a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia, and the perceived opportunity to settle the "northern problem" in Japan's security by either creating a buffer state, or through outright territorial acquisition were also factors. However, patronage of various White Movement leaders left Japan in a poor diplomatic position vis-à-vis the government of the Soviet Union, after the Red Army eventually emerged victorious from the Russian Civil War. The intervention tore Japan's wartime unity to shreads, leading to the army and government being involved in bitter controversy and renewed faction strife in the army itself. The official conduct of the Siberian Intervention would later be bitterly attacked in the Japanese Diet, with Army being accused of grossly misrepresenting the size of the forces sent, misappropriation of secret funds, and support of unsavory figures such as the "Mad Baron" Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the ugly rumors of whose atrocities had reached the press.
Japanese casualties from the Siberian Expedition included some 5,000 dead from combat or illness, and the expenses incurred were in excess of 900 million yen.

Aswad Ansi

Aswad Ansi (), better known as Abhala bin Ka'b (), was an Arabic member of the al-Ansi family claimed by Muslims to be a false prophet. He lived in Yemen and proclaimed his prophethood towards the end of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's lifetime, around 630 AD. Awsad claimed to receive divine inspiration in the form of words, similar to prophet Muhammad, and is recorded to have recited them to his people.
He was known to be a soothsayer and a sorcerer. He had an ability to dazzle a crowd with chis charisma. The people of Yemen eventually proclaimed him a prophet.
History.
Aswad went on to invade Najran and most of Yemen. After his invasion of Yemen, he changed his title from "Prophet of God" to "Rahman" (The Most Merciful). His rule of the Yemen was short-lived, as Muhammad later sent Fairouz ad-Delami to assassinate him under the supervision and planning of Qais bin Hubaira.

Bi-specific T-cell engager

Bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are a class of artificial bispecific monoclonal antibodies that are investigated for the use as anti-cancer drugs. They direct a host's immune system, more specifically the T cells' cytotoxic activity, against cancer cells. "BiTE" is a registered trademark of Micromet AG.
BiTEs are fusion proteins consisting of two single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of different antibodies, or amino acid sequences from four different genes, on a single peptide chain of about 55 kilodaltons. One of the scFvs binds to T cells via the CD3 receptor, and the other to a tumor cell via a tumor specific molecule.
Mechanism of action.
Like other bispecific antibodies, and unlike ordinary monoclonal antibodies, BiTEs form a link between T cells and tumor cells. This causes T cells to exert cytotoxic activity on tumor cells by producing proteins like perforin and granzymes, independently of the presence of MHC I or co-stimulatory molecules. These proteins enter tumor cells and initiate the cell's apoptosis.
This action mimics physiological processes observed during T cell attacks against tumor cells.
Examples.
Clinical trials.
The following BiTEs are in clinical trials :
Further research.
Utilizing the same technology, melanoma (with MCSP specific BiTEs) and acute myeloid leukemia (with CD33 specific BiTEs) can be targeted. Research in this area is currently ongoing. Another avenue for novel anti-cancer therapies is re-engineering some of the currently used conventional antibodies like trastuzumab (targeting HER2/neu), cetuximab and panitumumab (both targeting the EGF receptor), using the BiTE approach. BiTEs against CD66e and EphA2 are being developed as well.

Kris Jensen

Kris Jensen (born Peter Jensen, April 4, 1942, New Haven, Connecticut) is an American singer and guitarist.
Jensen began his career in music cutting records for Colpix, for whom he recorded his first single in 1959. He graduated from high school in Fort Lauderdale in 1960 and then recorded with Kapp Records and its subsidiary, Leader Records. In 1962 he moved on to Hickory Records, where he began recording many numbers by Nashville staff songwriters such as Boudleaux and Felice Bryant, Roy Orbison, Joe Melson, and John D. Loudermilk.
In 1962 he recorded "Torture", which Loudermilk had originally written for The Everly Brothers. The song became a hit, reaching #20 on the Billboard Hot 100, and after its success the Everly Brothers decided to record it as well. The song proved to be Jensen's only hit, though he recorded at least 30+ songs over the course of his career. Reissues of his catalog were released to LP by Bear Family Records in 1979 and to CD by Sparkletone Records in 1995.

Ancient Egyptian race controversy

The question of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically as a product of the scientific racism of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy based on skin color, facial features, hair texture, and genetic affiliations. A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture. These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the Caucasoid and Negroid racial categories. Some accounts argued that Egyptian culture emerged from African populations to the south, while others pointed to influences from the Middle East, and yet others proposed that at least the upper classes originated from Europe.
Since the second half of the 20th century, anthropologists have rejected the notion of race as having any validity in the study of human biology. Typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists in favour of models of societal development based on geographical origin.
However, the question of the phenotypical characteristics (skin color, facial features, hair texture) and genetic affiliations of the ancient Egyptians remains a point of study, discussion, and debate. 
History.
The earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in the "New-England Magazine" of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that "Herodutus was given as authority for their being negroes." They point out with reference to tomb paintings: "It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the Negro countenance."
In the 18th century, Count Volney wrote that "The Copts are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians" due to their "jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips...the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans." Just a few years later, in 1839, Champollion stated in his work "Egypte Ancienne" that the Egyptians and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and reliefs, further suggesting that: "In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the Ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race." Also in 1839, Champollion’s and Volney’s claims were disputed by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating that "The opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth...Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible." 
The debate over the race of the Ancient Egyptians intensified during the movement to abolish slavery in the United States, as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting that "There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost...Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian." The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as the United States escalated towards civil war. In 1854, Josiah Nott with George Glidden set out to prove: "that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and "that the Egyptians were Caucasians."" Samuel George Morton, a physician and professor of anatomy concluded that although "Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is the United States, that of servants and slaves." 
In the early 20th century, Flinders Petrie continued the discussion of Black Egyptians. A Professor of Egyptology at the University of London, Petrie spoke of the "black queen" that was the divine ancestress of the XVIIIth dynasty. He indicated that "southern people reanimated Egypt, like the Sudani IIIrd dynasty and the Galla XIIth dynasty."
Position of modern scholarship.
Modern scholars who have studied Ancient Egyptian culture and population history have responded to the controversy over the race of the Ancient Egyptians in different ways.
Since the second half of the 20th century, scholars have rejected the notion of race as having any validity in the study of human biology. Stuart Tyson Smith writes in the 2001 Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt that "Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as "black", while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans.” Frank M. Snowden asserts that "Egyptians, Greeks and Romans attached no special stigma to the colour of the skin and developed no hierarchical notions of race whereby highest and lowest positions in the social pyramid were based on colour." Additionally, typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists in favour of models of geographical origin.
It is now largely agreed that Dynastic Egyptians were indigenous to the Nile area. About 5,000 years ago, the Sahara area dried out, and part of the indigenous Saharan population retreated east towards the Nile Valley. In addition, peoples from the Middle East entered the Nile Valley, bringing with them wheat, barley, sheep, goats, and possibly cattle. Dynastic Egyptians referred to their country as "The Two Lands". During the Predynastic period (about 4800 to 4300BC), the Merimde culture flourished in the northern part of Egypt (Lower Egypt). This culture, among others, has links to the Levant in the Middle East. The pottery of the later Buto Maadi culture, best known from the site at Maadi near Cairo, also shows connections to the southern Levant as well. In the southern part of Egypt (Upper Egypt) the predynastic Badarian culture was followed by the Naqada culture. These people seem to be more closely related to the Nubians than with northern Egyptians.
Due to its geographical location at the crossroads of several major cultural areas, Egypt has experienced a number of foreign invasions during historical times, including by the Canaanites (Hyksos), the Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Macedonian Greeks, the Romans (Byzantium in late antiquity/early Middle Ages), the Arabs, the Ottoman Turks, the French and the British.
At the UNESCO "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script" in Cairo in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with "profound" disagreement. Most participants concluded that the Ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. The arguments for all sides are recorded in the UNESCO publication "General History of Africa", with the "Origin of the Egyptians" chapter being written by Diop.
In 1996, the Indianapolis Museum of Art published a collection of essays, which included contributions from leading experts in various fields including archaeology, art history, physical anthropology, African studies, Egyptology, Afrocentric studies, linguistics, and classical studies. While the contributors differed in some opinions, the consensus of the authors was that Ancient Egypt was a Northeast African civilization (although ethnic type was not mentioned), based on Egypt's geographic location on the African continent.
In 2008, S. O. Y. Keita wrote that "There is no scientific reason to believe that the primary ancestors of the Egyptian population emerged and evolved outside of northeast Africa... The basic overall genetic profile of the modern population is consistent with the diversity of ancient populations that would have been indigenous to northeastern Africa and subject to the range of evolutionary influences over time, although researchers vary in the details of their explanations of those influences."
Specific current-day controversies.
Since the 1970s, the issues regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians have been "troubled waters which most people who write (in the United States) about ancient Egypt from within the mainstream of scholarship avoid." The debate, therefore, takes place mainly in the public sphere and tends to focus on a small number of specific issues.
Tutankhamun.
Several Afrocentric scholars, including Diop, have claimed that Tutankhamun was black, and have protested that attempted reconstructions of Tutankhamun's facial features (as depicted on the cover of "National Geographic Magazine") have represented the king as "too white". Among these writers was Chancellor Williams, who argued that King Tut, his parents, and grandparents were black.
Forensic artists and physical anthropologists from Egypt, France, and the United States independently created busts of Tutankhamun, using a CT-scan of the skull. Biological anthropologist Susan Anton, the leader of the American team, said the race of the skull was "hard to call." She stated that the shape of the cranial cavity indicated an African, while the nose opening suggested narrow nostrils, which is usually considered to be a European characteristic. The skull was thus concluded to be that of a North African. Other experts have argued that neither skull shapes nor nasal openings are a reliable indication of race.
Although modern technology can reconstruct Tutankhamun's facial structure with a high degree of accuracy, based on CT data from his mummy, determining his skin tone and eye color is impossible. The clay model was therefore given a flesh coloring which, according to the artist, was based on an "average shade of modern Egyptians."
Terry Garcia, "National Geographic"'s executive vice president for mission programs, said, in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction: "The big variable is skin tone. North Africans, we know today, had a range of skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.' We will never know for sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of his eyes with 100% certainty.  ... Maybe in the future, people will come to a different conclusion."
When pressed on the issue by American activists in September 2007, the current Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Dr. Zahi Hawass stated that "Tutankhamun was not black."
Ahmed Saleh, the former archaeological inspector for the Supreme Council of antiquities stated that the procedures used in the facial re-creation made Tut look Caucasian, "disrespecting the nation's African roots."
In a November 2007 publication of "Ancient Egypt Magazine", Hawass asserted that none of the facial reconstructions resemble Tut and that, in his opinion, the most accurate representation of the boy king is the mask from his tomb. The Discovery Channel commissioned a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun, based on CT scans of a model of his skull, back in 2002.
One scientific examination of the remains of Tutankhamun have revealed that the boy king was: 1) significantly dolichocephalic, or long-headed; 2) had enlarged incisors; and 3) had a pronounced alveolar prognathism, resulting in an overbite and a concomitant receding chin, which some people in the fields of forensic criminology and forensic anthropology still believe indicates a Negroid person. Between September 2007 and October 2009, the detailed studies of the King Tutankhamun Family Project determined that Tutankhamun actually has a cephalic index of 83.9, indicating brachycephaly. However various experts have pointed out that skull shapes etc. are not actually a reliable indication of ancestry.
Cleopatra VII.
The race and skin color of Cleopatra, the last pharaoh following the Greek invasion of Egypt in 300 BCE, has also caused frequent debate, as described in an article from "The Baltimore Sun". There is also an article entitled: "Was Cleopatra Black?" from "Ebony magazine", and an article about Afrocentrism from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that mentions the question, too. Scholars generally suggest a Caucasian skin color for Cleopatra, based on the following facts: her Greek Macedonian family had intermingled with the Persian aristocracy of the time; her mother's identity is uncertain, and that of her paternal grandmother is not known for certain.
The question was the subject of a heated exchange between Mary Lefkowitz, who has referred in her articles to a debate she had with one of her students about the question of whether Cleopatra was black, and Molefi Kete Asante, Professor of African American Studies at Temple University. In response to "Not Out of Africa" by Lefkowitz, Asante wrote an article entitled "Race in Antiquity: Truly Out of Africa," in which he emphasized that he "can say without a doubt that Afrocentrists do not spend time arguing that either Socrates or Cleopatra were black."
In 2009, a BBC documentary speculated that Arsinoe IV, the half-sister of Cleopatra VII, may have been part African and then further speculated that Cleopatra’s mother, thus Cleopatra herself, might also have been part African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Thür of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who in the 1990s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BC tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. Arsinoe IV and Cleopatra VII, shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but had different mothers.
Great Sphinx of Giza.
The identity of the model for the Great Sphinx of Giza is unknown. Virtually all Egyptologists and scholars currently believe that the face of the Sphinx represents the likeness of the Pharaoh Khafra, although a few Egyptologists and interested amateurs have proposed several different hypotheses.
Numerous scholars, such as DuBois, Diop, Asante, and Volney, have characterized the face of the Sphinx as Black, or "Negroid." Around 1785 Volney stated, "When I visited the sphinx...on seeing that head, typically Negro in all its features, I remembered...Herodotus says: "...the Egyptians...are black with woolly hair"..." Another early description of a "Negroid" Sphinx is recorded in the travel notes of a French scholar, who visited in Egypt between 1783 and 1785, Constantin-François Chassebœuf along with French novelist Gustave Flaubert.
American geologist Robert M. Schoch has written that the "Sphinx has a distinctive African, Nubian, or Negroid aspect which is lacking in the face of Khafre."
"Kemet".
Ancient Egyptians referred to their homeland as "Kmt" (conventionally pronounced as "Kemet"). According to Cheikh Anta Diop, the Egyptians referred to themselves as "Black" people or "kmt", and "km" was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition. A review of David Goldenberg's "The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam" states that Goldenberg "argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology." Diop, William Leo Hansberry, and Aboubacry Moussa Lam have argued that "kmt" was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people, which Diop "et al." claim was black. The claim that the Ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography, but it is rejected by some Egyptologists.
Mainstream scholars hold that "kmt" means "the black land" or "the black place", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil which was washed down from Central Africa by the annual Nile inundation. By contrast the barren desert outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called "dšrt" (conventionally pronounced "deshret") or "the red land". Raymond Faulkner's "Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian" translates "kmt" into "Egyptians", Gardiner translates it as "the Black Land, Egypt".
At the UNESCO Symposium in 1974, Professors Sauneron, Obenga, and Diop concluded that KMT and KM meant black. However, Professor Sauneron clarified that the adjective "Kmtyw" means "people of the black land" rather than "black people", and that the Egyptians never used the adjective "Kmtyw" to refer to the various black peoples they knew of, they only used it to refer to themselves.
Ancient Egyptian art.
Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples contained thousands of paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal a great deal about the people of that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.
In 1839, Champollion states in his work "Egypte Ancienne" that the Egyptians and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and reliefs. University of Chicago scholars assert that Nubians are generally depicted with black paint, but the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range "from dark red to brown to black." This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy, as well as Ramses II's temple at Beit el-Wali. Also, Snowden indicates that Romans had accurate knowledge of "negroes of a red, copper-colored complexion...among African tribes." Conversely, Najovits states that "Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately, arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature." He continues that "There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddish-brown Egyptians and black Nubians."
However Manu Ampim, a professor at Merritt College specializing in African and African American history and culture, claims in the book "Modern Fraud: The Forged Ancient Egyptian Statues of Ra-Hotep and Nofret," that many ancient Egyptian statues and artworks are modern frauds that have been created specifically to hide the "fact" that the ancient Egyptians were black, while authentic artworks which demonstrate black characteristics are systematically defaced or even "modified." Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence which "proves" that the ancient Egyptians were black, under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses "European" scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.
Ampim has a specific concern about the painting of the "Table of Nations" in the Tomb of Ramses III (KV11). The "Table of Nations" is a standard painting which appears in a number of tombs, and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased. Among other things, it described the "four races of men," as follows: (translation by E.A. Wallis Budge: "The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third are NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians, the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned Libyans."
The archaeologist Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work "Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien." In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section, called the "Ergänzungsband" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius’ original work. One of them, plate 48, illustrated one example of each of the four "nations" as depicted in KV11, and shows the "Egyptian nation" and the "Nubian nation" as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Professor Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting, and that it "proves" that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the Nubians, even though he admits no other examples of the "Table of Nations" show this similarity. He has further accused "Euro-American writers" of attempting to mislead the public on this issue.
The late Egyptologist, Dr. Frank Yurco, visited the tomb of Ramses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Erganzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a "pastiche" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius' notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much-more-recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings. (Erik Hornung, "The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity", 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images which stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the Ancient Egyptians.
Historical hypotheses.
Black African hypothesis.
The Black Egyptian hypothesis is a heavily-contested hypothesis held by various authors that Ancient Egypt was a Black civilization. This includes a particular focus on links to Sub Saharan cultures and the questioning of the race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times, including Tutankhamun and the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, and Cleopatra. Since the second half of the 20th century, typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists, and most (but not all) scholars have held that applying modern notions of race to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. 
Early advocates of the Black African model relied heavily on writings from Classical Greek historians, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Herodotus, wherein the Greeks referred to Egyptians as "melanchroes" with woolly hair. The translation of the Greek word “melanchroes” is disputed, being translated either as “black” or "dark skinned". Snowden claims that Diop is distorting his classical sources and is quoting them selectively. There is dispute about the historical accuracy of the works of Herodotus - some scholars support the reliability of Herodotus while other scholars regard his works as being unreliable as historical sources, particularly those relating to Egypt.
Other points used to support the Black Hypothesis included testing melanin levels in a small sample of mummies, arguing that the Ancient Egyptian language was related to Diop's native Wolof (Senegal), interpretations of the origin of the name "Kmt", conventionally pronounced "Kemet", used by the Ancient Egyptians to describe themselves or their land (depending on your point of view), biblical traditions, and interpretations of the depictions of the Egyptians in numerous paintings and statues. Other points of the hypothesis include claimed cultural affiliations, such as circumcision, matriarchy, totemism, hair braiding, head binding, and kingship cults. Artifacts found at Qustul (near Abu Simbel - Modern Sudan) in 1960-64 were seen as showing that ancient Egypt and A-group Nubia shared the same culture and were part of the greater Nile Valley sub-stratum,
At the UNESCO "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script" in Cairo in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with "profound" disagreement. Most participants concluded that the Ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).
Asiatic Race Theory.
The Asiatic Race Theory holds that the ancient Egyptians were the lineal descendants of the biblical Ham, through his son Mizraim. This theory was the most dominant view from the Early Middle Ages (c. 500 AD) all the way up to the early 19th century. The descendants of Ham were traditionally considered to be the darkest skinned branch of humanity, either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the Curse of Ham. Thus, Diop cites Gaston Maspero "Moreover, the Bible states that Mesraim, son of Ham. brother of Chus (Kush)... and of Canaan, came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile."
By the 20th century, the Asiatic Race Theory and its various offshoots were abandoned but were superseded by two related theories: the Hamitic Hypothesis, asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing with them all advanced agriculture, technology and civilization and also the Dynastic Race Theory, proposing that Mesopotamian invaders were responsible for the dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC). In sharp contrast to the Asiatic Race Theory neither of these theories propose that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.
Caucasian / Hamitic hypothesis.
In 1844, Samuel George Morton wrote that the Nile valley “was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race”, and acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants. George Gliddon (1844) wrote: "The Egyptians were white men, of no darker hue than a pure Arab, a Jew, or a Phoenician." 
The similar Hamitic hypothesis, which developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted that these people were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name. Charles Gabriel Seligman in his "Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan" (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.
The Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi (1901) believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African (Hamitic) branch of the Mediterranean race, which he called "Eurafrican". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or "Eurafrican" contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean "proper" branch and the Nordic (depigmentated) branch. Sergi maintained in summary that the Mediterranean race (excluding the depigmentated Nordic or 'white') is: "a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples." Grafton Elliot Smith modified the theory in 1911, stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired "brown race", most closely "linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe", and not Negroid. Smith’s "brown race" is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi’s Mediterranean race. 
The Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 1960s and late 70’s and was supported notably by Anthony John Arkell and George Peter Murdock.
Turanid race hypothesis.
The Egyptologist Samuel Sharpe (1846) proposed that the ancient Egyptians belonged to the Turanid race, linking them to the Tatars. He was inspired by some ancient Egyptian paintings, which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said "From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow, like that of the Mongul Tartars, who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race...The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars."
Dynastic race theory.
In the early 20th century, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, one of the leading Egyptologists of his day, noted that the skeletal remains found at pre-dynastic sites at Naqada (Upper Egypt) showed marked differentiation. Together with cultural evidence such as architectural styles, pottery styles, cylinder seals, and numerous rock and tomb paintings, he deduced that a Mesopotamian force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times, imposed themselves on the indigenous Badarian people, and become their rulers. This came to be called the "Dynastic Race Theory." The theory further argued that the Mesopotamian founded state or states then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty.
In the 1950s, the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship. Scholars such as the Senegalese Egyptologist Cheikh Anta Diop, fought against the Dynastic Race Theory with their own "Black Egyptian" theory and claimed, among other things, that European scholars supported the Dynastic Race Theory "to avoid having to admit that Ancient Egyptians were black". Bernal proposed that the Dynastic Race theory was conceived by European scholars to deny Egypt its African roots.
Contemporary consensus suggests that Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).

Kyopolou

Kyopolou (, more often "Кьополу"; ) is a popular Bulgarian and Turkish relish made principally from roasted eggplants and garlic. Often bell peppers, tomatoes, parsley are added. Kyopolou can be consumed as a bread spread, a condiment, or as a salad.
The kyopolou is a typical eggplant appetizer for the Bulgarian cuisine. The relish is popular in the Balkans in different variants and names (e.g. ajvar or pinđur). In Romanian cuisine it is called zacuscă—a word of obvious Slavic origin (cf. Russian zakuska), possibly pointing to the southern Bulgarian neighbours as the source. It is generally prepared as a canned food, in glass jars, for the winter season. However, it is not unusual that it is prepared as a main dish. It generally consists of baked eggplant, onions, baked kapia red peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes or home made tomato juice (which is made by boiling for thickening juice extracted from tomatoes, usually with added salt and/ or sugar), black pepper, laurel leaves and garlic. Some also add hot peppers, or extra black pepper. Taste can vary from light and sweet to hot and peppery. Chopped onion is sauteed in (usually) sunflower oil, then chopped bell peppers are added (preferably red), followed by eggplant and chopped or minced baked kapia peppers and finely minced tomatoes, tomato juice or tomato paste. Black peppers and laurel leaves are added for flavoring. It is usually oven cooked in pots or casseroles. It is used as a spread on bread slices (sometimes toast) or as an appetizer before the main course, served with regular meals. During summer and autumn months, when its ingredients are usually readily available it is also a main dish, mainly during orthodox fasting periods.
Etymology.
According to the dictionary of foreign words in Bulgarian the name "Kyopolou" comes from the Turkish "köpekoğlu", which means "bastard".

Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey

The Boston College Eagles are a Division I college hockey program that represent Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. The team has competed in Hockey East since 1984, having previously played in the ECAC. The Eagles have won five national championships, the most recent coming in 2012. Home games have been played at Kelley Rink, named after coach John "Snooks" Kelley, since 1988, having previously played at McHugh Forum. The Eagles are coached by former Eagles forward Jerry York, who has won the most games of any head coach in NCAA hockey history, having surpassed Ron Mason's 924th win on December 29, 2012. York is an alum of Boston College, a member of the class of 1967.
Boston College Hockey History.
Boston College is among the top college hockey programs in the country. Beginning with legendary coach John "Snooks" Kelley, who led the Eagles to their first national championship in 1949, Boston College has established itself as a perennial powerhouse in both regular season and post-season play. Former coach Len Ceglarski and current coach Jerry York, both Boston College alums, continue to build upon the success began by Kelley. Both York and Ceglarski have at least 500 career wins. York to date has 959 career wins, which is first all-time and is first among all active coaches.
To date, BC has won thirteen conference tournament titles, including eleven Hockey East titles, a conference record. Their most recent triumph in 2012 came after beating Maine 4-1 in the championship game.
Post-Season and Frozen Four.
Boston College has made thirty two NCAA tournament appearances, reaching the tournament's Frozen Four twenty-three times.
Under John "Snooks" Kelley, BC advanced to the NCAA tournament three straight years from 1948-1950 (when the field was only four teams), winning the National Championship in 1949 after defeating Dartmouth 4-3 in Colorado Springs, CO.
After Jerry York took over as head coach in 1994, the Eagles began to work their way back to the NCAA tournament, having not qualified since 1991, and not having been to a Frozen Four since 1990. In 1998, four years after York became head coach, the Eagles were back in the National Championship game, losing to the Michigan Wolverines in Boston. BC was back in the national championship game in 2000, facing the North Dakota Fighting Sioux. They lost the game 4-2, but returned the favor a year later in 2001, beating the Sioux 3-2 in overtime thanks to a sensational Krys Kolanos goal. This was the Eagles first National Championship since 1949. The championship was all the more satisfying for BC as the Eagles defeated in the process the three teams that had eliminated them from the previous three tournaments (Michigan Wolverines, Maine Black Bears, North Dakota Fighting Sioux). The 2001 National Championship team contained current NHL standouts Brian Gionta, Brooks Orpik, and Chuck Kobasew, 
The Eagles returned to the National Championship game in 2006, facing the Wisconsin Badgers in Milwaukee, WI. The Eagles lost 2-1. A Brian Boyle shot was denied by the post as time expired, securing the win for the Badgers. The Eagles made it back to the National Championship game in 2007, riding on the heels of a thirteen-game winning streak. However, they came up short again, losing 3-1 to the Michigan State Spartans.
BC got back to the National Championship game in 2008, disposing of Minnesota, Miami (OH), and North Dakota in the Frozen Four semifinals along the way. The 2008 Tournament marked the third year in a row that the Eagles ending Miami's season, beating the top seeded Red Hawks 4-3 in overtime thanks to an acrobatic goal by freshman Joe Whitney. In the National Championship game, the Eagles met the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who had upset Michigan in the other semifinal. The Eagles won the contest by a score of 4-1, behind an MVP performance by Nathan Gerbe. The defeat of the Irish by BC has added fuel to the growing rivalry between Boston College and Notre Dame, carrying over to the ice what has been being fought on the gridiron for years between the two schools football teams in the Holy War.
After missing out on the 2009 Tournament, BC returned in 2010 as a number one seed. The Eagles defeated Alaska and Yale in the Northeast Regional in Worcester, earning them a berth in the Frozen Four to be played at Ford Field in Detroit. BC defeated Miami (OH) 7-1 in the national semifinal, the fourth time in five years that the Eagles ended the RedHawks' season in the NCAA Tournament. BC would face Wisconsin in the championship, a rematch of the 2006 title game. The Eagles avenged that loss by defeating the Badgers 5-0 behind a two goal effort from sophomore Cam Atkinson and an MVP performance by senior Ben Smith, who would be named the Frozen Four's Most Outstanding Player. Junior John Muse became just the fourth goalie to record a shutout in a title game. The game was played before a record crowd of 37,592, the largest to attend an indoor hockey game. 
Since 1998, the Eagles have qualified for the NCAA tournament fourteen times, making it to ten Frozen Fours, seven National Championship games, and have won four national titles.

Rivals.
Boston University Terriers.
Boston College's chief and most hated rival is the Boston University Terriers, separated by a mere four miles on Boston's Commonwealth Avenue. The rivalry is often referred to as the Green Line Rivalry, as the MBTA Green Line is the principal mode of transportation between the two schools. BC-BU is considered one of the top rivalries in college sports as well as the number one rivalry in college hockey. The schools regularly meet in Hockey East play three times each season. Besides meeting in conference play, the two schools often meet in the annual Beanpot tournament. Boston University has traditionally dominated the tournament. The Eagles beat the Terriers 3-2 in overtime during the Championship of the 2012 tournament, the most recent meeting between the schools in the tournament. 
The two schools have also met in NCAA tournament play. In their most recent meeting, Boston College skated to a memorable 5-0 victory against the top seeded Terriers in the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament Northeast Regional Final. The Eagles and Terriers have met once in the NCAA Tournament championship game in 1978, with BU winning 5-3 in Providence, RI. BC and BU have combined for ten national championships, with each school having won five.
Games between the two schools are also highlighted by the intensity of the two school's student sections, the BC Superfans and the BU Dog Pound. The BU students often shout their infamous "BC Sucks" or "Sunday School" chants while the Superfans will retort with "Safety School", "Sucks to BU", or "BC Rejects" at their counterparts.
Boston University leads the all-time series 129-119-17. In their most recent meeting on February 3, 2014 BC defeated BU 3-1 at TD Garden in the first round of the 2014 Beanpot tournament.
Boston College and Boston University faced off in Hockey East play at Fenway Park on January 8, 2010. The game was the first men's college hockey game played at Fenway Park, with a women's game between Northeastern and New Hampshire played earlier in the day. BU edged BC for a 3-2 win.
North Dakota Fighting Sioux.
Boston College has developed a national rivalry with the North Dakota Fighting Sioux, a rivalry fueled by each teams post-season success. Boston College ended North Dakota's season in three straight Frozen Fours, most recently winning 6-1 in 2008 en route to a National Championship, while in the 2005 tournament the Sioux beat the Eagles in the East Regional finals, 6-3.
In 2000, the Sioux triumphed over BC 4-2 in the National Championship game in Rhode Island. A year later, in 2001, the Eagles and Sioux met again in Albany, this time with BC prevailing 3-2 in overtime. In 1963, the Sioux beat Boston College by a score of 8-2 in the National Semifinal game. Two years later in 1965, Boston College defeated North Dakota 4-3 in the National Semifinal game. 
On October 10, 2007, the two teams squared off in a regular season match best remembered for the unusual circumstances in which the game ended. Midway through the second period, the power went out at BC's Conte Forum. When power was restored, the ice surface began to melt, leading to the game being called after two periods due to the hazardous playing conditions. The game ended 0-0.
The Eagles and Sioux last met in the championship game of the 2011 Ice Breaker Tournament at the Ralph Engelstad Arena, with BC defeating North Dakota 6-2.
New Hampshire Wildcats.
The rivalry between Boston College and New Hampshire has grown in recent years due to the success of the two programs. UNH leads the all-time Hockey East regular season series over BC. The Eagles, however, hold a distinct advantage in Hockey East tournament play, holding an 8-3 record. Most recently, in the 2009 Hockey East Tournament, UNH hosted BC in the quarterfinals on their home ice at the Whittemore Center. UNH had the chance to end BC's season and their hopes of reaching the NCAA tournament to defend their national title. BC won the best-of-three series 2-0.
During the 2007-2008 season, the Wildcats swept the season series and won the Hockey East regular season championship. The two teams met in the semifinals of the Hockey East tournament, with the top-seeded and favored UNH squad jumping out to a 4-1 midway through the second period. The Eagles mounted a comeback, however, and won the game 5-4 in triple overtime.
Both UNH and BC have also competed closely for the Hockey East regular season championship. In the 2009-2010 season, the Wildcats cemented the title on the final weekend of the season, earning a 3-3 tie against the Eagles at the Whittemore Center in the penultimate game season after BC jumped out to a 3-0 lead. In the 2010-2011 season, the regular season title was again decided on the final weekend, with the Eagles, sitting in second place, sweeping a home-and-home series against the Wildcats, earning their eleventh regular season championship.
Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
Boston College and Notre Dame first met on the ice in 1969, and have faced-off annually since 1994. BC leads the all-time series 16-12-2, including beating the Irish in the 2008 National Championship game, as the Eagles captured their third national title in a 4-1 victory. The Irish have won five of the last seven regular season meetings since 2003. Boston College won the most recent match-up on January 4, 2013, beating Notre Dame 4-3 at Fenway Park. 
The rivalry is commonly referred to as "The Holy War on Ice," a take on the name of the football rivalry between the two schools. In 2013, Notre Dame joined Hockey East, transforming the annual rivalry game into a two-game conference series.

1954 college football season

The 1954 NCAA football season saw three teams finish unbeaten and untied, with Ohio State Buckeyes and the UCLA Bruins sharing the national championship as the #1 picks of the AP Poll and the UPI Poll, respectively. Although the winners of the Big Ten and the Pacific conferences normally met in the Rose Bowl, a "no repeat" prevented the two champions from meeting. UCLA, which had been in the Rose Bowl earlier in the year, was replaced by conference runner-up USC. 
During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual "NCAA Football Guide" of the "unofficial" national champions. The AP poll in 1954 consisted of the votes of as many as 419 sportswriters. 
Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams. Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the "overall" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained "unbeaten and untied" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20. Generally, the top teams played on New Year's Day in the four major postseason bowl games: the Rose Bowl (near Los Angeles at Pasadena), the Sugar Bowl (New Orleans), the Orange Bowl (Miami), and the Cotton Bowl (Dallas).
In 1954, a limit of 10 games per season, excluding a bowl game, was imposed on all teams, with the exception that existing contracts would not be changed.
September.
In the preseason poll released on September 13, 1954, #1 Notre Dame had the most points, although #2 Oklahoma had more first place votes (74 vs. 52). Rounding out the Top Five were defending champion #3 Maryland, #4 Texas and #5 Illinois. As the regular season progressed, a new poll would be issued on the Monday following the weekend's games.

Final Coaches Poll.
The United Press International poll, taken from a panel of 35 coaches, had UCLA as the number one team beginning with the poll released on October 26. A rival to the AP poll, the UPI prefaced its release with the statement, "The men who know the game the best, the coaches themselves, voted UCLA to the top spot by the slender margin of seven points over Ohio State, the perfect record champions of the Big 10 Conference," The UPI poll was a Top Ten, with a first place vote by a coach being worth 10 points, second worth 9 points, etc. With 350 being the maximum number of points, and 315 being the total for 35 second place votes, the panel was split on whether UCLA or Ohio State was the best team in the nation.

Red Letter Year is a studio album by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, released on September 30, 2008.
Says DiFranco about the album: “When I listen to my new record, I hear a very relaxed me, which I think has been absent in a lot of my recorded canon. Now I feel like I’m in a really good place. My partner Mike Napolitano co-produced this record – my guitar and voice have never sounded better, and that’s because of him. I’ve got this great band and crew.

No Connection released their first album, titled "Justified", in January 2000. The album included ten songs, including "Victory Girl", which was featured in the teaser of an episode of "First Wave" titled "Ohio Players". Two more songs off the album—"Ain't Foolin'" and "Love for Free"—reached No. 1 on MP3.com's Classic Rock chart.
The band released "Deal With It", co-produced with John Mitchell,

OK Sauce

OK Sauce is a fruity brown sauce. 
Early history.
It was first made in a factory called the Chelsea Works (formerly, a swimming pool) in London. 
In 1928 production was transferred to a purpose-built factory to the designs of Percy Sharp, at 265 Merton Road, Southfields, in the London Borough of Wandsworth. The company's official title was George Mason & Co Ltd. However, George Mason left the firm before World War 1 and the company was run by the Cooper family, initially by Percy Cooper, then by his son Rex Cooper as Chairman and MD.
Colmans.
Rex's son, Brian, together with Rex's sister Betty Urwin, oversaw the changeover to Colmans. In addition to OK sauce, other sauces and chutneys were made. They also had a satellite factory (called Watersend Condiments) in a converted farm building beside a manor house at Temple Ewell, Dover. This concentrated on horseradish sauce, mint sauce and mint jelly. The factories continued to make sauces until 1969 when the owners of the company sold it off to Reckitt and Colman at Norwich. The products had a Royal Warrant which ceased around the takeover. All production was transferred to Norwich and both factories closed. However, the Art Deco facade of the Southfields building, visible from Merton Road. still exists and has been awarded Grade 2 listing status in August 2002 by the then Secretary of State. (Ref TQ2526 7363 1207/0/10125)
Colmans continued to make OK Sauce but the other condiments were soon discontinued. It is still in production today but is extremely difficult to find. Sainsburys and some other supermarkets dropped supply about 20 years ago but some specialist shops stock it and it is a popular ingredient in Chinese cuisine. The original recipe contained a mix of fruits and spices making it a piquant, fruity sauce. The list of ingredients in the current sauce is very different (less variety of fruit and water now being an ingredient).

Hughes Hall College Boat Club

Hughes Hall College Boat Club is the rowing club for members of Hughes Hall, Cambridge. The Boat Club houses its four rowing shells in the boathouse. Despite the college being founded in 1885 and the first male undergraduates arriving in 1973, the boatclub formed late compared to other colleges. The first crews joined at the bottom of the Bumps race order and were able to make rapid progress up the tables to a more 'natural' position: the Men's first crew won blades in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004.
History.
In 2003 there was an official merger with the boat club of Lucy Cavendish College, an all-women's college of Cambridge University. The result was a combined club formally recognised by the Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs as the "Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish Combined Boat Club". This combination is the only of its type at Cambridge, and is subject to significant controversy regarding both the ability of the two colleges to combine membership and the significant disparity between larger and smaller colleges as a whole, although this obviously only affects the women's crews.
Since the merging of the two college boat clubs, Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish have enjoyed significant advances marked by three squads winning blades during the May Bumps 2009, including a 10 place gain by M2. It was also the first time the boat club fielded four crews into the May Bumps. Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish have won the Pegasus Cup, awarded to the boat club that shows the largest cumulative advancement at the bumps, twice – in 2007 and 2009. They are the only club to have done so.
Hughes Hall admits many students on one-year degrees. As such, the boat club trains many novices each year. Top performers are often given opportunities in the first VIII. Despite this, Hughes Hall is also known for producing many of those rowers who represent CUBC at The Boat Race. In 2009 half the roster of Goldie, the 2nd Varsity boat, were from Hughes. This continued in 2010, including CUBC President Deaglen McEachern who was the first representative from Hughes Hall to hold this post.
Other Appearances.
In 2008, the women flew to Galway Ireland to race in the Tribesman Head of the River race and qualified for the Intermediate Coxed Fours in 2008 at Henley Women's Regatta. The Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish women also competed in the Women's Eights Head of River Race (WeHorr) for the first time in 2009. They were the only Cambridge college to enter two boats. The first VIII overtook five boats and came 144th out of 291. W2 placed 272nd.

SoCal VoCals

The SoCal VoCals (abbreviation: "the VoCals") are the first of seven a cappella groups from the University of Southern California. Founded in 1996, this award-winning group comprises between 13 and 19 male and female students who arrange and sing songs from multiple genres, including pop, rock, and jazz. The group, which has released six albums, uses no instruments—only vocal percussion and voices. In 1997, they took first place at USC's Songfest.
The members of the VoCals are hired to perform at numerous gigs each year; past performance venues include the Staples Center, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles House of Blues, and the Getty Center. Nicknamed "a party on stage," the SoCal VoCals are known for their engaging performance style and school spirit (they are the only USC a cappella group to have performed a rendition of the University's Alma Mater).
The group frequently participates in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
In April, 2008, they took first place at New York City's Lincoln Center as the Grand Champions. The next morning, they were featured on "The Today Show". 
In April, 2010, the SoCal VoCals returned to Lincoln Center and reclaimed the ICCA title, making them one of only two groups to win that title more than once.
On April 29, 2012, the SoCal Vocals performed in competition at Town Hall in New York City. They won their third ICCA title. They are the only group, in the history of the ICCAs, to win the competition three times. They are also the only group to have won the ICCA title after having lost in semifinals but brought back from the Wild-Card round. 
In November, 2009, two current members of the USC SoCal VoCals joined with six VoCal alumni to compete as "The SoCals" on NBC's first a cappella competition, "The Sing-Off".
Also in 2010, several members of the VoCals also competed in Season 2 of "The Sing Off" as members of "The Backbeats"
In 2011 Scott Hoying, a member of the SoCal VoCals, lead a team of five people to win NBC's third season of "The Sing-Off" as Pentatonix.
Recordings.
The VoCals have released 6 (5 award-winning) albums, "This Ain't No Choir, Babe," "This 2 Shall Rock," "V3: Previously Unreleased," "The SoCal VoCals," "Get In. ROCK. Get Out.", "Unanimous", and their most recent album "Permit to Harmonize," released on March 1, 2013.

Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type

Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type (type 1, IRID1) refers to a spectrum of diseases characterized by malformations of the irido-corneal angle of the anterior chamber of the eye. Iridogoniodysgenesis is the result of abnormal migration or terminal induction of neural crest cells. These cells lead to formation of most of the anterior segment structures of the eye (corneal stroma & endothelium, iris stroma, trabeculum). 
Symptoms: iris hypoplasis, goniodysgenesis, and juvenile glaucoma. Glaucoma phenotype that maps to 6p25 results from mutations in the forkhead transcription factor gene FOXC1 
Transmission: autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. 
First reported by Berg (1932). 
Treatment: of glaucoma in iridogoniodysgenesis is primarily surgical. 
It is listed as a "rare disease" by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD). This means that Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type, or a subtype of Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type, affects less than 200,000 people in the US population.

Santiago Queirolo

Santiago Queirolo was a Peruvian pisco producer based in Pueblo Libre, a district in Lima.
History.
Italian immigrant Santiago Queirolo Raggio arrived in Peru in the 1880s, joining a thriving Italian community that had been developing for years in the city of Lima. Living in Pueblo Libre, then still little more than an agricultural town on the edge of Lima, he sold octopus and other sea food on the street before founding his tavern, Antigua Taberna Queirolo. Here he sold traditional Peruvian Creole food and bottles of wine and Pisco from grapes grown on land he bought around Cañete, south of the city.
Eventually his Pisco outsold his lunches, with "Santiago Queirolo" becoming a brand name for wines and spirits while the restaurant became only a side business.
Although the Antigua Taberna Queirolo is still in business, it's the Santiago Queirolo warehouse that sees most business. Here, where cases of Pisco are piled you will see restaurateurs and wholesalers placing large orders.
Today you can find Santiago Queirolo wines and spirits in many supermarket or restaurants around the world.

State within a state

State within a state (also or "status in statu") is a political situation in a country when an internal organ ("Deep State"), generally from the armed forces, intelligence agencies, or police, does not respond to the civilian leadership.
Sometimes, the term refers to state companies that, though formally under the command of the government, act "de facto" like private corporations. Sometimes, the term refers to companies that, though formally private, act "de facto" like "states within a state".
Certain political debates surrounding the separation of Church and State revolve around the perception that if left unchecked, the Church might turn into a kind of State within a State, an illegitimate outgrowth of the State's natural civil power.
"Imperium in imperio" was also the first state motto of Ohio, reflecting its great size and influence within the early United States.

<doc id="18880684" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18880684" title="Politics of Kuwait">
Politics of Kuwait

Kuwait's government is a constitutional monarchy.
Constitution.
The Constitution of Kuwait was ratified in 1962 and has elements of a presidential and a parliamentary system of government. The Emir is the head of State and has the power to appoint the Prime Minister. Both the Emir and judicially independent Constitutional Court have the authority to dissolve the parliament. 
The Kuwaiti parliament (per article 3 of the Constitution) has the constitutional right to approve and disapprove of an Emir's appointment, therefore the parliament has the authority to remove an Emir from his post. The parliament effectively removed Saad al-Sabah from his post in 2006 due to his illness.
The Constitution expressly supports political organizations, but they remain illegal as no law has arisen to define and regulate them. MPs tend to serve as Independents or as members of some loose affiliation or faction based on philosophy, sect, class or clan.
Citizens who have reached the age of 21 years, are not in the military and have not been convicted of a crime, can vote. Parliamentary candidates must be eligible to vote and at least 30 years old.
Elections.
The Parliament consists of fifty members who are elected in districts using the first past the post voting method. The major factions, de facto parties, are as follows; 
National Issues.
Two contentious issues, leading to six different elections between 1991–2008, involve issues pertaining to the electoral process and involvement of the ruling family in the government. The exclusion of women from the electoral process, prior to 2005, the minimum voting age of 21 and the fact that parties are still illegal, are also frequent points of contention.
2006 Election.
An early election was called in 2006 as disputes over the redistricting of legislative districts and dislike of the Prime Minister, led to the parliament being dissolved and new elections being called. The turnout rate was 66.4%. 
A coalition of liberals and populist nationalists (Popular Action Bloc) won 18 seats, becoming the largest political bloc in the parliament. Sunni Islamists won 16 seats. Most of the 13 liberal Independent candidates who won, were expected to side with the ruling family and the remaining seats were won by a Shiite populist faction.
2008 Elections.
Protests over the election law, lead to another early election being called in 2007. Along with charges of electoral fraud, concerns about high inflation was also a major campaign issue. This time the Sunni Islamists gained four seats, the Shitte populists gained no seats, the Neoliberals lost a seat and the Independents lost three seats. The ongoing protests over election laws and the power of the ruling family led to another early election.
2009 Elections.
Independents won 20 seats. Sunni Islamists won 11 seats, liberals won at least 8 seats and Shias won 9 seats. The Popular Action Bloc won 2 seats. 
2012 Elections.
Due to corruption allegations against previous Prime Minister Nasser Al-Sabah and mounting pressure from the parliament and numerous protests, the government resigned on 28 November 2011. Parliament was dissolved and early elections called for the early spring of 2012.
Liberals won 9 seats. The opposition bloc won 34 out of 50 seats in the parliament. The opposition bloc is a loose coalition of liberals, Islamists, secular nationalists, populists, tribes and a few Shiites. Sunni Islamists and tribes combined won 23 seats. 
2013 Elections.
Elections were held in July 27, 2013. Voter turnout was an estimated 52.5%, which was higher than expected despite an opposition boycott, the voter turnout was only 7% lower than the turnout of the non-boycotted February 2012 elections (59%). Liberals were the biggest winners of the election. 
According to the "Associated Press", liberal lawmakers gained at least six seats. The Congressional Research Service reported that liberals won 9 seats, making them the largest political bloc in the parliament after pro-government Independents. Fox News reported that the tribal bloc won at least 10 seats in the 50-member parliament. Two women were elected. The Shia group was reduced to eight seats after winning 17 seats in December 2012. Sunni Islamists won 3 seats.

Paula Miller

Paula Jean Miller (born August 1, 1959) is an American politician. She was a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates 2005–2012, representing the 87th district in the city of Norfolk. She ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the special election to fill the seat being vacated by Ralph Northam, who was elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, in the Virginia Senate, District 6, representing portions of Norfolk, the Eastern Shore, and Virginia Beach.
Early life.
Miller graduated from Attica Central High School in Attica, New York in 1977, then earned degrees in mass communications from Genesee Community College (1979) and speech communication from SUNY Geneseo (1981). She then began working locally in broadcast journalism.
In 1984 Miller and her husband, George Schaefer, moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where she became a reporter for WTKR-TV, the local CBS affiliate. Miller worked at WTKR until 1999, when she took over the public information office of the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office. 
Miller has two children, George Schaefer IV and Molly Schaefer. In 2007, George attended American Legion Boys Nation in Washington, D.C. and the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership's High School Leadership Program in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Political career.
Miller's husband, George Schaefer, became heavily involved in Norfolk Republican politics, serving as local party chair and making unsuccessful bids to unseat 86th district Delegate George Heilig in 1993 and 1995. Due to her TV news job, Miller's role in Schaefer's campaigns was severely limited.
Schaefer switched political allegiances at the turn of the millennium and was elected Norfolk Clerk of Circuit Court as a Democrat in 2003. Now out of TV news, Miller was able to take an active role in his campaign.
Delegate Thelma Drake, a Republican, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 2004, creating a vacancy in the 87th district, where Miller's house was then located. She decided to run and was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. In the special election on December 14, she narrowly defeated Michael Ball, the local Republican chair and a professional fundraiser for conservative televangelist Pat Robertson's Regent University. Miller stressed the need for bipartisan solutions to such issues as transportation and the environment, in the manner of Democratic Governor Mark Warner; Ball emphasized his conservative credentials and his potential for delivering for the district as a member of the House majority.
In 2005 she won reelection in a three-way race with Ball and independent John Coggeshall, a local lawyer, cabaret entertainer and radio talk show host. In 2007 she defeated retired Vice Admiral Henry C. "Hank" Giffin III, and in 2009 she defeated Republican John Amiral, a former Navy officer, to return for her third term in Richmond.
In 2011, Miller was redistricted into House district 100 along with fellow Democrat Lynwood Lewis. She did not run that year. The 87th district, which was moved to northern Virginia, was won by Republican David Ramadan.
Miller considered a run for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2013, but chose not to. Following Ralph Northam's election as Lieutenant Governor, Miller announced she would run to be the Democratic nominee in the special election for Northam's seat in the Virginia Senate.

2008 UCLA Bruins football team

The UCLA Bruins football team "(Motto: Then ... Now ... Forever)" opened the 2008 campaign by playing its first game at home against Tennessee under new head coach Rick Neuheisel, at 5:00 p.m. at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. The Bruins played six of the Top 25 teams in the 2007 final Associated Press rankings, with eight opponents played in last season's bowl games. More than half of the opponents had won nine or more games during the 2007 season.
The Bruins had seven home games and five away games this season, UCLA's 90th season in college football and 27th season at the Rose Bowl. Since moving to the Rose Bowl, the Bruins had a 109-46-2 record, winning 70% (prior to this season).
On Monday, August 19, Neuheisel named Kevin Craft (#3) as starting quarterback for the first game of the season. Both Ben Olson (#7) and Patrick Cowan (#12) were injured in pre-season practices. Other available quarterbacks were Chris Forcier (#8), Osaar Rasshan (#11), and Nick Crissman (#18).
Alterraun Verner and Aaron Perez were named to the 2008 Pacific-10 Conference All-Academic football team. Verner majors in mathematics and Perez is a sociology major. Sophomore place kicker Kai Forbath was named to Associated Press' All-America third team.
Coaching staff.
Norm Chow.
Other members of the coaching staff include: Wayne Moses, Running Backs coach; Bob Palcic, Offensive Line coach; Reggie Moore, Wide Receivers coach; Todd Howard, Defensive Line coach; Chuck Bullough, Linebackers coach; Tim Hauck, Secondary Coach; Frank Gansz, Jr., Special Teams.

SPECIALISTS: PK - Kai Forbath (25), Jeff Locke (49); KO - Jimmy Rotstein (37); P - Aaron Perez (17), 39 Danny Reese (39); LS - Christian Yount (52); H - 17 Aaron Perez (17); PR - Terrence Austin (4), Ryan Graves (2); KOR 4 Terrence Austin (4), Raymond Carter (20).
Media.
In addition to the games on TV, the football games were broadcast on the UCLA ISP Sports Network (AM570 Sports, in Los Angeles), with Chris Roberts, Matt Stevens and Wayne Cook. 2008 marked the 17th year of the voice of the Bruins for Roberts, 12th season for Stevens, and 7th year for Cook. Both Stevens and Cook are former quarterbacks for UCLA.
Game notes.
Tennessee (#18).
This was the season-opening game for both teams. Tennessee held a 7-4-2 record on the Bruins before game time. Only San Diego State had more games with the Bruins in a non-conference series history. The 1996 game against Tennessee set an attendance record with a crowd of 106,297 at Neyland Stadium.
UCLA and the University of Tennessee agreed to move up their football game to Labor Day in order to have the game nationally televised on ESPN as one of only two football games played on the final day of college football opening weekend. The game was originally scheduled for September 6. The game kicked off from the Rose Bowl at 5 p.m. Pacific Time in the ESPN Monday Night Football time slot, which for the rest of the season was devoted to NFL professional football. The moving of the game altered the schedules of the two teams. Tennessee was scheduled to begin the season on August 30 against the University of Alabama-Birmingham, but that game was moved to September 13. UCLA changed the September 6 slot to be an open date.
UCLA went ahead in the first quarter when Sean Westgate returned a blocked-punt for a 17-yard touchdown. After throwing four interceptions in the first half, Kevin Craft threw a 3-yard pass to Ryan Moya in a 70-yard drive that gave UCLA the lead late in the fourth quarter. Then Tennessee's Daniel Lincoln's 47-yard field goal tied the game with no time in regulation. But Kai Forbath kicked a 42-yard field goal to give the Bruins a 27-24 lead in overtime. The Volunteers were unable to match the Bruins in overtime when Lincoln's field goal attempt went wide left.
The win made Rick Neuheisel, a former UCLA quarterback who was the 1984 Rose Bowl MVP, only the third head coach to win in the first game. The win also marked the first win as a Bruin offensive coordinator for Norm Chow.
Tennessee Head Coach Phil Fulmer has a season opener record of 14-3, with all three losses coming to teams in California: a 25-23 loss to UCLA at the Rose Bowl in 1994, a 45-31 loss to California in 2007, and this game.
BYU.
It was a homecoming for Norman Chow, who was an assistant coach at BYU for many years. Dewayne Walker also coached the Cougars as defensive coordinator. The Bruins held a 7-2 record on the Cougars prior to the game. BYU was ranked No. 18 in the AP Top 25 poll and No. 15 in the USA Today/Coaches Poll. Former BYU quarterback Ben Olson did not play due to injuries. In his first career start at San Diego State, Kevin Craft completed 20 of 32 passes for 216 yards against BYU.
BYU scored first on a Max Hall pass to Dennis Pitta for 10 yards for a touchdown; then another Hall pass to Austin Collie for a two-yard score in the second quarter. UCLA fumbled the ball and the Cougars recovered, which led to Hall's pass to Collie for the third touchdown. The Bruins again fumbled and Hall had his 4th touchdown pass to Michael Reed. Another Bruins' fumble gave Hall his 5th pass touchdown. Before the end of second quarter, Hall threw his 6th pass (2 yards) to Pitta.
In the second half, Max Hall passed to Harvey Unga for a 6-yard touchdown, Mitch Payne kicked a 24-yard field goal and Wayne Latu rushed for a 13-yard touchdown to give BYU the 59-0 win. This was the worst loss the Bruins endured since a 76-0 defeat in the very first UCLA-USC rivalry football game.
Arizona.
The Bruins held a 19-11-2 record on the Wildcats at game time. On a day when the Bruins were woeful in punt coverage and bad in third down conversions, the Arizona Wildcats won 31-10 in the Rose Bowl. Arizona quarterback Willie Tuitama, who had been a thorn to UCLA for the last couple of years, threw 222 yards and a pair of touchdowns to tight end Rob Gronkowski.
The only touchdown for UCLA came from Korey Bosworth, who recovered a Wildcat fumble and rolled one yard into the end zone for the score. Kai Fobath kicked a 35-yard field goal to cut Arizona's lead to 17-10 at half-time.
No scoring by either team in the third quarter, but Arizona took care of that by scoring two touchdowns with the short fields in the final period. UCLA running back Chane Moline (#42) had 72 yards rushing and Arizona's wide receiver Mike Thomas (#10) caught for 112 yards. Aaron Perez kicked two punts for more than 50 yards for the Bruins and they were downed inside the two-yard line.
Fresno State.
Before the game, the Bruins held a 6-1 record on the Bulldogs. The game was a public safety appreciation game. Because of a knee injury, Fresno State's top defense lineman Jon Monga did not play.

California.
Cal quarterback Kevin Riley started for the Bears, his first since nearly a month before against Colorado State on September 27. The Bruins took their only lead of the game at the beginning of the second quarter by managing to block a punt attempt by Bryan Anger and recovering the ball in the end zone to go up 7-3.

Highlights for the Bruins included a 67-yard punt by Aaron Perez, Taylor Embree's five receptions for 64 yards and Reggie Carter's 10 tackles.
Washington.
Huskies head coach Tyrone Willingham already had been fired from his position. On October 27, 2008, the University of Washington announced that he will not be retained as head coach after the completion of Washington's 2008 football season. Willingham became the third Washington coach to be fired (out of the last four) since Hall of Fame coach Don James resigned in 1993 because of pending NCAA and Pac-10 sanctions against his team where his players were determined to have "accepted substantial and illegal benefits under James, likely with his knowledge".
UCLA coach Neuheisel had been fired in the summer of 2003 from the University of Washington in relation to his participation in a neighborhood pool for the 2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and lies he told about his actions. The University of Washington had its probation extended for failing to monitor its football program. This was Neuheisel's first return to Husky Stadium following the firing. There was some booing, but not a significant amount. The Huskies had been on a winless streak all season, and were at 0-9.
The day was sunny and dry, so weather was not a factor as can often be the case in Seattle in November. Under the direction of quarterback Kevin Craft, the Bruins drove 80 yards in 12 plays. Running back Derrick Coleman rushed for a touchdown in the first half. In the second half, the Bruins launched a ninety-two yard drive. Backed up against the goal line, running back Kahlil Bell ran four straight times, and Craft followed with several key pass completions. UCLA finally scored on a run by Bell, taking the 24-7 lead.
Arizona State.
UCLA led the series 15-8-1 entering the game, following the Sun Devils' 2007 24-20 win.
The Sun Devils ended UCLA's hope of postseason play with a 34-9 victory over the Bruins. Kai Forbath kicked three field goals, including a 53-yarder, for all of the Bruins' points. ASU had four defensive touchdowns, including a 100-yard interception touchdown.
In the game, Marcus Everett caught eight passes for 75 yards, Michael Norris had six tackles, and Korey Bosworth tallied two sacks during the game for UCLA. A school record was set when Aaron Perez punted eight times for a total career punt yards mark and Terrence Austin ran for 188 all purpose yards, 131 yards in kickoff returns.
USC.
USC led the series, 42-28-7, but UCLA had an 8-5 record over the Trojans in the Rose Bowl. Rick Neuheisel vs. USC was 1-1. Senior athlete salute. Before the season, this game garnered interest in seeing how coach Rick Neuheisel would perform in his battle to gain supremacy in Los Angeles. Both schools wore their home colorful uniforms, the first time since 1982.
A fumble recovery turned into a pass reception touchdown by Kahlil Bell in the beginning of the game was all the scoring by the Bruins in this the latest cross-town rivalry game. Quarterback Kevin Craft completed 11 out of 28 passes for a total of 89 yards and had one pass intercepted. He finished the season with 232 completions, second place in history. Terrence Austin set a new school record with 1,878 all-purpose yards, surpassing Maurice Jones Drew, who had 1,863 yards in 2005.
Joe McKnight (12-yard run), Damian Williams (12-yard pass from Mark Sanchez), Stafon Johnson (2-yard run) and Patrick Turner (18-yard pass from Sanchez) accounted for the Trojans' scores. Sanchez passed for 269 yards, McKnight ran for 99 yards and Turner caught for 81 yards.

Taylor Morrison

Taylor Morrison is one of the largest North America based home building companies. Its corporate headquarters are in Scottsdale, Arizona.
The company formed when Taylor Woodrow and Morrison Homes joined forces in July, 2007. Taylor Morrison operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas, building mid-to-upscale housing as well as first-time and mid-market homes. The company also operates in Canada, where conventional single-family homes as well as high-rise buildings in Toronto's urban core are marketed under the Monarch brand.
History.
Taylor Woodrow was founded in 1921 by Frank Taylor and Jack Woodrow. They built a pair of modest semi- detached houses at 347 and 349 Central Drive, Blackpool. During the twenties, Lord Taylor’s new company concentrated on providing low- cost, high quality housing in the Lancashire area. In the 1930s, Taylor Woodrow diversified into building temporary hospitals, etc., and thereby moved into general construction. In 1936 Taylor Woodrow entered the Canadian construction market through the acquisition of Monarch Development Corporation, founded in 1917, one of Canada’s oldest, largest and most diversified real estate companies. In 1953 the company purchased a controlling interest in a newly established business, Monarch Mortgage and Investments Limited, which owned land, apartment complexes, stores, and houses in the Toronto area, and in 1994, entered into the high-rise sector. Between 1945 and 2001 Taylor Woodrow's main operations were in general construction with Taylor Woodrow Homes only being a small part of the Group.
Morrison Homes was initially founded in Seattle in 1905 by C.G. Morrison and moved to northern California in 1946. The company built primarily first-time and midmarket home communities in Phoenix, Sacramento, Denver, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Austin, and Houston. George Wimpey Plc acquired Morrison Homes in 1984 when it was based in San Francisco, Northern California. George Wimpey's 2001 acquisition of Richardson Homes was later integrated under the Morrison brand.
On July 6, 2007, the United Kingdom-based parent companies of Morrison Homes Inc. and Taylor Woodrow Inc. joined. Taylor Woodrow Plc. and George Wimpey Plc. formed a new company, Taylor Wimpey Plc., becoming one of the world's largest home building companies. Morrison Homes joined with Taylor Woodrow as part of the parent company formation.
The companies continued to operate under their existing brands until 2008, when they began to operate under the new Taylor Morrison brand.
In July, 2011, Taylor Morrison became a wholly owned subsidiary of TMM Holdings Limited Partnership, which is indirectly owned by investment funds separately managed by TPG Capital, Oaktree Capital Management, as well as JH Investments. It was taken public in 2013.

McGivern was loaned to Walsall on a season long loan for the 2010–11 season, having won the race from other clubs, but was recalled on 20 January 2011.
After signing a new deal, keeping him at City until 2013, McGivern made a 28-day loan move to Crystal Palace on 3 August 2011, providing an assist for Jonathan Parr on his home debut for the Eagles. After his loan spell at Palace ended, McGivern moved to Bristol City for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. He made his debut for Bristol City on 10 September, against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Hibernian.
In August 2012, McGivern signed on loan for Scottish Premier League side Hibernian until January 2013. Having been an unused substitute for two games, McGivern finally made his debut, coming on for Alan Maybury, in a 2–1 loss against Aberdeen. He then established himself at Hibs, playing in the left-back position, replacing Maybury, who would play in the right-back position. His playing time having been increased, his loan deal was extended until the end of the season. After having his loan extended, McGivern said he would decide his future beyond then at the end of the season. During a match against Dundee United on 24 February 2013, McGivern was penalized for a foul on Gary Mackay-Steven which resulted in a penalty kick for United even though television coverage showed the incident was clearly outside the penalty area. After the match, McGivern criticised referee Alan Muir and his assistant Graham McNeillie for their decision. In the next game, a 2–2 draw with Kilmarnock, McGivern scored his first goal for Hibernian.
After a successful loan spell, McGivern agreed a permanent deal with Hibernian after his contract with Manchester City came to an end. The defender signed a two-year contract with the Easter Road side.
International career.
McGivern has been a regular at various underage levels for Northern Ireland, winning caps at Under-17 level in 2006, before elevation to the Under-19 in 2007. He played in the Northern Ireland elite side during their 2008 Milk Cup win.
Steve Beaglehole called McGivern to the Northern Ireland Under-21 squad for a mini tournament in Ukraine on 19 and 20 August 2008, but he never did make his U21 debut as Nigel Worthington promoted McGivern into the full Northern Ireland squad as a replacement for the injured George McCartney for a friendly international against Scotland on 20 August 2008. The eighteen-year-old made his debut in that match as a starter but the match was marred by his sending-off for two bookable offences. On 11 October 2008, he made his competitive debut, coming on as a second half substitute in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Slovenia.

Joseph Hibbert

Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert (born 1894, died September 18, 1986) was, along with Leonard Howell, Archibald Dunkley, and Robert Hinds, one of the first preachers of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica following the coronation of Ras Tafari as Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia on 2 November 1930. 
In about 1911, at the age of 17, he moved to Costa Rica where he spent 20 years at farm work, also becoming a member of the Ancient Order of Ethiopia masonic lodge. His background at this time had been with the Ethiopian Baptist Church, that had been founded in Jamaica by the 18th century Baptist preacher George Lisle. Hibbert returned to Jamaica in 1931, starting his ministry, "Ethiopian Coptic Faith", to teach that the newly crowned Haile Selassie was divine, in St. Andrew Parish, in a district called Benoah. He reached this conclusion independently, having studied the Ethiopic translation of the Bible. Somewhat later, he transferred his ministry to Kingston, where he found that another street preacher named Leonard P. Howell was already teaching many similar doctrines. Like Howell and Dunkley, Hibbert was subjected to arrest and imprisonment by authorities, and he was also a founding member of EWF Local 17.
Hibbert was probably among the Rastafari elders, including Mortimer Planno, who were given the honour of meeting with Haile Selassie I on his historic 1966 visit to Jamaica. In 1970, Hibbert formally invited the Archbishop Laike Mandefro, whom Haile Selassie had sent to Jamaica as emissary of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, to teach Rastafarians about the Orthodox Faith, and in about 1971, Mandefro named Hibbert as a "Spiritual Organizer".

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority v. Anderson

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority v. Anderson, et al., Civil Action No. 08-11364, was a challenge brought by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to prevent three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students from publicly presenting a security vulnerability they discovered in the MBTA's Charlie Card automated fare collection system. The case concerns the extent to which the disclosure of a computer security flaw is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The MBTA claimed that the MIT students violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and on August 9, 2008 was granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the students to prevent them from presenting information to DEFCON conference attendees that could have potentially been used to defraud the MBTA of transit fares. The MIT students contended that submitting their research for review and approval by a government agency before publication is unconstitutional prior restraint.
The case garnered considerable popular and press attention when the injunction unintentionally became a victim of the Streisand effect, increasing the dissemination of the sensitive information of the students' presentation because the slides had been both distributed to conference organizers in the weeks before the injunction as well as inadvertently posted to the district court's public website as exhibits to the MBTA's original complaint.
On August 19, the judge rejected the MBTA's request to extend the restraining order and the TRO likewise expired, thus granting the students the right to discuss and present their findings.
Background.
In December 2007, cautions were published separately by Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz regarding the weak encryption and other vulnerabilities of the particular security scheme as implemented on NXP's MIFARE chip set and contactless electronic card system. In March 2008, articles on the vulnerabilities appeared in newspapers and computer trade journals. A comparable independent cryptanalysis, focused on the MIFARE Classic chip, was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen. On March 7 the scientists were able to recover a cryptographic key from the RFID card without using expensive equipment. With respect to responsible disclosure the Radboud University Nijmegen published the article six months later. NXP tried to stop the publication of the second article through a preliminary injunction. In the Netherlands, the judge ruled on July 18 that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published.
In May 2008, MIT students Zack Anderson, Russell J. Ryan, Alessandro Chiesa, and Samuel G. McVeety presented a final paper in Professor Ron Rivest's "6.857: Computer and Network Security" class demonstrating weaknesses in the MBTA's automated fare collection system. The report identified four problems: the value is stored on the card and not in a secure database, the data on the card can be easily read and overwritten, there is no cryptographic signature algorithm to prevent forgeries, and there is no centralized card verification system. Anderson, Ryan, and Chiesa submitted a presentation entitled "Anatomy of a Subway Hack: Breaking Crypto RFID's and Magstripes of Ticketing Systems" to the DEF CON hacker convention which claimed to review and demonstrate how to reverse engineer the data on the magstripe card, several attacks to break the MIFARE-based Charlie Card, and brute force attacks using FPGAs.
Before the complaint was filed in August 2008, Bruce Schneier wrote on the matter that "Publication of this attack might be expensive for NXP and its customers, but it's good for security overall. Companies will only design security as good as their customers know to ask for."
Litigation.
On 8 August 2008, the MBTA filed suit seeking a temporary restraining order, both to prevent the students from presenting or otherwise discussing their findings until its vendors had sufficient time to correct defects and to seek monetary damages. The motion was granted on August 9 by Judge Douglas Woodlock and while the students appeared as scheduled, they did not speak or present at the convention. However, the injunction not only garnered more popular and press attention to the case, but the sensitive information in the students' presentation became even more widely disseminated afterwards since it had been both distributed to conference organizers in the weeks before the injunction as well as inadvertently posted to the district court's public website as exhibits to the MBTA's original complaint.
The MBTA retained Holland & Knight to represent them and contended that under the norm of responsible disclosure, the students did not provide sufficient information or time before the presentation for the MBTA to correct the flaw and further alleged that the students transmitted programs to cause damage to (or attempted to transmit and damage) MBTA computers in an amount in excess of $5,000 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Furthermore, it was contended that this damage constituted a threat to public health and safety and the MBTA would suffer irreparable harm if the students were allowed to present; that the students converted and trespassed on MBTA property; that the students illegally profited from their activities; and that MIT itself was negligent in supervising the undergraduates and notifying the MBTA.
The MIT students retained the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fish & Richardson to represent them and asserted that the term "transmission" in the CFAA cannot be broadly construed as any form of communication and the restraining order is a prior restraint infringing their First Amendment right to protected free speech about academic research. An 11 August letter published by 11 prominent computer scientists supported the defendants' assertions and claimed that the precedent of the gag order will "stifle research efforts and weaken academic computing research programs. In turn, we fear the shadow of the law's ambiguities will reduce our ability to contribute to industrial research in security technologies at the heart of our information infrastructure."
On 19 August, the judge rejected the MBTA's request to extend the restraining order and the TRO likewise expired, thus granting the students the right to discuss and present their findings.

Metacommunity

An ecological metacommunity is a set of interacting communities which are linked by the dispersal of multiple, potentially interacting species. The term is derived from the field of community ecology, which is primarily concerned with patterns of species distribution, abundance and interactions. 
There are four theoretical frameworks, or unifying themes, that each detail specific mechanistic processes useful for predicting empirical community patterns. These are the patch dynamics, species sorting, source–sink dynamics (or mass effect) and neutral model frameworks. Patch dynamics models describe species composition among multiple, identical patches, such as islands, and emphasizes colonization-competitive ability trade-offs. Species sorting models describe variation in abundance and composition within the metacommunity due to individual species responses to environmental heterogeneity, such that certain local conditions may favor certain species and not others. This model represents the classical theories of the niche-centric era of G. Evelyn Hutchinson and Robert MacArthur. Source-sink models describe a framework in which dispersal and environmental heterogeneity interact to determine local and regional abundance and composition. This framework is derived from the metapopulation ecology term describing source-sink dynamics at the population level. Finally, the neutral perspective describes a framework where species are essentially equivalent in their competitive and dispersal abilities, and local and regional composition and abundance is determined primarily by stochastic demographic processes and dispersal limitation. The neutral perspective was recently popularized by Stephen Hubbell following his groundbreaking work on the unified neutral theory of biodiversity.

Biography.
James H. Robb was born on April 25, 1918 in Bena, Minnesota. He attended St. Cloud State Teachers College, completing his Bachelor of Science degree in English and Psychology in 1940. After two years of teaching high school English, Robb entered the Army Signal Corps during the Second World War. He served as a officer (Captain) in the China, India, and Burma theaters until his discharge in 1946. After the war and his conversion to Catholicism, he entered Marquette University where he received his second Bachelors degree in Philosophy and Latin in 1948. Robb next pursued graduate studies at the University of Toronto, receiving a Licentiate in Medieval Studies Summa Cud Laude from the Pontifical Institute in 1952 and a M.A. and Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1953. After a Fulbright year in Paris, where he studied medieval philosophy and French cuisine, he began his teaching career at Loyola Marymount University.
Marquette University (1956–1991).
Robb returned to Marquette University in 1956, becoming one of the schools most popular professors over a thirty-year span until his retirement in 1991. Along with a great knowledge of Charles Peguy, Robb was an expert on Medieval Philosophy in general and Thomas Aquinas in particular and was the author/editor of three books: St. Thomas Questions on the Soul (1984); Man as Infinite Spirit (1974); critical edition of S. Thomae Aquinatis Quaestiones De Anima (1968) and numerous articles. He also served for over twenty-five years as Editor-in-Chief of the Marquette series, Mediaeval Philosophical Texts in Translation. James H. Robb died in Milwaukee on September 16, 1993.

Happy (Michael Jackson song)

"Happy" is a song recorded by the teenage Michael Jackson for the Motown label in 1973. The song featured on Michael Jackson's "Music and Me" album. Its full title is "Happy (Love Theme from "Lady Sings the Blues")", although it was never featured in the film or the soundtrack for "Lady Sings the Blues". The song was released as a single in Australia, backed by "In Our Small Way".[http://www.discogs.com/Michael-Jackson-Happy-In-Our-Small-Way/release/655958]
Jackson continued to perform the track in concert as late as 1977, citing it as one of his favorite songs.
The song was not released as a single in the UK until 1983 to promote Motown's "18 Greatest Hits" compilation album, on which the song was included. Upon its release, "Happy" (credited to Michael Jackson plus The Jackson 5) peaked at #52 on the British pop chart. It was also issued as a single by Bobby Darin and included on his posthumous Motown LP "Darin: 1936-1973". It was later recorded by the song's composer, Smokey Robinson, and appeared on his landmark solo album "A Quiet Storm".
According to Robinson, the song was inspired by the film's melody, which was originally composed by Michel Legrand. He explained, "I was looking at the movie one day, and I was listening to that melody, and I thought it was just such a beautiful melody, until I wanted to write some words for that melody, which I did, and I went and I sang them for Berry Gordy, and he was really upset because I didn't write them before he finished the movie so they could've been in the movie."

Carruthers Beattie

Sir John Carruthers Beattie (born 1866, died 1946) was the first principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Town from 1918 to 1937. He was born on 21 November 1866 in Waterbeck, Scotland. He graduated from Edinburgh University having studied at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow. Soon afterwards he was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at South African College in Cape Town. He married Elizabeth Paton in 1898. They had two daughters and a son. The son who was killed while serving with the R.A.F. in 1942. For his contributions to education in South Africa, he was knighted in 1920. He died in Cape Town on 10 September 1946.
Early life.
John Carruthers Beattie was born on 21 November 1866, in Dumfriesshire. He attended St John's Boarding School in Workington and Moray House in Edinburgh. He entered the University of Edinburgh and obtained a degree in Chemistry, Botany and Mathematics before furthered his studies in Physics at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow (under Lord Kelvin). In 1896 he was awarded a Doctorate of Science from the University of Edinburgh for his thesis entitled "The Behaviour of Bismuth Plates in a Steady Magnetic Field".
University career.
In 1897 Beattie was appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the South African College in Cape Town. Beattie’s research included the influence of X-rays, ultra-violet light, and the rays from uranium on the electrical conductivity of gases, and the leakage of electricity from charged bodies at moderate temperatures. During the Anglo-Boer War in February 1899, he and others demonstrated the application of wireless telegraphy by transmitting signals over a distance of 120 metres on Cape Town's Grand Parade using equipment imported from Britain. In 1901 he began a magnetic survey of South Africa. Starting in 1908 he extended the survey through central Africa to Egypt, arriving in Cairo in December 1909.
Beginning in 1904 there was a movement to obtain a charter for both the University of Cape Town and the University of Stellenbosch. Alfred Beit, a mining magnate and one of Cecil John Rhodes' collaborators, died in 1906 leaving a bequest of £200 000 for the creation of a university in Johannesburg. The then government though had a preference for Rhodes's idea of establishing a university in Cape Town on his former estate. The Beit trustees were then persuaded to allow the Beit Bequest to rather be used to pursue Rhodes's dream and additionally to contribute a further £300 000. Establishing a new university adjacent to South African College would then have inhibited its further development. Seeing an opportunity, Beattie became involved in the ‘audacious bid’ to develop South African College into this new national university. He succeeded, despite strong opposition from people in Johannesburg who wished to establish the university there, and the Beit's Bequest was subsequently used to establish the University of Cape Town.
Beattie in 1917 was appointed Principal of the South African College, abandoning his academic research. In 1918 he was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Cape Town, which he held till his retirement at the end of 1937. He was responsible for the establishment of the campus on the slopes of Table Mountain. The move to the present-day campus took place between 1928 and 1929. This helped establish the reputation of the university, opening of new departments and greatly increasing in the number of students from about 600 in 1918 to 2200 in 1938.
Awards.
Beattie was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining in November 1891. He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 March 1897, his proposers being Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown and Cargill Gilston Knott. He was a member of the South African Philosophical Society and was elected as President for the 1905-6 session. In 1910 he was awarded by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science the South Africa Medal and Grant; he was President of Section A of the Association in that year and President of the Association in 1928. In 1920 he was knighted for his services to education.
Honorary degree were conferred on him by the Universities of the Witwatersrand, Edinburgh, and Cape Town. The citation for the Honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh on 2 July 1927 read:
His numerous public activities included membership of the Board of Trustees of the South African Public Library, Cape Town (Chairman for several years), membership of the Scientific and Industrial Research Committee of the Union of South Africa and Vice-Chairman of the South African Broadcasting Board from 1937 to 1943.

Islamic Forum of Europe

The Islamic Forum of Europe (IFE) is an Islamic organization based in London with branches throughout the United Kingdom. Its website states it has branches in "most of the European countries including: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland".
Its youth wing is called the Young Muslim Organization (YMO), which is based in Tower Hamlets, "with several branches across Britain," and is very active among the Bangladeshi community. The YMO was established mainly by Bangladeshi youths in East London during the period of racial attacks in Tower Hamlets in 1978. Its women's wing is Muslimaat UK.
The group is said to have a more limited following in Birmingham where it has around 80 members. Its London and Sunderland branches are affiliated to the Muslim Council of Britain.
History.
IFE was founded by Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin. Its presidents include Musleh Faradhi during 2005. Dr Mohammed Abdul Bari was also president, before becoming chairman of the East London Mosque.
Insinuations of Extremist activity.
Farming minister Jim Fitzpatrick, blamed the organisation for sex segregation policies at the East London Mosque after attending an Islamic wedding held at the venue which strictly seated men and women separately.
A "Dispatches" documentary aired on 1 March 2010 suggested the IFE are an extremist organization with a hidden agenda that went against Britain's democratic values. "Dispatches" quoted Azad Ali, the IFE's community affairs coordinator, as saying, "Democracy, if it means at the expense of not implementing the sharia, of course no one agrees with that".
However, in a comment piece in the Guardian newspaper, Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain suggested that many of the people interviewed on the programme had hidden agendas of their own and highlighted that Jim Fitzpatrick, who suggested the Labour Party had been infiltrated by IFE members, was up against George Galloway in the upcoming elections who had overturned a 10,000+ majority held by Oona King at the 2005 general election.
Galloway was recorded as saying that his 2005 election owed "more than I can say, more than it would be wise for me to say, to the Islamic Forum of Europe." Responding to the "Dispatches" programme, Galloway denounced it as a smear, credited the IFE only as one of several groups that helped his anti-war campaign, and claimed to know little about the IFE's membership or policies.
The programme also claimed that the IFE also helped Lutfur Rahman to gain the leadership of Tower Hamlets Council from 2008 until 2010. Six unknown Labour councillors told "Dispatches" that a senior IFE official had threatened to mobilise the group's supporters against them if they did not support the candidate. IFE in a response to the programme stated that the programme "Presented a grossly inaccurate and misleading picture of the Islamic Forum of Europe (IFE). The programme failed to broadcast IFE’s responses to many of the allegations and therefore failed in its basic obligation of fair, honest and balanced reporting."
The group has been described as part of a movement of Bangladeshi immigrants in east London away from secular left politics towards Islamist politics.
The group has close links with the East London Mosque, which is located close to its offices. According to one report, the group found itself in conflict with Jamaat-e-Islami-affiliated group — Dawatul Islam (affiliated with the UK Islamic Mission) — at the East London Mosque "throughout the late 1980s". Dawat'ul Islam is now based at another mosque, Jamiatul Ummah Bigland Street. The IFE and YMO were featured in the book "The Islamist" by Ed Husain, where he explains that the YMO attracts mainly English-speaking Asian youths, providing circles or talks daily at the East London Mosque; while teaching about Islam, it covers the political system of the religion.
The journalist Robert Lambert criticized the accusations, pointing out that youth workers from the Islamic Forum of Europe were actively working to oppose the influence of extremist groups such as Al Qaeda and Al Muhajiroun, for which they should be commended rather than denigrated. He wrote the following on the work of IFE youth workers: ""the brave Muslims involved have received no praise for their outstanding bravery and good citizenship, and instead faced a never ending barrage of denigration."" More recently during the 2011 England riots, on 9 August, IFE youth workers made use of social media to thwart and chase away a large mob of looters from Whitechapel, where the East London Mosque is located.

Neverne Bebe

Neverne Bebe (Serbian Cyrillic: Неверне Бебе; trans. "The Unfaithful Babies") are a Serbian rock band from Belgrade.
History.
1990s.
The band was formed in 1993 by a former Nova Zemlja, Smak and Frenki keyboardist Milan Đurđević. The first lineup featured Vladan Đurđević (bass guitar), Bane Jelić (a former Viktorija backing band member, guitar), Čeda Macura (drums) and Puniša Zeljković, also known as Billy King (vocals). The band had its first performance on April 4, 1993 in Belgrade. The band's debut, progressive rock-oriented album "Neverne Bebe I" was released in 1994. It featured the hits "Veliki je Bog" ("Lord is Great") and "1000 godina" ("1000 Years"). "Neverne Bebe I" also featured a cover of the song "Daire" ("Tambourine"), originally released by Milan Đurđević's former band Smak. The Neverne Bebe version featured a guest appearance by Smak guitarist Radomir Mihajlović Točak.
After the success of the first album, Macura and Jelić left the band. The guitarist Saša Ranđelović (a former Čutura i Oblaci member), drummer Dušan Šubarević and female vocalist Gorica Ponjavić became the band's new members. This lineup held its first concert in Podgorica on May 25, 1994. In 1996, the band started recording their second studio album. At the end of 1996, Billy King left the band, and was replaced by Aleksandar Tasić, and in August 1997 Šubarević left the band and was replaced by Goran Marinković. "Neverne Bebe II" was released in 1997, featuring hits "Godine srama" ("Years of Shame"), "Divlje svinje" ("Wild Pigs"), "Stranac" ("Stranger") and the band's cult ballad "Dvoje" ("Couple").
2000s.
In 2001, the band released the album "Neverne Bebe III – Južno od sreće" ("Unfaithful Babies III – South of Happiness"), which was more pop rock-oriented than the band's previous releases. The album featured hits "Ljubav" ("Love"), "Balkan" and "Gotovo" ("Over").
In 2003, vocalists Ponjavić, Tasić and Marinković left the band, and two female singers, Jelena Pudar and Jana Šušteršič, and the drummer Duca Ivanišević joined the band. This lineup held its first concert in Herceg Novi. In 2004, the band released the album "Neverne Bebe IV – Dvoje – The Best Of" ("Unfaithful Babies IV – Couple – Best Of"), which featured re-recorded hits and two new songs.
In 2005, Ivanišević was replaced by Vladimir Ružičić. In 2006, the band performed as the opening band on Toto concert in Belgrade's Тašmajdan Stadium and started recording their fifth album. "...Iza oblaka" ("...Beyond the Clouds") was released in 2007. The album featured the ballad "Boje duge" ("Colors of the Rainbow") recorded with Parni Valjak frontman Aki Rahimovski. In 2008, the band performed as an opening act on Lenny Kravitz concert in Belgrade Arena.
2010s.
In 2010, the band released the promo video for the song "Uzmi boje" ("Take the Colors"), which was announcing their sixth studio album. However, in March 2011, Jana Šušteršić left the band, moving to USA. She was replaced by Tijana Sretković, who previously performed with the band on several occasions.
In 2012, the band released their sixth studio album, entitled "Praštam" ("I Forgive"). Beside Sretković, "Praštam" featured another new member, Andreja Stojić (acoustic guitar). The album, released in standard and deluxe edition, featured guest appearances by Croatian singer Vanna, on the track "Za tvoje oči" ("For Your Eyes"), and Macedonian guitarist Vlatko Stefanovski, on the track "Dan tvoj" ("Your Day"). Only several months after the album release, Stojić was replaced by Nemanja Savić, singer of the hard rock/heavy metal band Atlantida. Alongside acoustic guitar, in Neverne Bebe Savić also plays percussion instruments and sings backing vocals.
On December 28, 2013, the band celebrated 20 years of activity with a concert in Kombank Arena.
Legacy.
In 2011, the song "Da ima nas" ("There Should Be Us") from the album "...Iza oblaka" was polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, one of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label's existence.

Karia HM V

HM V is a class of two-bogie four-axle (Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement) tram operated by Helsinki City Transport (, abbreviated HKL; , abbreviated HST) on the Helsinki tram network. All trams of this type were built by the Finnish tram manufacturer Karia in 1959.
The first trams of this type were withdrawn from service in 1993. As of 2008 six trams (numbers 9, 11–14 and 175) remain in operational condition. Of these, two have been extensively repaired and are occasionally used in normal service (numbers 9 and 12), one has been converted into a restaurant tram (former no. 15, now no. 175 "Spårakoff") and one is used as a non-passenger carrying advertisement tram (no. 14).
Concept and construction.
The HM V type trams, alongside the near-identical RM 3 type produced at the same time by Valmet, were the last development in a series of five near-identical tram types produced by Karia and Valmet for operations on the Helsinki and Turku tram network during the 1950s (the previous types being HM IV and RM 1 for Helsinki and RM 2 for Turku).
HKL ordered the HM V type trams from Karia, a subsidiary company of Suomen Autoteollisuus, in 1957. The series designation stands for "Helsingin moottorivaunu, viides sarja" (). Karia built the bodies and assembled the trams, while Sisu (another subsidiary company of Suomen autoteollisuus) supplied the bogies and Strömberg the electronics.
Service history.
The first HM V tram, number 1, was delivered to the HKL on 1959-04-27, with number 15 delivered last in the series on 1959-10-23. Coinciding with the delivery of these new trams the HKL had decided to reset their numbering scheme. Therefore the HM V trams were numbered starting from one and not from 376, as they would have been had the old numbering been continued. The HM V trams were built to be compatible with the HP II type trailers that had been constructed in 1958–1959, also by Karia. The usage of trailers in Helsinki ended in 1983, although the couplers needed for hauling trailers were retained in the HM V type trams for many years afterwards, number 14 being the last tram to have one, with the coupler removed only in 2006.
Originally the HM V trams were built to be operated by two people, with a separate driver and conductor. Between 1978 and 1982 they were converted to one-person operations, with the driver also acting as the ticket seller.
The first HM V units to be withdrawn from service were numbers 5 and 6, withdrawn in 1993, with number 7 following in 1994. In 1994 work also begun on converting number 15 into a pub tram. These works were completed in 1995, when number 15 was renumbered into number 175 in honour of the 175th anniversary of the Sinebrychoff brewery, who also paid the conversion work of the tram. In addition to be being renumbered, the tram was named Spårakoff (from Helsinki slang "", tram, and "Koff", a beer brand brewed by Sinebrychoff). Also during 1995 number 11 was rebuilt as a "NAC prototype" by ABB, with new traction motors and control devices.
During the latter half of the 1990s HKL ordered 40 low-floor Variotrams, which were projected to replace the HM V and RM 3 types in their entirety. During the early 2000s three HM V trams were withdrawn from service, with number 4 withdrawn in 2000, and numbers 1 and 2 during the following year. However, due to persistent technical problems of the Variotrams, some other units in the class remained in service. In 2004–2005 number 12 was in Tallinna Trammi- ja Trollibussikoondis (TTTK) depot in Tallinn for large-scale repair/renovation process. Similar renovation were carried out at TTTK on number 9 in 2005–2007. Number 11 received smaller-scale renovation in 2007. While these three trams were restored, numbers 3, 8 and 10 were withdrawn from service in 2006–2007, leaving six HM V trams in existence.
Liveries.
Originally all HM V trams were painted in the traditional yellow/green livery used in HKL trams, with the top half of the carriage painted yellow and the bottom half green. In 1995 on conversion into the Spårakoff pub tram, number 175, ex-15, received a new all-red livery advertising Koff beer. Numbers 8, 9 and 15 had occasionally been used as advertisement trams during the 90s, and from 2005 onwards number 14 has been used as an advertisement tram, covered entirely in adverts of various companies.
During the extensive repairs at TTTK in Tallinn, number 9 and 12 have been painted with a modified version of the original livery, with added silver decorative stripes; one running between the yellow and green fields, and another near the bottom of the carriage.
Interior layout and design.
In the original interior layout with a separate conductor and driver the HM V trams had capacity of 29 seated passengers and 69 standing passengers. During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 standing passengers. On conversion to one-person operation during the late 70's and early 80's, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Spårakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers.
Names.
The nicknames ', ', ' and ' have been used the HM V trams. Below are some of the explanations that have been offered for these nicknames.

Quadriga (award)

Quadriga is an annual German award sponsored by "Netzwerk Quadriga gGmbH", a non-profit organization based in Berlin. The award recognizes four people or groups for their commitment to innovation, renewal, and a pioneering spirit through political, economic, and cultural activities.
The award consists of a small statue resembling the quadriga atop the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. "Werkstatt Deutschland" presents the award every year on German Unity Day, which commemorates German reunification in 1990. The award has been presented by prominent individuals, including Viktor Yushchenko, Bernard Kouchner, and Mikhail Gorbachev.
History.
The award was first given in 2003. For the first two years, the award ceremony took place at Konzerthaus Berlin. From 2005 until 2008, the ceremony was held at Komische Oper Berlin opera house. In 2009, the award ceremony was hosted at the seat of the Foreign Office of Germany.
The announcement that Vladimir Putin would receive the award in 2011 was widely condemned. As a result of protests by Quadriga board members and former recipients, the 2011 awards and ceremonies were cancelled. Likewise, the Quadriga was not awarded in 2012.
Recipients.
2011.
Controversy.
The announcement that Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin would be awarded the prize led to a public outcry. Quadriga board members Cem Özdemir of the German Green Party, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia, and Heidelberg University history professor Edgar Wolfrum stepped down in protest. Former recipients Olafur Eliasson and Václav Havel decided to return their awards. "The New York Times" commented that from the volume of outcry the ranks of people feeling Putin, a former East Germany-assigned KGB agent and later chief, had rolled back democracy and human rights in Russia are apparently quite large. The organisers decided not to make any awards in 2011 as a result of the controversy. They released a statement on 16 July 2011 saying they acted "in light of the growing and unbearable pressure and the danger of further escalation" and that they deeply regretted hearing news of Havel's decision. The awards ceremony scheduled for that October was therefore cancelled.

Continuant (mathematics)

In algebra, the continuant is a multivariate polynomial representing the determinant of a tridiagonal matrix and having applications in generalized continued fractions.
Definition.
The "n"-th "continuant", "K"("n"), of a sequence a = "a"1...,"a""n"... is defined recursively by
It may also be obtained by taking the sum of all possible products of "a"1...,"a""n" in which any pairs of consecutive terms are deleted.
An extended definition takes the continuant with respect to three sequences a, b and c, so that "K"("n") is a polynomial of "a"1...,"a""n", "b"1...,"b""n"−1 and "c"1...,"c""n"−1. In this case the recurrence relation becomes
Since "b""r" and "c""r" enter into "K" only as a product "b""r""c""r" there is no loss of generality in assuming that the "b""r" are all equal to 1.
Applications.
The simple continuant gives the value of a continued fraction of the form formula_7. The "n"-th convergent is
The extended continuant is precisely the determinant of the tridiagonal matrix
