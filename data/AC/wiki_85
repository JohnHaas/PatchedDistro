Dicobalt edetate

Dicobalt edetate is the coordination compound with the approximate formula Co2(EDTA)(H2O)6. 
Solutions of this solid have been used in Europe as an antidote to cyanide poisoning.
It is a derivative of the (non-natural) amino acid ethylenediaminetetraacetate.
Structure.
The compound is polymeric in the crystalline form. Half of the Co2+ ions are bound to the EDTA2− and the other Co2+ ions are bound to four water ligands as well as carboxylate ligands on the entity. In aqueous solution, depolymerization occurs to give [Co(EDTA)2− and ions, each of which is kinetically labile and has a high affinity for cyanide. Oxidants would convert the [Co(EDTA)2− into [Co(EDTA)]−, which would be unreactive toward cyanide because this complex would be "inert."

Charles Dolan (politician)

Charles Joseph Dolan (18 August 1881 – June 1963) was an Irish politician.
He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1906, representing North Leitrim constituency.
He resigned his seat in 1908 by taking the Manor of Northstead in order to re-fight the constituency on behalf of Sinn Féin. However, he was defeated by Francis Edward Meehan, the IPP candidate.
After losing the by-election, Dolan emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri, then a center of shoe manufacture. He hoped to export that technology and set up a shoe factory in Leitrim, but was not successful. He continued to agitate on behalf of an independent Ireland and against the entry of the United States into World War I.
Dolan's marriage to an Episcopalian in 1953 and entry into Freemasonry made him a pariah among the Irish community of St. Louis. He became a law professor and died in 1963.

Armoire (Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin)

This armoire, displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851, was designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812–52) and made by JG Crace (1809–89). The shields along the top and the carved decorative motifs were drawn from medieval sources. The motifs include Crace's initials, a plummet (carpenter's tool) as an emblem of his honesty, and a compass to indicate his ability to keep within his estimates. Many designers of the Victorian period were inspired by the art of the Middle Ages, but Pugin was probably the greatest and most ardent exponent of the Gothic Revival style. 
The cabinet was the grandest piece in the group of furniture designed by Pugin and made by Crace for the Medieval Court in the Great Exhibition of 1851. As Crace was a judge for Class XXVI (furniture) and the cabinet was exhibited in his name, it was not eligible for a medal. 
A prolific designer, best remembered for his decoration of the Houses of Parliament, Pugin exhausted himself and died the year after this cupboard was made, aged only forty. The Victoria and Albert Museum bought the cupboard directly from the 1851 Exhibition, making it one of its earliest acquisitions.

Porolepiformes

Porolepiformes is an order of prehistoric lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period (about 416 to 359 million years ago). The group contains two families: Holoptychiidae and Porolepididae. 
Porolepiformes was established by the Swedish paleontologist Erik Jarvik, and were thought to have given rise to the salamanders and caecilians independently of the other tetrapods. He based this conclusion on the shapes of the snouts of the aforementioned groups. This view is no longer in favour in Paleontology.
Jarvik also claimed the existence of choanae in porolepiformes which linked them to tetrapods, but this has remained controversial. Recent phylogenetic reconstruction places porolepiformes close to lungfishes.
More recent evidence has shown that at least one genus "Laccognathus" was most likely amphibious.

Catena (biblical commentary)

A catena (from Latin "catena", a chain) is a form of biblical commentary, verse by verse, made up entirely of excerpts from earlier Biblical commentators, each introduced with the name of the author, and with such minor adjustments of words to allow the whole to form a continuous commentary.
The texts are mainly compiled from mainstream authors, but they often contain fragments of certain patristic writings now otherwise lost. It has been asserted by Faulhaber that half of all the commentaries on scripture composed by the church Fathers are now extant only in this form.
History.
The earliest Greek catena is ascribed to Procopius of Gaza, in the first part of the sixth century. Between the seventh and the tenth centuries Andreas Presbyter and Johannes Drungarius are the compilers of catenas to various Books of Scripture. Towards the end of the eleventh century Nicetas of Heraclea produces a great number of catenas. Both before and after, however, the makers of catenae were numerous in the Greek Orient, mostly anonymous, and offering no other indication of their personality than the manuscripts of their excerpts. Similar compilations were also made in the Syriac and Coptic Churches.
In the West, Primasius of Adrumentum in the former Roman province of Africa in the sixth century compiled the first catena from Latin commentators. He was imitated by Rhabanus Maurus (d. 865), Paschasius Radbertus, and Walafrid Strabo, later by Remigius of Auxerre (d. 900), and by Lanfranc of Canterbury (d. 1089). The Western catenae have had less importance attached to them. The most famous of the medieval Latin compilations of this kind is that of Thomas Aquinas, generally known as the "Catena aurea" (Golden chain) and containing excerpts from some eighty Greek and Latin commentators on the Gospels. Aquinas composed the parts of his "Catena aurea" treating the gospels of Mark, Luke, and John while directing the Roman "studium" of the Dominican Order at the convent of Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, "Angelicum".
Similar collections of Greek patristic utterances were constructed for dogmatic purposes. They were used at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, at the Fifth General Council in 553, also apropos of Iconoclasm in the Seventh General Council in 787; and among the Greeks such compilations, like the exegetical catenae, did not cease until late in the Middle Ages. The oldest of these dogmatic compilations, attributed to the latter part of the seventh century, is the "Antiquorum Patrum doctrina de Verbi incarnatione". 
Finally, in response to homiletic and practical needs, there appeared, previous to the tenth century, a number of collections of moral sentences and paraenetic fragments, partly from Scripture and partly from the more famous ecclesiastical writers; sometimes one writer (e.g. Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, especially John Chrysostom whom all the catenae-makers pillage freely) furnishes the material. Such collections are not so numerous as the Scriptural or even the dogmatic catenae. They seem all to depend on an ancient Christian "Florilegium" of the sixth century, that treated, in three books, of God, Man, the Virtues and Vices, and was known as τα ιερά (Sacred Things). Before long its material was recast in strict alphabetical order; took the name of τα ιερά parállela, "Sacra Parallela" (because in the third book a virtue and a vice had been regularly opposed to one another); and was attributed widely to John Damascene, whose authority was defended (against Loofs, Wendland, and Cohn) by K. Holl in the above-mentioned "Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter" (Leipzig, 1899), though the Damascene probably based his work on the "Capita theologica" of Maximus Confessor. The text of these ancient compilations is often in a dubious state, and the authors of most of them are unknown; one of the principal difficulties in their use is the uncertainty concerning the correctness of the names to which the excerpts are attributed. The carelessness of copyists, the use of "sigla", contractions for proper names, and the frequency of transcription, led naturally to much confusion.
Printed editions.
From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, various catenas were published. However no modern editions exist, and there are severe textual problems in editing them.
Among the editors of Greek catenae was the Jesuit Balthasar Cordier, who published (1628–47) collections of Greek patristic commentaries on St. John and St. Luke and, in conjunction with his confrère Possin, on St. Matthew; the latter scholar edited also (1673) similar collections of patristic excerpts on St. Mark and Job. The voluminous catenae known as "Biblia Magna" (Paris, 1643) and "Biblia Maxima" (Paris, 1660), edited by J. de la Haye, were followed by the nine volumes of "Critici Sacri, sive clarissimorum virorum annotationes atque tractatus in biblia", containing selections, not only from Catholic but also from Protestant commentators. 
An important collection of the Greek catenae on the New Testament is that of J. A. Cramer (Oxford, 1838–44), online at archive.org. See also the twenty-eight volumes of the Migne commentary in his "Scripturae sacrae cursus completus" (Paris, 1840–45).

In the years 1898 to 1902, he published his comprehensive five volume work "Kunst- und Geschichtsdenkmäler des Großherzogtums Mecklenburg-Schwerin" (Art and Art History of the Great-Dukedom of Mecklenburg-Schwerin"). He was also a friend and promoter of the famous archeologist Heinrich Schliemann.
A 1902 marble bust of Schlies by Ludwig Brunow is to be found in the Staatl. Museums Schwerin.

Game Editor

Game Editor is a 2D game authoring package. It supports multi platform development to iPhone, iPad, Mac OS X, Windows (95-Windows 7), Linux, Windows-based Smartphones, GP2X, Pocket PCs, and Handheld PCs. Compatibility with these platforms is mentioned on Game Discovery, a popular site for game developers, among other software like 3D Gamemaker, Darkbasic, and .
Game Editor was created by Makslane Rodrigues, who has been developing it since 2002. The current version is 1.4.0. It is still considered to be a work in progress.
Features.
Interface.
The interface itself is relatively basic and is the same for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. Navigating the editor map (where the level is designed and executed) involves panning. The interface is composed of a main menu at the top, which shows the current position on the map, and icons indicating the mode(s) the user is in. The interface is window based. Each action and event has its own window, along with several settings windows.
Target platforms.
Target platforms include Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, iPhone, iPad, Windows Mobile based Smartphones, GP2X and Handhelds. It is possible to make builds, or export game data only. This is useful when the designer wants the game, or parts of the game, apart in different files, but don't want them to be all executables. The editor itself runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.
Scripting language.
Game Editor uses a scripting language that bears similarities to the C programming language. Scripts are created through the script editor, defined as an action triggered by an event.
The script editor window gives access to the built-in names of objects (actors), variables and functions. It is capable of syntax coloring to make code easier to distinguish.
Actor concept.
The objects in Game Editor are known as actors. Notably, this doesn't mean every actor has to be a character. You can add multiple graphics and animations to an actor from supported formats (listed below).
Game Editor recognizes alpha channels, to enable animation transparencies. In the case of all images, it recognizes the top-left pixel's color as the transparent color, and finally, there's a transparency value you can modify to set literally how transparent the actor will be overall, which gives various possibilities for adding visual effects to your game, e.g.: fog.
Actors can have either animations or text, which is handy for help sections, menu descriptions, and RPG talk. With actors you can also play sounds, sound effects and add music to your game. Again there are many file formats you can use.
A very important aspect of actors, is that there are 3.141 types of them. The normal actor type is what the above talks about. The additional types of actors are Wire-frame, Filled Regions, and Canvas actors.
Wire Framed regions can serve as borders for some collision, but they're not visible in game, and cannot receive mouse click events. Filled Regions are also invisible, the difference being they can receive actions from mouse clicks.
Canvas actors let you draw any line, image or other elements on them. Additionally, it allows the rotation and scaling of other images on other actors, as well as just a file on disk. Scripting knowledge is needed to perform these effects.
Events.
The Game Editor engine is event driven. For something to happen in your game, Game Editor handles events you create using the interaction of actors, and other game elements, the mouse and the keyboard. In Game Editor, you can customize to a very high extent what actions happen on an event.
Events that can be triggered:
And here is a list of actions you can select to be done on any of those events:
Level creation.
Game Editor provides two ways for dividing the levels of the game. One is creating separate files for each level, and then linking them with 1 or 2 functions. But if the levels are small anyway, and you don't want to separate them so much, then you can put all levels into one file, and surround the levels with activation regions which defines the surrounded part of the file loaded in and out of the memory together, This loads and unloads actors and regions depending on whether the activation region is touching the view. If you have earlier created a separate level file, then you can merge projects together into one file, as long as the actor names merged are different.
Non-actor objects.
Game Editor also allows you to create Paths, and activation events. Paths are marked as nodes in Game Editor interface, and can specify a route the actor will move on. The speed of the path can also be modified, and the path can be made up of Bézier curves and linear lines too.
Activation events are another important aspect. When one actor receives an event, then if there's an activation event on that actor for that event, then it triggers an activation event on the specified actor. Example:
If in game play two cars crash, and there's a hintbox actor which comments in-game events, and we want the hintbox to say: "2 cars crashed" when they did, then we create an activation event one of the cars, and make the triggering event a collision with another car actor, and then set the activation event receiver to Hintbox, and finally, create an action for the activation event on hintbox, which is a Set Text, then we can specify the color, and font of the displayed text.
File extension.
Game Editor, before exporting/building your game into an executable, can save your project, into a .ged file. All versions of Game Editor are backwards compatible. Game Editor also adds a folder named "data" into the directory in which you saved the .ged to store the related graphics, animations, sounds, and music files. To save your undo/redo possibilities, a .ged.undo file is created.
Reference and help.
When using game editor, a documentation is accessible reached from the main menu's Help section. This documentation explains the basics of the editor to the concept of individual script functions. The game editor website supports a forum that answers more complex questions involving game design and demos to experiment from. The editor forum also gives access to additional files for the amateur to use.
Game Editor source code.
The source code of Game Editor was made available to the public as of October 2008. It was subsequently dual-licensed as of October 2009 under the terms of the GPL v3 and a commercial license [http://game-editor.com/License] for use with proprietary projects.
The revenues are shared [http://game-editor.com/Sharing_Software_Revenues_in_Open_Source] with all developers that's have accepted contributions. It is hoped this can help increase the rate of Game Editor's development.
Known problems.
Bugs have been known throughout game editor, sometimes they being rather conflicting. Game Editor can have problems if large numbers of scripts are present, where objects can behave abnormally. An example of this is that some objects will conduct an event at an undesirable time, and sometimes parts of scripts can be completely missed. This can make large levels in a single file close to obsolete; if large levels were to be created, it is recommended that these levels be divided up into separate files. Separate files can cause conflict with the user because these files are not universal, and much of the main game elements of what is in the other levels are expected to be the same for all levels. Game Editor lacks autonomous multiple file updating.
Another problem that is experienced is activation region usage. When using activation regions, other parts of a game will not function if the view is out of those activation regions these objects take place in, which can be a disadvantage for large levels without using complex scripts to "blend in" with these effects.
System requirements.
These requirements are for the Mac, Linux and Windows development environments.
Please note that the system requirements for the (ARM-based) iPhone, iPad, GP2X and (various architectures) hand-held devices will be different.

In the early 1930s Auziņš became a candidate for Latvia national football team, but he didn't play for it until 1935. He played with Vanderers until 1939 and the biggest achievements were two second place finishes in the Latvian league – in 1932 and 1934. In 1936 Auziņš was a member of the Vanderers squad that won the Latvian Cup (in the first year when its name had been changed from Riga Football Cup) and another time in 1938. With the Latvia national team Auziņš played seven matches in 1935.
Auziņš played with Riga Vanderers until 1939, then retired from active football only to return to it during World War II. In 1941 during the German occupation of Latvia he played with the Students football club, and from 1942 to 1944 – with US Riga.
Ice hockey playing career.
In ice hockey Auziņš played all of his career with the hockey team of US Riga winning three Latvian league titles – in 1937, 1940 and 1942. He played with Latvia national ice hockey team at the 1936 Winter Olympics.
Coaching career.
Auziņš was the director of the Lokomotīve football stadium in Riga for more than three decades – from 1947 to 1980 but in addition to it he also worked as a football and ice hockey coach. In football he worked with the senior squad of Lokomotive Riga (from 1956 to 1959) and with its youth squad. The most notable footballers whom he coached include Vilnis Straume and Leonards Andžāns.

List of existentialists

Existentialism is a movement within Continental philosophy that developed in the late-19th and 20th centuries. As a loose philosophical school, some persons associated with Existentialism explicitly rejected the label (e.g. Martin Heidegger), and others are not remembered primarily as philosophers, but as writers (Fyodor Dostoyevsky) or theologians (Paul Tillich). It is related to several movements within Continental philosophy including Phenomenology, Nihilism, Absurdism and Post-modernism.
Pre-Existentialist philosophers.
Several thinkers who lived prior to the rise of Existentialism have been retroactively considered proto-Existentialists for their approach to philosophy and lifestyle.

Sideboard (Edward William Godwin)

This sideboard was designed by Edward William Godwin (1833–86), who was one of the most important exponents of Victorian "Japonisme", the appreciation and appropriation of Japanese artistic styles. Japan began trading with the West in the 1850s, and by the next decade imported Japanese prints (Ukiyo-e), ceramics and textiles were very fashionable in Britain. Godwin was influenced by interiors depicted in Japanese prints and by the studies he made of Japanese architecture, but he did not seek to imitate Japanese designs. Instead his Anglo-Japanese furniture aimed to combine the more general principles of simplicity and elegance he admired in the art of Japan with domestic needs of the Victorian home.
The sideboard is stylish and dramatic, but it is also quite appropriate for use in a dining room. It is functional with drawers, adjustable shelves, and a rack fitted to take a large dish between the cupboards. The construction and finish are practical and hygienic, with hard surfaces and simple decoration, and the raised bottom shelf gives access for cleaning the floor.
Godwin designed the first version of this sideboard in ebonised deal, a cheap wood, in 1867. He subsequently changed to ebonised mahogany, as he found deal to be unstable. At least ten versions of the original were made between 1867 and 1888, with differences in design, in decoration or in the number of legs. There are several surviving examples of this sideboard, made of ebonised deal, mahogany, or oak and pine. The original sideboard was designed by Godwin for the dining room of his London home in 1867.

It is an introduced species in North America, where it was first reported from Queens in New York City in 1993. In 2009 it was found in Rochester, New York, so it appears to be established and spreading.
The wingspan is 26–35 mm. The length of the forewings is 12–15 mm. The moth flies from April to October depending on the location. There are two generations per year in North America.
The larvae feed on "Plantago" and various grasses.

Lon Oden

Lon Oden (March 15, 1863 – August 10, 1910) was a Texas Ranger of the Old West, and is a legend inside the Texas Rangers organization.
Early life.
He was born Alonzo Van Oden and called "Lon", in Tilden, Texas, in McMullen County. At the time, Tilden was called Dogtown, and previously it had been called Rio Frio, because it is located on the Frio River. It was later changed to the name Colfax, but eventually settled on the name of Tilden, after Samuel Tilden, a presidential candidate. Lon Oden was born into a family with an exciting past.
His father, Aaron Van Buren Oden, of Swedish descent, had served several times as a Texas Ranger before fathering Lon Oden. Four months after Lon Oden's birth, Aaron Oden, accompanied by rancher George Hindes, encountered Julian Gonzales, a noted horse thief from Starr County, Texas. They came into contact with him between the towns of Presidio and Los Ojuelos, on the Rio Grande. In the ensuing gunfight that followed, Aaron Oden killed Gonzales, but was himself shot and killed by Gonzales. Hindes, lacking proper tools, buried Aaron Oden where he died, then had the task of informing Aaron's 19 year old wife, Mary Jane Walker Oden, of her husbands death. Mary Jane Oden was now left to raise their son with no father.
Lon Oden's grandfather, Mary Jane Oden's father, Joe Walker, had initially raised his family in Shelby County, Texas, but was forced to leave after he killed two men during the Regulator-Moderator War. They eventually settled in Atascosa County, where they became some of its earliest settlers. It was there that Mary Jane Walker married Aaron Van Oden. Mary Jane Oden, however, did not last long after her husbands death. She died on August 31, 1864, only a year after her husband. Her father Joe recorded in his journal that she died of a broken heart, out of grief. 
This left Lon Oden to be raised by his grandparents, and both the Walker family and the Oden family shared in this task. His grandmother Oden taught him in the classics of her native Sweden. She also educated him in poetry and the arts. From the Walker side, he learned the arts of shooting, and the skills necessary to survive in a harsh land. His grandfather, Joe Walker, had a total of nineteen children, but due to the circumstances surrounding Lon Oden's becoming an orphan at the age of 1 year, Joe Walker took special interest in the child and his upbringing. When Lon was only 2 years old, Joseph Walker gave him 150 head of cattle, registering them with the "ODN" brand. 
Lon Oden's uncles, Tom and James, were but teenagers when their sister died. Coming from the Walker family, which was noted for being rugged and tough, they were outdoorsmen, cowboys, and from the enormous amount of time he spent with them, Lon Oden learned the trade of cattle, and how to work them and wrangle them. During this time, he often saw his family battle against raiding Comanche, who would raid the ranch for horse or cattle. On Christmas Eve, 1868, his cousin William "Buck" Taylor was gunned down and killed, in a shooting which many attribute to have been the start of the Sutton–Taylor feud The Walker family was tied to the Taylor's due to James Walker having married Sophronia Taylor, the widow of Martin Taylor. Lon Oden's uncle Tom Walker became a somewhat well known gunman, who had several brushes with the law due to shootings he was involved in. He eventually drifted to Seven Rivers, New Mexico, and took part in the Lincoln County War as a member of the Seven Rivers Warriors gang. He was killed in a gunfight on November 23, 1879. This was the life and family in which Lon Oden was raised.
Texas Ranger career.
Lon Oden married for the first time in 1889, but the marriage ended shortly thereafter in divorce, and on March 1, 1891, he joined the Texas Rangers. For a time he worked the region surrounding San Antonio, but then was sent west to serve with Ranger John R. Hughes. Oden and Hughes were dispatched to Shafter, due to the Carrasco brothers gang, led by Antonio Carrasco, committing armed robberies in order to steal silver being shipped from the silver mines. Assisted by Ranger and undercover agent Ernest St. Leon, the Rangers set up surveillance on a mine where the thieves were expected to strike, based on inside information gained by St. Leon. When the outlaws opened fire after ignoring the command to surrender, the Rangers killed all three men.
Oden then was sent to El Paso, where he worked for some time, and where he became acquainted with, and friends with Ranger Bass Outlaw. In 1893, when Ranger Captain Frank Jones was ambushed and killed, John Hughes took over as Ranger Captain for that area. Because Jones and his small band of Rangers were mistakenly inside Mexico when the ambush had taken place, there was to be no prosecution of those responsible. However, still working undercover, Ernest St. Leon supplied a list of names of those known to have taken part in the killing to Captain Jones. Accompanied by a company of Rangers, including Oden and led by Hughes, the Rangers tracked down and killed all 18 men on the list, either by shooting them or by hanging them. 
Oden had by this time settled in Ysleta, Texas. During this time he took part in several Ranger raids, and over time he and his fellow Rangers working that area drastically reduced the number of robberies and cattle rustling in that region. On April 5, 1894, Bass Outlaw was shot and killed by John Selman in El Paso. Outlaw was not innocent in his own death, a fact which made it all the more difficult to accept for Oden. Outlaw, intoxicated and furious at what he deemed mistreatment by a local judge, had shot and killed Ranger Joe McKidrict inside a brothel. When confronted by Selman, a constable at the time, Outlaw and Selman became involved in a gunfight, leaving Selman wounded, and Outlaw dead. Two years later, on April 5, 1896, lawman and friend to Outlaw, George Scarborough, would shoot and kill Selman in a gunfight over Selman having killed Outlaw.
Lon Oden continued working as a Ranger, and by this time he had developed a considerable reputation due to the numerous and mostly unknown outlaws and cattle rustlers he had either killed in shootouts, arrested, or hanged. He had become involved with widow Annie Laura Hay around 1894. On January 17, 1897, the couple married, and he left the Rangers shortly thereafter to become a rancher and businessman. He started a successful ranch in Marfa, Texas. He died there of an unknown lung ailment on August 11, 1910. In 1936, his daughter Annie Laura Oden Jensen published his diary of his exploits as a Ranger.

John Clement (physician)

John Clement (born in Yorkshire about 1500; died 1 July 1572, in the Blocstrate, St. John's parish, Mechlin) was an English Roman Catholic physician and humanist. He was tutor to Thomas More's children, and became President of the College of Physicians.
Life.
He was educated at St. Paul's School and Oxford. Thomas More admitted Clement as one of his household to help in the education of his children and to assist him in linguistic studies. 
In 1519 we find Clement at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, when Cardinal Wolsey constituted him the Rhetoric Reader in the university; later he became professor of Greek there. About 1526 he married the daughter of a Norfolk gentleman, Margaret Giggs, who lived and studied with More's family; she had been adopted by More.
Applying himself to the study of medicine, he was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians (1 February 1528), and was chosen by Henry VIII to attend Wolsey when the latter was dangerously ill at Esher (1529). He was consiliarius of the college from 1529 to 1531, in 1547, and again from 1556 to 1558. He held the office of president in 1544, and that of censor in 1555. 
After the accession of Edward VI of England he retired to Louvain to escape persecution for his Catholicism; he was exempted from the general pardon granted by Edward. He returned to England in Mary Tudor's reign and practised his profession in Essex, but fled abroad again when Elizabeth of England came to the throne. 
Mechlin was his last place of exile. He lies buried in the cathedral church of St. Rumbold in that city.
Works.
He wrote: "Epigrammatum et aliorum carminum liber"; and also translated from Greek into Latin:

George Candidius

George Candidius () (1597, Kirchardt, Palatinate – 30 April 1647, Batavia, Dutch East Indies), also recorded as Georgius Candidius, was a Dutch Reformed Church missionary to Taiwan from 1627 to 1637. He was the first missionary to be stationed on the island. Sun-Moon Lake in central Taiwan was named "Lake Candidius" in his honour and is referred to thus in older English writings, although this name was not adopted by the local inhabitants and later fell into disuse.
Candidius studied at Leiden, Netherlands, from 1621–1623, when he was persuaded by Sebastiaen Dankaerts to minister overseas. Before arriving in Formosa in 1627 Candidius worked in Ternate, Moluccas. Having arrived in Taiwan he refused to live in the Dutch castle Zeelandia and settled in the native village of Sinckan instead.
In 1632 he married Saartje Specx, Eurasian daughter of Governor-General Jacques Specx. Saartje had previously evoked a scandal in Batavia and Holland when she was discovered making love to a young soldier in the private quarters of Specx's predecessor, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, who was known for his harsh discipline. Narrowly escaping a death sentence, she was flogged and her lover beheaded.
After a year in residence in the region of Tayouan (present-day Tainan), Candidius commented regarding his missionary duties that:
Candidius returned to the Netherlands in 1639 and went to Batavia in 1643, where he served as rector of the Latin school until his death.

Azizabad airstrike

The Azizabad airstrike took place on Friday 22 August 2008 in the village of Azizabad which is located in Shindand district, Herat Province, Afghanistan. It is estimated that between 78 and 92 civilians, mostly children, were killed during the attack and a number of structures in the village, including homes, were damaged or destroyed, although there remains some dispute about the accuracy of these figures. A Taliban commander was the intended target of the airstrike.
Reaction.
Azizabad residents.
The day after the attack, Saturday 23 August 2008, villagers organised a demonstration against Afghan troops which had been deployed to Azizabad to distribute food and other assistance. Several people were injured during a confrontation between villagers and army personnel.
Government of Afghanistan.
The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, described the attack as "tragic" and "irresponsible". Karzai dismissed two senior Afghan military personnel, a general and a major, for "negligence and concealing facts". After a cabinet meeting the government announced that it would seek to renegotiate the terms of the international presence in the country. Some analysts suggested that this announcement was a direct response to the Azizabad event. A government statement called for an end to "airstrikes on civilian targets, unilateral searches of homes and illegal detentions" by international forces.
In February 2009, a primary court in Herat sentenced Mohammad Nader to death for giving "wrong information" to coalition forces which resulted in the Azizabad airstrike. The presiding judge, Qazi Mukaram, told Nader that, "You, Mohammad Nader, are sentenced to capital punishment for spying for foreign forces and giving wrong information that caused the death of civilians." Nader denied the charges, saying, "My information was accurate and I did it for the well-being and security of my village."
Government of United States.
The Pentagon described the attack as "a legitimate strike against the Taliban" and questioned the casualty estimates given by the government of Afghanistan and reported by the media. The US military originally denied that any civilian casualties had occurred, but later acknowledged that some civilians may have been killed and announced its intention to conduct an investigation. Preliminary findings of the investigation acknowledged that five civilians had been killed. On 2 September 2008, a further report was announced in which the US stated that up to seven civilians had been killed and reasserted that the majority of those killed were members of the Taliban. On 1 October 2008 the Department of Defense published the summary of a report by Brig. Gen. Michael Callan which accepted that 33 civilians were killed.
United Nations.
In a statement on the attack, the United Nations reports that "An investigation by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has found that some 90 civilians, including 60 children, were among those killed during military operations in the strife-torn nation’s western Herat province last week." The investigation found "'convincing evidence, based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, and others,' that some 90 civilians were killed – including 60 children, 15 women and 15 men – and another 15 villagers wounded."
Other international reaction.
Russia circulated a draft United Nations Security Council statement on Tuesday 26 August which expressed serious concern about the numerous civilian casualties reportedly caused by the airstrike. It stated that member nations "strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind."
Video emerges that show more than 40 bodies.
On 8 September 2008, a video recorded on a mobile phone emerged, showing around 40 bodies. Following the emergence of this new evidence, the United States announced the need for an independent enquiry into the matter. An Afghan government commission stated that 90 civilians, including 60 children and 15 women, died in the bombing. General David D. McKiernan, the senior U.S. officer in Afghanistan and NATO commander, said in a statement "In light of emerging evidence pertaining to civilian casualties in the August 22 counter-insurgency operation in the Shindand District, Herat province, I feel it is prudent to request that U.S. Central Command send a general officer to review the U.S. investigation and its findings with respect to this new evidence".
Possible deaths of coalition contractors.
The New York Times reported on October 7, 2010, that eight coalition security contractors were killed in the attack. The contractors were alleged to be headed by a 'Mr. White II' whose men included former Taliban fighters.

Jean François Renaudin

Jean François Renaudin (13 July 1750 in Le Gua - 29 April 1809, Le Gua) was a French Navy officer and Rear-Admiral. He is mostly known for captaining the "Vengeur du Peuple" at the Third Battle of Ushant.
Career.
Early life.
Renaudin was born to a modest family of Saint-Martin du Gua, and joined the merchant navy before enlisting in the French Royal Navy as a suppleant frigate lieutenant in 1779. He served on the fluyt "Dorade", on which he took part in four battles. He was promoted to Sous Lieutenant de Vaisseau on 1 May 1786.
At the French Revolution, Renaudin was promoted to Lieutenant de Vaisseau on 1 January 1792, and to Captain on 1 January 1793; he was appointed to command the 20-gun corvette "Perdrix", cruising off Belle-Ile and Rochefort. He later transferred to the frigate "Andromaque", on which sustained a fight against a ship of the line and four Spanish frigates.
The "Vengeur du Peuple" at the Glorious First of June.
Renaudin commanded the "Vengeur du Peuple" in the fleet of Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse. Exiting Brest, "Vengeur" was separated from her fleet, which prevented her from taking part in the Action of 29 May 1794; on the next day, however, she sustained fire from ten British ships while preventing them from cutting the French line of battle.
On the next day, at the Glorious First of June, Renaudin led a fierce battle against HMS "Brunswick", in which "Brunswick" and "Vengeur" disabled each other. As "Vengeur" could not be rescued by French frigates, Renaudin asked for help from the British.
Renaudin was rescued by HMS "Culloden" and abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship. Though his account of the event insinuated that he was on a boat close to "Vengeur" when she foundered, he was in fact dining in the mess of "Culloden" at the moment of the sinking. Taken in captivity in Tavistock, he wrote an account of the fight of "Vengeur" on 1 Messidor an II (19 June 1794), signed and had it co-signed by his staff, comprising, Jean Hugine, Louis Rousseau, Pelet, Trouvée, Lussot and others.
In France, Renaudin was assumed to be dead, and posthumously promoted to contre-amiral on 29 August 1794. His return astonished the Convention on 10 September 1794, when Jean-Jacques Bréard stated:
Nevertheless, in 1847, Lamartine wrote a description where Renaudin was killed, cut in half by a cannon shot like Dupetit-Thouars, and Thiers later wrote an account repeating Barère's version, where "Vengeur" refused to surrender.
Remarkably, neither the national Archives, nor the archives of the Navy, nor the archives of the War Council nor Renaudin's personal file mention any court-martial that should have been held automatically for the loss of the ship, in accordance with French law.
Later life.
Renaudin was promoted to Rear Admiral on 29 August 1794, purportedly a postumeous honour, before being exchanged. He was put in command of "Jemmapes" before obtaining command of the 3rd Squadron of the naval army of the Ocean (the Brest fleet under AdmiralMartin), a 6-ship division, on 29 October 1794, with his flag on "Jemmapes". In late February 1795, Renaudin's division left Brest to reinforce the naval forces of Toulon, where it arrived on 3 April 1795.
On 24 March 1798, Renaudin was appointed to the 2nd squadron of the Brest fleet, succeeding Admiral Lelarge. From 21 March 1799, he commanded the naval forces of Napoli, before moving to Toulon to become the senior officer of the garrison on 25 May 1799, replacing Jean Gaspard Vence who had fallen in disfavour after an altercation with Bruix.
On 23 September 1799, Renaudin became general inspector of oceanic harbours from Cherbourg to Bayonne. He retired on 4 April 1801, and died in Le Gua.

The Temple.
There are number of famous temples in Trichy District like Trichy Malaikkottai Thayumanaswami temple, Srirangam Renganatha swami Temple. Our Thirupparaitturai Tharugavaneshwarar Temple can also be treated on par with those temples for its grandeur.
The great Nalvars and ArunagiriNathar have sung in praise of the presiding deity of Thirupparaitturai temple.
History of the temple.
This is the place then known as Tharugavanam where Lord Shiva as Pitchardanar destroyed the pride of Tharugavana Hermits. 
Long long ago Tharugavana Hermits became oblivious (unmindful) Lord Shiva and thought that they could be omnipotent through their own spiritual powers. They chanted numberless prayers, and performed numberless poojas and sacrifices. They slighted and forgot Lord Shiva completely. 
Knowing all those things, Lord Shiva sent Lord Vishnu in Mohini Avatar (a beautiful woman) to set right the hermits who had gone astray. All Tharugavana Hermits felt drawn towards Mohini by the silken bonds of love. They felt irresistibly attracted towards the infinite charm and exquisite beauty of Mohini. They all forgot their prayers, poojas and everything.
Lord Shiva himself went as Pitchadanar (a handsome youth) to the ladies of Tharugavana hermits. They also fell in love with Pitchadanar and lost their purity. 
At this the Tharugavana Hermits felt enraged and performed Homas and Yagas. They brought forth a Tiger by the strength of their Tapas and sent it to kill Shiva. But Lord Shiva slaughtered the tiger and wore the skin as his typical dress. Lord Shiva took their thrisul as his weapon. Their baby deer was placed on his left hand. Their snakes were worn as ornaments by Lord Shiva. 
Lord Shiva, otherwise piously called Tharugavaneshwarar, ParaithuraiNather, ParaithuraiSelvar is being worshipped by the large number of people since 7 th Century A.D. 
The Total area of the land which the holy Temple is situated is more than . The temple is surrounded by a gigantic boundary wall.

Strawberry Thief (William Morris)

Strawberry Thief is one of William Morris's most popular repeating designs for textiles. It takes as its subject the thrushes that Morris found stealing fruit in his kitchen garden of his countryside home, Kelmscott Manor, in Oxfordshire. To print the pattern Morris used the ancient and painstaking indigo-discharge method he admired above all forms of printing. He first attempted to print by this method in 1875 but it was not until 1881, when he moved into his factory at Merton Abbey Mills, near Wimbledon, that he succeeded. In May 1883 Morris wrote to his daughter, "I was a great deal at Merton last week ... anxiously superintending the first printing of the Strawberry thief, which I think we shall manage this time." Pleased with this success, he registered the design with the Patents Office. This pattern was the first design using the technique in which red (in this case alizarin dye) and yellow (weld) were added to the basic blue and white ground. 
The entire process would have taken days to complete and consequently, this was one of Morris & Co.'s most expensive cottons. Customers were not put off by the high price, however, and Strawberry Thief proved to be one of Morris's most commercially successful patterns. This printed cotton furnishing textile was intended to be used for curtains or draped around walls (a form of interior decoration advocated by William Morris), or for loose covers on furniture.

Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg

Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg (6 February 1643, Wetterau – 4 July 1712, Frankfurt am Main) was the first ever Minister-President (effectively Prime Minister) of the kingdom of Prussia, and the head of the "Cabinet of Three Counts".
Life.
In his youth he was Oberstallmeister and Geheimer Rat in the council of Mary of Orange (1642–1688), sister-in-law of the Great Elector and wife of Pfalzgraf Ludwig Heinrich von Simmern (1640–1674). On her death he transferred to the service of Frederick III of Brandenburg, where he rose quickly through the ranks - in 1691 he became Schlosshauptmann of Berlin, in 1694 Hauptmann der Dompropstei Havelberg, in 1696 Oberstallmeister and Oberkammerherr.
On the fall of first minister Eberhard von Danckelmann in 1697 he became minister and finance minister and quickly eliminated his competitors Hans Albrecht von Barfus and Paul von Fuchs via targeted intrigue and filled important court posts with his henchmen. On 18 January 1701, at Frederick's coronation in Königsberg, it was Johann who was allowed to place the purple cloak on him, and in the same year he became prime minister. His course was marked by a proliferation in the offices he was awarded - 
along with those already mentioned, he also held the offices of marshal of the kingdom of Prussia, protector of the Royal Academy, chancellor of the Order of the Black Eagle, Oberstallmeister, Oberaufseher of the royal castles, Oberhauptmann of all the Schatullenämter, postmaster general. Moreover, he did not hold these offices one after the other, but instead all at once, in a kind of personal union, thus making him able to fill the court with systematic corruption and enrich himself shamelessly.
He was also assisted by his wife Katharina Rickers (1670, Lobith - 1734, The Hague). She was of middle-class origin, as the daughter of a tax collector for the Brandenburg court to the Duchy of Cleves in Emmerich am Rhein. She came to Berlin as wife to Kammersekretär Peter Biedekap and there fell in love with Johann. After their marriage, she became the king's official mistress. Johann's son Kasimir (1699) later became a general under Frederick William I of Prussia.
In 1704 the king successfully petitioned the Holy Roman Emperor to promote Johann to the rank of Reichsgraf of Wartenberg. Johann and his ministers, Oberhofmarschall Graf August von Wittgenstein (14 April 1663 – 1735) and Generalfeldmarschall Graf Alexander Hermann von Wartensleben (1650–1734) − the "three great W(oes)" of Prussia (Wartenberg, Wartensleben, Wittgenstein) – raised and wasted national taxation. For example Johann made August Reichsgraf zu Sayn-Wittgenstein director of salt mines in 1705, and then used the opportunity to raise the salt tax and thus increase his receipts. He also introduced taxes on wigs, hats, stockings and carriages, as well as the precursor of a coffee tax (whoever wanted tea, coffee or cocoa had to acquire a license, costing two taler a year). Wartenberg was also a member of the "der Bessere" company. 
As the population's troubles mounted, crown-prince Frederick William intervened and Johann's cabal fell. In 1711 Johann was released from government service and retired to his estates.

Charles Wooler

Charles Robert Dudley Wooler (born June 30, 1930 in Bulawayo, Rhodesia) was a first-class cricketer who played for the Leicestershire County Cricket Club in England and the Rhodesia cricket team which competed in the Currie Cup.
Wooler was a right-arm fast-medium pace bowler and started his first-class career at Leicestershire. After making his debut in a non county match against Northamptonshire in 1949, he earned a regular spot in the team for the 1950 County Championship season. He finished the summer with 54 wickets at 31.31. His average would have been better had he not bowled in a match against the touring West Indians who amassed 2/682 declared in their first innings. Frank Worrell and Everton Weekes both scored double hundreds while teammate Roy Marshall fell for 188. Wooler took 0/103 from his 28 overs.
He took exactly 50 wickets the following summer, at a slightly better average of 28.20. His 100th first-class wicket was that of Kent all-rounder Alan Shirreff. 
When the summer ended, Wooler traveled to Rhodesia and represented their team in the 1951/52 Currie Cup. He managed 23 wickets at 32.34 in first-class matches for Rhodesia, with perhaps the biggest of those scalps being his last ever, Denis Compton of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Dark fermentation

Dark fermentation is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen. It is a complex process manifested by diverse groups of bacteria, involving a series of biochemical reactions using three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark fermentation differs from photofermentation in that it proceeds without the presence of light.
Fermentative/hydrolytic microorganisms hydrolyze complex organic polymers to monomers which are further converted to a mixture of lower-molecular-weight organic acids and alcohols by obligatory producing acidogenic bacteria.
Utilization of wastewater as a potential substrate for biohydrogen production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative substrate for H2 production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and biodegradability (Angenent, "et al.", 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, "et al.", 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, "et al.", 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, "et al." 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), starch hydrolysate wastewater (Chen, "et al.", 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, "et al.", 2007a, 2008b) have been reported to produce biohydrogen apart from wastewater treatment from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched mixed cultures under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, "et al.", 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, "et al.", 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin "et al.", 2004, van Ginkel, "et al.", 2005), domestic wastewater (Shin, "et al.", 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu "et al.", 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, "et al.", 2007, Venkata Mohan, "et al.", 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, "et al.", 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H2 production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H2 production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H2 production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a biocatalyst, operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, "et al.", 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, "et al.", 2008d).
In spite of its advantages, the main challenge observed with fermentative H2 production processes is the relatively low energy conversion efficiency from the organic source. Typical H2 yields range from 1 to 2 mol of H2/mol of glucose, which results in 80-90% of the initial COD remaining in the wastewater in the form of various volatile organic acids (VFAs) and solvents, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol. Even under optimal conditions about 60-70% of the original organic matter remains in solution. Bioaugmentation with selectively enriched acidogenic consortia to enhance H2 production was also reported (Venkata Mohan, "et al.", 2007b). Generation and accumulation of soluble acid metabolites causes a sharp drop in the system pH and inhibits the H2 production process. Usage of unutilized carbon sources present in acidogenic process for additional biogas production sustains the practical applicability of the process. One way to utilize/recover the remaining organic matter in a usable form is to produce additional H2 by terminal integration of photo-fermentative processes of H2 production (Venkata Mohan, "et al." 2008e, Rai et al. 2012) and methane by integrating acidogenic processes to terminal methanogenic processes.

Alonso de Salazar Frías

Alonso de Salazar Frías has been given the epithet "The Witches’ Advocate" for his role in establishing the conviction, within the Spanish Inquisition, that accusations against supposed witches were more often rooted in dreams and fantasy than in reality, and the inquisitorial policy that witch accusations and confessions should only be given credence where there was firm, independent, corroborating evidence. He was probably the most influential figure in ensuring that those accused of witchcraft were generally not put to death in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spain. The Spanish Inquisition was one of the first institutions in Europe to rule against the death penalty for supposed witches. Its Instructions of 1614, which embodied Salazar's ideas, were influential throughout Catholic Europe.
Biography.
Alonso de Salazar Frías (c. 1564–1636) was born in Burgos, where his father was a lawyer and belonged to an influential family of civil servants and prosperous merchants. Salazar studied for degrees in canon law at the University of Salamanca and at the University of Sigüenza. He took holy orders and was appointed as a vicar-general and judge at the court of the bishop of Jaén. His career owed a great deal to his close relationship with Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, Bishop of Jaén, and subsequently Archbishop of Toledo. Having gained a reputation as a successful lawyer, Salazar was elected Attorney General of the Castilian Church in 1600. When his patron became Inquisitor General in 1608, Salazar was selected as an inquisitor for a vacant post at Logroño (La Rioja) in 1609. His intelligent and single-minded approach to the witch trials conducted by this tribunal created great respect for him within the Inquisition. He became a member of its Supreme Council in 1631.
Witch Trials in Navarre.
When Salazar joined the tribunal of Logroño as its third inquisitor in June 1609, preliminary hearings were already under way in what was to prove the biggest series of witch trials in Spanish history, eventually involving 1384 supposed child witches and 420 supposed adult witches. This was a witch persecution unmatched in scale, before or after, in Spain. The accused in these trials came almost exclusively from Zugarramurdi and Urdax, two Basque villages within the region of Spanish Navarre, on the northern side of the Pyrenees, near the French border.
The investigation began when Maria de Ximildegui, of Zugarramurdi, claimed that she had attended witches' Sabbaths (nocturnal gatherings), and named other members of the village as present. She confronted one of the women she accused, Maria de Jureteguia, in front of the woman's family, and recounted the details so vividly that the listeners became convinced and pressured the woman to confess. She admitted it was true and said she had been a witch since she was a small child. After her priest urged her to make a public confession, during the next few days various others who had been denounced came forward and made public confessions. Some of those under suspicion were dragged to the local priest by force and threatened with torture if they did not confess.
In January 1609, four self-denounced witches were taken to Logroño for an initial hearing before the Inquisition. Not until the preliminary inquiries were completed did the inquisitors inform the Inquisitor General and the Supreme Council in Madrid. The two inquisitors in Logroño, Alonso Becerra Holguin and Juan del Valle Alvarado, assumed the existence of a witch sect was a fact, largely because the witches' descriptions were in such close agreement. Their descriptions of the devil, nocturnal assemblies and admissions ceremonies tallied, with very few discrepancies between accounts.
In March 1609, the Supreme Council of the Inquisition sent a questionnaire to Logroño to administer to imprisoned witches, witches still at liberty, and certain witnesses. Several of the questions aimed to establish whether the experiences of the supposed witches were dreams or reality, indicating the sceptical attitude of the Council The inquisitors only applied the questionnaire to imprisoned witches. From the answers, it was clear to them that the witches' gatherings were not based on dreams or imagination but were real.
A subsequent visitation by inquisitor Valle Alvarado concluded that about 300 adults were incriminated in witchcraft, of whom thirty-one of the most guilty were taken to Logroño for trial in June 1610. The inquisitors, by now including Salazar, were unanimous that those nineteen who confessed their crime should be punished but saved from the stake, except for one who was condemned to burn for being a proselytizer for the witch sect. But they disagreed over the fate of those twelve who denied the offence. Whereas the other inquisitors considered it a foregone conclusion that they should be sent to the stake, Salazar was not convinced of their guilt and voted for their interrogation under torture in order to provide more proof. In the event, the majority judgment prevailed, and those who denied their guilt were burned either alive or dead (for those who died while in prison). At this stage, Salazar's doubts remained known only to his fellow inquisitors.
These events occurred simultaneously with the witch-hunt conducted by French judge Pierre de Lancre in the Pays de Labourd, north of the Pyrenees. De Lancre's investigation led to mass burning of accused witches, who numbered over 80, according to Salazar (this figure is now recognised as the probable maximum, and much closer to the truth than the formerly accepted figure of 600, which arose out of a misunderstanding of what de Lancre himself wrote). There is little doubt that news of de Lancre's activities fuelled a witch panic on the Spanish side of the border. The public auto de fe at Logroño in 1610, attended by perhaps as many as 30,000 people, whipped up further anxiety about witchcraft in 1610–11 and produced a flock of accusations and confessions. In the whole area of northern Spanish Navarre, it seemed that there was hardly a town without bewitched children who were taken to witches’ nocturnal gatherings and who named all those they had seen there. 
However, important sceptics believed that the accused in the Logroño trials had made false statements under torture or threats. This conviction was shared by local priests, Jesuit preachers and even the Bishop of Pamplona, Venegas de Figueroa, who informed the Inquisitor General that the witch craze consisted of rumours spread by children and simple folk who had heard about the witches in France. Faced with so many new unsubstantiated accusations and confessions, Salazar refused to support the other inquisitors, and a divided vote was forwarded to the Supreme Council.
In March 1611, the Inquisitor General instructed Salazar to make a new visitation, this time alone, unaccompanied by the other inquisitors. He was not to use pressure to force confessions, nor to question witches about supposed accomplices, but he was to interrogate witches who allegedly attended the same gathering to see if their statements tallied. Salazar's visitation began in May 1611 and lasted almost eight months. He was struck by the defendants’ uncertainty and inconsistency, and their frequent retraction of statements they had previously made about others. He rejected out of hand the statements of 1384 children, aged between six and fourteen years, which were full of defects. He concentrated upon obtaining material proofs of the existence of the supposed witch sect. When the accused were taken to the supposed place of the gathering and interrogated in detail about where the devil sat, they contradicted each other and their own earlier statements. Supposed ointments and powders proved to be fake materials, which the accused admitted contained harmless substances that they had cooked up in order to satisfy their persecutors and to substantiate confessions. Children who said they had been to gatherings in the village of Santesteban had lied, since Salazar's secretaries had been to the place on the night in question and had seen no one. In fact, the supposed witches had never been seen by anyone. Salazar concluded that the devil deludes those who think they have been to his gathering, with the intention of creating uproar and unjustly incriminating the innocent. The supposed witch sect was a product of the imagination. In a report to the Inquisitor General, Salazar wrote:
"I have not found one single proof nor even the slightest indication from which to infer that one act of witchcraft has actually taken place…the testimony of accomplices alone without further support from external facts substantiated by persons who are not witches is insufficient to warrant even one arrest."
In a subsequent report to the Supreme Council in 1613, Salazar severely criticized the procedure of the tribunal during the witchcraft outbreak, not even disclaiming his own responsibility. The inquisitors had failed to keep proper records, writing only the resolution of each point, and thus suppressing inconsistencies; they had concealed the fact that the accused were permitted to retract confessions; those retractions which had occurred were sometimes omitted from the records, in the hope they would be withdrawn. The inquisitors had also tacitly accepted violence used against the accused by local authorities. The real question, Salazar said, was whether one should believe witchcraft occurred simply because of what accused witches claim. In his view, they were not to be believed, since they alleged impossible things such as flying through the air, attendance at the witches’ gathering at the same time that they were in bed, and self-transformation into different shapes. "These claims go beyond all human reason and many even pass the limits permitted the devil", he concluded. If the devil was involved, how could he allow his machinations to be exposed so easily by children of eight years and under?
In 1614, the Supreme Council issued instructions that adopted almost all of Salazar's suggestions, and even reproduced some of his clauses word for word. This included the emphasis on establishing whether witches’ gatherings had taken place; the requirement that witches’ entire statements be recorded with all the contradictions and consideration of motives, and if the accused had been exposed to violence or coercion; insistence on proof from outside witnesses and acceptance of revocation of statements; the stipulation that no person should be sentenced solely on the basis of witches’ denunciations; and insistence that public discussion of witchcraft should be forbidden.
After Salazar executed these instructions in Logroño, he was able to report to the Supreme Council in 1617 that a state of peace now existed in Navarre; the imposition of silence on the witch question had combated the craze.
Impact of Salazar in Spain and Europe.
Salazar consistently applied the inductive method and insisted on empiricism. He advanced rational explanations for the witch panic in Navarre, including rumours of persecutions in France, preachers’ sermons, the spectacular auto de fe at Logroño, witnessed by 30,000 people, and a dream epidemic.
The Instructions of 1614 were not entirely original, since in many respects they restated guidelines formulated by inquisitors who met in Granada in 1526 in order to determine how to react to witchcraft discovered in Navarre that year. The restated guidelines included forbidding arrest or conviction of a witch solely on the basis of another witch's confession. But the 1614 Instructions also added new directions regarding the taking and recording of confessions. Thus, Salazar's contribution was not to create scepticism where there was none, since other inquisitors shared his views, but rather to restate this scepticism so cogently and with such an overwhelming body of empirical evidence that it definitively carried the day within the Inquisition. 
Salazar was able to mitigate the effects of large-scale witch persecutions elsewhere in Spain, and worked to ensure that, where possible, witch trials came under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. In 1616, secular authorities, entirely independent of the Inquisition, proceeded against witches in North Vizcaya, but thanks to the intervention of Salazar, there were no mass burnings. The accused were absolved and their trials were transferred to the Inquisition, which suspended the cases. In Catalonia, secular authorities hanged more than 300 supposed witches in 1616–19 but the persecutions were halted by the Inquisition. In 1621, when eight supposed witches were burned in the province of Burgos, Salazar compiled a report subsequently, and the jurisdiction of the Inquisition in witch cases was reaffirmed. In a hunt in the 1620s at Cangas, the Inquisition intervened and ensured that the accused escaped with light sentences.
The Instructions of 1614 expressed a scepticism not shared by all inquisitors. Until well into the seventeenth century, many inquisitors considered that witches should be put to death. Largely owing to the centralized method of government of the Inquisition and the authority of its Supreme Council, it was possible to implement a minority decision and suspend witch burning several decades before most of the rest of Europe changed policy. But the new instructions did not abolish witch trials, they only suspended killings. In fact, witch trials in Spain increased in number during the seventeenth century, even if the punishments were light compared to those administered in central and northern Europe. There were witch trials in Spanish courts long after many other European courts. As late as 1791, the Inquisition in Barcelona conducted a case against a woman who confessed to a pact with the devil.
Salazar's influence extended even beyond Spain. The Roman Inquisition also developed a strong tradition of leniency in sentencing supposed witches and insisted on adherence to strict procedural rules in the conduct of witch trials. Its own guidelines on witch trials were drafted in early the 1620s, influenced by Salazar's Instructions, and were circulated widely in manuscript until 1655 when they were published. They established strict rules for examining accused witches, called for restraint in the administration of torture and recommended care in the evaluation of witches’ confessions. Both the Spanish and Italian Inquisitions were among the earliest to reject the reality of the myth of the witches’ gathering.
Salazar's reports remind us that intelligent people of the past were able to analyze witchcraft with no less penetration than modern commentators.

Brachypterygius

Brachypterygius (meaning ″wide wing/paddle″ in Greek) is an extinct genus of platypterygiine ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur known from the Late Jurassic of England, France, European Russia and possibly Madagascar. The type species was originally described and named as "Ichthyosaurus extremus" by Boulenger in 1904. "Brachypterygius" was named by Huene in 1922 for the width and shortness of the forepaddle, and the type species is therefore "Brachypterygius extremus". The holotype of "B. extremus" was originally thought to be from the Lias Group of Bath, UK, but other specimens suggest it more likely came from the Kimmeridgian Kimmeridge Clay (Late Jurassic) of Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset, UK.
Description.
"Brachypterygius" is a medium to large ichthyosaur, with a skull length of 0.5–1.2 m. The snout is long, as is characteristic for ichthyosaurs, with larger and more robust teeth, and a relatively smaller eye than "Ophthalmosaurus". The basioccipital has a very narrow extracondylar area. The forepaddle may have five or six digits, with the maximum phalangeal count being between 8 and 16. A key feature is the three facets at the distal end of the humerus; the middle is the smallest and articulates with the intermedium, which clearly separates "Brachypterygius" from "Ophthalmosaurus", the most common Late Jurassic ichthyosaur.
Taxonomy.
The holotype of "Brachypterygius extremus" is a single right forepaddle, clearly different to other Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs (e.g. "Ophthalmosaurus"). A large skull was discovered in the Kimmeridge Clay of Stowbridge, Norfolk, UK and named as a new genus and species, "Grendelius mordax", by McGowan in 1976. More complete material from the Kimmeridge Clay of Kimmeridge Bay united these two specimens and the two genera were duly synonymised. In 2003, McGowan & Motani synonymised the two species "B. extremus" and "B. mordax" into "B. extremus", considering differences in the forepaddle to be of insufficient taxonomic value.
Efimov, 1998 named a new genus of ichthyosaur, "Otschevia pseudoscythica" on the basis of a single specimen (the holotype) from the "Pseudoscythia" Zone (late Tithonian stage of the Late Jurassic) of Ulyanovsk, Volga region, Russia. Later, Arkangelsky, 1998 described "Brachypterygius zhuravlevi" from a Tithonian-stage locality in Saratov, Russia, subsequently referring it to "Otschevia zhuravlevi". Maisch & Matzke, 2000 considered both Russian taxa to be synonyms of each other, and referred the new combination "B. pseudoscythica" to "Brachypterygius", although they misspelt this as "B. pseudoscythius". Thus, "Grendelius" and "Otschevia" are considered to be junior synonyms of "Brachypterygius". Arkhangelsky named "Otschevia alekseevi" in 2001, also from the Late Jurassic of Russia. While McGowan and Motani (2003) considered these Russian taxa to be junior synonyms of "B. extremus", Maisch (2010) retained them, and "B. mordax", as separate species. Poor preservation and description makes it difficult to be certain of their affinities.
"Brachypterygius" is closely related to "Platypterygius" and "Caypullisaurus".
Previously referred to "Brachypterygius".
Owen (1840) erected "Ichthyosaurus trigonus" based upon a single dorsal vertebra (ANSP 10124) from the Kimmeridge Clay of Westbrook, Wiltshire, UK. The holotype was long thought to be lost until it was rediscovered in 1988. Many specimens were referred to "Ichthyosaurus trigonus"; Bauer (1898) suggested that – what are now – "Ophthalmosaurus", "Brachypterygius" and "Nannopterygius" should be synonymised into "Ichthyosaurus trigonus". "I. trigonus" was included in the new genus "Macropterygius" by Huene (1922), who later (1923) made it the type species of the genus. Nowadays, "I. trigonus" (and hence "Macropterygius") is a nomen dubium because its holotype is indistinguishable from other ophthalmosaurids. (McGowan and Motani mistakenly stated that "I. trigonus" may be synonymous with "Ophthalmosaurus icenicus") 
Richard Lydekker erected the species "Ophthalmosaurus cantabridgiensis" from the Cambridge Greensand (Albian, Early Cretaceous) of Cambridge, UK, on the basis of a humerus (NHMUK 43989). McGowan and Motani (2003) considered it to be a species of "Brachypterygius", but a recent re-assessment of Cambridge Greensand ichthyosaurs found it to be a nomen dubium indeterminate beyond Ophthalmosaurinae.

Articular cartilage repair

The aim of an articular cartilage repair treatment is to restore the surface of an articular joint's hyaline cartilage. Over the last decades, surgeons and researchers have been working hard to elaborate surgical cartilage repair interventions. Though these solutions do not perfectly "restore" articular cartilage, some of the latest technologies start to bring very promising results in "repairing" cartilage from traumatic injuries or chondropathies. These treatments are especially targeted by patients who suffer from articular cartilage damage. They provide pain relief while at the same time slowing down the progression of damage or considerably delaying joint replacement (knee replacement) surgery. Most importantly, articular cartilage repair treatments help patients to return to their original lifestyle; regaining mobility, going back to work and even practicing sports again.
Different articular cartilage repair procedures.
Though the different articular cartilage procedures differ in the used technologies and surgical techniques, they all share the aim to repair articular cartilage whilst keeping options open for alternative treatments in the future. Broadly taken, there are five major types of articular cartilage repair:
Arthroscopic Lavage / Debridement.
Arthroscopic lavage is a "cleaning up" procedure of the knee joint. This short term solution is not considered an articular cartilage repair procedure but rather a "palliative treatment" to reduce pain, mechanical restriction and inflammation. Lavage focusses on removing degenerative articular cartilage flaps and fibrous tissue. The main target group are patients with very small defects of the articular cartilage.
Marrow Stimulation Techniques (Microfracture Surgery and others).
Marrow stimulating techniques attempt to solve articular cartilage damage through an arthroscopic procedure. Firstly, damaged cartilage is drilled or punched until the underlying bone is exposed. By doing this, the subchondral bone is perforated to generate a blood clot within the defect. Studies, however, have shown that marrow stimulation techniques often have insufficiently filled the chondral defect and the repair material is often fibrocartilage (which is not as good mechanically as hyaline cartilage). The blood clot takes about 8 weeks to become fibrous tissue and it takes 4 months to become fibrocartilage. This has implications for the rehabilitation.
Further on, chances are high that after only 1 or 2 years of the surgery symptoms start to return as the fibrocartilage wears away, forcing the patient to reengage in articular cartilage repair. This is not always the case and microfracture surgery is therefore considered to be an "intermediate" step.
An evolvement of the microfracture technique is the implantation of a collagen membrane onto the site of the microfracture to protect and stabilize the blood clot and to enhances the chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs. This technique is known as AMIC (Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis) and was first published in 2003.
Marrow Stimulation augmented with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells.
A 2011 study reports histologically confirmed hyaline cartilage regrowth in a 5 patient case-series, 2 with grade IV bipolar or kissing lesions in the knee. The successful protocol involves arthroscopic microdrilling/ microfracture surgery followed by postoperative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC's) and hyaluronic acid (HA). PBPC’s are a blood product containing mesenchymal stem cells and is obtained by mobilizing the stem cells into the peripheral blood. Dr. Khay Yong Saw and his team propose that the microdrilling surgery creates a blood clot scaffold on which injected PBPC’s can be recruited and enhance chondrogenesis at the site of the contained lesion. They explain that the significance of this cartilage regeneration protocol is that it is successful in patients with historically difficult-to-treat grade IV bipolar or bone-on-bone osteochondral lesions. 
Dr. Saw and his team are currently conducting a larger randomized trial and working towards beginning a multicenter study. The work of the Malaysian research team is gaining international attention.
Osteochondral Autografts and Allografts.
This technique/repair requires transplant sections of bone and cartilage. First, the damaged section of bone and cartilage is removed from the joint. Then a new healthy dowel of bone with its cartilage covering is punched out of the same joint and replanted into the hole left from removing the old damaged bone and cartilage. The healthy bone and cartilage are taken from areas of low stress in the joint so as to prevent weakening the joint. Depending on the severity and overall size of the damage multiple plugs or dowels may be required to adequately repair the joint, which becomes difficult for Osteochondral Autografts. The clinical results may deteriorate over time.
For Osteochondral Allografts the plugs are taken from deceased donors. This has the advantage that more osteochondral tissue is available and larger damages can be repaired. There are, however, ethical considerations and worries on the histocompatibility.
Cell Based Repairs.
Aiming to obtain the best possible results, scientists have striven to replace damaged articular cartilage with healthy articular cartilage. Previous repair procedures, however, always generated fibrocartilage or, at best, a combination of hyaline and fibrocartilage repair tissue. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) procedures are cell-based repairs that aim to achieve a repair consisting of healthy articular cartilage.
ACI articular cartilage repair procedures take place in three stages. First, cartilage cells are extracted arthroscopically from the patient's healthy articular cartilage that is located in a non load-bearing area of either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the femoral condyles. Then these extracted cells are transferred to an "in vitro" environment in specialised laboratories where they grow and replicate, for approximately four to six weeks, until their population has increased to a sufficient amount. Finally, the patient undergoes a second surgery where the "in vitro" chondrocytes are applied to the damaged area. In this procedure, chondrocytes are injected and applied to the damaged area in combination with either a membrane or a matrix structure. These transplanted cells thrive in their new environment, forming new articular cartilage.
Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplant.
For years, the concept of harvesting stem cells and re-implanting them into one's own body to regenerate organs and tissues has been embraced and researched in animal models. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown in animal models to regenerate cartilageRecently, there has been a published case report of decrease in knee pain in a single individual using autologous mesenchymal stem cells.[2An advantage to this approach is that a person's own stem cells are used, avoiding transmission of genetic diseases. It is also minimally invasive, minimally painful and has a very short recovery period. This alternative to the current available treatments was shown not to cause cancer in patients who were followed for 3 years after the procedure. 
See also Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplant for Cartilage Growth
The importance of rehabilitation in articular cartilage repair.
Rehabilitation following any articular cartilage repair procedure is paramount for the success of any articular cartilage resurfacing technique. The rehabilitation is often long and demanding. The main reason is that it takes a long time for the cartilage cells to adapt and mature into repair tissue. Cartilage is a slow adapting substance. Where a muscle takes approximately 35 weeks to fully adapt itself, cartilage only undergoes 75% adaptation in 2 years. If the rehabilitation period is too short, the cartilage repair might be put under too much stress, causing the repair to fail.
Concerns.
New research by Dr. Robert Litchfield, September 2008, of the University of Western Ontario concluded that routinely practised knee surgery is ineffective at reducing joint pain or improving joint function in people with osteoarthritis. The researchers did however find that arthroscopic surgery did help a minority of patients with milder symptoms, large tears or other damage to the meniscus) — cartilage pads that improve the congruence between femur and tibia bones. Similarly, a 2013 Finnish study found surgery to be ineffective for knee surgery (arthroscopic partial meniscectomy), by comparing to sham treatment.

Women's World Chess Championship 2008

The Women's World Chess Championship 2008 took place from August 28, 2008 to September 18 in Nalchik, Russia. It was won by Alexandra Kosteniuk, who beat Hou Yifan in the final by 2½ to 1½.
For the fifth time, the championship took the form of a 64-player knock-out tournament.
Participants.
Players were seeded by their Elo ratings (July 2008 list), except that defending champion Xu Yuhua was the no. 1 seed.
<ol start="33">
Absentees.
The world's no. 1 female player (and 22nd overall), Judit Polgár, has never competed for the Women's World Championship and did not play this time either. World no. 3 and ex-champion, Xie Jun, had played little chess in recent years (four rated games since 2005) and also did not appear. Other absentees from the top 20 were Kateryna Lahno (ranked 12th), ex-champion Zhu Chen (15th) and Elina Danielian (16 th).
Some players refused to go to Nalchik. In their letters to FIDE, Canadian Natalia Khoudgarian and American Irina Krush both cited the general safety in the region of North Caucasus.
More players protested after the start of the 2008 South Ossetia war. On 12 August 2008, six Georgian players published an open letter asking to move the Championship to a safer place, which was endorsed by several other players (Monika Soćko, Irina Krush, Iweta Rajlich, Ketino Kachiani-Gersinska, Tea Bosboom-Lanchava, Claudia Amura, and Marie Sebag). On 15 August, the Chess Federation of Georgia published an open letter stating that the Georgian players will not participate in the Championship unless it is moved to another country. Argentinian Claudia Amura, whose opponent in the first round is Georgian Lela Javakhishvili, also published a letter to FIDE asking for the Championship to be moved.
The FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov published two letters in reply, on 13 August and 19 August. In his letters, he confirmed that the Championship would be held in Nalchik, appealed to everyone not to mix politics and sport, and stated that the organizers provided all the necessary security. This was seconded by Boris Kutin, president of the European Chess Union, and Arsen Kanokov, president of Kabardino-Balkaria and the chairman of the organizing committee. On 21 August, Ilyumzhinov published a letter to Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili asking him to let Georgian players participate.
A total of 11 players did not arrive at the Championship. Besides the six Georgian players (Maia Chiburdanidze, Lela Javakhishvili, Maia Lomineishvili, Nino Khurtsidze, Sopiko Khukhashvili, and Sopio Gvetadze), these were Marie Sebag (France), Irina Krush (United States), Ekaterina Korbut (Russia), Tea Bosboom-Lanchava (Netherlands), and Karen Zapata (Peru).
Tournament Format.
The Championship was conducted as a single-elimination tournament with 64 players and six rounds. In each encounter, players played two games at normal time controls (90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30 seconds per move from move one). If the score after two games was level, the tie-break was played. In the tie-break, two rapid games were played (25 minutes for the game, with addition of 10 seconds after each move). If the score was level after the rapid games, two blitz games were played (5 minutes for the game, with addition of 10 seconds after each move). If the score was level after the blitz, the decisive armageddon game was played. The time control was 6 minutes for White and 5 minutes for Black, with no addition. If the game was drawn, Black is declared the winner. The colours in the armageddon games were chosen by the player who won the drawing of lots.
In the final, four regular games were played instead of two, and the first (rapid) phase of tie-break would also have consisted of four games.
Ruling appeal.
The final tiebreak game in the first round match between Monika Soćko and Sabina-Francesca Foisor ended in controversy. It was an armageddon blitz game in which Socko (as White) had 6 minutes compared to 5 minutes Foisor (as Black), but White must win the game to advance to the next round whereas Black only needed to draw (or win). With time running out, a position was reached in which each player had only a king and a knight, a material combination which is a draw under normal circumstances. Just after this, Foisor's time ran out and the arbiter Zsuzsanna Veroci ruled it a draw, meaning that Foisor would advance. Socko immediately protested, showing a position where checkmate is possible (but cannot be forced) and reminding the arbiters of the FIDE rules of chess which state that if one player runs out of time and the opponent has the "possibility" of checkmate, that player loses. Socko filed an appeal, and the Appeals Committee agreed that she was correct on the rules. The game was ruled a win for Socko and she advanced to the next round.

International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia

Abkhazia and South Ossetia are two partially recognised breakaway republics in the Caucasus, claiming independence from Georgia. 
Following the 2008 South Ossetia War between Russia and Georgia they were recognised by and UN member states respectively, though Vanuatu subsequently withdrew its recognition of Abkhazia. The two regions recognise each other, and also have some recognition from other non-UN member states.
Georgia and the vast majority of countries of the world do not recognise their independence and officially consider them as sovereign territory of the Georgian state.
History.
South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia during the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War on 29 May 1992, with its Constitution referring to the "Republic of South Ossetia". Abkhazia declared its independence after its war with Georgia in 1992–1993. Its Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1994.
Developments in 2008.
Kosovo's declaration of independence on 17 February 2008 and its divided international acceptance prompted speculation that there could be implications for the frozen South Caucasus situation.
In April 2008, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed "Resolution 1808" that reaffirmed "the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders and supports all efforts by the United Nations and the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General, which are guided by their determination to promote a settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict only by peaceful means and within the framework of the Security Council resolutions."
The 2008 South Ossetia war was fought in August 2008 between Georgia on one side and South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Russia on the other, resulting in a South Ossetian, Abkhaz and Russian victory and the expulsion of the Georgian military from both territories. On 21 August 2008, rallies were held in Tskhinvali and Sukhumi at which the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, respectively, appealed to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Federal Assembly for official recognition of their independence as sovereign states. South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity flew to Moscow on 23 August 2008 to address the Federation Council of Russia, and in his appeal stated "what the Georgian leadership has done in South Ossetia can only be described as a Caucasian Stalingrad." On 25 August 2008, President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh also made a presentation to the Federation Council. In his address to the Council, Bagapsh stated "I can say for certain that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will never be part of Georgia."
Russia's recognition.
After hearing the aforementioned appeals from both the Abkhazian and South Ossetian leadership, on 25 August 2008, the Federation Council and State Duma passed motions calling upon President Dmitry Medvedev to recognise the independence of both states and establish diplomatic relations.
On 26 August 2008, President Medvedev signed decrees recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as sovereign states (see images, right), and made the following statement:
President Medvedev stated that "Western countries rushed to recognise Kosovo's illegal declaration of independence from Serbia. We argued consistently that it would be impossible, after that, to tell the Abkhazians and Ossetians (and dozens of other groups around the world) that what was good for the Kosovo Albanians was not good for them. In international relations, you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others."
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin noted previous Georgian aggression against Ossetia, and said "those who insist that those territories must continue to belong to Georgia are Stalinists — they stick to Yosif Visarionovich Stalin's decision", referring to the fact that it was Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, who gave the territory to the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, the predecessor of the modern day Georgian republic.
The Russian representative to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin stated that Russia's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is "irreversible" but called upon "NATO countries to withdraw and review their decision concerning Kosovo's independence" and subsequently "act on the premise that this is the new political reality." He warned, moreover, that any NATO attack on Russia-supported regions would "mean a declaration of war on Russia."
In the UN Security Council, the United States was heavily critical of Russian support of the secessionist governments, accusing the government of violating Georgia's territorial integrity. In response, Vitaly Churkin, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN, attacked the U.S. claim to moral high ground by recalling its invasion of Iraq in 2003. Others accused the United States of hypocrisy, citing its support of the violation of Serbian territorial integrity when it recognised the independence of Kosovo in 2008.
The Russian government also welcomed Nicaragua's recognition of the two states, and called on other countries to "recognise reality" and follow Nicaragua's example. President Daniel Ortega announced that his government "recognises the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and fully supports the Russian government's position." Medvedev also signed into law federal bills ratifying friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance pacts between his government and those of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The laws stipulated the obligations of each state to provide assistance to each other if either of them comes under attack, joint protection of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's borders, as well as cooperation on a wide range of economic, social, and humanitarian issues. The states would also jointly counter organised crime, international terrorism, and drug trafficking as documents was signed for 10 years with an option to extend the deal automatically.
Georgia's response.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili considered Russia's move as an attempt to alter the borders of Europe by force. Below are some excerpts from his statement:
This is the first attempt on European territory ... since Hitler's regime and Stalin's Soviet Union where a large state is trying unilaterally, with the use of force, to completely crush a neighbouring country and openly annex its territory.
This is inconceivable lawlessness and insolence ... Russia has done unthinkable damage to its place in the international community.
The question of the re-establishment of the territorial integrity of Georgia and the protection of its freedom — this is not an internal Georgian problem, or a question of Georgia and Russia. This is now a question of Russia and the rest of the civilised world. Georgia's future, is not only the future of Georgia, this is the future of the whole civilised world...
Deputy Foreign Minister Giga Bokeria said, "This is an unconcealed annexation of these territories, which are a part of Georgia."
On 28 August, the Georgian Parliament passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia "Russian-occupied territories" and instructed the government to annul all previous treaties on Russian peacekeeping. The following day the government announced that it was severing diplomatic ties with Russia, with the Georgian Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Tbilisi to close as a result. Georgia recalled its ambassador from Russia and ordered all Russian diplomats to leave Georgia, saying that only consular relations would be maintained. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on this decision, saying that some 600,000 to 1 million Georgians in Russia would be left to the "mercy of fate".
Later, Georgia also severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua. Georgia moved to economically isolate the regions. A ban on economic activity in the regions without Georgian permission was issued, and anyone caught violating this ban by the Georgian authorities faced prosecution. The Georgian Navy blockaded the coast of Abkhazia, and has seized 23 cargo ships trying to bring supplies to Abkhazia, most notably fuel supplies. Abkhazia is dependant on fuel imports, and faced a serious shortage as a result. Russia began deploying boats from its own Black Sea Fleet on 21 September 2009, in response. In August 2009, Russia and South Ossetia accused Georgia of shelling Ossetian villages and kidnapping four South Ossetian citizens. Russia threatened to use force unless the shelling stopped, and put its troops stationed in South Ossetia on high alert.
Georgia criticised Nauru following the small island state's recognition of Abkhazia. Minister of Reintegration Temur Yakobashvili stated "The recognition of Abkhazia's independence by Nauru is more like a comedy ... it changes nothing on the international arena".
In January 2010, Georgia adopted a strategy regarding the reintegration of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The strategy is called "Involvement through Cooperation" and it was presented to the international organisations as well as to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The document says Georgia views peaceful methods as the only way for conflict solution and that there won’t be a war with these regions. It envisions engagement of people of these two regions through education as well as social, economic and business projects, instead of isolation.
Western response.
The European Union, NATO, the OSCE, and the United States immediately voiced displeasure with Russia's decision.
Controversy.
Comparisons with Kosovo.
The Assembly of Kosovo, under temporary administration of the United Nations (UNMIK) since 1999, unilaterally declared independence as the "Republic of Kosovo" on 17 February 2008. The Republic of Kosovo was instantly recognised by the United States and the EU-3 and now has been recognised by United Nations member states.
In an emergency session of the UN Security Council, Serbian President Boris Tadić asked the Council, "Are we all aware of the precedent that is being set and are we aware of the catastrophic consequences that it may lead to?" The permanent representatives of the United States, United Kingdom and France presented their opinion that the Kosovo case is "sui generis" in nature and could not be perceived as a precedent.
The setting of a precedent was mentioned by many countries, including Argentina, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, Greece and Spain. India stated that Kosovo "can set a very dangerous precedent for similar cases around the world." The then Russian President Vladimir Putin described the recognition by Western powers of Kosovan independence as a "terrible precedent, which will "de facto" blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries." He then went on to say, "they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face."
In the United States, in hearings before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher said:
"Now we can talk until we're blue in the face trying to say there is no analogy here, but it doesn't cover up the obvious analogy between Kosovo and what's going on in Georgia where you have breakaway republics similar to what the Serbs face. Now the only difference is of course, we're Americans and they're Russians. And the people trying to break away there were pro-Russian.
And either we're for democracy — either we're for those people in Kosovo and in Ossetia and elsewhere — and in, I might say, in Georgia and their right to be separate from Russia in the beginning — to begin with — if we lose that, we've lost the high ground. We're already losing our credibility right now, let's not lose the high ground."
Some analysts at the time called ignoring Russian objections and the move by the United States and the EU-3 a mistake, with Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute stating that their view of Kosovo being "sui generis" and setting no precedent as "extraordinarily naïve". It was also suggested at the time that Russia could use the case of Kosovo as pretext for recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the future. Other analysts, including the Heritage Foundation, offer that Kosovo is no precedent due to its administration by the United Nations as a protectorate for seven years and was blocked from being recognised by the United Nations due to Russia and China being able to use their veto in the Security Council.
In September 2009, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, when asked by journalists why Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be internationally recognised and Kosovo not, said that "the strongest argument is the fact that at the time when Kosovo’s authorities made the UDI, nobody was threatening them or putting them in a position where they had to secede. On the contrary, Belgrade even went so far as to refrain from exerting any military or economic pressure on Pristina."
Other events.
Abkhazia said it would not take part in the "Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucacus" in June 2010 because of concerns over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE. A spokesman said "Our proposals are being ignored, discussions on the non-renewal of war are being procrastinated, instead secondary questions are being discussed. Thereupon we feel the co-chairmen have no real proposals, and we want to give them time till September to prepare a document, concerning security, and acceptable for all sides. The Geneva discussions are necessary, and it is normal that each party voices its position, but the mediators must be neutral and non-biased. But the mediators fail to conduct discussions in a constructive impartial manner."
Positions taken by states.

The following lists all the states that have ever recognised Abkhazia or South Ossetia.
Positions taken by intergovernmental organisations.
Under international law, intergovernmental organisations do not themselves possess the legal capacity to recognise any state diplomatically; their member states do so individually. However, depending on the intergovernmental organisation's rules of internal governance and the positions of their member states, they may express positive or negative opinions as to declarations of independence, or choose to offer or withhold membership to a newly declared state.

Yisrael Barzilai

Yisrael Barzilai (, born Yisrael Izenberg on 1 October 1913, died 12 June 1970) was an Israeli politician who served as a government minister during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.
Life and career.
Born in an area that was later to become part of Poland, Barzilai joined Hashomer Hatzair at the age of 11. In 1932 he moved to Paris to study, before making aliyah to Mandate Palestine in 1934. In Palestine he joined the HeHalutz movement, and in 1938 was elected head of the independent settlements department of Kibbutz Artzi. In 1939 he was one of the founders of kibbutz Negba.
In 1947 he became secretary of the World Union of Mapam. Between 1948 and 1951 he worked as the Israeli consul in Poland. After returning to Israel, he served as political secretary of Mapam between 1953 and 1955.
He was first elected to the Knesset on Mapam's list in 1955, and was appointed Minister of Health in David Ben-Gurion's government. In November 1958 he also became Minister of Postal Services after the National Religious Party withdrew from the government. After the 1959 elections he continued as Minister of Health.
Although he was re-elected in 1961, Mapam were excluded from the government and Barzilai lost his cabinet position. However, he did serve as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset. In the 1965 elections he lost his seat, but was re-appointed Minister of Health by Levi Eshkol. Following the 1969 elections (in which he also failed to win a seat) he was appointed Minister without Portfolio, serving until his death in June 1970. Following his death, the hospital in Ashkelon (whose cornerstone he had laid in 1961) was renamed Barzilai Medical Center in his honour.

Silhillians Rugby Union Football Club

Silhillians Rugby Union Football Club is a rugby club based at Copt Heath near Solihull in the English West Midlands. They compete in Midlands 1 (West). The club regularly fields a 1st and 2nd XVs and in the 'Mini and Junior' section teams range from Under 6s to Under 17s and Colts
History.
Origins and Early Days.
The club was originally founded in 1932 as Solihull Old Boys and was exclusively for former pupils of Solihull School, an historic Independent School. The school's headmaster at the time, Mr A R Thompson, was the Club's first President and attended every meeting and fixture until his retirement in 1947. Upon the outbreak of World War II 13 members of the 1st XV were called up meaning that the Club was temporarily defunct but was reformed by Alan Bradbury, Mel Cooper and Claude 'CT' Coton in 1947 as the "Old Silhillians" (the name given to Old Boys of Solihull School. Coton was selected, at the age of 18, for the Committee immediately after leaving School. 'CTC' went on to captain the 1st XV, served as President twice and was a Committee member for more than 50 years.
In 1953 the Club moved to Dingle Lane in Solihull and the first game on the site was a notable occasion. WC Ramsey, who was the President Elect of the Rugby Football Union 1954-55, sent a WC Ramsey XV to play against the 'Solihull Old Boys' and over 3,000 spectators were in attendance.
In 1959 the inaugural "Birmingham and Warwickshire Old Boys Rugby Sevens" tournament was held for former pupils of notable schools from the region. Amongst others, Rugby School, King Edward VI Aston, Solihull School, King Edward's School, Birmingham, Bablake School and Warwick School sent former pupils to compete.
In 1967 the Old Silhillians moved to their current home at Copt Heath, about 1 mile from the Solihull School campus. This season was a hugely successful one in the Club's history. They won the "Birmingham and Warwickshire Old Boys' Rugby Sevens", beating Old Saltleians 13-5 in the final. Captained by Martin Green, they also won 8-3 against the Cambridge University 1st XV. They remained one of the best Old Boys' sides in the Midlands for many years.
One of the most significant points in the history of the club was the decision to go 'open' in 1982, i.e. they accepted members and players who had not attended Solihull School. Thus, they dropped the 'Old' from the name and became Silhillians RUFC.
Recent years.
"The Sils" were promoted to Warwickshire Division One of the 'Courage League' in 1991 under the captaincy of Alan Elliot.
More recently 'The Sils' have enjoyed further promotions; in 1994/96 captained by Nick Savage, 1998/99 when captained by Andrew Durrant, in 2000/01 under the captaincy of Andrew Clutterbuck and in 20012/13 captained by Peter Nicholls.
Undoubtedly the club's greatest achievement to date was their appearance in the 1999 Tetley's Bitter Vase Final at Twickenham. They lost to Billericay Rugby Football Club 19-3 but Silhillians look back fondly on that season and the experience of playing at 'Rugby HQ'.
The 2007/08 season saw the Silhillians RUFC celebrate their 75th Anniversary.
Present day.
Silhillians RUFC are located at the Memorial Ground in Copt Heath near Solihull. Although the site is skirted to the south and east by rural land it is only 150 yards from the M42 motorway and the easy access has made Silhillians a popular fixture for touring teams or as a pre-season friendly. The rugby club share the Memorial Clubhouse with the Old Silhillians Association (OSA), the old boys' club of Solihull School. The building houses a gymnasium, squash courts, changing facilities, a rifle range, a function room, a members' bar and administration offices for the rugby club and OSA.
The club is governed by The Committee, which is a functional body who are of importance to the club. Its members are stalwarts of the club as well as several current players and is accessible to all members of the club. Within the club it is considered an honour to serve or have served on The Committee.
The youth system at the club is thriving with 11 'mini and junior' teams regularly turning out on Sundays. The high standard of education in the local area, both state and private, means that many students carry on to university and thus Silhillians 1st XV is deprived of many young player during term time.
Although the club is now open to those who are not former pupils of Solihull School the link between the school and rugby club is still strong and many Old Silhillians represent Silhillians RUFC.
Club Traditions.
Easter Tour
In May 1953 Old Silhillians Rugby Club (as then named) travelled to the Southend Rugby Festival. It has since been an annual tradition that all members of the senior squads are invited to tour with the club. Recent tours have been slightly more far-afield than Southend and have been to France, Galway, Krakow and Prague.
Annual Dinner
The Annual Dinner is a black tie event held at the Memorial Clubhouse and it is traditional that selected members of The Committee and the 1st XV captain make speeches and that awards are presented. The "Most Improved Player Award", "The Peter Styles Trophy" and various top try-scorer awards are traditionally given out.
Members' Clock
Those who are later than the predetermined meeting time for a fixture, according to the clock in the Members' Lounge, are fined at the discretion of the senior players.
Captaincy
Captains of the Club will stand down at the end of their second season in the role.
Sils Saxons
The Silhillians 2nd/Development XV is known as the Sils Saxons, in the same way that the England Development XV are known as The Saxons.
The Wedgebury Cup
The Wedgebury Cup is annually contested between Silhillians RUFC and local rivals Solihull RFC. The match takes place on Boxing Day and is a popular day amongst spectators, Club officials and players alike.

Milan Kojić

Milan Kojić (Serbian Cyrillic: Милан Којић) (born July 10, 1976 in Hamilton, Ontario) is a retired Canadian soccer player.
Early life.
He was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He is of Serbian descent.
Career.
In 1999, Kojić signed for the Toronto Lynx. There he established his reputation as one of the best defenders in the United Soccer Leagues, starting 26 out of 28 games in his first season (where he was mostly used as the point man for set plays) scoring two goals, both off free kick headers. He had a standout year in 2000, leading the Lynx to one of the lowest goals-against average totals in the league. The highlight of his season was a dramatic goal against the Richmond Kickers in the A-League quarterfinals, which clinched the playoff series for the Lynx. In 2001, he signed for division rivals Montreal Impact. With the Impact he scored a single goal in twenty games, and he helped the Impact come within one win of clinching the final playoff berth. 
He re-joined Toronto in 2002 where his solid defensive play was one of the bright spots that season. His two goals and four assists in 2002 was the highest single year point total for a Lynx defender. He nearly helped the Lynx make the playoffs but a tie in the final game of the season against the Atlanta Silverbacks made the Charlotte Eagles take the final playoff spot. 
Just after signing a new contract with the Lynx for 2003, Milan was transferred to FK Haugesund of the Norwegian First Division. As a starter for Haugesund, he became one of their leading players, helping turn around a team that finished 9th in 2002 to one that is challenging for a promotion spot in the Tippeligaen. In 2005, he helped FKH win back a promotion to the Adeccoligaen. On August 31, 2006 he was released from his contract. Kojić signed for Canadian Soccer League side Serbian White Eagles FC in 2007 but retired midway through the season.
International.
Kojić has also represented Canada at the Under-17 and Under-20 level, making his debut in 1993 against Nigeria.

Bothrops brazili

Bothrops brazili is a venomous pitviper species endemic to South America. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Etymology.
The specific name, "brazili", is in honor of Dr. Vital Brazil, a Brazilian physician and founder of the Instituto Butantan in São Paulo.
Description.
Stoutly built and terrestrial, adults are usually 70-90 cm (28-35 inches) in total length, but may exceed 140 cm (55 in). The largest specimen on record is 149.3 cm (58¾ in). The available evidence would indicate that, among adult specimens, females are much larger than males.
The scalation includes 23-29 (usually 25-27) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 151-180 ventral scales in males and 159-202 (usually less than 190) in females, and 44-68/42-56 usually paired subcaudal scales in males/females. On the head there are 3-10 (usually 5-8) intersupraocular scales, 7-9 (usually 8) supralabial scales, the second of which is fused with the prelacunal, and 10-12 sublabial scales.
The color pattern consists of a pinkish tan to pinkish or reddish gray ground color overlaid with a series of 9-19 dark ash gray dorsolateral blotches. These may alternate or oppose across the midline of the back, sometimes looking like triangular C's or merging to form bands. The tail is the same color as the body, but may be mostly black. The belly is usually yellow or pinkish cream with mottling that is slightly darker in color. The top of the head is also the same color as the body, but usually lighter. The rostral scale and lower edges of the supralabials are paler still, while a poorly defined postocular stripe may be present, running from the eye to the angle of the mouth, pale brown in color and bordered below by a dark brown line.
Geographic range.
Found in the equatorial forests of southern Colombia, eastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southern and eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, and northern Bolivia. The type locality given is "Tomé Assú, Acará Mirim River, State of Pará, Brazil".
Venom.
This is an uncommon species and bites from it have not yet been recorded. However, it is greatly feared by the indigenous people of southeastern Colombia.
Taxonomy.
As variations in scalation and color pattern are apparent in different populations of this species, new taxa will likely be defined as a result of further research.

Barzilai Medical Center (, "Merkaz Refu'i Barzilai") is a 490-bed hospital in Ashkelon in southern Israel. The Hospital serves a population of 500,000, including a large number of Ethiopian and Russian immigrants. It has 100,000 admissions annually.
History.
The hospital opened in July 1961, and was initially named Ashkelon Hospital. Construction was financed by the Ministry of Health with the assistance of the South-African Zionist Federation, the Ashkelon municipality and Mifal HaPayis. The building was designed by the architect David Anatol Brutzkus, covering an area of 8000 sq. m. In 1971, it was renamed for Minister of Health Yisrael Barzilai, who laid the cornerstone of the building in the early 1960s. 
Situated six miles from Gaza, it has been the target of numerous Qassam and Grad rocket attacks, sometimes as many as 140 over one weekend. The hospital plays a vital role in treating wounded soldiers and terror victims. 
Emergency room controversy.
Plans to build a new rocket and missile-proof emergency room for the hospital have been hampered by Haredi protests sparked by the discovery of human remains in an ancient burial ground unearthed during construction activities.

Crime in the United Arab Emirates

The crime rate in the United Arab Emirates is relatively low compared to more highly industrialized nations. Incidents of petty crime like pickpocketing are low. The United States Department of State states: "Crime generally is not a problem for travelers in the UAE. However, the U.S. Embassy advises U.S. citizens to take normal precautions against theft, such as not leaving a wallet, purse, or credit card unattended. Although vehicle break-ins in the UAE are rare, U.S. citizens are encouraged to ensure that unattended vehicles are locked and that valuables are not left out in plain sight".
Terrorism.
The threat of a terrorist attack is a matter of concern. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Government of Australia advised travelers "to exercise a high degree of caution in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) because of the high threat of terrorist attack". The DFAT claimed they received reports of a terrorist plan to attack Western interests in the nation.
Cybercrime.
Incidents of cybercrime are increasing. In 2002, there was a 300% rise in computer hacking within six months. According to experts, the United Arab Emirates is among the top ten countries which are most vulnerable to attack by hackers. White-collar crime includes embezzlement of funds, fraud and bribery.
Drugs.
The UAE is a drug transshipment country for traffickers due to its proximity to Southwest Asian drug producing nations. Drug trafficking is a major form of crime in the UAE, and the nation has a zero tolerance policy towards illegal drug use. Possession of the smallest amount of illegal drugs is punishable by a minimum of four years' imprisonment.
Money laundering.
The UAE is vulnerable to money laundering due to its position as a major commercial driver in the region. The UAE leadership has taken several measures for combating organized crime. A law was enacted in January 2002 for the purpose of curbing money laundering. However, despite government efforts to combat money laundering, regulation of banking is still developing.
Murder.
According to the Interpol data, the murder rate in the UAE increased from 0.78 to 2.99 per 100,000 population between 1998 and 1999.
Human trafficking.
Human trafficking is a problem which involves trafficking of young boys and women. Young boys are trafficked into the country for the purpose of being used as camel jockeys. There were many camel jockeys working in the UAE under inhumane conditions but these have now been replaced by robot jockeys. Most camel jockeys were found in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The country is in the process of eradicating this issue completely.
In 2009, there were 43 cases of human trafficking in the UAE, up from 20 cases in 2008.
Prostitution.
Women are trafficked into the country for sexual exploitation. Women from Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Morocco, India, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, the Philippines, Iraq and Iran are reportedly trafficked to the UAE. Porous borders and proximity to war-affected countries like Iraq increase the problem of human trafficking.

Photofermentation

Photofermentation is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen manifested by a diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria by a series of biochemical reactions involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Photofermentation differs from dark fermentation because it only proceeds in the presence of light.
For example photo-fermentation with "Rhodobacter sphaeroides" SH2C (or many other purple non-sulfur bacteria) can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen and other products.

D.S. (song)

"D.S." is an album track by Michael Jackson from his 1995 double disc record "". It is track six on the second disc, one of the three songs from that disc whose lyrics are printed in the album booklet, and is four minutes and forty-nine seconds in length. The song is often cited as a derogatory reference to Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon, whose name is similar to the subject of the song, Dom Sheldon. When Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, the investigation was controlled by Sneddon, who also ordered that Jackson be strip searched. The criminal investigation was subsequently closed due to lack of evidence and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jackson was angered by the allegations, his perception of being mistreated by the police and media, and the negative effect on his health.
Shortly afterwards, he began work on "HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I". The track "D.S." is written, composed and produced by Jackson and includes a guitar solo by Slash. It is a rock song that conveys themes such as bitterness, mistrust and corruption within law enforcement. There was no major critical analysis of the song from mainstream reviews when "HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I" was issued, but the song's connection to Tom Sneddon was widely reported in the media. Jackson was subsequently involved in projects that made coded references to Sneddon and the 1993 investigation.
Background.
"", its album tracks such as "D.S." and corresponding music videos are heavily influenced by the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against Jackson, the reaction to the allegations and the effect they had on the singer. The album acts as Jackson's response to the media and the public. In 1993, Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse. Jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at Neverland Ranch; the strip search was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the district attorney of Santa Barbara County, California. Sneddon was in charge of the investigation as a whole. The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson's genitals, also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singer's body, but eventually the description was proved wrong. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room, took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twenty-five minutes; he was never physically touched. 
The media coverage of the allegations was criticized for using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, for accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, for accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money, for deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst, for a lack of objectivity and for using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt. At the time, Jackson said of the media reaction, "I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions".
The entertainer began taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds in weight and had stopped eating. Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic, and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level". While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.
Jackson was not charged with a crime and the police closed their criminal investigation citing lack of evidence. With his health improving, Jackson then began work on a new album called "HIStory", and commenced recording in 1994. The song "D.S." included in the album contains lyrics about a cold man called Dom S. Sheldon, which, when sung, sounds similar to Thomas Sneddon. Some media sources, and Sneddon himself, believe the song is directed at him.
Themes and genre.
"D.S." has very similar themes to the rest of "HIStory", creating an atmosphere of paranoia. The album's content focuses on the hardships and public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the new jack swing/funk rock efforts "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", along with the R&B ballad "You Are Not Alone", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs much of his anger at the media. In the introspective ballad "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments over his "fall from grace". "D.S." contains an excerpt from the Yes hit single "Owner of a Lonely Heart" composed by Trevor Rabin, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire and Trevor Horn. The lyrics describe the subject of the song as a man who wants him "dead or alive" and "really tried to take me down/By surprise". The track ends with the sound of a gunshot.
The song has a distinct rock feel to it, with a guitar solo performed by Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, who had previously worked with Jackson on his "Dangerous" album. Jackson screams the name "Slash!" immediately before Slash's part in the song. Jackson has previously made a number of successful rock songs, including; "Beat It", "Dirty Diana", "Give In to Me" and "Scream". In his "HIStory" album review, "Entertainment Weekly"'s Jackson Browne musically defines "D.S." as a hard rock song.
Critical reaction.
Although the album "HIStory" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and had additional related Grammy nominations, hardly any mainstream music reviewers provided a critical analysis of "D.S." in their reviews of the album. Analysis of the song usually only covered the connection to Tom Sneddon and the song's genre. However, Fred Shuster of the "Daily News of Los Angeles" described "D.S." as a "superb of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer's busiest dance floors".
Many news organizations reviewed the piece in connection to Sneddon. Fox News Channel and CNN expressed the opinion that the "cold man" of this song's lyrics is Sneddon, as when sung, "Dom S. Sheldon" sounds very close to "Thomas Sneddon". The BBC suggested that the lyric's reference to a "B.S.T.A." sounds similar to "S.B.D.A.", meaning "Santa Barbara District Attorney". "The Guardian" and "The New York Times" expressed the view that Jackson suggests "Sheldon" has links to the CIA and the Ku Klux Klan and he just "wants your vote". Sneddon's own work website indicates that he believes he is the subject of the song, stating, "He's the only DA in the nation to have an angry song written about him by pop megastar Michael Jackson". Of the song, he said, "I have not—shall we say—done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot".
Other works and aftermath.
Although there was no music video made for "D.S.", the song's subject was referenced in the short film "Ghosts". Released in 1997 and premiering at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, it was written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston. The story was based loosely on the events and isolation Jackson felt after he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993. In the plot, the Maestro (played by Jackson) is nearly chased out of his town by the mayor (who deliberately looks very similar to Sneddon) and the residents because they believe him to be a "freak". It features many special effects and dance moves to original music, composed and choreographed by Jackson. The film includes several songs and music videos from the albums "HIStory" and "". The video for "Ghosts" is over thirty-eight minutes long and holds the "Guinness World Record" as the world's longest music video.
The child sexual abuse allegations of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later. Sneddon was the lead investigator again, as well as the trial prosecutor. The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts. The two investigations being controlled by Sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a "vendetta" against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying, "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music". He then preceded to call Jackson "Wacko Jacko" and shouting "we got him, we finally got him" to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence. "D.S." was sung outside the courtroom by a group of Jackson's fans every day the trial took place.

George Franklin Tucker (born December 15, 1947 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican physicist and former Olympic luger.
He represented Puerto Rico in the luge event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, and was the only Puerto Rican representative at the Games. He was also the country's flagbearer. Tucker was, at the time, a doctoral student at Wesleyan University in the United States. He was later described by "Sports Illustrated" as "overweight but quick-witted" and as "the press's favorite loser". He finished last in his event, and reportedly "got a lot more press in the States than Paul Hildgartner, the Italian who won the gold medal". He described himself as "the luger who dripped blood", and "Time" reported that he "shed alarming amounts of skin bouncing off the wall".
Tucker represented Puerto Rico again at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, but was, this time, one of nine Puerto Rican competitors. Tucker competed in the luge with team mate Raul Muniz.
According to Puerto Rican bobsled coach Rich Kolko, Tucker in 1984 "set the standard for Caribbean nations competing" in Winter sports - such as the Jamaican bobsled team.

King of Pop (album)

King of Pop is a compilation album by American recording artist Michael Jackson released in commemoration of Michael Jackson's 50th birthday. The album differs significantly in each country it was released because fan voting was employed to determine the songs for each country's version. The album's title comes from the title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years earlier. The album's launch was made public on June 20, 2008 with the official announcement of the Australian version. The first release came with the German edition (which is identical to the Swiss edition) on August 22, 2008.
Fans in countries where Sony BMG operates national offices were given the opportunity to vote for songs from a list of Jackson's back catalogue to be included in their country's version of the album. Aside from the tracks selected by fans, a megamix of five songs from the "Thriller" album by Jason Nevins was also included in the pool. The album has been released in a total of 26 countries. Each pool list and release date differed slightly by country. "Billie Jean" is the only song to appear on all versions of the album. There has been no announcement of a release in North America.
Background.
Prior to the release of "King of Pop", Jackson issued the double-disc album "Thriller 25", a 25th anniversary edition of "Thriller". It was a commercial success, having done particularly well as a re-issue, peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe. It reached number two in the US, number three in the UK and top 10 on over 30 national charts. In the US, "Thriller 25" was just 14,000 copies short of reaching the peak position, selling 166,000 copies. It was ineligible for the "Billboard" 200 chart as a re-release, but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart, where it stayed for 10 non-consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996.
A few months afterward, Sony announced the release of regional editions of the "King of Pop" compilation, in celebration of Jackson's 50th birthday. The album's title is a reference to the same title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years ago when actress and friend Elizabeth Taylor presented Jackson with an "Artist of the Decade" award at the 1989 Soul Train Awards, proclaiming him "the true king of pop, rock and soul". MTV, VH1, FOX, and Jackson's record label began marketing Jackson as the "King of Pop" to coincide with the release of "Dangerous" and the music video for "Black or White", the album's first single.
Versions.
Argentina.
On November 11, the Argentinian version of the compilation was released.

Blundell entered politics in 1913, when he was elected to Lancashire County Council, he became a county alderman in 1931, finally retiring from the council in 1935.
In 1922 was chosen by Conservatives to contest the parliamentary constituency of Ormskirk. The seat, held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, had been unexpectedly lost to James Bell of the Labour Party in 1918. Blundell was able to reagin the seat for the party, and held it when further elections were called in 1923 and 1924. He lost the seat at the 1929 general election to Labour's S T Rosbotham, also a major landowner and farmer in the constituency.
After parliament.
Blundell was recognised as an authority on agriculture, and was appointed to a number of state bodies dealing with the matter. He was appointed to the Imperial Economic Committee in 1926, to the Milk Reorganisation Commission in 1932, and to the Eggs and Poultry Reorganisation Commission in 1933. He wrote two books on agriculture: "The Agricultural Problem" (1928) and "A New Policy for Agriculture" (1931). In 1935 he presented Sniggery Woods to the town of Crosby to mark the silver jubilee of George V. In 1936 it was announced that a charter of incorporation had been granted to constitute Crosby as a municipal borough in the following year, and Blundell was chosen to be the town's first mayor.
Papal honours.
Blundell was an active Catholic, and was regarded as one of the church's most influential laymen in the country. He served as chairman of the Catholic Education Council of England and Wales from 1927 until his death. He was appointed a Papal Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape to three popes: Pius X, Benedict XV and Pius XI.
Death.
Blundell died suddenly from heart failure in a hotel in Kensington, London in October 1936, aged 56. He was buried in the graveyard of St Mary's Catholic Church, Little Crosby.

Discipline (Janet Jackson album)

Discipline is the tenth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released by Island Records on February 26, 2008. It is her only album released on Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records was fulfilled with the release of "20 Y.O.". Jackson worked with producers such as Darkchild, Ne-Yo, Shea Taylor, Stargate, Johntá Austin, Jermaine Dupri, Tricky Stewart, and The-Dream on the album. Jackson's long-time producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, did not contribute to the project. The album was executive produced by Island Urban president Dupri and Jackson.
The album experimented with the electropop, house, and dance-pop genres before the style became popular in the mainstream the following years after its release, and also contained R&B and hip-hop orientated tracks.
Four singles were released from the album; the first, "Feedback", was released as a digital download in December 2007. The song reached number nineteen on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, becoming Jackson's best-charting single since 2001's "Someone to Call My Lover". The album's later singles did not share the success of "Feedback". The deluxe version of "Discipline" contained a DVD documenting the production and promotion of the album and music videos.
The album received generally positive reviews, with critics arguing that it was an improvement on Jackson's two previous albums. Despite positive reviews it became one of her least successful albums. It debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200, becoming her sixth to top the chart and it was her first album to reach number one in the United States after 2001's "All for You". However, sales of the album quickly fell, and by June the album's promotion had officially ended. Jackson started her Rock Witchu Tour—with the support of Live Nation—in early September to positive reviews but by the end of that month Jackson parted company with her record label.
Conception.
In July 2007, it was announced that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records was fulfilled with the release of her album "20 Y.O." Jackson's tenth studio album, "Discipline", which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, "I wanted to name the album "Discipline" because it has a lot of different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this for as long as I have ... And to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus."
Jackson worked with producers such as Rodney Jerkins (who produced the lead single "Feedback" alongside D'Mile), Jermaine Dupri, Ne-Yo, Shea Taylor, Stargate, Johntá Austin, Tricky Stewart, and The-Dream. Jackson's long-time producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, did not contribute to the project. The album was executive produced by Island Urban president Jermaine Dupri and Jackson. She did not write or co-write any songs on the album, a departure from her usual practice of co-writing and producing all of the songs on her albums. The song "So Much Betta" contains sampled portions of the track "Daftendirekt" by the French house music duo Daft Punk.
The deluxe edition included a DVD entitled "The Making of Discipline". The DVD is split into five chapters that documents the production of the album, its promotion, and the "Feedback" music video. The first chapter entitled "Photo Shoots", shows Jackson creating a new image for the album and adopting different looks for different markets. She spent two days working on photos for the cover and credit booklet, revealing that she still feels uncomfortable in front of the camera despite two decades in the music industry. In the second chapter, "The Studio", Jackson expressed her opinion on recording work, stating that although she usually enjoyed the experience, it was, at times, tedious. She discusses further how her songs are built up in layers and parts, from melodies and background vocals or sounds. The third chapter, "Rehearsals", shows the rehearsals of the dance routine for the "Feedback" music video. The DVD reveals that the eight dancers had been practicing for over a week before they started working with Jackson. The dancers then had three days to rehearse with Jackson and a further two days to complete the video. Jackson described the video as a metaphor for sexual tension. The fourth chapter, "Behind the Video", shows the making of the video itself. Jackson told the director that she wanted a futuristic, moody concept, and he came up with the idea of jumping between planets. The final chapter is the lead music video in its entirety. On March 31, 2008 an edition of "Discipline" in environmentally friendly packaging was released through Wal-Mart stores as part of a green promotion.
Singles and notable tracks.
The album's first single "Feedback", was released as a digital download in December 2007. In the US, the song reached number nineteen on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, number thirty-nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number twenty-three on the Pop 100, becoming Jackson's best-charting single since "Someone to Call My Lover" in 2001. The song was also successful in Canada, where it peaked at number three. Due to a rushed release and no international promotion, the song failed to chart highly in European countries, peaking at number thirty-six in France.
Subsequent singles were promoted and released primarily in the US. "Rock with U", the second single, was released on February 5, 2008. A music video was released, with the song peaking at number twenty on the "Billboard" Dance Club Play Singles chart and at number 4 on the UK R&B charts. Following Jackson's departure from Island Records two more promotional singles, "Luv" and "Can't B Good", were issued to select radio formats. "Luv", the first promotional single, was released on February 11, 2008. It was not accompanied by a music video or promoted and peaked at number thirty-four on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. A second promotional single, "Can't B Good", was released March 18, 2008 to urban formats. The song "2nite" was featured on the second part of the soundtrack to the film "Sex and the City", titled "".
Reception.
Commercial.
"Discipline" debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200 for the issue dated ending March 15 with 181,000 copies sold. While this was a higher chart position than Jackson's two previous releases, it was a lower first-week sales total compared to "Damita Jo" which opened with sales of 381,000 and "20 Y.O." with sales of 296,000. Paul Grein of Yahoo! Music observed that with six number one studio albums, Jackson had "surpasseher brother Michael Jackson, who has amassed five [number one albums." With six number-one albums, Jackson is now tied with Mariah Carey and Britney Spears in the US for the third most number-one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with eight and Barbra Streisand's nine chart-toppers. In its second week, US sales saw the album fall to number three with 57,000 copies sold. In its third chart week, the album fell to number eight with sales of 38,000 copies. In its fourth chart week, the album fell to number seventeen with sales of 34,000 copies, achieving total US sales in its first month of 310,000 copies.
The album achieved moderate success in other countries, reaching number three in Canada (with 6,000 copies sold during its first week), number nine in Japan (where it has been certified Gold for 100,000 shipments), and number nine in Switzerland, but had low sales in most European markets. By June 2008 Island stopped promoting "Discipline". The singer expressed open dissatisfaction with the promotion of the album, explaining that there would be no further single releases. The album failed in the UK charts, remaining just one week in position 63 with 3,914 copies sold. In France, "Discipline" debuted at number forty-three with just 3,000 copies sold. In Japan the album debuted higher, at number nine with 19,839 copies sold. To date, the album has sold 449,000 copies in the United States; 100,000 copies in Japan and 9,312 copies in the United Kingdom.
Critical.
Upon its release, "Discipline" received generally positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 14 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".
Music critic Keith Harris of "Rolling Stone" wrote, "Janet Jackson has abandoned the plastic R&B of 2006's "20 Y.O." for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any images of the abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. Just lie back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs "Rock with U" and "2Nite" "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on "Discipline", and while none of it is exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer."
Carol Cooper of "The Village Voice" called "Discipline" "the most cohesive deep-groove album from La Jackson since "Control"." "NOW" Magazine reviewer Bryan Borzykowski called it "her most modern and club-friendly" album, and commented saying "Jackson wouldn't want us to call it a comeback, but it sure sounds like one." Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" gave it a three-out-of-four rating, saying "Its 22 tracks should be two albums: The first, a club-directed missile helmed by "Darkchild" Rodney Jerkins and Jackson's beau, Jermaine Dupri, could reassert Jackson's primacy among glamazon hit-makers; the second, a bedroom-bound ladies' favorite coauthored by soul dauphin Ne-Yo, would remind fans of Jackson's gift for creating truly tender smut."
"The Boston Globe" music critic Joan Anderman criticized the album saying "Jackson's decision to recycle the nympho routine one more time is just boring [...] A quarter-century into her career, it was Jackson's moment to take a breath, dig a little deeper, and make a bold - or at least a different - statement. Instead, she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn." On a better note, she called the tracks "Rollercoaster" and "Luv" "engaging tracks", describing them as a "sassy-sweet side" and "a plump, crackling confection", respectively.
"New York Times" music critic Kelefa Sanneh commented saying "If anything, "Discipline" may be too subtle: a pretty, smartly produced collection that sometimes sounds like background music." Michael Arceneaux of PopMatters called the album the "same old from her", adding "These days her look and sound seem nothing more than a continuation of 2001's "All for You"." "Entertainment Weekly"'s Margeaux Watson wrote that Jackson's lyrics "sound like the cheesy text messages of a lovesick adolescent" and gave a C- rating. Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that "Jackson's attempts to play the uber-nympho are beginning to sound very, very desperate" with "embarrassingly lewd lyrics" and gave the record 2 out of 5 stars. Caroline Sullivan of "The Guardian" described most tracks on the album as either boring or unmemorable. Robert Christgau gave the album a "dud" score as he had done with her previous album "20 Y.O." ().
Rock Witchu Tour.
Although the album promotion stopped in June, Jackson's fifth concert tour—the North American Rock Witchu Tour, with the support of Live Nation—began on September 10, 2008. Amy O'Brian of "The Vancouver Sun" described Jackson's stage show at the GM Place as a "high-voltage performance". According to O'Brian, "ith an ear-piercing blast of pyrotechnics, a fog of thick cloud and dancers that popped up out of the stage and runway, Jackson proved within the first minutes that she didn't choose the low-budget route for her Rock Witchu Tour." Similarly, Jim Harrington of "The Oakland Tribune" offered a positive review, stating: "Like Jackson's previous tours, 'Rock Witchu' was a flashy, high-budget extravaganza built on well-choreographed dance routines and plenty of theatrics." The initial response to the tour was very good, with sold out shows in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Supporting acts for the show included LL Cool J and Donnie Klang.
Jackson had to reschedule nine dates on the first leg of the tour due to vestibular migraines. However, on November 4, 2008, Jackson canceled 7 of the 9 shows which had been rescheduled, citing schedule conflicts as the main reason. On November 19, it was announced on Japanese newspapers and websites that Jackson will bring the tour to Japan for a series of five shows in Saitama, Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka in February 2009. However, all five dates were canceled.
Departure from record label.
On September 22—while on the Live Nation-supported tour of North America—Jackson parted company with her recording label Island; their 14-month relationship was dissolved per a request by Jackson. The singer had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the label, first telling SOHH.com that they "stopped all promotion whatsoever on the album" after releasing the first single, "Feedback". In early September she had stated, "I can't say if we'll be working with them in the future. I don't know what the future holds between the two of us." A spokesperson for Jackson added, " will have autonomy over her career, without the restrictions of a label system... Always known to break new ground and set trends, Janet's departure from Island Records makes her one of the first superstar artists to have the individual freedom to promote their work through a variety of avenues such as iTunes, mobile carriers and other diverse and innovative channels".
Jackson told "Sister 2 Sister" magazine, "There were some people who didn't like the direction I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A few months before the split, a spokesperson for the label told "Billboard", "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".

Geography of the Yarra River

The Yarra River is a river in East-Central Victoria, Australia that flows through the city of Melbourne. This article contains explanations and lists of the river's tributaries and other geographic features. The river flows atop layers of silt that built up within an ancient river valley around 10,000-15,000 years ago.
The river's major tributaries are the Plenty River, Merri Creek, Darebin Creek, Gardiners Creek, Mullum Mullum Creek and the Moonee Ponds Creek. It hosts a wide range of geographic features including; bends, rapids, lakes, islands, floodplains, billabongs, wetlands, etc. Most features have been named after translated Woiwurrung phrases or have European, particularly British, origins.
Tributaries.
The Yarra River has about 50 named tributaries in total; 6 rivers, 42 creeks and 2 gullies. At its most easterly point, it is fed by many small unnamed creeks and streams that begin in the Yarra Ranges within the Yarra Ranges National Park, which are sometimes fed by snowfalls. Below is a list of its tributaries (from downstream to upstream):
Geographical Features.
The Yarra River hosts a wide range of geographical features, perhaps the most plentiful of which are billabongs, of which there are over 100, particularly in the floodplains near Yering, Yarra Glen and Coldstream. Being a considerably thin river for almost its entire length, there are very few islands or lakes. In the middle reaches there are a few rapids of easy to moderate difficulty, however these are sparsely distributed. Below is a list of the river's geographical features, including tributaries (shown in bold) and man-made features or townships (shown in italics), for bearings (from downstream to upstream):

Undorosaurus

Undorosaurus is an extinct genus of ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur known from Ul'yanovsk Province of western Russia.
Description.
"Undorosaurus" is known from the holotype UPM EP-II-20 (527), a partial three-dimensionally preserved skeleton which preserved partial skull. It was collected near the Volga river at Gorodische from the "Epivirgatites nikitini" ammonoid zone, dating to the Late Jurassic.
Maisch and Matzke (2000) regarded "Undorosaurus" to be a species of "Ophthalmosaurus". However, Storrs "et al." 2000 rejected this synonymy based on the tooth morphology of the specimen. Chris McGowan and Ryosuke Motani (2003) pointed out two noteworthy differences to "Ophthalmosaurus", an incompletely fused ischiopubis and a remarkably strong dentition, and considered "Undorosaurus" to be a valid genus of ophthalmosaurid. "Undorosaurus"'s validity is now accepted by most authors, even by Maisch (2010) who originally proposed the synonymy.
Etymology.
"Undorosaurus" was named by Vladimir M. Efimov in 1999 and the type species is "Undorosaurus gorodischensis". The specific name is named after Gorodische, the type locality of this taxon.

Mollesaurus

Mollesaurus is an extinct genus of large ophthalmosaurine ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur known from northwestern Patagonia of Argentina.
Description.
"Mollesaurus" is known from the holotype MOZ 2282 V, articulated partial skeleton which preserved partial skull and most of the vertebral column. It was collected in the Chacaico Sur locality from the "Emileia giebeli" ammonoid zone of the Los Molles Formation, Cuyo Group, dating to the early Bajocian stage of the Middle Jurassic, about 171.6-170 million years ago. "Mollesaurus", alongside with "Chacaicosaurus cayi" which was found at the same locality, are the only diagnostic ichthyosaur specimens from the Aalenian-Bathonian interval. It was found near Zapala city of the Neuquén Basin.
Maisch and Matzke (2000) regarded "Mollesaurus" to be a species of "Ophthalmosaurus". However, all recent cladistic analyses found that "Mollesaurus" is a valid genus of ophthalmosaurid. Patrick S. Druckenmiller and Erin E. Maxwell (2010) found it to be the basalmost member of the ophthalmosaurid lineage that include "Brachypterygius", "Caypullisaurus" and "Platypterygius" (but don't include "Ophthalmosaurus"). Valentin Fischer, Michael W. Maisch, Darren Naish, Ralf Kosma, Jeff Liston, Ulrich Joger, Fritz J. Krüger, Judith Pardo Pérez, Jessica Tainsh and Robert M. Appleby (2012) found it to be the basalmost member of Ophthalmosaurinae.
Etymology.
"Mollesaurus" was named by Marta S. Fernández in 1999 and the type species is "Mollesaurus periallus". The generic name is derived from the name of the Los Molles Formation, where the holotype was collected, and "sauros", Greek for "lizard". The specific name is derived from "periallos", Greek for "before all others", in reference to the fact that it is the oldest ophthalmosaurid and one of the oldest thunnosaurs.

Arthur Gilbert

Arthur Gilbert (19 December 1819 – 21 April 1895) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.
Biography.
Arthur Gilbert was born Arthur Gilbert Frederick Williams on 19 December 1819 at Newington Butts Road in Stoke Newington, London. He was the fourth son of the painter Edward Williams (1781–1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780–1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction.
He married Elizabeth Jane Williams, daughter of John Williams, on 23 January 1843 in St Martin in the Fields. From all accounts Arthur had a gentle disposition and was a most devoted husband and father. In 1848 he lost his first wife, Elizabeth, due to tuberculosis. He was left with their daughter, Kate, who had been born five years prior. He then married his second wife, Sarah Godfrey, the daughter of John Godfrey, a clerk, on 28 June 1854, at the Parish Church in Barnes. Their son Horace was born the following year. Both of his children displayed artistic talent and later painted and exhibited.
Arthur Gilbert had addresses in Weybridge and Hammersmith, but spent most of his years at Lonsdale Terrace in Barnes, close to his father and brothers. He moved to Redhill in 1873 and then to "De Tillens" in Limpsfield, Surrey. This was his home for many years, to well after the marriage of his son, who produced some fine watercolours of the place. He died 21 April 1895 in Croydon, Surrey.
Marriages and children.
Arthur Gilbert had two wives. He married his first wife Elizabeth Jane Williams (1820–1849) on 23 January 1843 at St. Martin in the Fields, London. After Elizabeth's 1849 death from tuberculosis, he married his second wife Sarah Ann Godfrey (1830–1898) on 28 June 1854 St. Andrew Holburn, London. He had one child born to each of his wives.
Both of his children were artists for at least part of their careers.
The Williams Family.
Arthur Gilbert was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School. His father and five surviving brothers (listed below) were all noted Victorian landscape painters. He was one of three of the sons of Edward Williams who changed their last names to protect the identity of their art.
Art.
Arthur Gilbert became known for painting moonlight and night scenes, as well as stark mountains landscapes, many of which were exhibited in London. He painted also two large pictures of Saint John the Baptist for the "atelier Jacques-Paul Migne" that are part of the triptych of the choir in the gothic church of Audresselles, sea-side village in France (Pas-de-Calais).

Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)

Dangerous is the eighth studio album by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It was released on November 26, 1991 by Epic Records. His first album under his new contract with Sony Music, it was also Jackson's first album since 1979's "Off the Wall" not to be produced by longtime collaborator Quincy Jones, who had agreed to split after the final recording sessions for Jackson's 1987 album, "Bad". "Dangerous" has sold over 30 million albums worldwide (sold 20 million certified copies), 7 million albums were shipped in the United States alone, and has been cited as one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album produced four top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 including one number-one. Similar to the musician's previous material, the album's music features elements of R&B, pop and rock while also incorporating a newer genre, new jack swing, after the inclusion of producer Teddy Riley to the project.
"Dangerous" took over a year in production. Lyrical themes expressed in the album included racism, poverty, paranoia, romance, the welfare of children and the world and self-improvement, topics Jackson had covered before. Nine singles were released from "Dangerous" between November 1991 and December 1993, with seven singles issued in the United States, and two others released only outside the US. The two singles released outside the United States were successful, charting within the top ten and top forty respectively. "Dangerous" peaked at number one in nine countries, while charting at the top ten in four other territories. The only songs not released were "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", "She Drives Me Wild", "Can't Let Her Get Away", "Keep the Faith" and "Dangerous;" a video and a single release for the latter song was said to have been planned but was postponed indefinitely due to the musician's tour and later personal problems.
"Dangerous" was the first album to be produced fully by Jackson, with additional production from his friend, Bill Bottrell, and Teddy Riley, whose contribution presented Jackson with a younger urban audience. Jackson earned writing credits on all but two tracks on the album. "Dangerous" received several Grammy nominations, winning only for Best Engineered Album (Non Classical) by Bruce Swedien and Riley. In addition to commercial success, the album received critical acclaim from contemporary critics. It has been listed as the most successful album of all time in the new jack swing style.
Background.
Following the end of his successful but grueling world tour to support his successful "Bad" album in January 1989, Jackson had decided to focus on outside works including a deal with L.A. Gear to promote their brand of sneakers. He had also planned on the release of two greatest-hits packages, "Decade 1979-1989" and "Decade 1980-1990". Each was supposed to compose of hits spanning from his three previous studio albums, "Off the Wall", "Thriller" and "Bad," as well as unheard demos and new songs (one of which was a cover of The Beatles song "Strawberry Fields Forever").
In 1988, CBS Records was acquired by Sony Music. As a result all of the artists who recorded for the CBS subsidiaries including Epic and Columbia would now see their records distributed by Sony Music. In March 1991, days after his sister Janet Jackson had signed a $32 million deal with Virgin Records, the musician topped her by signing with Sony Music for a reported $50 million, making it the most lucrative contract in music history. Jackson's stipulations for the contract was that he must release at least three studio albums ("Dangerous", the second disc of ' and "Invincible" respectively), a remix album ('), two greatest hits collections (the first disc of "HIStory" and "Number Ones") and a box set ("The Ultimate Collection").
Recording.
Recording sessions for "Dangerous" took place at Ocean Way/Record One's Studio 2 in Los Angeles, starting in 1990, and ended at both Larrabee North and Ocean Way Studios the next year.
After Jackson and Bottrell began work on some songs including an early version of "Dangerous", he decided to recruit Teddy Riley to overlook some of the album's production. For the first time since 1979, Jackson was without longtime producer Quincy Jones, who had produced "Off the Wall", "Thriller" and "Bad". According to Jones, he convinced Jackson to have Riley replace him in the production of "Dangerous".
Some album sessions were put on hold due to Jackson's health problems as he had spent time in a L.A. hospital for weeks after complaining of chest pains. When he was released, he continued work on the album, desiring to take his music to a harder sound than in previous albums, inspired by his sister Janet's edgy sound in her album, "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814". Prior to working with Riley, Jackson had desired to work with producers Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds and Antonio "L.A." Reid. Around the same time, his brother Jermaine Jackson, who had signed with La Face Records, was set to work with them and since Jackson didn't tell his brother about it before, considered it as an act of betrayal, though he later dismissed that notion in years since. Jermaine's song, "Word to the Badd", was composed with lyrics aimed negatively at his brother, and were later revised to lyrics aimed at a bad relationship.
Songs that were recorded for the "Dangerous" album but were eventually left out included "Monkey Business", "She Got It", "Work That Body", "Serious Effect" (which included rapper LL Cool J), "If You Don't Love Me", the ballad "For All Time", which had been written during the "Thriller" sessions but was recorded around the time "Dangerous" was recorded; "Superfly Sister" and "Blood on the Dance Floor", the latter two later issued on Jackson's remix compilation, "".
Composition.
With Riley, Jackson recorded under the new jack swing genre, a genre Riley has been often credited with inventing. It was also the first album in which Jackson began rapping. The inclusion of the rap group Wreckx-n-Effect, Jackson's embrace of hip-hop rhythms and new jack swing were designed to give Jackson a new younger urban audience. In other recordings, with Bottrell, Jackson's sounds were more diverse as it had been in other albums with "Black or White" recorded under the pop rock genre while the Slash-featured "Give In to Me" was recorded as a hard rock ballad. The ballads, "Keep the Faith", composed by Jackson and his "Man in the Mirror" collaborators Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard, and the self-composed "Will You Be There" both featured strong elements of gospel music while the other ballads "Heal the World" and "Gone Too Soon" were softer pop ballads. The smooth R&B number, "Remember the Time", featured elements of not only new jack swing but also funk, while "Who Is It" and "Jam" had stronger funk elements.
Lyrics for the songs' subject matter were more varied than in Jackson's previous records. Though he often talked of the subject of racial harmony in some of his songs with his brothers, The Jacksons, "Dangerous" was the first of these albums in which he talked openly of racism, which was the main topic with the hit song, "Black or White". Other social commentary topics that Jackson had never touched as a solo artist including poverty and inner city life were discussed in the song "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", in which he compared social ills to his own alleged publicized eccentricities that were covered in the press at the time asking critics and tabloid media why were they focusing on him when other more social problems were going on. He addressed similar issues in the album's opening track, "Jam", which included rapping from Heavy D. "In the Closet" had originally been set as a duet between Jackson and Madonna though this recording never happened and focused on two lovers carrying on a discreet affair without being open about the affair. The album also included songs of other personal nature especially in songs such as "She Drives Me Wild", "Remember the Time", "Can't Let Her Get Away", "Who Is It" and "Give In to Me". The social commentary "Heal the World" was in the middle of the number of personal songs. "Gone Too Soon", written by Larry Grossman and Buz Kohan, was written and recorded for Ryan White following White's death from AIDS in 1990. The title track's lyrics were compared to that of "Dirty Diana" with the song focusing on a seductress.
Release.
The album was released on November 26, 1991. After its first week of release, it debuted at number-one on the "Billboard" 200, staying there for four weeks. Sales of the album were shipped for seven million under two months, making this the fastest-selling album ever for Jackson in the U.S., breaking the sales record he had held for "Bad", which had shipped seven million in four months. The album was certified seven-times platinum for sales of seven million copies alone in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
Globally, "Dangerous" dominated worldwide charts debuting at number-one in the United Kingdom while also reaching number-one in seven other territories including Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. It was also a huge success in Asian countries. Sales of the album eventually reached over 35 million copies worldwide.
Marketing.
Similar to how Jackson's label had approached the "Bad" album, expectations again were raised high for the "Dangerous" album. In September 1991, Jackson netted a deal to have his videos air on the Fox TV network alongside regular music-video channels, MTV, BET and VH-1. The eleven-minute "Black or White" video debuted on November 14, 1991 and was seen in 27 countries and reportedly watched by a record 500 million viewers, said to be the most to ever watch a music video. The airing and later controversy of the video helped the sales of "Dangerous", as did the broadcasting of two other Jackson videos for "Remember the Time" and "In the Closet". Jackson's first HBO concert special, "", also helped in the sales of "Dangerous" after it aired in October 1992, reviving sales of the album. After several weeks of tapering off again, Jackson made personal appearances in early 1993 including the American Music Awards and Grammy Awards, the latter in which he accepted the Grammy Legend Award from his sister Janet, and the much talked about interview with Oprah Winfrey, helping to return the album to the top ten.
Singles.
The album's leading track, "Black or White", was an instant number-one hit upon its release that November, debuting at the top of the charts several weeks after it was released, staying there for seven weeks. It would be his only number-one single from the album on the pop charts. Jackson had four top ten singles in the United States from the album including "Remember the Time", which peaked at No. 3 but reached number-one on the R&B chart, his first R&B number-one since "Another Part of Me" nearly four years earlier; "In the Closet", which peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100, but also reached number-one.
The last top ten single for the album was "Will You Be There", which reached number seven and was boosted by an appearance on the "Free Willy" soundtrack, helping to boost more sales from "Dangerous". "Who Is It" peaked at number fourteen, while "Jam" and "Heal the World" would both peak at the top thirty on the Hot 100 respectively, Jackson's lowest pop showings since early 1979; and the overseas-only singles, "Give In to Me" and "Gone Too Soon" with "Give In to Me" reaching the top five in the UK, Netherlands, Australia and hitting the top of the charts in New Zealand, while "Gone Too Soon" was more moderately received, charting within the top forty.
The singles success of "Dangerous" was more successful overseas than in Jackson's native United States: in the UK alone, seven of the singles from the album all reached the UK top ten, just like Bad achieved by 2009. This was a record for any studio album in the UK until Calvin Harris broke this in 2013.
Critical reception.
"Dangerous" was well received by most critics. Robert Christgau gave "Dangerous" a grade of A-, saying it was Jackson's "most consistent album since "Off the Wall"". Alan Light of "Rolling Stone" described Jackson during the thesis of the album as "a man, no longer a man-child, confronting his well-publicized demons and achieving transcendence through performance" and that album rose to "the impossible challenge set by 'Thriller'." Stephen Thomas of Allmusic described the album as "a much sharper, riskier album than 'Bad'." "Dangerous" received four Grammy nominations including three for Jackson including Best Pop Vocal Performance, Best R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song while Teddy Riley and Bruce Swedien won the Grammy for Best Engineered Album - Non Classical.

CryoSat-2

CryoSat-2 is a European Space Agency environmental research satellite which was launched in April 2010. It provides scientists with data about the polar ice caps and tracks changes in the thickness of the ice with a resolution of about .
CryoSat-2 was built as a replacement for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between floating ice and open water.
CryoSat-2 is operated as part of the CryoSat programme to study the Earth's polar ice caps, which is itself part of the Living Planet programme. The CryoSat-2 spacecraft was constructed by EADS Astrium, and was launched by ISC Kosmotras, using a Dnepr-1 carrier rocket, on 8 April 2010. On 22 October 2010, CryoSat-2 was declared operational following six months of on-orbit testing.
Background.
The initial proposal for the CryoSat programme was submitted as part of a call for proposals in July 1998 for Earth Explorer missions as part of the European Space Agency's Living Planet programme. It was selected for further studies in 1999, and following completion of a feasibility study the mission was authorised. The construction phase began in 2001, and in 2002 EADS Astrium was awarded a contract to build the spacecraft. A contract was also signed with Eurockot, to conduct the launch of the satellite using a Rokot/Briz-KM carrier rocket.
Construction of the original spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in August 2005, and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut down at the end of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, North of Greenland.
Due to the importance of the CryoSat mission for understanding global warming and reductions in polar ice caps, a replacement satellite was proposed. The development of CryoSat-2 was authorised in February 2006, less than five months after the failure.
Development.
Following the announcement that CryoSat-2 would be built, experiments were conducted in Antarctica, as part of the CryoVEx programme, to determine how snow could affect its readings, and to provide data for calibrating the satellite. In January 2007 the European Space Agency issued a request for proposals for further calibration and validation experiments. Further CryoVEx experiments were conducted on Svalbard in 2007, followed by a final expedition to Greenland and the Devon Ice Cap in 2008. Additional snow measurements were provided by the Arctic Arc Expedition, and the Alfred Wegner Institute's ASIRAS instrument, mounted aboard a Dornier Do 228 aircraft.
Like its predecessor, CryoSat-2 was constructed by EADS Astrium, with its main instrument being built by Thales Alenia Space. Construction and testing of the spacecraft's primary instrument was completed by February 2008, when it was shipped for integration with the rest of the spacecraft. In August 2009, the spacecraft's ground infrastructure, which had been redesigned since the original mission, was declared ready for use. Construction and testing of the spacecraft had been completed by mid-September. The Project Manager for the CryoSat-2 mission was Richard Francis, who had been the Systems Manager on the original CryoSat mission.
CryoSat-2 is an almost-identical copy of the original spacecraft, however modifications were made including the addition of a backup radar altimeter. In total, 85 improvements were made to the spacecraft when it was rebuilt.
Final preparations.
When it was approved in February 2006, the launch of CryoSat-2 was planned for March 2009. It was originally planned that like its predecessor it would be launched by a Rokot, however due to a lack of available launches a Dnepr-1 rocket was selected instead. ISC Kosmotras were contracted to perform the launch. Due to delays to earlier missions and range availability problems, the launch was delayed until February 2010.
The Dnepr rocket assigned to launch CryoSat-2 arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome by train on 29 December 2009. On 12 January 2010, the first two stages of the rocket were loaded into the launch canister, and the canister was prepared for transportation to the launch site. On 14 January, it was rolled out to Site 109/95, where it was installed into its silo. The next day saw the third stage transported to the silo, and installed atop the rocket.
Following the completion of its construction, CryoSat-2 was placed into storage to await launch. In January 2010, the spacecraft was removed from storage, and shipped to Baikonur for launch. It departed Munich Franz Josef Strauss Airport aboard an Antonov An-124 aircraft on 12 January, and arrived at Baikonur the next day. Following arrival at the launch site, final assembly and testing were conducted.
During final testing, engineers detected that the spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was not receiving the amount of power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide was overheating, which suggested it was the cause of the problem. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without disassembly, however in order to avoid doing so, which would have delayed the launch, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove one of them, whilst engineers were able to remove the other with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from a coating on the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite was removed from the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.
On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 spacecraft was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it was attached to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the "Space Head Module". This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as the "crocodile", and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.
Launch.
When the spacecraft was installed atop the Dnepr, launch was scheduled to occur on 25 February, at 13:57 UTC. Prior to this, a practice countdown was scheduled for 19 February. Several hours before the practice was scheduled to begin ISC Kosmotras announced that the launch had been delayed, and as a result the practice did not take place. The delay was caused by a concern that the second stage manoeuvring engines did not have a sufficient quantity of reserve fuel.
Following the delay, the Space Head Module was removed from the rocket, and returned to its integration building on 22 February. Whilst it was in the integration building, daily inspections were made to ensure that the spacecraft was still functioning normally. Once the fuel issue had been resolved, the launch was rescheduled for 8 April, and launch operations resumed. On 1 April, the Space Head Module was returned to the silo, and reinstalled atop the Dnepr. Following integrated tests, the practice countdown was successfully conducted on 6 April.
CryoSat-2 was launched at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 separated from the upper stage of the Dnepr into a low Earth orbit. The first signals from the satellite were detected by a ground station at the Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.
Mission.
CryoSat-2's mission is to study the Earth's polar ice caps, measuring, and looking for variation in, the thickness of the ice. Its mission is identical to that of the original CryoSat.
The primary instruments aboard CryoSat-2 are SIRAL-2, the SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeters; which uses radar to determine and monitor the spacecraft's altitude in order to measure the elevation of the ice. Unlike the original CryoSat, two SIRAL instruments are installed aboard CryoSat-2, with one serving as a backup in case the other fails.
A second instrument, Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite, or DORIS, is used to calculate precisely the spacecraft's orbit. An array of retroreflectors are also carried aboard the spacecraft, and allow measurements to be made from the ground to verify the orbital data provided by DORIS.
Following launch, CryoSat-2 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , 92 degrees of inclination and an orbital period of 99.2 minutes. It had a mass at launch of , and is expected to operate for at least three years.
Launch and Early Orbit Phase operations were completed in the morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, the spacecraft returned its first scientific data. Initial data on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet Symposium on 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. The spacecraft underwent six months of on-orbit testing and commissioning, which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found the spacecraft was operating as expected, and that it was ready to begin operations.

Using this software it is possible to develop web applications on a 100% visual approach, without writing lines of code. To realize this, Softwell Maker designer uses visual forms and reports (WYSIWYG), business rules, and visually representing other actions using flowcharts.
Where it all began.
The Maker project was born in 2002, within Freire Informática Ltda. a software factory in Bahia that operates in the public area, which developed over 100 solutions based on the Softwell Maker platform since the first versions of the product. In 2004, Softwell Solutions Ltda was created to be a specialized company in the evolution and improvement of Maker and other tools to improve software development process.
Understanding the Softwell Maker.
The Softwell Maker platform is composed of two interdependent products, an IDE and a royalty-free runtime, respectively called Maker and Webrun.
The IDE is in charge of recording all the specifications of the system within specific tables set up in a database, the Webrun reads these specifications and provides the ultimate application for the customer.
Using Softwell Maker so many steps from traditional development process are useless, skipped or automatically filled when we are developing software using this tool. Then we will experience not just a new tool, but a new way to run over whole software development process. We hope put some more information about this methodology in another article as soon as possible.
Language Independent.
Applications developed by Softwell Maker are not tied to a programming language, so they will always be technologically upgraded preserving the real value of software: the business rules.
<br>
Main Features.
To support the widest range of applications, the product offers a comprehensive list of resources and tries to do this in the most simple and intuitive way as possible, following a summary of the product capability:
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
The IDE of the Softwell Maker platform (which gives the product its name) currently in version 2.4 is an application for Microsoft Windows (win32) compatible with versions 2000, Me, XP and Vista (32 e 64 bits) of Windows;
Softwell Maker platform is made up of a form designer, a report designer (MakerReport), flowcharts designer (MakerFlow), a set of wizards and tools to support the developer.
<br>
Form designer.
Used to develop the forms of application is a 100% visual approach availability to the developer of a very flexible set of components that can be added to the form and positioned through the mouse or keyboard, according to the WYSIWYG philosophy.
The forms may or may not be connected to a table in the database, but can also be connected to other databases, whole or in part, by facilitating the integration of various databases.
Reports designer.
This allows for reports with visual support for graphics, table cross-references, and sub-reports groups at various levels. 
The generated reports can be executed in the environment Win32/WINE, or be exported to Jasper, a reports generator written in Java;
Flow designer.
Sometimes called MakerFlow or simply Flow, this is the component that allows the complete independence of the code, since the actions and business rules will be defined using a 100% visual approach, free from specifications of a programming language.
The programming flow path allows only logic, allowing the team to concentrate efforts on implementing the details of what really matters to the customer: the business rules and not other details of the development software process, but must be followed reliable and stable application
Wizards tools and support.
There is a set of tools to support the development in the Softwell Maker platform. We can mention the following ones:
supports the latest copies of each object changed, restoration points of all software;
Running the Software (Webrun).
<br>
The Webrun can be defined as the virtual machine on which the applications are executed by the Softwell Maker platform. It is responsible for providing the resources necessary to correct software execution. Currently the Webrun is available for the Java and .NET platform. Over Java, the application is distributed as a standard WAR file, and was approved for the following application servers: Tomcat 5.5/6, JBoss, Weblogic, and Websphere. 
This application is that which provides the technological platform on which the software is implemented, namely access control, the so-called AJAX, the database connections, the load balancing, connections pool, and a number of countless other services used in the application, fully provided by Webrun.
Webrun Architecture.
The picture below illustrates some details from Webrun internal architecture and a default execution environment of an application built by Softwell Maker, where business rules can run into three layers: client (JavaScript), server (Java/.NET), and database (Oracle, MS-SQL Server, PostgreSQL, …). We can also realize internals subsystems of Visual Interface Builder (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PDF, ...), Database Management (Transactions, Procedures, Sequences, …), and System Manager (User’s session, authentication, permissions, …).

Leon Rotman

Leon Rotman (born July 22, 1934 in Bucharest) is a Romanian sprint canoer who competed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Life and sporting career.
Rotman is Jewish, and was born to a working-class Jewish family, he took up several sports in the years immediately after World War II and was fascinated by canoeing after seeing the famous Czech champions Jan Brzák-Felix and Bohumil Kudrna compete on Lake Snagov near Bucharest in 1953. He joined the Dinamo Bucharest sports club, in the hope of getting one of the Czech-made canoes left by the two in Romania. He didn't, but he was remarked by famous coach Radu Huţan after becoming national champion in improvised canoes. 
He would eventually compete at the Olympics on the first canoe ever made in Romania (at the factories in Reghin, Mureş County). At the 1956 Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne, despite competing with a sprained ankle, Rotman won both the C-1 10000 m and the C-1 1000 m events, equaling Swede Gert Fredriksson's performance who, at the same Olympics, won gold in both individual kayak events. He went on to win bronze at the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome in the C-1 1000m event. He was slightly less successful in other competitions (fifth in the 1957 and 1961 European Championships in C-1 1000 m, and seventh at the 1963 World Championships in C-1 10000 m). 
He won however the Snagov Regatta seven times and six international regattas outside Romania. He won 14 national titles before his 1963 retirement.

Vikentii Trofimov

Vikentii Pavlovich Trofimov (Russian: Викентий Павлович Трофимов; November 24, 1878 in Talizky Zavod, Perm Governorate – February 10, 1956 in Zagorsk, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, Moscow Oblast) was a Russian painter.
The Trofimov family.
Trofimov was descended from a family of Siberian Cossacks, explorers and merchants. His father Pavel Trofimov was a well-known ship-owner; his partners and he decided to restart merchant navigation through the famous Northern Sea Route and fairs in Mangazeya (the ancient merchant town). For this purpose in 1911 the famous Fridtjof Nansen had been invited to investigate the river basin of the Ob River, and Pavel Trofimov was among the sponsors of this project. There were ten children in Trofimov's family, and every one became a well-educated person.
Graduation from Stroganovka.
In 1899 Vikentii Trofimov graduated from Stroganov Central College of Technical Drawing (now Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry, informally named Stroganovka). He and his friend Ignaty Nivinsky were both recommended for the gold medal. As there was only one gold medal, the two friends instead were encouraged to travel and teach abroad, and they agreed. A little later Trofimov married Ignaty's sister Vera, a very talented person with abilities in theatre. Trofimov continued his painting education in the private school of Zhukovsky and Halyavin, and travelled extensively in Europe.
Early career.
In 1900 Trofimov started his pedagogical work at his alma mater, then continued as director of one of its branches. From 1903-1905 he worked as a painter and as the director of the domestic department of Sudga Zemstvo (a form of local government). There his first son, Ignaty, was born. Later the family lived in Moscow for several years and Trofimov taught watercolour painting in private school. From 1909-1911 he was headmaster of the Stroganovka branch in Sergiyev Posad.
From 1911 to 1922 the family lived in Voronezh where Trofimov was headmaster of Kolomenkin Art school, another branch of Stroganovka. The beginning of the First World War, Nicholas II of Russia visited Voronezh, and Trofimov made a sketch dedicated this visit. The sketch is now kept in the State Historical Museum of Russia. Some paintings from this period of Trofimov's life are kept in the Voronezh Museum of local lore as well. In spite of living in a small town, Trofimov continually took part in many art exhibitions such as All-Russian contests of art trade in Moscow and St. Petersburg from 1900–1916 and was awarded first prizes. In 1918 his painting "Boys Bathers" was sold during the first day of the show in Moscow.
Old Voronezh.
At the beginning of 1920 Vikentii Trofimov was invited to take part in very interesting work. Professor Uspenskiy created a Committee of Archeology (the predecessor of the Community of Saving of Art Monuments) and this Committee invited some painters (locals as well as famous painters such as Apollinary Vasnetsov) to draw old places of the town in order to save them for the future. Trofimov painted some works about the Old Voronezh. For this task he studied archive documents in order to recreate monuments which were no longer in existence at the time. His painting "Uspenskaya Church and the houses of Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov and Apraksin in Peter the Great Period" drew on the ancient prints and other works kept in the Ivan Kramskoi Museum in Voronezh. These works were also published in the book "Old Voronezh" by Prof. Uspenskiy. Much later, in March 1986 on the Conference of Regional Studies in Voronezh, an address on Trofimov was presented as well as a show of his works. Some articles about his art were published; for example, there is a little citation: "The painter Vikentii Trovimov mostly worked in his favourite watercolour technique though he was able to paint in oil in the same light and transparent manner. His style was honoured by Igor Grabar, who described the paintings by Trofimov as documentary and pictorial portraits of architectural monuments which were correct down to the number of bricks".
Omsk.
In 1924 the Trofimov family moved to Omsk. Trofimov was a headmaster of the painting branch of Mikhail Vrubel Art School, and additionally he became a director of the New Siberia branch. In Omsk he painted such works as "Near the crossing of Irtysh", "Ob River near Belokurikha", "The Spring in Omsk Creek" and others. Among them, he created a number of monumental works in the public houses. In the 1930s the portrait of his young son Lev under the name "Our Relief" was published as a postcard by Association of the Painters of the Revolution; 25,000 copies were made.
Vikentii Trofimov was a fine yachtsman and he passed this love to his children. His knowledge of sea-skills gave him the ability to draw sailors with a high degree of accuracy not usually seen in paintings of seascapes.
Zagorsk.
In 1932 the Trofimov family moved to Moscow. There Trofimov painted on a heroic scale, including the decorated ceiling of the main staircase in the Soviet Army House, decorated ceilings of the White Hall of Mossovet and Shchusev Museum of Architecture, etc.
At the end of the 1930s the family moved to Zagorsk. There Trofimov took part in the very complex and important restoration works in Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, together with his son Ignaty who was invited as general director and architecture restorer. Vikentii Trofimov created art reconstructions of the monuments of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra based on the working drawings made by his son. His reconstructions include "Holy Spirit Church and Trinity Cathedral. Perspective view eastwards"; "Holy Spirit Church. Perspective view south-west"; "Hospital Wards and Church of Zosima and Savvaty. Perspective view south-east"; "Refectory. Perspective view north-east"; "Refectory. Section according to east-west axis" and others; these were published in the book written by his son 
Vikentii Trofimov didn't stop his easel painting and constantly took part in art exhibitions. On August 23, 1955, he presented a solo exhibition in Zagorsk Preserve Museum. All his masterpieces were presented, from the earliest works to the latest sketches. The main part of the exhibition consisted of the paintings dedicated to Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. The catalogue was published with the comment that "the watercolors may serve as documents for the future investigator of Old Russian architecture, so precisely is every detail trimmed up".
Impact.
The heritage of Vikentii Trofimov is not currently studied. His archive in 1990-1991 was shown in the Tyumen Art Museum and his paintings are kept in many other museums of the Russian Federation. He brought up a lot of pupils in various fields of easel, monumental and applied paintings as well in art manufacture, and his children were first among his pupils. Lev and Valentina became well-known painters, and Valentina collaborated with her famous uncle Ignaty Nivinsky. Ignaty Trofimov, the general director of restoration of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, the honourable citizen of Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, a member of the Architectural Society, devoted his book to his father. He wrote: "The author revered his father's memory with particular gratitude. The painter Vikentii Pavlovich Trofimov from the years 1938 till 1956 had lived and worked in Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra and was adviser and leader of the author. His deep knowledge of art and architecture, his creative activities strongly expressed in his paintings, and his love for Russia gave the author the constant model in creation and the author is obliged to the model of all positive things he has in his work." 
In spite of his bright and productive activity, Vikentii Trofimov had no titles and ranks as he was a non-Party man and so had been kept in the background during the Communist period.
In 2007, on the XXIII Antiq Saloon, the art exhibition of Vikentii Trofimov was presented by Shishkin Gallery.
Works by Vikentii Trofimov are known and claimed as well abroad. In 2007 Christie's sold one of his early paintings, "The Descent in Voronezsh," and in 2008 another of his pictures, "Kazakhs with a horse at a crossing," was sold through Christie's.

2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's scratch

The 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's scratch was the women's scratch race at 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. It was one of the eight women's events, held at the Manchester Velodrome in Manchester, Great Britain on the fifth and final day of the Championships on 30 March 2008. It was the seventh women's scatch race appearance at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. 21 women from 21 countries participated in the race.
After several attacks that did not come to anything Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands struck out alone with less than eight laps to go. No one else reacted and she rode solo to the finish. The sprint of the peloton behind Van Dijk was won by Yumari González of Cuba who took the silver medal with Belinda Goss from Australia taking bronze.
Qualification.
Qualification for the race was restricted to one cyclist per nation for the countries in the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) individual standings as of 18 February 2008, after the fourth and final round of the 2007–08 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics. Additionally, one place was available at the B World Championship, one place at each contintenal championships and one wild card for nations that did not qualify through the UCI standing. National federations of the qualified countries selected the rider. The maximum quota of the event was set at 24 cyclists but only 21 cyclists were registered.
Competition format.
A scratch race is a race in which all riders start together and the object is to cross the finish line. The competition consisted on 40 laps, making a total of 10 km without intermediate points or sprints.
There were no qualification rounds for this discipline so the event was run direct to the final.
Schedule.
Times are in British Summer Time (UTC+1)
Sunday 30 March
16:30-16:50 Final
17:15:-17:25 Victory Ceremony
Pre-race favorites.
Not all 2007–08 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics medalists could participate in the race because each qualified country was only allowed to select one rider. Besided of that, not all countries selected their World Cup medalist, if they had one. The main favorite for the race was Yumari González from Cuba, the defending champion, who won the scratch race at the 2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and won the first World Cup race in Sydney and finished third in the second World Cup race in Beijing. The silver medalist of 2007, María Luisa Calle of Colombia, was also selected. The start list further included Belinda Goss of Australia, Jarmila Machačová from the Czech Republic and Annalisa Cucinotta from Italy who won all three a silver medal during a World Cup race. The Netherlands did not select Marianne Vos, who won two of the four World Cup races, but selected Ellen van Dijk instead.
Race.
The race started at 16:30 British Summer Time (UTC+1) and was scheduled to last until 16:50. 21 women form 21 countries took part in the race.
The race had several attacks, the first meaningful one coming in only lap five from Aksana Papko of Belarus in an early bid to match her countryman Aliaksandr Lisouski's victory in the men's race on day one. She was chased down by a small group that included Svetlanan Paulikaite of Lithuania, Svitlana Galyuk of Ukraine and Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. The rest of the bunch was very attentive at this early stage and they were soon back together. Paulikaite struck out alone, but her effort did not come to anything. A crash in the middle period of the race took down Catherine Cheatley of New Zealand and Spain's Gema Pascual Torrecilla after a touch of wheels near the back. Cheatley rejoined after a few minutes, but Torrecilla pulled out having fallen more heavily. More attacks continued, but all were reeled. With less than eight laps to go, Van Dijk struck out alone and no one else reacted. She overtook the Danish rider Trine Schmidt from an earlier escape and had soon almost half lap lead. The rest of the riders did not react and looked to each other. Despite having almost half a lap on the rest of the bunch, Van Dijk refused to start getting complacent and kept going. When a chase did materialise, it was too late and Van Dijk finished alone with a considerable gap to take the gold medal and the rainbow jersey. Behind Van Dijk the sprint was won by the 2007 champion Yumari Gonzalez Valdivieso of Cuba, ahead of Belinda Goss from Australia. Annalisa Cucinotta of Italy was fourth and Rebecca Quinn from the United States of America finished fifth.
Final classifications.
The victory ceremony was held at 17:15 British Summer Time (UTC+1). The winner was awarded the rainbow jersey and the top three riders got flowers and respectively a gold, silver and bronze medal.

Medalists reactions.
"I was never World champion so it is my biggest victory so far! I was focused on the individual pursuit, everything for me was on that. My individual pursuit was good, but I was fifth and just missed the finals. I was very disappointed because I also missed the Olympic Games, because I only started riding cups on the track four months ago. I didn't have enough points to ride in the individual pursuit in the Olympics." About the scratch race she continued: "My plan was to attack about 10 laps from the finish, I wanted to go when the speed was a bit lower. I did it about eight laps before the finish. I was surprised, but every country has just one rider so they don't work together. That was better for me to ride away. I didn't look behind, just once," she added. "I knew I had to give it everything and if there was no gap, then there was no gap. But it worked out well." Despite having quite a considerable gap coming into the final lap, Van Dijk refused to believe that the race was won until the very end. She detailed the point at which she realised that she was definitely going to triumph. "Just 100 metres before the finish," she said. "I didn't know how big the gap was then, I didn't look back, I was just focused on riding hard and getting everything out." A few days on from the frustration of non-qualification, her new rainbow jersey and gold medal provide her with a great deal of compensation. "I was really, really disappointed with that," she confirmed. "But this makes up for it."
"The race was very fast." She told the assembled media. "I didn't feel very good but at the end I was able to get the silver medal so I am happy about that."
"I'm certainly stoked by the result. It is such a great improvement on last year. It would have been great to have got gold, the top prize, but I am really happy. It has been a long wait. I had to put it in my head that I'd get in some training this week, get a bit fitter. But I am really happy with myself; things have been going well for me. I rode well in Europe last year."

Montreal Diocesan Theological College

The Montreal Diocesan Theological College (known as Dio) is the theological seminary of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal, Canada. It offers the Master of Divinity and Diploma in Ministry to candidates for ordination and other students. It also offers a distance education program, the Reading and Tutorial Course in Theology, leading to the Licentiate in Theology. 
Andrew Taylor (Architect) designed the former Montreal Diocesan Theological College building at University Street near Milton Street, 1895-96. In 2008, after many years without ever having more than twelve full-time students, and in order to devote its resources to its educational mission, the college sold its buildings to McGill University, and is now run out of the rooms of the former Principal's Lodge, which are now rented from McGill. 
The college is affiliated with the Montreal School of Theology, the McGill University Faculty of Religious Studies [http://www.mcgill.ca/religiousstudies/ and the Université de Montréal.
A World War I memorial window (1935) by Charles William Kelsey depicting St. Stephen the Martyr was dedicated to Albert Withey of the 24th Canadian Battalion.

Leader of the Labour Party (UK)

The Leader of the Labour Party is the most senior politician within the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. Since 25 September 2010, the office has been held by Ed Miliband, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
Harriet Harman is currently the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.
Background.
The post of Leader of the Labour Party was officially created in 1922. Before this time, between when Labour MPs were first elected in 1906 and the election in 1922, when substantial gains were made, the post was known as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party.
Unlike other British political party leaders, the Labour Leader does not have the power to dismiss or appoint their Deputy. Both the Leader and Deputy Leader are elected by an Alternative Vote system in an electoral college, with a third of the votes allocated to the Party's MPs and MEPs, a third to individual members of the Labour Party, and a third to individual members of all affiliated organisations, including socialist societies and trade unions.
When the Labour Party is in Opposition, as it currently is, the Leader of the Labour Party usually acts as the Leader of the Opposition, and chairs the Shadow Cabinet. Concordantly, when the Party is in Government, the Leader would usually become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service, as well as appointing the Cabinet.
In 1921, John Robert Clynes became the first Leader of the Labour Party to be born in England; prior to this, all Leaders had been born in Scotland. In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald became the first ever Labour Prime Minister, leading a minority administration. Clement Attlee would become the first Leader to lead a majority government in 1945. The first to be born in Wales was Neil Kinnock, who was elected in 1983. The most electorally successful Labour Leader to date is Tony Blair, who won three in 1997, 2001 (both landslide victories), and 2005.
List of Leaders of the Labour Party.
×These assumed the role of party leader temporarily because of the death or resignation of the incumbent. In the case of George Brown and Margaret Beckett, both were serving as Deputy Leader, and assumed the role temporarily following the sudden deaths of Hugh Gaitskell and John Smith respectively. Harriet Harman was Deputy Leader when Gordon Brown resigned, becoming Leader while the process of electing a new Leader was ongoing.
Retirement.
It is not uncommon for a retired Leader of the Labour Party to be granted a peerage upon their retirement, particularly if they served as Prime Minister; examples of this include Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson. However, Neil Kinnock was also elevated to the House of Lords, despite never being Prime Minister, and Michael Foot declined a similar offer.
There are currently three living former Leaders of the Labour Party (with the period they were in office):

Dépôt-Échouani, Quebec

Dépôt-Échouani is an unorganized territory in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada. It is the smallest and northernmost of the five unorganized territories in the La Vallée-de-la-Gatineau Regional County Municipality. Its territory surrounds Échouani Lake and stretches along the western banks of the upper Gatineau River.
The territory is named after the Échouani Depot, a former logging camp of the Canadian International Paper Company near the confluence of the Chouart and Gatineau Rivers, abandoned since 1962. The name is known since the nineteenth century and several variants have been used on maps and plans: Eshwaham (1873), Eskwahani (1924), Eshwahani (1926), Échouani (1933), as well as Eshawan and Askwahani (dates unknown). The exact origin and significance of this name is unknown, but one possibility is that the word comes from "Echoam", a tributary of the Gatineau, and this in turn is a derivative of "echohamok", which is from the Algonquin language probably meaning "to prepare to leave by water".

Markov spectrum

In mathematics, the Markov spectrum devised by Andrey Markov is a complicated set of real numbers arising in the theory of diophantine approximation, and containing all the real numbers larger than Freiman's constant.
Context.
Starting from Hurwitz's theorem on diophantine approximation, that any real number "formula_1" has a sequence of rational approximations "m"/"n" tending to it with
it is possible to ask for each value of "1/c" with "1/c" ≥ √5 about the existence of some "formula_1" for which
for such a sequence, for which "c" is the best possible (maximal) value. Such "1/c" make up the Lagrange spectrum, a set of real numbers at least √5 (which is the smallest value of the spectrum). The formulation with the reciprocal is awkward, but the traditional definition invites it; looking at the set of "c" instead allows a definition instead by means of an inferior limit. For that, consider
where "m" is chosen as an integer function of "n" to make the difference minimal. This is a function of "formula_1", and the reciprocal of the Lagrange spectrum is the range of values it takes on irrational numbers.
The initial part of the Lagrange spectrum, namely the part lying in the interval [√5, 3), is associated with some binary quadratic forms that are indefinite (so factoring into two real linear forms). The first few values are √5, √8, √221/5, √1517/13, ... . The Markov spectrum deals directly with the phenomena associated to those quadratic forms.
Freiman's constant is the name given to the end of the last gap in the Lagrange spectrum, namely:
Real numbers greater than "F" are also members of the Markov spectrum.

International Championship for Manufacturers

The FIA International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC) was a rally series culminating in a champion manufacturer. The championship was run from 1970 to 1972 and it was replaced by the FIA World Rally Championship in 1973. All the nine rallies of the 1972 IMC season were part of the 1973 World Rally Championship season.
In the inaugural season, Porsche's Björn Waldegård drove his 911 S to victory at the Monte Carlo Rally, the Swedish Rally and the Österreichische Alpenfahrt. With Porsche leading Alpine-Renault by only three points before the season-ending RAC Rally, the championship went down to the wire. Alpine-Renault recruited Ove Andersson for the event, but he had an accident and retired. Alpine-Renault's best result was then Andrew Cowan's fifth place, and Porsche took the title. Porsche's Gérard Larrousse also picked up a point for sixth place. 
In 1971, Alpine-Renault ran away with the title as Andersson won four of the eight events in the Alpine A110 1600. The Alpine-Renault, driven by Bernard Darniche, also won the last-ever Coupe des Alpes, but because the event ran with an insufficient number of starters (36 when the FIA minimum was 50), no points were awarded towards the championship.
The final IMC title went to Lancia. The Fulvia 1.6 Coupé HF was driven by Simo Lampinen (35 points), Harry Källström (22) Sandro Munari (20) and Amilcare Ballestrieri (20). Fiat finished second in the standings with their 124 Sport Spider.

Beecher's Handmade Cheese

Beecher's Handmade Cheese is an artisan cheesemaker and retail shop based in the Pike Place Market, Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.. The company was founded by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003, and was opened in the Pike Place Market after Dammeier obtained a storefront lease in the Market, which are rarely available. Because Dammeier had never been a cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.
Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses pasteurized milk and operates a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard flavor of the milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.
Beecher's Pike Place Market cheese-making facility includes a café, which serves grilled cheese and other items, and a retail shop, which sells both Beecher's cheeses and others brands from local Pacific Northwest cheesemakers. The New York location is a much larger space. In addition to the production facility, café, and retail space, it also has a full-service restaurant downstairs referred to as The Cellar. Beecher's also manufactures and sells macaroni and cheese dishes (and other frozen sides), which have received praise in reviews from the national news media. Dammeier and his firm's cheeses have been featured on national television, including twice on "The Martha Stewart Show" and once on Oprah, with the "World's Best" Macaroni and Cheese featured as one of Oprah's "Favorite Things." A cookbook by Dammeier, "Pure Flavor: 125 Fresh All-American Recipes From The Pacific Northwest", has been published, and incorporates recipes used to make various Beecher's products and dishes. In addition to their various business endeavors, Beecher's sponsors the Flagship foundation and Pure Food Kids project, an educational program to teach children in the Seattle public schools system about healthful diets.
Founding and history.
Before founding Beecher's, Dammeier had never made cheese, and had little direct knowledge of the cheese making business. His self-described "passion" for cheese began during his childhood in Tacoma, Washington, where his family always kept a cheese board piled high with local cheeses. Raised in a family business involving printing and food manufacturing, he decided to open a cheese business after his family sold the printing company. He named it for his great-grandfather, Beecher McKenzie. Dammeier also owns the Seattle-based specialty grocer Pasta & Co. and is a major investor in Pyramid Breweries, Inc.; other members of his family have stakes in Pyramid as well. Dammeier also founded Bennett's Pure Food Bistro on nearby Mercer Island, and the food truck Maximus/Minimus, both of which carry many dishes prepared with Beecher's products. In 2003, Dammeier opened Beecher's in Seattle's Pike Place Market when a rare large retail location became available in the market after the nursery Molbak's closed its Market location and moved to its current Woodinville, Washington property.
After taking a cheese making course at Washington State University, Dammeier decided he needed to hire someone to work with him as chief cheesemaker. He hired Brad Sinko, a microbiologist, who previously had managed his family cheese business of Bandon Cheese in Oregon, before it was acquired by the Tillamook County Creamery Association. According to Dammeier, the artisanal cheese market was underrepresented in Seattle and Washington, and he opened his business in part to encourage more cheese business to grow in the region. In 2000, Washington had nine licensed cheesemakers; this expanded to twenty-eight by 2007. Dammeier compared the growth he expects in artisan cheese to the United States' recent growth in sales of specialty beers:
"If you said the word 'Porter' 20 years ago, no one in the U.S. would have had any idea you were talking about beer. Twenty years from now, people will know what a washed rind is."
Thanks to financing from Dammeier's other business ventures, Beecher's had the ability to build up their operations slowly, absorbing the costs of capitalization of the business while experimenting with their cheeses, including the time to age them. "The first vat," remarked Dammeier, "we threw away. The second vat was really good." As their work progressed Sinko would adjust the formulas of their cheese processing, the cultures, and the enzymes involved, and increased the average aging time for their Flagship brand to 18 months. However, they only publicly claim 12 months of aging. In their first year of operation, Beecher's had no aged product of their own to sell, instead building up an inventory of of cheese. During that same time, their primary sales were of fresh cheese curds.
Milk supplies.
After their initial founding with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system has had to expand several times to include more suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's was in the process of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases them back to the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.
To ensure a standardized flavor for the finished cheeses, and due to there being insufficient space in their facilities for milk separating systems, Sinko said he "went and standardized the herd." Their initial milk from Holstein cows was sweet, but lacked the fatty content and nuttiness of Jersey cow milk that was part of the product they wanted to create. They were able to eventually balance the two to their satisfaction. Dammeier has described the blend of Holstein and Jersey milk as a "50–50 mix". From each farm, all the milk supplied to Beecher's is from the same herd, to ensure that the flavor of each batch of milk they receive is consistent (based on the herd's diet and environment).
At times, Beecher's has encountered challenges in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, the cows there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves to fight off bacteria, but changed the flavor of the milk.
Cheese and food manufacturing.
The cheese factory is housed in a small, glass-walled facility in Seattle's Pike Place Market, on Pike Place between Stewart Street and Pine Street. The location includes a retail shop and a café that features cheese-based meals. Passers-by in the heavily touristed market can watch the cheese making process. Beecher's produces over of cheese annually. Their manufacturing facility now operates twenty-four hours a day to keep up with their demand. The New York facility is significantly larger than Seattle's and can produce over three tons of cheese a day.
Sinko admits that the modern facility with large vats of cheese and milk processing would seem to contradict the word "Handmade" in the company name. According to him, all of the cheese is monitored, processed, and prepared by hand, but simply on a larger scale than most artisanal cheesemakers. Unlike most artisan cheeses, Beecher's is made largely with pasteurized milk. Dammeier believes that many people feel raw milk cheeses taste better due to renowned French cheeses, which were historically made of raw milk because the farms were unable to afford pasteurization. "I've probably tasted 150 different cheeses this year, and I'm convinced that raw milk doesn't create more flavor," he said, adding that his cheeses have a more consistent taste from not using raw milk. Nevertheless, Beecher's offers a raw milk version of their Flagship cheese. The cheeses they produce use no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Beecher's typically manufactures up to nine different varieties of cheeses each year, including a combination of their staple brands and various seasonal varieties.
At the Beecher's facility, their process for cheese manufacturing is multi-staged. Thousands of gallons of milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a coagulant, are added to the developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. "A variation of half a degree the pasteurization process can change the flavor of the cheese," he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel "rakes" to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese.
Beecher's cheeses differ from similar cheeses in that they mix cheese growth cultures in unusual ways. For example, their signature "Flagship" cheese includes cultures typically used for non-cheddar cheeses, such as Gruyère and Emmental, changing the nature, flavor, and texture of their cheddar. Flagship cheese is produced using a cheddaring process, but owing to a different taste, Beecher's does not call this cheese cheddar. The cheese has been described as having a "sweet finish and creamy texture" unlike the tangier cheddars, owing to this being one of the cheeses they create with a mixture of different cheese cultures. After being prepared in blocks and aged for approximately one year, the Flagship—unlike cheddars—lacks a rind, is moister, resembles butter visually, and carries a milky aroma due to being aged in plastic bags. A variant called "Flagship Reserve" is aged in cheese cloth in sizes on racks in open air, and is rubbed with butter while being turned daily. This preparation method causes the Reserve to lose up to 12% of its initial weight by the time it is completed. The Reserve is aged for a shorter amount of time, leading to a sharper, nuttier taste and texture, according to "Food & Wine" Magazine. Of the of cheese they produce annually, approximately will be Flagship, and only will be Flagship Reserve.
Additionally, Beecher's is in the process of developing new types of crackers, designed to not overpower the taste of the cheese with which they are paired.
Retail sales and cheese shop.
Beecher's features a gourmet cheese shop and café in both their Pike Place Market and Flatiron facility. It is considered an anchor of the Pike Place Market, and has become a tourist attraction in its own right. During the day, crowds typically gather in the store, watching through windows as the cheesemakers prepare batches of cheese.
A portion of the cheese curds used in the manufacturing process is set aside to sell directly to visitors at the retail store. The principal cheeses created and sold by Beecher's are their Flagship and Flagship Reserve varieties; "Just Jack", a form of Monterey Jack cheese; "Blank Slate", a type of cream cheese; unpasteurized, raw-milk versions of their Flagship cheeses, and different cheeses seasoned and flavored with spices and herbs. Some of their seasonal varieties have included cheeses similar to Brie.
The Pike Place Market store now sells roughly thirty-five other local artisan cheese brands, in addition to the various Beecher's products. The Pike Place Market location also offers classes to the public about cheese making, cheese history, and the pairing of wine with cheese. The collection of Pacific Northwest cheeses on sale at the retail store has been described as the best in the entire region by Will O'Donnell in "Northwest Magazine". In keeping with Dammeier's idea that his cheese business should encourage the growth of the artisan cheese businesses in the area, the Beecher's retail store makes special efforts to feature and sell cheeses from new and small Northwest cheesemakers. The Flatiron location incorporates the Northwest influence its cheesecase, but carries a significant number of Northeast artisinal cheeses.
Beecher's products are sold in retail stores throughout the country at well-known artisanal cheese vendors such as the shops of Murray Klein and the international Artisanal Cheese retail company. Beecher's also uses the services of PeriShip to ensure their products arrive to customers across the United States.
Macaroni and cheese.
Beecher's retail shop in the Pike Place Market sells over 17,000 orders of Dammeier's macaroni and cheese dish annually. The recipe is featured in a 2007 cookbook, "Pure Flavor: 125 Fresh All-American Recipes From The Pacific Northwest", which Dammeier wrote with Laura Holmes Haddad. Both "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" gave it reviews described as "rave", according to MSNBC news. Dammeier says the key to the success of their macaroni and cheese is to undercook the pasta by half, so that it softens from cheese sauces in baking with a béchamel sauce. The recipe, named simply "World's Best Mac & Cheese", has been prepared by Dammeier during guest appearances on several television programs. On August 19, 2008, Beecher's facility and cheese was featured on "The Martha Stewart Show", and Dammeier prepared his macaroni and cheese dish with Stewart on the program. The "World's Best Mac & Cheese" was also featured as one of Oprah's "Favorite Things," and a second time on "The Martha Stewart Show."
Awards and recognition.
In 2007, Beecher's was the winner of the American Cheese Society awards for their cheddar cheese. At the World Cheese Awards in 2007, Beecher's "Marco Polo" cheese won a gold medal, and at the American Cheesemaker Awards in Newport Beach, California, they took first place, also in 2007. Beecher's also came in as the runner up for Best In Show at the 2007 World Cheese Society competition, in a field of 1,207 competitors. Beecher's again won a top award from the American Cheese Society for their Marco Polo cheese in 2008. According to Laura Werlin, author of "The New American Cheese: Profiles of America's Great Cheesemakers", their Flagship cheese is "everything a cheddar should be - and more."
Pure Food Kids.
Beecher's and Dammeier also fund and develop "Pure Food Kids: A Recipe for Healthy Eating", an outreach and educational program, run by the Flagship Foundation, for elementary and middle-school children in the Seattle Public Schools, with the goal of teaching children about healthful foods and eating habits. The program was initially developed by Dammeier and his wife Leslie, after they learned about and were unhappy with the state of school cafeteria meals in Seattle, where their three children attended public school. Established in 2005, 1% of the total sales for Beecher's and Dammeier's other business, Bennet's Pure Food, Maximus/Minimus, and Pasta & Co., are used to fund the Pure Food Kids program. The Pure Food Kids program is staffed by trained volunteers, including Dammeier himself.
Fourth through sixth grade elementary school children are educated on the effects of food additives, eating healthful foods, reading food labels, and about marketing of food aimed at children. According to Chip Wood, co-founder of the Northeast Foundation for Children, fourth through sixth grade children will typically be between the ages of 9 and 12 years old. The program is provided at no cost to the children and their families. To date, over 15,000 children have participated in the educational program. Pure Food Kids is taught in classrooms, after-school events, and at Parent-Teacher Association events, with all supplies and materials provided by Beecher's, although there is explicitly no promotion or use of any products from any of Dammeier's businesses.

Nannopterygius

Nannopterygius (meaning ″small wing/flipper″ in Greek) is a genus of ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur that lived in the Middle to Late Jurassic (Callovian to Tithonian stages). Fossils have been found in England and Germany. The first specimen was found in the Kimmeridgian Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset, UK and described by Hulke in 1871, who named it "Ichthyosaurus enthekiodon". A year earlier, Hulke had described some remains from the same horizon and locality that he thought were ichthyosaurian, naming them "Enthekiodon" (no species given). These are now lost, but Hulke considered them sufficiently similar to demote the name to species level. In 1922, Huene separated this species into the new genus "Nannopterygius", named for the small fore- and hindpaddles.

Japan–Turkey relations

Japanese–Turkish relations are foreign relations between Japan and Turkey. Japan has an embassy in Ankara and a consulate-general in Istanbul. Turkey has an embassy in Tokyo.
History.
Relations between the two countries started in the 19th century. A foundational event was the Ertuğrul incident in 1890. The Turkish frigate Ertuğrul sank off the coast of Wakayama, Japan, after having an audience with Emperor Meiji. The surviving sailors were taken back to Istanbul by two Japanese frigates. 
In 1985, this gesture of kindness was reciprocated during the Iran-Iraq war. As hostilities escalated to an extent that all aircraft were threatened with being shot-down, Turkey sent an aircraft in to rescue 215 Japanese nationals who were living in Tehran at the time. The Turkish government issued a statement: "We have not forgotten the rescue of the sailors of the Ertuğrul. Thus, once we heard there were Japanese citizens in need of help, we went to their rescue." 
Following the founding of the Republic of Turkey, diplomatic relations were established in 1924 and first embassies were opened in 1925.
Japan was also involved in a plot with Young Turk exiles to set up a puppet state in Central Asia with a former Ottoman Prince as its monarch in the 1930s. During the Kumul Rebellion some Japanese secret agents were captured.
2010 marked the 120th anniversary of Turko-Japanese relations. In this year, Turkey held the "Japan Year 2010 in Turkey." On July 10, 2010, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, cousin of the emperor, attended the opening ceremony of the Kaman Kalehöyük Archaeological Museum. The museum was built with funding from Japan. The prince has often engaged himself actively to promote Japanese-Turkish relations.
Political relations.
Turkey and Japan are both members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Also Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and Japan is an observer.
There are 10,000 Turkish citizens living in Japan, constituting an important aspect of Turkey's relations with Japan.

John Buster

John Edmond Buster (born July 18, 1941) working at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, directed the research team that performed history's first embryo transfer from one woman to another resulting in a live birth. It was performed at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, reported in July 1983, and led to the announcement of the first human birth February 3, 1984. In the procedure, an embryo that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.
This scientific breakthrough established standards and became an agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women who did not want to pass on genetic disorders to their children. Donor embryo transfer has given women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will contain their husband’s genetic makeup. Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 10% of in vitro fertilization recorded births. 
Prior to this, thousands of women who were infertile, had adoption as the only path to parenthood. This set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer. This breakthrough has given way to the donation of human embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which impacted the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health. 
Buster and other members of the UCLA research team were featured on, The Today Show, NBC News, Good Morning America, Oprah Winfrey, Phil Donahue and showcased in leading print publications such as the New York Times, New York Times Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, People Magazine, and Time Magazine. 
This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human oocyte and embryo donation, a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years. Building upon Buster's research and since the initial birth announcement in 1984, well over 200,000 live births resulting from donor embryo transfer have been and continue to be recorded by the Centers for Disease Control(CDC) in the United States to infertile women, who otherwise would not have had children by any other existing method.
For this work and in addition to a number of groundbreaking medical advancements in women's health, notably in the field of reproductive medicine Buster received the Legends Award in May 2012. "Legends" are selected based upon their internationally recognized contributions to medicine through research and innovative clinical practice. It was awarded by The Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute (LA BioMed or LABioMed) located at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.
Education.
Buster attended Stanford University for his undergraduate degree and earned both his medical degree and residency training in obstetrics and gynecology from the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, where he later completed fellowship training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility.
Career.
Buster is a highly experienced physician who has dedicated almost four decades of his career to research, private practice, and the teaching of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. He is Board Certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the subspecialty of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility with special expertise and international recognition for his contributions in preimplantation embryology, early pregnancy loss, female hormone replacement, and infertility.
Buster currently serves in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island and also in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.
He is engaged full time in the private practice and in clinical teaching of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility in both institutions. He continues to participate and consult in numerous clinical research programs.
As an academician, Buster has held positions as professor of obstetrics and gynecology and served as director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at UCLA School of Medicine, the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
Research.
Buster's forty years of research and clinical practice in reproductive medicine include numerous published studies in steroid physiology, pre-implantation embryology, pregnancy loss, and menopausal hormone replacement therapy.
Buster is a leading researcher in female sexual dysfunction (FSD), a continuum of psychosexual disorders centered on loss of sexual desire with interrelated problems of arousal, orgasm, and sexual pain. Buster has recently outlined awareness and treatment for sexual dysfunction for both the physician and post-menopausal woman. 
Buster authored "Sex and the 50-Something Woman: Strategies for Restoring Satisfaction" in the professional journal of Contemporary Obstetrics and Gynecology. The intent was to explain the various causes of what is called female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and the simple interventions obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care physicians can recommend. The article attracted national interest with stories appearing in local media, creating greater awareness for the treatment and open dialogue for woman. 
One of Buster's earliest research studies focused on steroid hormone radioimmunoassay (RIA). He reported an RIA for the androgen prohormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), the direct measurement of which was shown to be possible in un-extracted serum. Refined versions of his methodology are used today in the diagnosis and management of androgen excess disorders in women.
Buster's development of a simple nonchromatographic RIA to measure un-conjugated estriol in pregnancy serum led to more refined versions of this method that are used today in the early diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities in mid-trimester pregnant women. He also described for the first time the simultaneous progression of multiple androgens, progestins, and estrogens concentrations in maternal blood throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy and into the onset of labor.
In the early 1980s, over a period of 4 years, at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, Buster and his team developed a revolutionary technique based on in-vivo fertilization and uterine lavage – a method adapted from the commercialization of bovine embryo transfer in the cattle industry – as a means to transfer human blastocysts from fertile woman donors to ovulating or agonadal infertile recipient women (6) Specifically, the group developed a simple office procedure in which blastocyst, which had been deliberately created from in vivo fertilization in the donor’s body using infertile recipient’s husband sperm, were transferred to produce pregnancy in an infertile recipient woman. In February 1984, the historical first live birth, followed 3 months later by a second live birth, resulted from these techniques and was reported by Buster and his team. 
A University of California at Los Angeles team, under Buster's direction, contemporaneous with a group from Northwestern University, published findings on the first case series of ectopic pregnancies (outside the uterus) treated successfully with methotrexate, a cancer chemotherapy agent. This approach became widely accepted in the 1990s and continues to save thousands of women from major surgery customarily associated with ectopic pregnancy, a dangerous and potentially fatal complication of human reproduction.
More recently, Buster helped develop a testosterone delivery system for women researched by Procter & Gamble. It is now marketed in Europe under the brand name Intrinsa. The product – a trans-dermal patch – is designed to deliver chemically identical testosterone directly into the micro vascular circulation-much like an artificial endocrine organ. Buster was lead investigator in a major study that demonstrated the effectiveness of this patch to treat decreased sexual desire in oophorectomised, postmenopausal women (13). These patches are in use outside of the United States to treat hypoactive sexual desire in women who are deficient of androgens.
Most recently, Buster served as lead investigator in another major study demonstrating the effectiveness of an estradiol mist, which has pharmacology similar to those of a trans-dermal estrogen patches (14). Sold in the United States by TherRx Corporation under the name Evamist, the spray offers additional margins of safety and convenience over traditional oral and patch-administered estrogen's. Evamist won FDA approval in 2007. Buster's Phase III Study for Evamist was published in the Journal, Obstetrics & Gynecology, in June 2008.

Coronation Ode

Coronation Ode, Op 44 is a work composed by Edward Elgar for soprano, contralto, tenor and bass soloists, chorus and orchestra, with words by A. C. Benson.
It was written for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902, and dedicated "by Special Permission, to His Most Gracious Majesty King Edward VII". But the Coronation was postponed due to the King being ill, so the first performance was not until 2 October 1902 at the Sheffield Festival, by the Sheffield Choir, soloists Agnes Nicholls, Muriel Foster, John Coates and David Ffrangcon Davies, with Elgar conducting. The first London performance was at Covent Garden on 26 October 1902.
There are six parts:
History.
Queen Victoria died in January 1901 and preparations for the coronation of her son King Edward VII were soon under way. Late that year the Covent Garden Grand Opera Syndicate commissioned Elgar to write a work to be premiered at a Royal gala on the eve of the Coronation which was planned for July of the next year. Elgar himself invited A. C. Benson (perhaps at the instance of the King) to provide the libretto: Benson was a musician as well as a writer, and the collaboration was close and successful.
The King suggested to Elgar that words could be provided to the "Trio" section of the first Pomp and Circumstance March, which he liked: Elgar took up the King's suggestion and asked Benson to provide words so that the tune could form the climax of the "Ode".
Elgar began writing in February 1902 and by the end of March he had finished the vocal score, which at that time consisted of parts I, III, IV, V and VI. Benson then realised that there needed to be a song referring to Queen Alexandra, and added ""Daughter of ancient Kings"" which Elgar reluctantly placed after ""Crown the King"", as he had wanted to follow that with ""Britain, ask of thyself"".
The publishers, Booseys, realising its popularity, asked Elgar to revise ""Land of hope and glory"" so it could be produced as a separate song, and this was in fact sung by Clara Butt with great success at a "Coronation Concert" a week before the "Ode" was first performed in London.
The work was published for five royal occasions:

Praja Rajyam Party

Praja Rajyam (Telugu: ప్రజా రాజ్యం translation: "People's Rule") was a regional political party in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, founded by Telugu cinema actor Chiranjeevi on 26 August 2008.On 6 February 2011, it was officially announced that the party would be merging into the Indian National Congress. As announced, it was formally merged with Indian National Congress in August 2011.
History.
Chiranjeevi's foray into politics had been highly anticipated in media and political circles.
While it was reported that he was seeking the opinions of the people during the latter half of 2007, the media also suggested that he would announce the decision in January 2008.
He launched his political party as an alternative to the ruling Indian National Congress and Telugu Desam Party in his native state of Andhra Pradesh. PRP merged with the Indian National Congress on 20 August 2011.
Party Formation.
The first public meeting was held by Chiranjeevi on 26 August 2008, at Tirupati. He addressed a gathering of about a million people and announced the party name and its agenda. The party flag, which has white colour making up 3/4 of the height at the top, and the bottom 1/4 filled with green, was unveiled at the meeting. In the middle of the flag a red coloured sun symbol is encircled with a yellow line.
The green color is an "acknowledgement to the farmers", red symbolizes "change and revolution", the yellow border around the sun symbolizes "happiness in every home", white symbolizes "clean governance and transparency", and the sun in the middle emphasizes the need for change and revolution.
Merger with NTP.
The Nava Telangana Party headed by former minister Devender Goud was merged with the Praja rajyam Party. NTP was a political entity campaigning for Telangana State formation, and had a strong base in the Telangana Region of Andhra Pradesh. Post-merger, Goud was made the Vice-President of Praja Rajyam Party. 
Chiranjeevi at one time expressed his support for the efforts to forge a "Fourth Front" at the national level.
2009 Election.
They won 18 out of a possible 294 assembly seats. The party leader, Chiranjeevi contested in two assembly seats - Tirupathi and Palakollu (West Godavari District) - and won in Tirupathi. It polled 18% votes, which is considerable for a debut. The entry of PRP made a huge vote split between the existing major parties like Congress and TDP .
Merger into Congress Party.
On 6 February 2011, PRP chief Chiranjeevi announced that his party would merged with the Congress party after a meeting with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. The merger was proposed by A.K. Antony, Minister of Defence. He stated that he had originally been compelled to create the PRP on a platform of fighting corruption and ensuring social justice due to the "rampant corruption" of the Congress government of the late chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy ("YSR"), but that Congress now had a good record of fighting corruption elsewhere.
It was asserted by political observers that Chiranjeevi's move may have been prompted by his loss of support in the wake of his own strong anti-Telangana stance in previous months. It was argued in the press that Chiranjeevi's move would particularly strengthen Congress' hand in retaining the Kapu (caste) vote, as the PRP had done particularly well among them.

Perigrapha munda

The Twin-spotted Quaker ("Perigrapha munda") is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae. The wings are gray, with two closely approximate and very conspicuous dark spots on the disc of the fore wings. a small dark apical mark at the costal edge and a discal spot on the fuscous hindwings. It is found in Palearctic ecozone (All Europe (absent only in the North and in the South), Russia, Asia as far east as Japan).
The wingspan is 38–44 mm. The moth flies from March to May depending on the location.
The larvae feed on Oak, Willow, "Populus tremula", "Fraxinus excelsior", "Acer campestre", "Humulus lupulus" and Honeysuckle.
The nectar-feeding adults visit sallow blossom.
Variation.
"Perigrapha munda" is variable both in colour and markings and there are many named forms. The forewing colouration is from light ochreous brown through to dark ochreous. The stigmata are not well defined and the subterminal line is often faint and reduced to two black median dots. The crosslines are not always well defined in darker forms. The discal spot in the hindwings are is not always clearly defined.There is an isolated subspecies on Taiwan

Past clients included Henrique Capriles, Venezuela’s opposition leader; President Alvaro Uribe (his fourth presidential client in Colombia); and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil. His expertise in the region has made him a sought-out voice on Latin American political issues and regional reputational risks. He is a frequent guest as political analyst for television shows around the region as well as US-based Spanish language networks Univision and Telemundo.
In September 2009, Schechter's firm signed a four-month contract with the interim Honduran government of Roberto Micheletti to provide public relations services following the June 28, 2009 coup d'état in this country. According to Foreign Agents Registration filings with the US Department of Justice, the firm received over $292,000 to boost the interim regime's image in the US. The contract put Schechter's firm in the spotlight and sparked letters of condemnation. On October 19, 2009 a protest took place in front of the firm's Washington, DC office in response to its work on behalf of the interim Honduran government.
Schechter is also a Virginia goat farmer, a co-owner and board member with superstar chef José Andrés of five successful Washington restaurants (including prize-winning Jaleo and Zaytinya), a co-proprietor of Agur Winery in Israel, and a critically acclaimed author.
Schechter published his first novel, Point of Entry, in 2006. The Washington Post called it “fast moving.” The Chicago Tribune said it is “as good as this kind of writing gets.” The St. Louis Post Dispatch said the plot is “why-didn’t I think-of-that-clever.” Newsweek called it “a rip-roaring novel about terrorism, nuclear plots and presidential dating.” The Boston Globe declared it “entertaining.” His second book, Pipeline, was published in 2009.
In addition to his work at the Atlantic Council, Schechter is an adjunct professor at The George Washington University in DC and a visiting professor at Ben Gurion University’s Faculty of Business and Management. He also serves on BGU’s Board of Governors. 
Peter Schechter lives in Washington, DC with his Spanish wife Rosa and two daughters Alia and Marina.

Springfield Park (London)

Springfield Park is a park in Upper Clapton in the London Borough of Hackney in north London. The park was formed in 1905 from the grounds of three private houses, one of which still survives as a cafe. It is a Local Nature Reserve.
Topography and environs.
The park occupies and slopes from the high ground on the edge of Stamford Hill to the towpath of the River Lee Navigation on the River Lea. Situated on the other side of the river/navigation to the park is Springfield Marina, a large basin for narrow boats. The park is also adjacent to the Lea Rowing Club and Springhill Sports Ground, which is used by Hackney Rugby Club.
The higher ground of the park affords views over Walthamstow Marshes to Walthamstow and north east London.
History.
The Georgian Springfield House stands near the main entance to the park on a road known simply as Springfield. It was a private residence well before the surroundings were given over to housing in the mid-Victorian period. The park area remained intact as a private estate until 1902 when the house and land went up for sale. A group of local businessmen saved the park when it went up for auction and eventually the London County Council took over responsibility for the park and it opened to the public on 5 August 1905.
As well as Springfield House, there were two other large houses on the estate, 'Springhill House' and 'The Chestnuts'. They had to be demolished due to their deteriorating condition when the council took them over. A road called Spring Lane ran through the estate but this was re-routed along the Lee and now forms part of the tow-path walk.
Facilities.
Sports facilities include five tennis courts, a bowling green and grounds for rugby, cricket and other sports on the wide flat area by the river. The park is home to Hackney Rugby Club, and planning has begun on a replacement for the rugby side's clubhouse, which was burnt down in April 1999. The Spark Cafe is housed in Springfield House, now known locally as the White House Mansion. Near the house is a large conservatory which was open to the public but has since been closed. There is a large pond and ornamental gardens with fountains and a children's playground as well as a bandstand.
The Capital Ring, a circular walking route around London, passes through the park on the section from Stoke Newington to Hackney Wick, and the distinctive green signs can be seen in the park. Another walking route, the Lea Valley Walk, is close by and can be accessed via the River Lee towpath.
The park received a Green Flag award in July 2008.
Springfield Park Community Orchard.
This small project contains varieties of local apple trees, including examples rescued from Hackney gardens. There is also a medlar tree and an olive tree.

Princess Charming

Princess Charming is an operetta by composer Albert Szirmai. It was first presented in Hungarian in Budapest as "Alexandra". The English libretto by Arthur Wimperis and Lauri Wylie is based on the Hungarian libretto by Franz Martos. The story concerns a young princess who accepts a proposal of marriage from the elderly king of a neighboring country as protection against an uprising by her own subjects. Captain Torrelli, a military officer sent by the king, fears imminent danger to the princess and marries her himself. The officer then escorts her to his king for an annulment, but the couple fall in love and elope. 
The operetta premiered in London in 1926 and was revived on Broadway and elsewhere. A 1934 film adaptation was made.
Productions.
The operetta premiered on London's West End on 21 October 1926. It ran for a very successful 362 performances at the Palace Theatre. The production starred Winnie Melville as Princess Elaine of Novia, John Clarke as Captain Torrelli, W. H. Berry as Albert Chuff, Alice Delysia as Countess Wanda Navaro and George Grossmith, Jr. as King Christian II of Sylvania. It was produced by Robert Courtneidge. The production then toured in Britain. 
After a rewrite of the book by Jack Donahue, with additional lyrics by producer Arthur Swanstrom and additional music by Arthur Schwartz, the work was presented on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on October 13, 1930, closing after 56 performances on November 29, 1930. The production starred Jeanne Aubert as Wanda Navarro, Grossmith as King Christian II of Elyria, and Victor Moore as Irving Huff. Two up-and-coming entertainers were in smaller roles, Howard St. John as the king's aid and Ernest McChesney as the second footman. 
The show was also produced by the J. C. Williamson company in Australia. It was adapted as a film in 1934, starring Grossmith, Yvonne Arnaud, Evelyn Laye, Max Miller and Cecil Parker.
Critical response.
The "Time Magazine" review noted "The fact that it has sparkle and distinction is almost entirely attributable to blithe, blonde, beauteous Jeanne Aubert. As the Princess, Evelyn Herbert ... is luscious-looking, hits good rich notes but experiences difficulty in making the lyrics intelligible."
Steven Suskin wrote that the operetta "was not especially distinguished, though it contained one song hit – the snappy, interpolated 'I Love Love'".

Off the Wall (album)

Off the Wall is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It was released on August 10, 1979 by Epic Records following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in "The Wiz". While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson wrote three of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death in 2009.
The record was a departure from Jackson's previous work for Motown. Several critics observed that "Off the Wall" was crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained positive reviews and won the singer his first Grammy Award since the early 1970s. With "Off the Wall", Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the "Billboard" Hot 100. The album was a commercial success; to date it is certified for 8× Multi-Platinum in the US and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.
On October 16, 2001, a special edition reissue of "Off the Wall" was released by Sony Records. Recent reviews by AllMusic and "Blender" have continued to praise "Off the Wall" for its appeal in the 21st century. In 2003, the album was ranked number 68 on "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The National Association of Recording Merchandisers listed it at number 80 of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. In 2008, "Off the Wall" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
Background.
Starting in 1972, Michael Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them "Got to Be There" and "Ben". These were released as part of The Jackson 5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as "Got to Be There", "Ben" and a remake of Bobby Day's "Rockin' Robin". The Jackson 5's sales, however, began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input. Although the group scored several top 40 hits, including the top five disco single "Dancing Machine" and the top 20 hit "I Am Love", The Jackson 5 (minus Jermaine Jackson) left Motown in 1975. The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with CBS Records in June 1975, first joining the Philadelphia International Records division and then Epic Records. As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons. After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. From 1976 to 1984, Michael Jackson was the lead songwriter of the group, writing or co-writing such hits as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", "This Place Hotel" and "Can You Feel It".
In 1978, Jackson starred as Scarecrow in the film musical "The Wiz". The musical scores were arranged by Quincy Jones, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album "Off the Wall". Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part. Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from "The Wiz", and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr. Critics panned "The Wiz" upon its October 1978 release. Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed "genuine acting talent" and "provided the only genuinely memorable moments." Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: "I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't". In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on "The Wiz" was "my greatest experience so far...I'll never forget that".
Production.
When Jackson began the "Off the Wall" project he was not sure what he wanted as the final result. However he did not want another record that sounded like The Jacksons. He wanted more creative freedom, something he had not been allowed on prior albums. Jones and Jackson jointly produced "Off the Wall", whose songwriters included Jackson, Heatwave's Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney. All sessions took place at Los Angeles County-based recording studios. Rhythm tracks and vocals were recorded at Allen Zentz Recording, the horn section's contributions took place at Westlake Audio, and string instrumentation was recorded at Cherokee Studios in West Hollywood. Following the initial sessions, audio mixing was handled by Grammy-winning engineer Bruce Swedien at Westlake Audio, after which the original tapes went to the A&M Recording Studio, also located in L.A., for mastering. Swedien would later mix the recording sessions for Jackson's next album and his most well-known work, 1982's "Thriller". Jones recalled that, at first, he found Jackson to be very introverted, shy and non-assertive.
"She's Out of My Life" was written for Jones by Tom Bahler three years prior. Jackson heard and enjoyed it, and Jones allowed him to use it on the record. Jones called in Heatwave's keyboardist Rod Temperton to write three songs. The intention was for Jackson and Jones to select one of his songs, but Jackson, liking them all, included all of them in the final cut. Jackson stayed up all night to learn the lyrics to these songs instead of singing from a sheet. He finished the vocals to these three Temperton songs in two recording sections. Temperton took a different approach to his song writing after spending some time researching the background to Jackson's music style. Temperton mixed his traditional harmony segments with the idea of adding shorter note melodies to suit Jackson's aggressive style. Jackson wrote "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" after humming a melody in his kitchen. After listening to hundreds of songs, Jackson and Jones decided upon a batch to record. In hindsight, Jones believed they took a lot of risks in the production of "Off the Wall" and the final choice of album tracks. Attention was also paid to the album cover, which shows Jackson smiling, wearing a tuxedo and trademark socks. His manager stated, "The tuxedo was the overall plan for the "Off the Wall" project and package. The tuxedo was our idea, the socks were Michael'".
Music and vocals.
Music critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Stephen Holden of AllMusic observed that "Off the Wall" was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soul, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads. Prominent examples include the ballad "She's Out of My Life", and the two disco tunes "Workin' Day and Night" and "Get on the Floor". "I Can't Help It" is a jazz piece. In Quincy Jones' autobiography, he compares Jackson to other jazz singers noting that Jackson "has some of the same qualities as the great jazz singers I'd worked with: Ella, Sinatra, Sassy, Aretha, Ray Charles, Dinah. Each of them had that purity, that strong signature sound and that open wound that pushed them to greatness." "She's Out of My Life" is a melodic pop ballad. The end of the former song showed an "emotional" Jackson crying as the track concluded. Of the song R&B writer Nelson George proclaimed, " became a Jackson signature similar to the way "My Way" served Frank Sinatra. The vulnerability, verging on fragility that would become embedded in Michael's persona found, perhaps, its richest expression in this wistful ballad". "Rock with You" is a romantic, mid-tempo song. The album's songs have a tempo ranging from 66 beats per minute on "She's Out of My Life", to 128 on "Workin' Day and Night".
With the arrival of "Off the Wall" in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine described him as a "blindingly gifted vocalist". At the time, "Rolling Stone" compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder. Their analysis was also that "Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly". John Randall Taraborrelli expressed the opinion that Jackson sings with "sexy falsetto" vocals in "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".
Release.
Writer, journalist and biographer John Randall Taraborrelli stated, "Fans and industry peers alike were left with their mouths agape when "Off the Wall" was issued to the public. Fans proclaimed that they hadn't heard him sing with such joy and abandon since the early Jackson 5 days". On July 28, 1979, "Off the Wall"'s first single, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", was released. It peaked atop the "Billboard" Hot 100 and reached number three in the UK. On November 3, 1979 the second single from the album, "Rock with You" was released, again it peaked atop the "Billboard" Hot 100.
In February, the album's title track was released as a single and went to number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and became a top 10 hit in four countries. "She's Out of My Life", also reaching number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in June. Thus "Off the Wall" became the first album by a solo artist to generate four US top 10 hits. Today, "Off the Wall" is certified 8× Multi-Platinum in the US for shipments of eight million units and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album's success lead to the start of a 9-year partnership between Jackson and Jones, their next collaboration would be "Thriller", which is the world's best selling album of all time.
Reception.
"Off the Wall" was hailed as a major breakthrough for Jackson, while receiving critical recognition, along with praises, from major music publications. In a 1979 review of the album, "Rolling Stone" magazine contributor Stephen Holden praised Jackson's maturity and transition from his early Motown material, while calling the album a "slick, sophisticated R&B-pop showcase with a definite disco slant". Holden went on to compare Jackson to Stevie Wonder, another Motown performer who began recording at a young age and gained critical acclaim for his transition.
Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a positive (A) grade believing that "Off the Wall" was "the dance groove of the year" and the album presented Jackson as a grown up. In a review for "Melody Maker" Phil McNeill expressed the opinion that in "Off the Wall" Jackson sounded comfortable, confident and in control. He believed "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" had a "classy" introduction and that it was the best song on the album. He also praised "Rock with You", describing it as "masterful". The reviewer concurred with a colleague that Jackson was "probably the best singer in the world right now in terms of style and technique". Giving the album a favorable review in "Smash Hits", David Hepworth said that Jackson "sings like an angel".
In 1980, Jackson won three awards at the American Music Awards for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Male Soul/R&B Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Single (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"). That year, he also won "Billboard" Music Awards for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"). Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt "Off the Wall" should have made a much bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In particular, Jackson was disappointed that he had won only a single Grammy Award at the 1980 Grammys, a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". Jackson stated that "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again".
Legacy.
On October 16, 2001, a special edition reissue of "Off the Wall" was released by Sony Records. The material found strong praise from critics more than 20 years after the original release. AllMusic gave the record a five star review, praising the record's disco-tinged funk and mainstream pop blend, along with Jackson's songwriting and Jones' crafty production. The publication believed, "["Off the Wall"] is an enormously fresh record, one that remains vibrant and giddily exciting years after its release".
In recent years "Blender" gave the record a full five star review stating that it was, "A blockbuster party LP that looked beyond funk to the future of dance music, and beyond soul ballads to the future of heart-tuggers—in fact, beyond R&B to color-blind pop. Hence, the forgivable Wings cover".
In 2003, the album was ranked number 68 on "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The National Association of Recording Merchandisers listed it at number 80 of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. In 2004, Nelson George wrote of Jackson and his music, "the argument for his greatness in the recording studio begins with his arrangements of "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". The layers of percussion and the stacks of backing vocals, both artfully choreographed to create drama and ecstasy on the dance floor, still rock parties in the 21st century". In 2008, "Off the Wall" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Run Cactus Kid Run is an advertising campaign for the soft drink Oasis. The campaign launched in June 2008 in the United Kingdom. It tells the story of Cactus Kid – a misunderstood anti-hero does not like water, but loves Oasis. The campaign includes three 30 second advertisements entitled 'Pregnant', 'Diner' and 'Motel' and also comprises series of web content and social networking elements.
Campaign elements.
Television advertising.
'Cactus Kid's character and the Run Cactus Kid Run campaign were created by advertising agency Mother. The ads were shot in Mexico in the style of an American road movie.
Online.
A series of websites and social network elements were created to expand on the story of Cactus Kid and Cactus Girl. The online content was created by digital advertising agency glue London.
Mothers Against Cactus Kid (M.A.C.K.).
The sequence tells the story of Cactus Girl’s mother Merrill Dawning, who believes her daughter was kidnapped by Cactus Kid and in protest founded the organisation Mothers Against Cactus Kid online. Merrill has set the cops on Cactus Kid in order to rescue her daughter.
The Hunt For Cactus Kid.
The Hunt for Cactus Kid is headed by a rogue US sheriff. He enlists the help of the online public to help him find Cactus Kid in a Google Maps-based Mechanical Turk application with a $2000 reward.
Characters.
Cactus Boy.
Cactus Boy is inspired by James Dean and Steve McQueen. He appears to be part man and part cactus. His mysterious past is unclear and he never speaks a word. He has run away with his pregnant girlfriend Cactus Girl and is now living on the lam.
Cactus Boy sightings have been posted on YouTube and Flickr.
Cactus Girl.
Cactus Girl is a small town, 20 year old girl who was just waiting for her life to begin. Then she met Cactus Boy. Cactus Boy who like her doesn’t like water. She becomes pregnant with the child by Cactus Boy and the two have run away to start a new life together. But freedom is not in store for the ill-fated couple.
Cactus Girl vents her frustrations with her hometown, living with her parents, and being on the run on her Myspace video blog.
Music.
The Cactus Kid soundtrack was originally composed in 1536 by Hans Neusiedler. The arrangement made specifically for the Cactus Kid campaign was recorded by Tom Hodge and Arnold Hattingh of Boosey and Hawkes.
The Campaign Ending.
On posters, phone boxes and the internet, the public were invited to visit the Run Catus Kid Run website to vote on how they wanted the Cactus Kid story to end. There were three endings to choose from: Happy, Sad and Twist, and viewers weren't able to watch them in their entirety until the winner was announced on 22 September. Twist won, with 43% of the vote, and the endings were also posted on YouTube.
Controversy.
The Advertising Standards Authority received thirty two complaints of the advert on six different grounds, among those included that it condoned teenage pregnancy and underage sex, in reference to her youthful appearance and the her pregnancy. As well as that, it discourage good dietary practice as the girl drank Oasis as a substitute to water, attracting seventeen complaint and it was screened at a time when it could be watched by children and young people.
Despite being approved by Clearcast as claimed by Coca-Cola GB, the ASA concluded that it breached its guidelines on two grounds, 
Coca-Cola GB responded to claims stating that the advert did not "denigrate" water and did not discourage other people from drinking it, the ASA concluded that it did suggest that "water was being rejected" . It stated that the girl was portrayed as a 20 years old and portrayed by 22-year-old actress, stating further that the commercial intended to be the style of "a film trailer than a reflection of a real life situation." The ASA concluded that the actress was "likely to be viewed as a girl in her early teens", despite her age. The advert was banned on those two grounds from further broadcast in its current form.

Georg Simon Klügel

Georg Simon Klügel (August 19, 1739 – August 4, 1812) was a German mathematician and physicist.
He was born in Hamburg, and in 1760 went to the University of Göttingen where he initially studied theology before switching to mathematics. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was a fellow student. His doctoral thesis "Conatuum praecipuorum theoriam parallelarum demonstrandi recensio", published in 1763 with Abraham Gotthelf Kästner as doctoral advisor, was a study of 30 attempted proofs of the parallel postulate. It was influential at the time and much cited.
Klügel edited the "Hannöversche Magazin" for 2 years from 1766, before becoming professor of mathematics at the University of Helmstedt. In 1788 he succeeded Wenzeslaus Johann Gustav Karsten to the chair of mathematics and physics at the University of Halle. He died in Halle in 1812.
He remained in correspondence with Lichtenberg throughout his career.

Dock5

Dock5 (Dedicator of cytokinesis 5), also known as DOCK5, is a large (~180 kDa) protein involved in intracellular signalling networks. It is a member of the DOCK-A subfamily of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which function as activators of small G proteins. Dock5 is predicted to activate the small G protein Rac.
Function.
Dock5 shares significant sequence identity with Dock180, the archetypal member of the DOCK family. It is therefore predicted to partake in similar interactions although this has yet to be demonstrated. Indeed, the function and signalling properties of Dock5 are poorly understood thus far. Dock5 has been identified as a crucial signalling protein in osteoclasts, and suppression of Dock5 expression with shRNA has been shown to inhibit survival and differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells. In addition, a mutation in Dock5 has been associated with the rupture of murine lens cataracts. In zebrafish Dock5 has been implicated in myoblast fusion.

Andrei Snezhnevsky

Andrei Vladimirovich Snezhnevsky () (7 (20) May 1904, Kostroma — 12 July 1987, Moscow) was a Soviet psychiatrist whose name was lent to the unbridled broadening of the diagnostic borders of schizophrenia in the Soviet Union, the key architect of the Soviet concept of sluggish schizophrenia, the inventor of the term "sluggish schizophrenia," an embodier of history of repressive psychiatry, a direct participant in psychiatric repression against dissidents. He was an academician of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry (1950—1951), the director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (1962—1987), and the director of the All-Union Mental Health Research Center of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (1982—1987).
Sluggish schizophrenia.
Snezhnevsky was the pinnacle of power, dominated the whole Soviet psychiatric system and forced the whole psychiatric system in the USSR and in many of its Eastern European satellites to adopt the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia as absolute knowledge. In the early 1950s, Snezhnevsky opposed the concept of "soft" schizophrenia but afterwards promoted the same idea under a different title: "slow-flowing", or "sluggish." The term "sluggish schizophrenia" was invented by Snezhnevsky and became widespread only in the 1960s. The prevalence of Snezhnevsky’s theories has particularly led to a broadening of the boundaries of disease such that even the mildest behavioral change is interpreted as indication of mental disorder. There was resistance, not all of thinking, educated doctors were willing to accept such unicity, Leningrad was opposed, Iosif Polishchuk has long resisted in Kiev, Fyodor Detengof did not wand to accept Moscow monopoly in Dushanbe, but Snezhnevsky had the power and so the monopoly on textbooks, manuals, conferences and congresses. In the USSR, he had not been criticized and disputed and had not had the need to prove while having the possibility to give an order.
Political abuse of psychiatry.
Snezhnevsky was long attacked in the West as an exemplar of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes and, in dozens of cases, he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including Vladimir Bukovsky, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Leonid Plyushch, Mikola Plakhotnyuk, Pyotr Grigorenko. Some of Snezhnevsky's employees say that one day in a selected auditorium, when discussing the situation in the country, he also gave the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia to Andrei Sakharov in absentia. As Oleh Wolansky noted, professor Snezhnevsky did not hesitate to act against principles of the Hippocratic Oath. On basis of the available data and materials accumulated in the archives of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry, one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons.
Discredit at the Royal College.
In 1980, the Special Committee on the Political Abuse of Psychiatry, established by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1978, charged Snezhnevsky with involvement in the abuse and recommended that Snezhnevsky, who had been honoured as a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, be invited to attend the College's Court of Electors to answer criticisms because he was responsible for the compulsory detention of this celebrated dissident, Leonid Plyushch. Instead Snezhnevsky chose to resign his Fellowship.
Snezhevsky wrote the letter to the president of the Royal College: 
The College’s Committee on Abuse passed the following judgment:
Other contributions to psychiatry.
In 1968, Snezhnevsky wrote of a distinction between the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, a concept long attributed to Snezhnevky but in fact introduced by John Hughlings Jackson and John Russell Reynolds. The concept came to be increasingly used in schizophrenia research and classification since 1970's, citing his colleague I.F. Ovchinnikov that the symptoms appear to exist "as if on two levels".
Estimations.
According to the psychiatrist Marina Voikhanskaya, Academician Snezhnevsky and his "school" have debased, reduced Russian psychiatry to a semi-amateur level and single doctrine about schizophrenia, in the terms of which alcoholic psychoses and alcoholism are considered schizophrenia; congenial idiocy in the children of alcoholics is considered premature schizophrenia; and dissent is considered schizophrenia with delusions of reform.
As reported by the psychiatrist Boris Zoubok, who worked at the Kashchenko hospital under Snezhnevsky and afterwards settled in the USA, Snezhnevsky and his colleagues genuinely believed in their concept of dissent as mental disease and in the method of diagnosis.
According to Moscow psychiatrist Alexander Danilin, the so-called "nosological" approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Snezhnevsky boils down to the ability to make the only diagnosis, schizophrenia; psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by the thousands are falling victims to these opinions—millions of lives were crippled by virtue of the concept "sluggish schizophrenia" introduced some time once by Andrei Vladimirovich Snezhnevsky, academician, whom Danilin called a state criminal. However, the founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group Yuri Orlov has the opinion that Snezhnevsky was a criminal in the political abuse of psychiatry rather against his will, the real criminal was Georgy Morozov, the director of the Serbsky Institute, who has collaborated with the KGB since his students days.
St Petersburg academic psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky’s school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky’s hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky’s concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.
In his article of 2002, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association Alan A. Stone, who as a member of team had examined Soviet dissident Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He asserted that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics and that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation.
Helen Lavretsky supposes that a totalitarian regime, the lack of a democratic tradition in Russia, and oppression and “extermination” of the best psychiatrists during the 1930-50 period prepared the ground for the abuse of psychiatry and Russian-Soviet concept of schizophrenia.
Awards.
He was honored with the title of a Hero of Socialist Labour, two Orders of Lenin, four Orders of the Red Star, and the USSR State Prize. 
Death.
Having learnt of his diagnosis of lung cancer and faced his death within a few years, Snezhnevsky started lamenting over his making a lot of blunders at the Pavlovian session and departed from his indisputable tone as to his own concept. He died on 12 July 1987 in Moscow and was buried on the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

Hereford Screen

The Hereford Screen is a great choir screen designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) and made by Coventry metalworking firm Skidmore & Co. for Hereford Cathedral, England in 1862. It was one of the Gothic Revival works in iron of the nineteenth century. When it was unveiled at the 1862 International Exhibition it was hailed as the "grandest and most triumphant achievement of modern architectural art". Weighing over eight tonnes, the screen is a mixture of wrought and cast iron, brass, copper, semi-precious stones, and mosaics, supporting electroformed statues of Christ and attendant angels. In 1967 the screen was dismantled as it was no longer considered fashionable. The Victoria and Albert Museum acquired the screen in 1984, but it was in very poor condition. In 2001, after a successful campaign to fund the largest conservation project ever undertaken by the Museum, the fully restored metal masterpiece was erected in pride of place, overlooking the main entrance.

Biography.
Born in Galicia, Rimalt studied at a heder and yeshiva, as well as a Hebrew high school in Kraków. While living in Poland he was one of the founders of the Akiva Hebrew Youth Organisation. He went on to study at a rabbinical seminary in Vienna, and gained a PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna, where he was chairman of the Zionist Students Group.
In 1939 he made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine, and worked as headmaster of a school in Ramat Gan. In 1943 he was appointed director of the city's department of education, serving until 1952.
In 1951 he was elected to the Knesset on the General Zionists list, and was also a member of Ramat Gan city council, serving as deputy mayor responsible for education between 1955 and 1959. In 1952 he became chairman of the General Zionist Labour Federation, a role he held until 1965. By that time the General Zionists had merged into the Liberal Party, which had become a faction within the Gahal alliance (later Likud); Rimalt was appointed chairman of the Liberal Party's directorate in 1965, having won re-election to the Knesset in 1955, 1959, 1961 and 1965.
Following the formation of a national unity government after the 1969 elections, Rimalt was appointed Minister of Postal Services. However, he left the cabinet in 1970 when Gahal withdrew from the coalition. The following year he became chairman of the Liberal Party, a role he held until 1975. He chose not to run for re-election in the 1977 elections, having been an MK for just under 26 years.

Absolute probability judgement

Absolute probability judgement is a technique used in the field of human reliability assessment (HRA), for the purposes of evaluating the probability of a human error occurring throughout the completion of a specific task. From such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety. There exist three primary reasons for conducting an HRA; error identification, error quantification and error reduction. As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of ‘fits/doesn’t fit’ in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors. ‘HRA techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare, engineering, nuclear, transportation and business sector; each technique has varying uses within different disciplines.
Absolute probability judgement, which is also known as "direct numerical estimation", is based on the quantification of human error probabilities (HEPs). It is grounded on the premise that people cannot recall or are unable to estimate with certainty, the probability of a given event occurring. Expert judgement is typically desirable for utilisation in the technique when there is little or no data with which to calculate HEPs, or when the data is unsuitable or difficult to understand. In theory, qualitative knowledge built through the experts’ experience can be translated into quantitative data such as HEPs.
Required of the experts is a good level of both substantive experience (i.e. the expert must have a suitable level of knowledge of the problem domain) and normative experience (i.e. it must be possible for the expert, perhaps with the aid of a facilitator, to translate this knowledge explicitly into probabilities). If experts possess the required substantive knowledge but lack knowledge which is normative in nature, the experts may be trained or assisted in ensuring that the knowledge and expertise requiring to be captured is translated into the correct probabilities i.e. to ensure that it is an accurate representation of the experts’ judgements.
Background.
Absolute probability judgement is an expert judgement-based approach which involves using the beliefs of experts (e.g. front-line staff, process engineers etc.) to estimate HEPs. There are two primary forms of the technique; Group Methods and Single Expert Methods i.e. it can be done either as a group or as an individual exercise. Group methods tend to be the more popular and widely used as they are more robust and are less subject to bias. Moreover, within the context of use, it is unusual for a single individual to possess all the required information and expertise to be able to solely estimate, in an accurate manner, the human reliability in question. In the group approach, the outcome of aggregating individual knowledge and opinions is more reliable.
Absolute probability judgement methodologies.
There are 4 main group methods by which absolute probability judgement can be conducted.
Aggregated individual method.
Utilising this method, experts make their estimates individually without actually meeting or discussing the task. The estimates are then aggregated by taking the geometric mean of the individual experts’ estimates for each task. The major drawback to this method is that there is no shared expertise through the group; however, a positive of this is that due to the individuality of the process, any conflict such as dominating personalities or conflicting personalities is avoided and the results are therefore free of any bias.
Delphi method.
Developed by Dalkey, the Delphi method method is very similar to the Aggregated Individual Method in that experts make their initial estimates in isolation. However following this stage, the experts are then shown the outcome that all other participants have arrived at and are then able to re-consider the estimates which they initially made. The re-estimates are then aggregated using the geometric mean. This allows for some information sharing, whilst avoiding most group-led biases; however there still remains the problem of a lack of discussion.
Nominal group technique (NGT).
This technique takes the Delphi method and introduces limited discussion/consultation between the experts. By this means, information-sharing is superior, and group domination is mitigated by having the experts separately come to their own conclusion before aggregating the HEP scores.
Consensus group method.
This is the most group-centred approach and requires that the group must come to a consensus on the HEP estimates through discussion and mutual agreement. This method maximises knowledge sharing and the exchange of ideas and also promotes equal opportunity to participate in discussion. However, it can also prove to be logistically awkward to co-ordinate as it requires that all experts be together in the same location in order for the discussion to take place. Due to this technicality, personalities and other biasing mechanisms such as overconfidence, recent availability and anchoring may become a factor, thus increasing the potential for the results to be skewed. If the circumstance arises in which there is a deadlock or breakdown in group dynamics, it then becomes necessary to revert to one of the other group absolute probability judgement methods.
Absolute probability judgement procedure.
1. Select subject matter experts
The chosen experts must have a good working knowledge of the tasks which require to be assessed. The correct number of experts is dependent upon what seems most practicable, while considering any constraints such as spatial and financial availability. However, the larger the group the more likely problems are to arise.
2. Prepare task statement
Task statements are a necessary component of the method; tasks are specified in detail. The more fuller the explanation of the task within the statement, the less likely it will be that the experts will resort to making individual guesses about the tasks. The statement should also ensure that any assumptions are clearly stated in an interpretable format for all experts to understand. The optimal level of detail will be governed by the nature of the task under consideration and the required use of the final HEP estimation.
3. Prepare response booklet
These booklets detail the task statement and design of the scale to use in assessing error probability and by which experts can indicate their judgements. The scale must be one which allows differences to be made apparent. The booklet also includes instructions, assumptions and sample items.
4. Develop instructions for subjects
Instructions are required to specify to the experts the reasons for the session, otherwise they may guess such reasons which may cause bias in the resultant estimates of human reliability.
5. Obtain judgements
Experts are required to reveal their judgements on each of the tasks; this can be done in a group or individually. If done by the former means, a facilitator is often used to prevent any bias and help overcome any problems.
6. Calculate inter-judge consistency
This is a method by which the differences in the HEP estimates of individual experts can be compared; a statistical formulation is used for such purposes.
7. Aggregate individual estimates
Where group consensus methods are not used, it is necessary to compute an aggregate for each of the individual estimates for each HEP.
8. Uncertainty bound estimation
Calculated by using statistical approaches involving confidence ranges.
Worked example.
Context.
In this example, absolute probability judgement was utilised by Eurocontrol, at the experimental centre in Brétigny-sur-Orge Paris, using a group consensus methodology.
Required inputs.
Each of the grades of staff included in the session took turns to provide estimates of the error probabilities, including ground staff, pilots and controllers. Prior to the beginning of the session, an introductory exercise was conducted to allow the participants to feel more comfortable with use of the technique; this involved an explanation to the background of the method and provided an overview of what the session would entail of. To increase familiarity of the method, exemplary templates were used to show how errors are estimated.
Method.
During the duration of the session it was revealed that the ease with which the experts were able to arrive at a consensus was low with regards to the differing estimates of the various HEP values. Discussions often changed individuals’ thinking e.g. in the light of new information or interpretations, but this did not ease reaching an agreement. Due to this difficulty, it was therefore necessary to aggregate the individual estimates in order to calculate a geometric mean of these.
The following table displays a sample of the results obtained.

In various cases, the range of figures separating the maximum and minimum values proved to be too large to allow to aggregated value to be accepted with confidence
These values are the events in the risk model which require to be quantified. There are 3 primary errors in the model that may occur:
There were various reasons which can explain the reasons why there was such a large difference in the estimates provided by the group: the group of experts was largely diverse and the experience of the individuals differed. Experience with Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) also showed differences. This process was a new experience for all of the experts participating in the process and there was only a single day, in which the session was taking place, to become familiar with its use and use it correctly. Of most significance was the fact that the detail of the assessments was very fine, which the staff were not used to. Experts also became confused about the way in which the assessment took place; errors were not considered on their own and were analysed as a group. This meant that the values estimated represented a contribution of the error on a system failure as opposed to a single contribution to system failure.

Caradrina kadenii

The Clancy's Rustic ("Caradrina kadenii") is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae. It originates from Southern and Central Europe, but has gradually extended its range to the North.
The wingspan is ca. 30 mm. The length of the forewings is 12–15 mm. The moth flies from May to October, depending on the location.
The larvae feed on various low-growing herbaceous plants.
