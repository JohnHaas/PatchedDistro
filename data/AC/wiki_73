Guadalajara Macrobus

The Guadalajara Macrobus is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The initiation of work on the system was announced by Jalisco Governor Emilio González Márquez on February 29, 2008. The system was launched on March 11, 2009 by the Governor and Mexican President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa.
Lines.
The initial line of the system runs 16 kilometers along Calzada Independencia and Gobernador Curiel with a total of 27 stations, including two terminals: Mirador and Fray Angelico. The line intersects the Guadalajara light rail system's Line 2 at San Juan de Dios station.
The actual stations in Line 1 are: (from North to South) Mirador, Huentitán, Zoológico, Independencia Norte, San Patricio, Igualdad, Monumental, Monte Olivette, Circunvalación, Ciencias de la Salud, Juan Álvarez, Alameda, San Juan de Dios, Bicentenario, La Paz, Niños Héroes, Agua Azul, Ciprés, Héroes de Nacozari, Lázaro Cárdenas, El Deán, Zona Industrial, López de Legazpi, Clemente Orozco, Artes Plasticas, Escultura and Fray Angélico,
Additional lines are currently being planned and are scheduled to open in 2010, soon after the opening of Line 1. These include:
Fleet.
The Macrobus fleet consists of articulated Volvo buses, similar to those used by Mexico City's Metrobús BRT system. The initial segment of the first line operates with 41 such buses.
Impact and Ridership.
As of February 2008, there were 130 bus routes running along Calzada Independencia and Gobernador Curiel, serviced by more than 2,000 buses. The goal of the BRT is to replace all non-BRT buses along the route. Many routes will be eliminated altogether and others altered so as to cross the BRT route and serve as feeder buses.
It is expected that upon the initial route's launch, the BRT system will achieve a daily ridership of over 174,000 passengers.

Gymnastics all-around champions by age

Prior to 1981, the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG was 14. The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied ballet for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast Ágnes Keleti won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. Larisa Latynina, the first great Soviet gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 World Champion while pregnant with her daughter. Czech gymnast Věra Čáslavská, who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.
In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — Ludmilla Tourischeva was sixteen at her first Olympics in 1968 — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.

Magnus, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Magnus, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (1455 – 29 October 1524) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen.
He was the third (but eldest surviving) son of Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, by his wife Cordula, daughter of Albert III, Count of Lindau-Ruppin.
Life.
By 1471 Magnus had made clear his intention to became a priest along with his youngers brothers William (who renounced his rights of succession) and Adolph II. This forced their father into a succession agreement with the Anhalt-Dessau branch of the House of Ascania, headed at that time by George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.
Adolph I died in 1473 and was succeeded by his half-brother Albert VI and Waldemar VI of Anhalt-Dessau. Fifteen months later Albert died to be succeeded by his only son Philip. Magnus (already a Canon of Magdeburg) and his brother Adolph II also inherited Köthen; both used the title of "Lord of Zerbst" in allusion to the portion of the principality that was under their charge.
Without any interest in the government of the principality, Magnus' reign was nominal, but it was only in 1508 that he formally abdicated along with his brother Adolph II.

Knot Feeder

Knot Feeder was a math rock band from Pittsburgh featuring ex-members of Don Caballero, Tabula Rasa, and Southpaw. The band consisted of guitarist Mike Banfield (ex-Don Caballero), drummer Rob Spagiare (ex-Tabula Rasa), guitarist Andrew Grossmann (ex-Tabula), and bassist Andy Curl (ex-Southpaw). They recorded a CD with J. Robbins in 2007, which was released on January 24, 2009 at The Smiling Moose.
History.
Guitarist Mike Banfield left Don Caballero, which he helped co-found with Damon Che, after their 1999 European tour supporting "What Burns Never Returns," their third release on the Touch & Go label, because he did not want to quit his job in Pittsburgh and relocate to Chicago. Damon Che continued to play with Don Cab, and the other guitarist Ian Williams went on to form the band Battles (band). After departing Don Cab, Banfield hibernated until a member of Pittsburgh band Mihaly connected him with drummer Rob Spagiare of the post-hardcore band Tabula Rasa. "We played a few times and it never materialized into anything, but then I got inspired and wanted to play more seriously. So I called Rob, and he brought along guitarist Andrew Grossmann (ex-Tabula)." Soon, friend and promoter/sound engineer Sean Cho hooked the trio up with bassist Andy Curl, whose previous band, Southpaw, was known for its complex extended jams. And thus Knot Feeder was formed in 2006.

Table for Three

Table for Three is a straight to DVD comedy film written and directed by Michael Samonek and starring Brandon Routh, Jesse Bradford and Sophia Bush.
"Table for Three" was released straight to DVD on the 23 of June 2009.
Plot.
Scott is a suddenly single young man, who is known for rushing into relationships. He invites a co-dependent, seemingly "perfect couple" to share his large apartment, only to see them completely disrupt his life when they insert themselves into his new romance.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The film has been panned by various film critics. An example is Jason McKiernan review for AMC: "Table for Three is not the most painful movie experience one will ever have, but it is one of the most unnecessary. We've seen it all before, and we don't need to see it again. The characters are wooden, the plot is tedious, and the comedy is strained and corny. For their part, the actors do what they can, but with material this uninspiring, they would be better off pooling their salaries to buy a more interesting screenplay."

Misty Copeland

Misty Copeland (born September 10, 1982) is an American ballet dancer, described by many accounts as the first African American female soloist for the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), one of the three leading classical ballet companies in the United States (along with New York City Ballet and San Francisco Ballet). However, Anne Benna Sims and Nora Kimball, who were with the ABT in the early and mid-1980s respectively, preceded her. In this role as the third African-American soloist and first in two decades with ABT, she has endured the cultural pressure associated with it.
Copeland is considered a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet until the age of 13. By age 15, Copeland's mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal proceedings involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.
In 1997, Copeland won the Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Award as the best dancer in Southern California. After two summer workshops with the ABT, she became a member of the Studio Company in 2000, a member of the corps de ballet in 2001, and a soloist in 2007. Stylistically, she is considered a classical ballet dancer. As a soloist since the autumn of 2007, she has been described as having matured into a more contemporary and sophisticated dancer.
Early life.
Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in the San Pedro community of Los Angeles, California. She is of African American, German and Italian descent. Copeland is the youngest of Sylvia DelaCerna's four children from her second marriage. Her siblings from that marriage are Erica Stephanie Copeland, Douglas Copeland Jr., and Christopher Ryan Copeland. She also has two younger half-siblings, Lindsey Monique Brown (a former track star at Chico State University) and Cameron Koa DelaCerna, one each from her mother's third and fourth marriage. Sylvia DelaCerna, a former Kansas City Chiefs cheerleader, had studied dance.
At age eleven, she found her first creative outlet at a Boys & Girls Club wood shop class. Copeland never studied ballet or gymnastics formally until her teenage years. However, she did enjoy choreographing flips and dance moves to Mariah Carey songs in her youth. Copeland's natural presence and skill came to the attention of her drill team coach, Liz Cantine, at Dana Middle School in San Pedro. She was first introduced to ballet in classes at her local Boys & Girls Club. DelaCerna allowed Copeland to go to the club after school until the workday ended and Cynthia Bradley, a former working dancer with companies in San Diego, Virginia and Kentucky, taught a free ballet class there once a week. Bradley invited Copeland to attend classes at the small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. However, Copeland initially declined the offer because her mother did not have a car, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. Soon after she and her mother moved to a motel in Gardena, California they signed a management contract as well as a life-story contract, and Copeland moved in with Bradley. She spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role.
The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she got to see Paloma Herrera perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. After three months of study Copeland was en pointe. The media first noticed Copeland when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in the "The Nutcracker" after only eight months of study. A larger role in "Don Quixote" and a featured role in "The Chocolate Nutcracker", an African American version of the tale that was narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed.
When she was fifteen years old, Copeland won first place in the Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards and subsequently began her studies with Diane Lauridsen of Torrance's South Bay Ballet at the Lauridsen Ballet Center. The competition was held at the Chandler Pavilion on March 24, 1998, and Copeland said it was the first time she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the "Los Angeles Times" as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.
Copeland studied at the San Francisco Ballet School after winning the Spotlight award. While training with Bradley she selected the workshop with the San Francisco Ballet over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theater of Harlem and three other companies. As a student, Copeland had a 3.8/4.0 GPA through her junior year of high school.
Custody case.
Copeland lived and trained with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley for nearly three years, ending in 1998. During that time she pursued independent study for tenth grade. After Copeland returned from her summer 1998 San Francisco Ballet experience, her mother informed her that she would be staying with her and not resuming her study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear that she would not be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the emancipation petition process. Copeland says she understood the process as a way to make everything better. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent when the emancipation petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend.
After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was taken to the police station by Bartell, who filed emancipation papers. Copeland's mother subsequently applied for a restraining order, which included the Bradleys' five-year old son who had been Copeland's roommate. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.
In late 1998, a custody controversy occurred involving Copeland. The case was highly publicized in the press (especially "Los Angeles Times" and "Extra"), starting in August and September 1998. Parts of the press coverage spilled over into op-ed articles. In the case, which was heard in Torrance in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, DelaCerna claimed that the Bradleys had brainwashed Copeland into filing suit for emancipation from her mother, and DelaCerna, who was represented by Gloria Allred, filed a series of restraining orders against Bartell, the lawyer who filed the emancipation charges on behalf of her daughter. Allred claimed that the Bradleys had turned Copeland against her mother by belittling DelaCerna's intelligence. The Bradleys were not intimidated by the suits and said they were willing to enforce the management contract, which gave them authority and rights to twenty percent of Copeland's earnings until she became eighteen, via the legal system.
After DelaCerna stated that she would always make sure Copeland could dance, the emancipation papers and restraining orders were dropped. Even though she had dropped the temporary restraining order request, DelaCerna wanted the Bradleys out of her daughter's life. Later in 1998, Copeland, who claimed she did not even understand the term emancipation, withdrew the request after informing the judge that such charges no longer represented her wishes. Eventually, Copeland re-enrolled at San Pedro High School on pace to be a part of her original class of 2000 and began ballet study with Lauridsen Ballet Centre, although it was now restricted to afternoons in deference to her schooling. Afterward, all parties appeared on Leeza Gibbons' "Leeza" show. In 2000, DelaCerna stated that Copeland's earnings from ballet were set aside in a savings account and only used as needed.
American Ballet Theatre.
As of 2008, Copeland has been the only African-American woman in the dance company for her entire American Ballet Theatre career, nor is there a male African-American since the departure of Danny Tidwell in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she is a rare African-American ballerina, and although she has been shielded from several issues, she endures the difficulties of cultural isolation as the second African-American ABT soloist ballet dancer. Since she is often credited as the first African-American ABT soloist ballet dancer in the press, some describe her as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet. Copeland also feels that since the female dancer is the focus of the ballet, her role as a trail-blazing performer and role model has extra significance. She is included in the 2004 picture book by former ABT dancer Rosalie O'Connor that is entitled "Getting Closer: A Dancers Perspective" (ISBN 0-8130-2768-3). Copeland's performances with American Ballet Theatre are sponsored by Susan Fales-Hill.
Early ABT career.
Copeland auditioned for several dance programs in 1999, and each made her an offer to enroll in its summer program. Copeland performed with the ABT as part of its 1999 and 2000 Summer Intensive programs. During the summer of 1999, the topic of whether Copeland would stay if invited came up, and she responded affirmatively, although her mother insisted finishing high school was important. During that summer, she was told that she would likely be invited to stay after she graduated in 2000 and by the end of the summer she was asked to skip her senior year and join the studio company. Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though the ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements.
She studied at the Summer Intensive Program on full scholarship for both summers and was declared ABT’s National Coca-Cola Scholar in 2000. In the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she danced the role of Kitri in "Don Quixote". Of the 150 dancers in the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she was one of six selected to join the junior dance troupe. She joined the ABT Studio Company in September 2000, and became a member of its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, which is the ABT's second company, she performed a duet in Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty".
Corps de ballet.
Early career reviews mentioned her as more radiant than higher ranking dancers. She was named to the 2003 class of Dance Magazine's "25 to Watch". As a corps dancer she had the opportunity to dance alongside her longtime idol Paloma Herrera. Starting in 2003, she began to be favorably reviewed for her roles as a member of the corps in "La Bayadère" and William Forsythe's "workwithinwork". Recognition continued in 2004 for roles in ballets such as "Raymonda" and "workwithinwork", and the 2004 season is regarded as her breakthrough season. In 2005, her most notable performance was in George Balanchine's "Tarantella". In 2006, she received a notable mention for her role in "Cinderella", and she was acknowledged for her meticulous classical performance style in "Giselle". That year, she also returned to Southern California to perform at Orange County Performing Arts Center. Copeland's "old-style" performance continued to earn her praise until her promotion to soloist in 2007.
In 2008, Copeland won the Leonore Annenberg Fellowship in the Arts, which funds study with master teachers and trainers outside of the American Ballet Theatre. The two-year fellowships are in recognition of "young artists of extraordinary talent with the goal of providing them with additional resources in order to fully realise their potential". During the 2008–09 season, she received publicity for roles in Twyla Tharp's "Baker's Dozen" and Paul Taylor's "Company B".
In March 2009, Copeland spent two days in Los Angeles filming a music video with Prince, for the first single from his 2009 studio album "Lotusflower", which was a cover of the "Crimson and Clover". Prince caught her by surprise with a next-day invitation to participate in unchoreographed movements. She described his instructions as "Be you, feel the music, just move" and upon request for instruction "Keep doing what you’re doing". During the summer, her Annenberg Fellowship resulted in training for her performance in Balanchine's "Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux" adaptation of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" "Pas de Deux". She also began taking acting lessons. That fall, she performed in the ABT's first trip to Beijing November 12 –15. The six-performance engagement was the first by an American ballet company at the new National Center for the Performing Arts.
In October 2010, she performed at the Guggenheim Museum to David Lang's music. During the New York City and New Jersey portions of Prince's Welcome 2 America tour, Copeland took a few nights off from her 2010 role in "The Nutcracker" at Brooklyn Academy of Music and performed a pas de deux en pointe to "The Beautiful Ones" as the opening number at the Izod Center and Madison Square Garden. Prince had previously invited her onstage at a concert in Nice, France. Copeland was also featured in T-Mobile's ads for the BlackBerry in 2010. In February 2011, in honor of Black History Month, Copeland was selected by "Essence" as one of its 37 Boundary-breaking black women in entertainment. That same month, she toured with Company B, which performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. On April 13, 2011, she performed alongside Prince on the "Lopez Tonight" show, dancing to the song "The Beautiful Ones." Her Summer 2011 ABT performances were part of a new Alexei Ratmansky ballet as well as a reprisal of "Giselle" pas de deux. In the Ratmansky piece, Copeland earned praise for her May and June Metropolitan Opera House performances: "Misty Copeland was a luminous, teasingly sensual milkmaid. I’ll never look at her the same way again," She performed Ratmansky to a Metropolitan Opera audience that included "Black Swan" star Natalie Portman. She reprised the role in July at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles with a performance described as "sly". As a flower girl, she was described as glittering in "Don Quixote". In August, she performed at the Vail International Dance Festival in the Gerald Ford Amphitheater in Vail, Colorado.
While aspiring to be a principal dancer, Copeland has numerous goals as a dancer, in terms of leading roles. She aspires to perform lead roles in "Giselle", Nikiya and Gamzatti in "La Bayadère", Juliet in Romeo and Juliet as well as Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake". In September 2011, she was featured in the Season 1, episode 5 of the Hulu web series "A Day in the Life". In December, she unveiled a line of dancewear that she designed. On April 5, 2012, Copeland was recognized by The Council of Urban Professionals as the Council's Breakthrough Leadership Award winner at its 5th Anniversary Leadership Gala.
In 2011, Copeland marketed dancewear line M by Misty. She has also produced celebrity calendars. By late 2012, she was seeking publication of two books: a memoir and an illustrated youth book. Copeland starred in "The Firebird" (marketed as "Firebird"), with choreography by Alexei Ratmansky at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, California. It premiered on March 29, 2012. The performance was hailed by the "Los Angeles Times" Laura Bleiberg as one of the years best dance performances. In January 2013, Dr. Pepper began airing an ad campaign featuring unique individuals such as Copeland. Later that month, she announced that she was working on two books: a memoir under the Simon & Schuster Touchstone Books label and a picture book for the G. P. Putnam's Sons for Young Readers label. In September 2013, Copeland became a spokesperson for Project Plié, a national initiative with the goal of broadening the pipeline of leadership within ballet. Copeland was interviewed in the November 2013 "Vogue Italia".

Michael Conrad Sophus Emil Aubert

Michael Conrad Sophus Emil Aubert (2 July 1811 – 8 November 1872) was a Norwegian jurist and politician.
He graduated as cand.jur. in 1835. He worked as an attorney from 1836, and diocesal attorney ("stiftprokurator") in Bergen from 1841. He was then appointed district stipendiary magistrate in "Lofoten og Vesterålen" in 1847. While stationed here, he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1851, representing the rural constituency of "Nordlands Amt".
In 1852 he was appointed County Governor of "Nordre Bergenhus Amt" (now known as Sogn og Fjordane). He served as deputy representative to the Parliament in 1857. He lived in Lærdalsøyri during this tenure. He made his mark by establishing the transport company Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe (later known as Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane) with Jan Henrik Nitter Hansen and Harald Ulrik Sverdrup in 1858.
He left the County Governor position in 1860 to become burgomaster of Throndhjem. He served as deputy representative from the constituency "Throndhjem og Levanger". His wife died during this period.
In 1866 he was appointed district stipendiary magistrate in Jarlsberg, residing in Sande i Vestfold. He held the position until his death. His replacement as burgomaster was Sivert Christensen Strøm.

__NOTOC__
The Jurca MJ-10 Spit is a sport aircraft designed by Hailey in France as a replica of the Supermarine Spitfire and marketed for homebuilding. Plans for two versions were produced, the MJ-10, at 3/4 scale, and the MJ-100, at full-scale. Construction throughout is of wood, and the builder may choose to complete the aircraft with either a single seat or two seats in tandem. The version represented is the Mk.IX Spitfire, but allowances are made to allow the builder to portray other versions, in particular the Mk.Vc and the Mk.XIV. Additionally, the MJ-100 version may be built with a fuselage structure of welded steel tube if desired. Plans for both versions were marketed by Falconar and later Jurca Plans West.

It is notable that the dynastic principles of primogeniture in accordance with Salic Law were not deviated from between Hugh Capet's accession in 987 until the deposition of Louis XVI in 1791; every monarch of France (with the exceptions of the Napoleonic emperors) was a legitimate, agnatic male descendant of Hugh Capet.
House of Capet 987–1328.
Following the accession of Hugh Capet to the French throne in AD 987, there was not to be a significant issue of dynastic inheritance for three centuries: through thirteen generations, the deceased King's oldest surviving son inherited the throne as follows:
Following the death of Philip IV in 1314, he was succeeded by his eldest son Louis X, but Louis died two years later, leaving his posthumous son John I as his heir; John died within five days of his birth. The Count of Poitiers, younger brother of Louis X, claimed the throne, excluding Joan of France, Louis X's daughter, from the French succession (although she later inherited the throne of Navarre). From that point there was no going back; the Count of Poitiers became Philip V of France, setting the precedent that only males could succeed to the throne. Philip would also die without a male heir, so he was succeeded by his brother, who became Charles IV.
Following the death of Charles IV in 1328 a succession dispute arose. Edward III of England argued that succession systems in place elsewhere, including cognatic primogeniture and proximity of blood, gave him a superior claim as the son of Isabella of France, daughter of Philip IV and sister of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV. Edward was not in fact the senior cognatic heir, who instead was Joan II of Navarre, daughter of Louis X, followed by several other male-line granddaughters of Philip IV, one of whom had a young son (Philip of Burgundy); on the other hand, Edward was neither a woman nor a child, and was more closely related to Charles IV (as his nephew) than some other claimants. Nonetheless Philip (son of Charles of Valois, younger son of Philip III) obtained the crown on the grounds that his descent from kings of France was in the male line. From that point it was clarified that the succession would not only exclude females, but also their male issue. Several decades later, Salic law would be rediscovered, and was used by the agents of the French king to boost their master's claim in a propaganda war against the King of England. Edward and his successors pressed their claim militarily until 1453 (see the Hundred Years' War), and the monarchs of England continued to call themselves monarchs of France until 1801.
Charles IV.
At the date of the death of Charles IV, the last male member of the senior branch of the House of Capet, February 1, 1328, the agnatic line of succession was as follows:
As described above, Philip of Valois became Philip VI amid some controversy, establishing a pattern (popularly known in the English-speaking world as Salic Law) that would govern the French succession thereafter.
House of Valois 1328-1498.
Philip VI.
At the date of Philip VI's death, August 22, 1350, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became John II.
John II.
At the date of John II's death, April 8, 1364, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Charles V.
Charles V.
At the date of Charles V's death, September 16, 1380, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Charles VI.
Charles VI.
In 1420, Charles VI adopted Henry V of England as his heir, displacing his own son the Dauphin, as part of his capitulation to Henry in the Treaty of Troyes. Thus, at the date of Charles VI's death, October 21, 1422, the heir to the throne was:
However, the Dauphin still had his supporters. The English were only able to occupy northern France, so the Dauphin withdrew to the south, where his enemies derisively referred to him as "King of the Bourges". At his father's death, on October 21, 1422, the line of succession was as follows (ignoring the Treaty of Troyes):
Eventually, the Dauphin would emerge victorious as Charles VII. From then on, to protect the succession from the intervention of foreigners, it was deemed that the crown could only pass by the sheer force of custom, not by the testament of the king, or by any edict, decree, or treaty. The Hundred Years' War did not end with a peace treaty (which meant that the Treaty of Troyes, though "de facto" moot, is "de jure" legal), so the Kings of England continued to style themselves Kings of France.
Charles VII.
At the date of Charles VII's death, July 22, 1461, the line of succession was as follows:
As the Dauphin had been living in exile due to conflict with his father, some thought his brother the Duke of Berry might succeed as King. However, the Dauphin returned after learning of his father's illness, and smoothly became Louis XI.
Louis XI.
At the date of Louis XI's death, August 30, 1483, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Charles VIII.
Charles VIII.
All of Charles' children predeceased him, including his only son Charles Orland, Dauphin of France, who died in 1495 aged 3. At the date of Charles VIII's death, April 7, 1498, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Louis XII.
House of Orléans (Valois cadet branch, 1498–1515).
Louis XII.
At the date of Louis XII's death, January 1, 1515, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Francis I.
House of Orléans-Angoulême (1515–1589).
Francis I.
At the date of Francis I's death, March 31, 1547, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Henry II.
Henry II.
At the date of Henry II's death, July 10, 1559, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Francis II.
Francis II.
At the date of Francis II's death, December 5, 1560, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Charles IX.
Charles IX.
At the date of Charles IX's death, May 30, 1574, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Henry III.
Henry III.
At the date of Henry III's death, August 2, 1589, the line of succession was as follows:
There was intense opposition to the succession of Henry of Navarre due to his Protestant religion. As part of the ongoing French Wars of Religion, the Catholic League argued that Henry's religion disqualified him from the throne and championed Charles of Bourbon (who himself refused to oppose his nephew's claim). After the Cardinal's death in 1590, several claimants appeared, yet most of France gradually accepted Henry of Navarre except the capital, Paris, until he converted to Catholicism in 1593 and was thus able to consolidate his power, being crowned Henry IV in 1594.
House of Bourbon (1589–1792).
Henry IV.
At the date of Henry IV's death, May 14, 1610, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Louis XIII. 
The House of Courtenay claimed a place in the line of succession after those named above, as they were descended in legitimate male-line from Louis VI. However, the Bourbons consistently denied the Courtenays' petitions to be recognized as princes of the blood, recognizing only the male-line descendants of Louis IX as dynasts. The last Courtenay died in 1727.
Louis XIII.
At the date of Louis XIII's death, May 14, 1643, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Louis XIV.
Treaty of Utrecht.
When the Spanish king Charles II died, his closest heir was Louis, the Grand Dauphin, son of Louis XIV, King of France. Charles knew that the other European powers would oppose the union of France and Spain. Thus, in his will, Charles named Philip, Duke of Anjou, second son of the Grand Dauphin (and thus, the first person not in the direct line of succession to the French throne) as his heir. 
France and Spain fought the other major European powers in the War of the Spanish Succession. The war ended with the Treaty of Utrecht which required that Philip, in order to retain the throne of Spain in his lineage and for Louis XIV to obtain peace for France, renounce for himself and his descendants any right of succession to the French throne, thereby preventing the crowns of France and Spain from being united on the head of a single Bourbon king. Despite doubts in France as to whether the Treaty was binding, Louis XIV and the other European powers ratified it and the Parlement of Paris registered it. The problem with this arrangement is that the succession to the throne is part of the fundamental laws of the realm, a set of principles not subject to the legislative powers of the king. The fundamental laws guard against this very kind of danger - that of a king, defeated in war, agreeing to disinherit an heir at the insistence of his enemies. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes attempted to disinherit the heir to the French throne. It failed, even though the treaty had been ratified by the Estates-General of France. Because of its similar name, the Parlement of Paris had been misunderstood to be the equivalent of the English Parliament. It was in fact, more of a judicial body tasked with the registration of royal edicts. The Estates-General, on the other hand, represented the three estates of the realm, and had the power to approve taxation (under the Valois) and to elect a new king (considered a possibility against the Protestantism of Henry IV). The ratification of the Treaty of Troyes by the Estates-General failed to divert the succession. It necessarily follows that the registration of a treaty in Parlement (a lesser body), with the intent of changing the succession to the throne, would not be binding as well. In fact, the only method that succeeded in breaking the fundamental laws is the destruction of the regime itself.
Still, the Treaty of Utrecht is part of the conflicting claims between Legitimists (descendants of Philip V, who deem the Treaty of Utrecht invalid) and Orléanists (descendants of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, who claim their right of succession based on the Treaty of Utrecht and the residence abroad of Philip and his heirs as kings of Spain).
Louis XIV.
The succession to Louis XIV changed upon the deaths of his eldest son Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the Grand Dauphin's eldest son Louis, Duke of Burgundy, and Burgundy's eldest son Louis, Duke of Brittany, all in 1711–1712. 
At the date of Louis XIV's death, September 1, 1715, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Louis XV.
In July 1714, Louis XIV, at the persistent behest of Madame de Maintenon, issued an edict inserting his two surviving illegitimate sons, Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine (b.1670) and Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse (b.1678), and those of their descendants born in the legitimate male-line, into the order of succession to the crown immediately following all other Princes of the Blood Royal of the House of Bourbon. That act was registered in the Parlement of Paris 1 August 1714. However, the edict was revoked nearly two years after his death, 8 July 1717, by the "Parlement of Paris" at the direction of the regent Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, in the name of the minor Louis XV, on the grounds that it would prejudice the rights and decision of the French nation in its choice of a king in the event of extinction of the reigning dynasty, contrary to the nation's fundamental laws.
Louis XV.
The succession to Louis XV changed upon the death of his son Louis, Dauphin of France in 1765. At the date of Louis XV's death, May 10, 1774, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Louis XVI.
Louis XVI.
At the date of Louis XVI's deposition and the proclamation of the First Republic, September 21, 1792, the line of succession was as follows:
Louis XVI remained the claimant to the throne until his execution on January 21, 1793, after which his imprisoned son and then his brother were recognized by monarchists as the rightful king.
House of Bonaparte (1804–1815).
Napoléon I.
On the dates of Napoléon I's first abdication, April 6, 1814, and his second abdication, June 22, 1815, the line of succession was as follows:
At the date of Napoléon II's abdication, July 7, 1815, the line of succession was as follows:
In both events, the senior living representative of the Bourbon line was Louis-Stanislaus, Count of Provence (b. 1755), Louis XVI's third brother, who became Louis XVIII, while Napoléon I continued to claim the Bonaparte legacy.
House of Bourbon (restored, 1815-1830).
Louis XVIII.
At the date of Louis XVIII's death, September 16, 1824, the line of succession was as follows:
The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Charles X. 
The recognised living representative of the Bonaparte line was François, Duke of Reichstadt (b. 1811), Napoléon I's only legitimate son.
Charles X.
At the date of Charles X's abdication, August 2, 1830, the line of succession was as follows:
Charles X continued to claim his right to the throne, which passed "de facto" to the Duke of Orléans as Louis-Philippe I. 
The recognised living representative of the Bonaparte line was François, Duke of Reichstadt (b. 1811), Napoléon I's only legitimate son.
House of Orléans (Bourbon cadet branch, 1830–1848).
Louis Philippe I.
At the date of Louis Philippe I's abdication and the proclamation of the Second Republic, February 24, 1848, the line of succession was as follows:
The senior living representative of the Bourbon line was Henri, Count of Chambord (b. 1820), grandson of Charles X.
The senior living representative of the Bonaparte line was Louis, Prince Napoléon (b. 1808), nephew of Napoléon I.
House of Bonaparte (restored, 1852–1870).
Napoléon III.
At the date of Napoléon III's abdication and the proclamation of the Third Republic, September 4, 1870, the line of succession was as follows:
Napoléon III continued to represent his dynasty's claim to the imperial throne, which passed "de facto" upon his death in 1873 to his son, Louis, Prince Napoléon (b. 1856).
The senior living representative of the Bourbon line was Henri, Count of Chambord (b. 1820), grandson of Charles X.
The senior living representative of the Orléans line was Philippe, Count of Paris (b. 1838), grandson of Louis-Philippe I.

Euharlee Covered Bridge

The Euharlee Covered Bridge, also known as the Euharlee Creek Covered Bridge or rarely the Lowry Bridge, is a wooden Town lattice covered bridge crossing Euharlee Creek in Euharlee, Georgia, United States, a small town west of Cartersville. The bridge was built after the raging creek swept away an old bridge on the property of Daniel Lowry. The collapse of the bridge killed one man. A new bridge was built using some materials provided by Lowry.
The bridge was built in 1886 by Horace King's son Washington King and Johnathan H. Burke. The bridge spans 138 feet. The lattice trusses consist of planks crisscrossing at 45- to 60-degree angles and are fastened with wooden pegs, or trunnels, at each intersection. Traffic finally stopped across the bridge in 1980 when a new two-lane bridge was built.
The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public seven days a week.

Valley Wildcats

The Valley Wildcats are a Canadian junior ice hockey franchise from the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia. The team is a member of the Maritime Junior A Hockey League and plays in the EastLink Division. They play their home games in the Kentville Centennial Arena in Kentville, Nova Scotia.
History.
The Antigonish Bulldogs were founded in 1967 as members of the Antigonish-Pictou-Colchester Junior B Hockey League. After two seasons the league became the Northumberland Junior B Hockey League. In 1974, the Bulldogs became a founding member of what became the Eastern Junior A Hockey League, but returned to the Northumberland League in 1975. The Bulldogs would win league titles and provincial titles in 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. They would also win the Don Johnson Cup as Atlantic Junior B Champions in 1983 and 1984, the first team to ever win the Cup back-to-back. In 1987 they jumped to the Metro Valley Junior A League, which became the MJAHL in 1991.
The franchise was known as the Antigonish Bulldogs for 40 years. After it was decided that operating in Antigonish, Nova Scotia was no longer viable, the franchise was sold to a Metro Halifax group and then relocated to that city in the summer of 2008. The team's nickname, then, as the Halifax Lions was announced on August 22, 2008. The name is a tribute to the successful Halifax Lions teams of the 1980s. 
In 2010, the team was relocated to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and renamed again as the Metro Marauders. Two years later, it was renamed the Metro Shipbuilders.
In 2013 it was announced that the Halifax Regional Municipality was losing Junior A hockey, due to low attendance rates in the area. The Metro franchise's move to the valley area of Nova Scotia was confirmed by the league's board of governors ahead of the 2013 MHL draft on June 15. The franchise was renamed the Valley Wildcats and is based in Kentville, Nova Scotia.

GRiDPad

The GRiDPad was a touchscreen tablet manufactured for GRiD Systems Corporation by Samsung in 1989. It is regarded as the first tablet computer directed towards consumers. It was so successful it was used even by the United States Army. Jeff Hawkins went on to use the GRiDPad as a predecessor for his best known-invention, the Palm Pilot.
Specifications.
The GRiDPad measured only 9 x 12 x1.4 inches and weighed 4.5 pounds. The main distinguishing aspect was its touch-screen interface with a stylus, a pen-like tool to aid with precision in a touchscreen device. The stylus was able to use hand writing recognition software. The GRiDPad also included these features:
Because of its use for inventory, the United States Army specified more durable versions of the tablet to be made out of magnesium that were not sold to civilians. The Army specially ordered magnesium because it is a strong yet light metal, making it ideal to be used in combat.
According to a patent submitted in 1992 by an engineer at GRiD Systems, the touch screen in the GRiDPad works by magnifying an internal Cartesian plane (x-y coordinate system) and calculating the displacement. Further patents by Jeff Hawkins describe flipping the screen orientation between landscape and portrait.
Reception.
Because of its text recognition interface, the GRiDPad was marketed toward specialist consumers who would use the tablet for bookkeeping. The GRiDPad was "designed to streamline the chores of workers such as route delivery drivers and claims adjusters, who typically record data on paper forms." Some of the agencies that used the GRiDPad include, Chrysler, San Jose Police Department, and even the United States Army.
The average selling price for one unit was US$2,370 without software, and $3,000 with software. It was so successful that it sold approximately $30 million in its best year.
Legacy.
Although the GriDPad had the same operating system as personal computers, it was not designed to be a replacement for computers. Hawkins once said "I never saw pen computers as a replacement for a full PC..." Although it did not replace computers, it did pave the way for other companies to invest more into tablet computers, eventually leading up to the current most popular tablet, the iPad from Apple Inc.
Not only did the GRiDPad start paving the way for tablet computers, it also helped propel Jeff Hawkins' career. Hawkins used the same stylus technology to develop his most commercially successful product, the Palm Pilot, making the GRiDPad its predecessor.

<br>
Mazanów is a quiet agricultural village that stretches along the road from Prawno to Boiska. Houses and farm buildings/stables front on either side of the road and the related fields stretch behind them, mostly on the south side. A portion of the land on the north side of the road beyond the house yards, and running for about 50 meters up to the left bank of the River Wyznica, serves as common pasture. The houses and farm buildings are typical of the rural architecture of this area of Poland, some being over 100 years old and still quite functional for their intended purposes.

Origins.
The name "Rozdziele" indicates the idea of "division" and relates to the area being on the drainage divide between the Raba and Dunajec rivers. The earliest mention of the name occurs in 1262, in a grant of forest rights from king Bolesław V the Chaste, though there is no indication as to whether a settlement with that name existed then. The first definite mention of Rozdziele as a village does not occur until 1490.
The centre of the village is in Upper Rozdziele ("Rozdziele Górne"); Lower Rozdziele ("Rozdziele Dolne") lies downhill towards the east.
Economy.
These days the local economy centres around agriculture and, increasingly, tourism, given the village's location amongst hills and unspoilt countryside.
Religion.
There is a historic Roman Catholic church by the lane leading to Lower Rozdziele. Dedicated to St. James the Apostle it is subsidiary to the parish church in Żegocina. Of wooden construction, typical of this part of Poland, the building dates back to the 16th century, and originally stood in Królówka. It was transported to its current location in 1986. The building is on the "Wooden Architecture Trail".

Borzęcin is a village in Brzesko County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Borzęcin. It lies approximately north-east of Brzesko and east of the regional capital Kraków. It is located on the Uszwica river and divided into two sołectwos, Upper Borzęcin and Lower Borzęcin. Currently it has a population of about 3,700 inhabitants.
The village is mentioned in historical documents for the first time in 1475 by the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz in his "Liber beneficiorum", a register of church property for tax purposes. Długosz states that the village was founded on unpopulated land in 1364 by the Bishop of Kraków, Bodzanta Jankowski, and named after him as "Bodzantin". This later turned into its current name when Austrian authorities recorded the village as "Borzecin" during the partitions of Poland. The founding of the village was based on Magdeburg law, and all the settlers where Slavs. Each one was given one łan, or about 25 hectares of land. Later settlers arrived from Germany and Silesia. Tax records from 1536 list 87 male peasants, and records attest to the existence of a local church school by 1596. Until 1782 the village was the property of the bishops of Kraków.
Borzęcin was pillaged by Swedish and Transylvanian forces during the period of Polish history known as the "Deluge". After the First partition of Poland in 1772 it became part of the Austrian partition. In the 1830's the village lost one sixth of its population due to a cholera epidemic, a destructive flood and a local famine. The last serfs were manumissioned in 1848.
During World War II 143 inhabitants of the village were killed, including 64 in Nazi concentration camps. Of those 43 were Jews. Additionally the Germans murdered 28 Roma from a nearby community in Lower Borzęcin itself, and several hundred more in the nearby village of Szczurowa in the Szczurowa massacre.
It is the birthplace of the Polish dramatist and author Sławomir Mrożek.

Liang Chongyi

Liang Chongyi (梁崇義) (died 781) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Daizong, Liang took advantage of the army's discontent after the death of the general Lai Tian (來瑱) to seize control of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and hold it semi-independently from the imperial regime. After Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong became emperor, however, he was defeated by another general then-loyal to the imperial government, Li Xilie, and committed suicide as his headquarters were falling.
Background.
It is not known when Liang Chongyi was born, but it is known that his family was from the Tang capital Chang'an. He became known for his strength and was said to be able to fold gold and straighten out metal hooks. He became an archer in the imperial guards and later served under the general Lai Tian in Tang's struggle against rebel Yan forces during the Anshi Rebellion. He was said to be silent and liked by other soldiers, and eventually became an officer. He continued to follow Lai late in the Anshi Rebellion as Lai became the military governor ("jiedushi") of Shannan East Circuit. During this time, Lai became hesitant to periodically visit Chang'an to pay respect to Emperor Suzong, because of his poor relationships with the powerful eunuchs, led by Li Fuguo.
After Emperor Suzong's death in 762, Emperor Suzong's son and successor Emperor Daizong, then under heavy influence by Li Fuguo (as Li Fuguo held the command of the imperial guards and therefore controlled the capital), tried to remove Lai from his power base by moving him to Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). Lai, however, was fearful of the move, and both he and his army favored staying in Shannan East, and so declined the move to Huaixi. Emperor Daizong relented and kept him at Shannan East. After Li Fuguo was removed from power later in the year, however, Lai accepted honorary titles as the minister of defense and chancellor and reported to Chang'an to meet Emperor Daizong. Once he got to Chang'an, however, his old enmity with the new eunuch in charge of the imperial guards, Cheng Yuanzhen, flared up, and Cheng induced another official, Wang Zhongsheng (王仲升), into accusing Lai being complicit with Yan generals during the Anshi Rebellion. Lai was removed from his posts and exiled, but was further ordered to commit suicide on the way to exile.
Prior to Lai's visiting Chang'an, however, he had left several key officers stationed at various prefectures of Shannan East. When they heard of Lai's death, they, including Liang, who was then at Nanyang (南陽, in modern Nanyang, Henan), fled their posts back to Xiang Prefecture (襄州), the capital prefecture for Shannan East. Neither he nor two other officers, Li Zhao (李昭) and Xue Nanyang (薛南陽), was initially willing to claim leadership, but the soldiers supported him, and so he took command. He soon executed Li and Xue and blamed the disturbance on them. Emperor Daizong was unable to do anything against Liang at that point, so he made Liang the reserve military governor, and shortly after military governor, of Shannan East. Liang took Lai's body and reburied it with honor, and further built a temple dedicated to Lai. He went as far as to avoid using Lai's old office and main hall, to show respect.
As "Jiedushi".
Liang Chongyi soon began to govern the circuit as a semi-independent realm from imperial authority, and he was allied with several other generals in the same position -- Xue Song, Tian Chengsi, Li Baochen, Li Zhengji, and Li Huaixian. The imperial government was unable to do anything about them and was content with nominal submission from them. Overall, he controlled six prefectures. However, as, unlike his allies, he was completely surrounded by circuits loyal to the imperial government, and also had the weakest army among the six, he tended to be the most respectful to the imperial government and occasionally followed imperial decrees. Nevertheless, after Emperor Daizong's death in 779, when his relatives advised him that he should visit Chang'an to pay respect to the new emperor, Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Liang stated:
Death.
As of 781, however, things came to a head when two of the generals that Liang was allied with, Li Baochen and Li Zhengji, died, and Emperor Dezong refused to allow their sons (Li Weiyue and Li Na), respectively, to succeed as military governors of their circuits (Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong)). Li Weiyue and Li Na, along with Tian Chengsi's successor Tian Yue, therefore prepared for war against the imperial government, as did Liang Chongyi, particularly since Li Xilie, the military governor of Huaixi, had repeatedly requested imperial approval to attack Liang. When a certain Guo Xi (郭昔) accused Liang of treason, however, Emperor Dezong, in order to placate Liang, had Guo caned and exiled, and then sent the official Li Zhou (李舟) to Xiang Prefecture to try to comfort Liang. Li Zhou's mission, however, had the opposite effect, as Li Zhou's prior mission to another rebellious general, Liu Wenxi (劉文喜), was followed by Liu's soldiers rising against him and killing him, and it was rumored that Li Zhou had an ability to turn rebellious generals' subordinates against them. Therefore, as Li Zhou reached the borders of Shannan East, Liang refused him entry and requested another imperial messenger. Because Emperor Dezong was then preparing for war against Chengde and Pinglu, he did not want another war with Shannan East at the moment. He therefore sent another official, Zhang Zhuo (張著), to Shannan East, honoring Liang with the honorary title as chancellor, creating his wife as a lady, bestowing on him an iron certificate (guaranteeing that he would not be put to death), and summoning him to Chang'an. He also accepted Liang's prior recommendation that one of the officers he favored, Lin Gao (藺杲), be made the prefect of Deng Prefecture (鄧州, in modern Nanyang). After Zhang arrived at Xiang Prefecture, Liang hesitated about what to do, as did Lin, who did not dare to accept the post without Liang's approval. Liang, after some thought, wept in Zhang's presence but still refused to visit Chang'an.
In reaction, Emperor Dezong created Li Xilie the Prince of Nanping and put in him charge of the operations against Liang. Meanwhile, Liang launched a preemptive attack against Jiangling, hoping to capture it and gain access to the south. However, he was defeated at Siwang (四望, in modern Xiangfan) and retreated back to Xiang Prefecture. He gathered his troops and concentrated them in Xiang and Deng Prefectures, while Li Xilie gathered the forces and headed northwest on the Han River toward Xiang Prefecture. Liang attacked some of Li Xilie's troops stationed at Linhan (臨漢, near Xiang Prefecture), slaughtering them, but subsequently, when Li Xilie's main troops arrived, Liang's generals Zhai Hui (翟暉) and Du Shaocheng (杜少誠) was defeated by Li Xilie at Man River (蠻水, flowing through modern Xiangfan) and then Shukou (疎口, also in modern Xiangfan). Zhai and Du surrendered to Li Xilie, and Li Xilie ordered them to take their troops to enter Xiangyang (the capital of Xiang Prefecture) first. Liang ordered resistance, but his troops opened the gates and fled outside. Liang, seeing no escape, committed suicide with his wife and children by jumping into a well. Li Xilie took his body out from the well, cut off the head, and sent it to Chang'an. Li Xilie also slaughtered Liang's relatives and friends, as well as 3,000 soldiers who had participated in the Battle of Linhan.

Scuba Dice

Scuba Dice are a four-piece Pop Punk band from Kilkenny. The band consists of vocalist Joe Grace, guitarist Padraig King, bassist Liam Bryne, and drummer Shane Pearson. Half of the band were in the original lineup which dates back as far as 2003.
The band started out playing punk and rock covers in local bars and clubs in late 2003. After some lineup changes the band began writing and recording original music. To date the band have released 3 singles, one official EP and are currently writing their debut album.
History.
Formation (2003–2007).
Since 2003 Scuba Dice have gained a large following, a good reputation and much acclaim, for their electric live show and own original material. After entering the 2006 Hype Entertainment Battle of the Bands and winning, the band released a highly successful self-titled EP, they then opened for the The Frank and Walters, at a gig in the Olympia Theatre, featuring an additional guitarist Des Foley of Mr Lightweight. In early 2007 Scuba Dice made their television debut as contestants in the national TV show "You're a Star", According To Brendan O'Connor their genre is "Power Pop Punk Punk Pop", competing for the coveted prize of a record contract and as part of the show they covered Green Day's "Holiday", which was released as a single reaching No. 8 and gave them their debut on the Irish Singles Chart and later went on to be 42nd best selling single of 2008 for an Irish artist. They also released their second single "Made" an original song, this time a physical release. The band also entered the Beatbox competition house to write a song with the contestants.
Two founding members leave (2007–2010).
It was around this time that Eoin 'Spud' Murphy, left the band due difficulties within the band, he was swiftly replaced by the band's roadie and guitar tech Liam Bryne. Shortly after this the band announced that Sean Savage (the band's original drummer) was no longer a member on their Bebo and MySpace pages, which resulted in angry exchanges through each other's blogs. This temporarily left the band drummer-less and facing an uncertain future. The band temporarily recruited Pat Byrne, a member of Mr Lightweight, to play the drums for them on their 4th Demo, and the single "Let Go". After this the band found their current drummer Daire Nolan. The band planned to release "Just Dance", a song from their third demo, as a single through iTunes; the date had been set however the single was not released.
In August 2008 the band took part in LA or Busk, a competition open to unsigned Irish bands. The competition, ran by Blastspace, consisted of 8 heats, each heat consisting of ten of Ireland's best young bands. Scuba Dice went on to finish 3rd in a closely contested final. A new single, titled "Let Go", was released on 13 February 2009 as a digital download available through DownloadMusic.i.e. The band organized their first headlining Irish tour in February 2009 to promote "Let Go" with "Under Stars & Gutters".
In the summer of 2009 Scuba Dice embarked on a short tour of Ireland with All or Nothing for three dates of their Irish tour and another three dates with Jody Has A Hitlist and Snakes Hate Fire. Scuba Dice are also wowed the huge crowds on the main stage of the Dithmarscher Rock Festival 2009 in Germany. For the first time in 2009, Scuba Dice embarked on a trip to America. Here they played 4 showcase shows and earned themselves great reviews and valuable contacts for the future.
2010 - Present: "The Lost Art Of Romance".
In the summer of 2010, between Friday June 25 and Saturday July 3 they did a headline tour around Ireland taking in places such as Wexford, Galway City, Cork City, Limerick City, Mayo, Louth and Antrim. They released E.P. Lost art of Romance in September. The band have supported My Passion, Canterbury, One Night Only and Francesqa around Ireland. They did 3 headline Halloween shows around Ireland in Cork City, Limerick City, and Dublin Scuba Dice then supported Paramore at The O2 in Dublin on November 6, 2010. They played a 30 minute set and were very well received.
Scuba Dice then took time off to prepare for their Summer 2011 tour which included 6 dates in Ireland as well as dates in Austria, Sweden and Germany They are now writing a new album.
Lead singer Joe, currently lives in Australia, so it's unknown if the band are on temporary hiatus or not. The band's website is currently down which suggests they have broken up.

Adolph II, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

Adolph II, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen (16 October 1458 – 24 March 1526, in Merseburg), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. A Roman Catholic Bishop of Merseburg, he remained until his death a staunch opponent of Martin Luther.
He was the fifth and youngest son of Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, by his wife Cordula, daughter of Albert III, Count of Lindau-Ruppin.
Life.
In 1471 Adolph began his studies at the University of Leipzig and in 1475 was elected Rector. Because he and his brothers had decided to become priests, their father Adolph I drew up a succession contract with the Anhalt-Dessau branch of the House of Ascania, headed by George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, to secure the existence of the principality. The contract stipulated that Adolph I would rule jointly with George's son Waldemar VI, and that Adolph I's half-brother Albert VI was to become co-ruler with Waldemar after Adolph's death. Upon the death of Albert VI, Adolph II and his brother Magnus succeeded their uncle as co-rulers of Anhalt-Köthen with their cousins Philip and Waldemar VI. Adolph used the title "Lord of Zerbst" to identify the portion of the principality in which he resided. Despite his spiritual office, Adolph participated in the government of his principality for several years; only in 1508 did he formally renounce his rights along with this brother Magnus.
In 1488 Adolph II became Provost of Magdeburg Cathedral, then was ordained as a priest two years later (in 1490). In 1507 was accepted by Bishop Thilo of Merseburg as his Coadjutor and succeeded him in 1514 as Bishop of Merseburg.
His administration over the Bishopric of Merseburg was prudent and kind. Besides his administrative duties, he also preached and taught. Although he fundamentally accepted the justification by faith doctrine proclaimed by Luther, he rejected all intervention in the existing Church order. In 1520 he ordered the burning of Luther's books and forbade the reading of the reformed Bible translation in 1522. In 1523 Adolph petitioned Duke George of Saxony for the expulsion of the Lutheran minister Sebastian Fröschel from Leipzig. On 3 May 1525 he was forced to flee after Protestant disturbances in Leipzig. Adolph died ten months later.

MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital

MultiCare Health System's Tacoma General Hospital is the largest hospital in Tacoma, Washington. It is a level II trauma center with 437 beds and the second largest obstetrical care center in the state of Washington. Tacoma General began serving patients in 1882. The hospital is owned and operated by MultiCare Health System, a Tacoma-based not-for-profit integrated health organization.
History.
Tacoma General's beginnings trace back to the earliest days of the city of Tacoma. Founded in 1882, seven years before Washington achieved statehood, the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital opened its doors in a former dance hall on North Starr Street in what is now Old Town Tacoma. Today, what was once the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital is now MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital, and the health care mission begun in that converted dance hall has evolved over the last 130 years into MultiCare Health System — the largest health care system in the South Puget Sound region.
Facilities.
Tacoma General has 437 licensed beds. It is a level II adult trauma center and contains 16 operating rooms, 4 cardiac catheterization labs, a 21-bed medical surgical intensive care unit, a 25-bed cardiac care unit, and level IIIB neonatal intensive care unit. Tacoma General is physically attached to Mary Bridge Children's Hospital, which is also run by MultiCare. Mary Bridge has 72 licensed beds and is a level II pediatric trauma center.
Volume.
In 2007 Tacoma General had 14,185 inpatient admissions (14,723 with Neonates), delivered 3,149 babies, performed 6,818 surgeries, conducted 32,121 home health visits, received 40,724 emergency room visits, and 64,904 outpatient visits (excluding ER). In 2007, Mary Bridge Children's Hospital had 3,990 medical and surgical inpatient admissions, 359 pediatric intensive care unit admissions, performed 5,392 surgeries, received 30,147 emergency department visits, and 41,055 outpatient clinic visits.

Show Me (The Cover Girls song)

"Show Me" is the title of the debut single by the American freestyle girl group The Cover Girls. First released as a 12" single in 1986, "Show Me" first charted on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it peaked at #4 in March 1987. Following the song's successful run on the dance chart, it was then released to radio, where it reached #44 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in May 1987, remaining in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks. The exposure the group received from this song led to an album deal, and the album "Show Me" was released later in 1987. The Cover Girls became among the first in a wave of freestyle musical artists to enjoy chart hits in the late 1980s; other associated acts include Exposé, Stevie B and Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam.
In 2000, former lead singer of The Cover Girls Angel Clivillés released an updated version of "Show Me" that was remixed and produced by DJ Tony Moran. Her recording was a hit in the US dance clubs, spending one week at #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in June of that year. This version appeared on her solo album "Angel", which was released in 1999.

The name of the village is tied to its location, at the mouth of the Raba, where it flows into the Vistula (Polish word "ujście" or "uście" means "river mouth"). The adjective Solne refers to salt, as for centuries, the river port at Uście served salt mines from Bochnia. Uście Solne received town charter from King Kazimierz Wielki, on May 18, 1360. Most likely, however, it had been a town before that date, and Kazimierz Wielki only confifmed the already existing charter, changing it from obsolete Sroda Slaska rights to the more modern Magdeburg rights
After 1360, the new town of Uscie Uście was placed near Old Uście (Stare Uście), a village near the confluence of the Raba and the Vistula. Traces of earth fortification, which protected salt warehouses, are still visible. Uście Solne prospered in the second half of the 14th century, due to salt deposits, mined at Bochnia, and transported here along the Raba river. The town had a large medieval main square, as well as a town hall. Several residents of Uście Solne studied at Krakow’s Jagiellonian University; three rectors of the university came from Uście (Stanislaw z Uścia Jakub Papenkowicz z Uścia, and Wojciech Papenkowicz).
Uście Solne remained a river port of local importance until the first partition of Poland (1772). Its slow decline, however, began during Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when it was completely burned. Annexed by the Habsburg Empire as part of Galicia, it quickly lost its importance after the Austrians built a new Vistula river port at nearby Swiniary. During World War One, heavy fighting between Russian and Austro-Hungarian forces took place here, and the village has a military cemetery nr. 319, located near parish cemetery. Uście Solne lost its town charter in 1934.

The University Library of Oslo (, UBO) is a library connected to the University of Oslo.
Like the University, it was established in 1811 with Georg Sverdrup as the first head librarian. It originally doubled as the Norwegian national library, and was located at the old University of Oslo campus.
In 1913 the current library building in "Henrik Ibsens gate" was completed. Head librarian at the time, from 1876 to 1922, was Axel Drolsum.
In 1989 the institution National Library of Norway was established. It finally took over the national library tasks from the University Library in 1998, allowing the latter to concentrate on university matters. The same year, the University Library left the building in "Henrik Ibsens gate" for the newly constructed Georg Sverdrup's House, located at the modern University of Oslo campus at Blindern.

Meller's Chameleon

Trioceros melleri, with the common names Meller's Chameleon and Giant One-horned Chameleon is the largest species of chameleon from the African mainland (i.e. the largest of the chameleons not native to Madagascar). Meller's Chameleon gets its common name from a "Dr. Meller" who is mentioned by biologist and taxon authority John Gray in the section about the habitat of the species in his 1865 description.
Range.
"T. melleri" is relatively common in the bushy savannahs and interior mountains of East Africa and may be found in Malawi, northern Mozambique, and Tanzania.
Description.
The largest of the chameleons from the African mainland, large male "T. melleri" typically reach in length, but exceptionally large specimens have reputedly reached over in length and have weighed .
Females are generally smaller than males, and have less developed dorsal and medial crests. The head of this species is relatively small in relation to the rest of its body and has a more elongated shape in comparison to other chameleons in its genus.
"T. melleri" is stout-bodied and has a relatively stubby tail one third the length of its body. A low, scalloped crest extends from just behind the casque of the head through the proximal half of the tail, and a sharp medial crest runs from the lizard's eyes to the tip of its snout, which bears a single small horn. This chameleon bears greatly enlarged occipital lobes. It has heterogeneous scales which vary shape and size to various parts of its body and large, granular scales distributed homogeneously on the trunk and limbs. There are longitudinal rows of large, granular scales in the chameleon's gular region, one of its most distinctive characteristics.
Spots and broad vertical bands on the chameleon's flanks range in color from brown, dark green, yellow or even black. The basic coloration of the creature is a deep forest green with white stripes, but like many chameleons it can change its color depending on various circumstances. If being fed or handled they might display black and white dots. When basking in the sun, the side of their body towards the sunlight can turn dark green or black, while the rest of the animal stays much lighter.
Meller's Chameleon has color patterns associated with stress. Mild excitement or stress is indicated by dark spotting overlaying the reptile's normal color. These dark green spots turn to black mottling as the chameleon gets more upset. Severe stress turns the chameleon first charcoal gray, followed by pure white adorned with yellow stripes. A sick Meller's Chameleon may be mottled with brown, gray, pink, or white. A gravid animal is black, cream, and gray colored and will be bulging with eggs.
With great care, Melleri are one of the few species that can be housed in groups. This doesn't always work as some individuals will not get along. Constant observation is required to ensure the animals safety. Their long tongues can reach prey up to away.
Diet and reproduction.
Like most chameleons, Meller's are strict carnivores eating insects, smaller lizards, spiders, worms, and caterpillars. Large specimens have been known to eat small birds.
Females annually produce a single clutch of up to 80 eggs. Newborn Meller's Chameleons are about in length and must be fed Drosophilidae and tiny crickets for the first three weeks of their lives. Afterwards, they accept house flies and larger insect prey including crickets, locusts, silkworms, and cockroaches. They may live as long as twelve years.
Captivity.
"T. melleri" specimens vary from timid to moderately aggressive towards humans, with some specimens being reported as friendly. Wild caught specimens of "T. melleri" have fared poorly in captivity, often imported with heavy parasite loads, they have a high mortality rate. The species has been successfully bred in captivity as long as specific requirements are met and are recommended for advanced hobbyists.
As they are large lizards, a large enclosure is recommended. One breeder recommends placing the chameleon's cage above human eye level so that it can feel elevated in its environment.
High day time temperatures (80-85°F or 27-29°C) are needed for the reptile's enclosure. Simulating the natural temperature changes of the creature's native environment, a night time temperature of the low 60s Fahrenheit (~16°C) is recommended as well. They need considerable hydration and various dietary supplements are recommended.

313th Air Division

The 313th Air Division (313th AD) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with Pacific Air Forces, based at Kadena AB, Okinawa. It was inactivated on 1 October 1991.
History.
The unit's origins begin with its predecessor, the World War II 313th Bombardment Wing (313th BW) was part of Twentieth Air Force. The 313th BW engaged in very heavy bombardment B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan.
World War II.
The 313th Bombardment Wing was organized at Peterson Field, Colorado in the spring of 1944 as a Very Heavy (VH) bombardment wing, to be equipped with the Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Operational groups assigned to the wing were the 6th and 9th Bombardment Groups, both were existing units with the 6th being reassigned from the Sixth Air Force in the Caribbean, where it was performing antisubmarine missions and protecting the Panama Canal from airfields in Panama. The 9th was assigned to Army Air Force Training Command in South Florida as part of its school of applied tactics. Both groups were reassigned to bases in Nebraska – to (Grand Island AAF and McCook AAF) respectfully where they trained initially on B-17 Flying Fortresses until their B-29 aircraft could be manufactured and made available to them. Two other groups, the 504th and 505th were formed as new units (504th at Fairmont AAF, the 505th at Harvard AAF), also being assigned to bases in Nebraska for training. After dealing with various training issues and also problems with the B-29s they received, the combat groups were ready to deploy to the Pacific Theater and departed for North Field, Tinian, in the Northern Mariana Islands arriving during late December 1944.
On Tinian, the wing was assigned to the XXIst Bomber Command of Twentieth Air Force. Once in place, the groups of the 313th began flying missions, initially against Iwo Jima, the Truk Islands, and other Japanese held areas. Later, they flew low-level night incendiary raids on area targets in Japan; participated in mining operations in the Shimonoseki Strait, and contributed to the blockade of the Japanese Empire by mining harbors in Japan and Korea. In April 1945 the 313th assisted the invasion of Okinawa by bombing Japanese airfields used by kamikaze pilots.
A fifth group, the 509th Composite Group, was assigned to the wing in May 1945 from Wendover AAF, Utah. The 509th, although assigned to the 313th Bomb Wing, was operationally controlled by Headquarters, Twentieth Air Force. The 509th was given a base area near the airfield on the north tip of Tinian, several miles from the main installations in the center part of the island where the other groups were assigned. Also unlike the other groups in the wing, the 509th used a wide variety of tail codes from various XXI Air Force groups, instead of using its own, so that the group's planes could not be identified by the Japanese. The 509th was also self contained, and drew little in resources from the 313th Wing or its other groups.
In early August, the mission of the 509th was revealed when the group flew the Atomic Bomb missions to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In November, the 509th was relieved from assignment to the 313th Bomb Wing and was reassigned to Roswell AAF, New Mexico.
After the Japanese surrender in August, 313th Bomb Wing units dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and participated in show-of-force flights over Japan. As part of the postwar drawdown of forces, two of the Wing's groups, the 504h and 505th were inactivated in late 1945 and early 1946.
Another group, the 383d, was reassigned to the 313th Bomb Wing from Eighth Air Force in September 1945 after the Eighth was drawn down on Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was planned to be a second strategic Air Force to be used during the Invasion of Japan which never materialized. The 383d was inactivated in December with its aircraft and personnel returning to the United States.
Pacific Air Forces.
In March 1946, the 313th was reassigned to Thirteenth Air Force in the Philippine Islands. In the Philippines, the wing was assigned the 5th Bomb Group from Seventh Air Force where it conducted Bombardment training, aerial reconnaissance and mapping and construction projects. The 5th Reconnaissance Group conducted many clandestine mapping missions over non-friendly areas of Asia during the postwar era. The wing itself began phasing down for inactivation in late 1947, with the 6th and 9th bomb groups being inactivated in June 1947, and finally the 5th bomb group in January 1948. The 313th Bombardment Wing was itself inactivated in June 1948.
In March 1955, the organization was redesignated as the United States Air Force 313th Air Division (313th AD) as part of Far East Air Forces Fifth Air Force, being assigned to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. The mission of the 313th AD was the command and control of USAF units assigned to Okinawa.
Throughout the years of the Cold War, the 313th AD assumed responsibility for air defense of the Ryukyu Islands and tactical operations in the Far East, maintaining assigned forces at the highest possible degree of combat readiness. In addition, it supported Fifth Air Force in the development, planning, and coordination of requirements for future Air Force operations in the Ryukyu Islands. The division also supported numerous PACAF exercises such as Cope Thunder, Cope Diamond, Team Spirit, and Cope North.
The 313th was inactivated on 1 October 1991 as part of a general drawdown of USAF forces in the Pacific after the end of the Cold War.

Expedición Róbinson (Colombia)

Expedición Róbinson is a Colombian version of the "Survivor" reality television game show based on the Swedish television series "Expedition Robinson" originally created in 1992 by Charlie Parsons. The show is based on stranding a group of strangers as one or more tribes in a remote location, where they must fend for food, water, fire, and shelter for themselves, while competing in challenges to earn rewards and immunity from being voted off by the tribe in progressive eliminations; the last challenger remaining at the end of the competition wins two a reward that ranges from two hundred million to three hundred million pesos prize (100-150 hundred thousandUS$) and title of "Colombian Robinson".
Overview.
"Expedición Róbinson" rights were bought by Caracol TV in 2001. This television network produced the first two seasons of Expedition Robinson. Both seasons were hosted by former beauty queen and actress Margarita Rosa de Francisco. Two years later, rights for "Expedición Robinson" were sold to RCN TV. The series changed its original name to "La Isla de los FamoS.O.S." ("Famous People Island", in English), in which all contestants were celebrities of Colombia. "RCN TV" has produced three seasons of "La Isla de los FamoS.O.S." and all three of them have been hosted by journalist Guillermo Prieto "Pirry". For its part, "Caracol TV" has developed a variation of the show whose name is "El desafío 20-0_" (in which the last number represents the year the season has been aired. i.e. "Desafío 20-08"). So far, five seasons of "El Desafío" have been aired, three of them hosted by "Margarita Rosa de Francisco" again.
Expedición Robinson.
"Expedición Robinson" aired two seasons in 2001 and 2002, respectively before being sold. Both seasons were a hit in Colombian audience. These seasons followed the same general format as the Swedish series.
Season 1: Expedición Róbinson.
The show's first season was filmed during 2001 and was aired later that year. It was set on Bocas del Toro, off the Caribbean Coast of Panama.
16 Colombians (8 women and 8 men) took part in the first season. The price was 200 million Colombian pesos. Contestants were divided into two initial tribes: Ukups and Atchas, these Kuna words mean "ants" and "bees", respectively. Ukup team was represented by yellow color as Atcha team was represented by orange color.
Thirteen episodes aired weekly on Sundays. Each episode lasted an hour except the season finale which lasted two hours. Besides official episodes, ""El Diario Robinson"" was aired during every week the show lasted on air. It was a 15 minutes long program in which unseen scenes from each episode were shot.
The show was won by Rolando Patarroyo. He was part of the Atcha tribe, who were outnumbered by the Ukup tribe at tribal merger. He won the 200 million pesos price and was presented as "the first Colombian Robinson". Marlon Restrepo, the runner-up of this season was rewarded with a van.
Season 2: Expedición Róbinson: el desafío.
"Expedición Róbinson" succeeded and became a hit in the Colombian audience. "Caracol TV" released a second season the next year, 2002. This time, the show format was changed extensively for the production of numerous 30 minute episodes. Episodes were broadcast from Sunday to Friday, and did not necessarily end with a Tribal Council elimination. Most of elimination episodes happened on Sundays.
This season was called "Expedición Robinson: el desafío" (desafío means challenge in English) and the chosen location to set the show was Los Haitises National Park, Dominican Republic. Challenges were more difficult than previous season and the contestants were not given any initial supplies, including food, water or matches. Both camps were given merely a water well and a machete, conditions were also extreme because camps were almost completely surrounded by mangroves and it was common both camps were invaded by mosquitos at the sunset.
The price was elevated 225 million Colombian pesos. Contestants were divided into two initial tribes: Mucaro and Kahaya, these Taíno words mean "owl" and "shark", respectively. Mucaro team was represented by red color and Kahaya team was represented by green color.
The show was won by Cristobal Echevarría. He was part of the Mucaro tribe, he made a powerful alliance at the tribal swap. This alliance was known as the Paisa alliance, since all alliance members came from that region of the Country. He won the 225 million pesos price. Camila Puerta, the runner-up, was rewarded with 20 million pesos and an expedition to Australia.

History.
Baranów was founded as a town on the basis of Magdeburg Law in 1544. By the 19th century the town was in economic decline and in 1870 it lost its town status.
The first historical mention of the Jewish inhabitants of Baranów comes from records dating from 1621. In 1930 the village had a population of 2071, including 1092 Jews. Under the German occupation of Poland the Jewish population was confined in a ghetto by 1942, then deported to the Sobibor extermination camp and murdered there. Fewer than 25 Baranów Jews survived the war, and the Jewish community was not reestablished in the village afterwards. Except for the remnants of the Jewish cemetery and the name of one of the streets, few traces of the former Jewish presence remain in the village today.

Girl Crazy (1943 film)

Girl Crazy is a 1943 musical film produced by Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Based on the stage musical of the same name, "Girl Crazy" stars Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in their ninth of ten pairings, partly filmed on location near Palm Springs, California. This was also June Allyson's feature film debut. Music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin.
Production began with Busby Berkeley as director, but Berkeley was fired after continued run-ins with Garland. An elaborate production number set to "I Got Rhythm" was his only major contribution to the film. Norman Taurog, who went on to direct Elvis Presley's rock and roll musicals, took over. 
The film used six songs from the original stage musical, plus another Gershwin song, "Fascinating Rhythm".
The musical numbers were recorded in stereophonic sound but mixed into mono for release to theaters. Rhino Records released a compact disc featuring the original stereo recordings, which include probably the only stereo tracks of Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.
Plot synopsis.
Danny Churchill, a young philandering playboy, is taken out of college by his concerned father and sent to 'Cody College', somewhere in the American West, in the hope that he'll stay away from girls and knuckle down to his studies.
En route from the train depot he meets Ginger, the local postal mistress and toast of all the students and falls for her. Initially not pleased with what he finds at the school, not least the primitive facilities and practical-joking fellow-students, he eventually settles in. 
Danny and Ginger are devastated when they learn that the college must close, due to falling enrollments. Using his father's society and business contacts, he approaches the state governor and extracts a promise that the college may be reprieved if enrollments improve. Danny decides to put on a show to 'bring back the old west' and persuades the college Dean to buy the first ticket. 
Tommy Dorsey's band is engaged, the event is a success, student enrollments roll in, and the future of the college is assured.

Box Office.
According to MGM records the film earned $2,608,000 in the US and Canada and $1,163,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $1,068,000.
DVD release.
"Girl Crazy" was released on DVD for the first time as part of Warner Bros. five-disc DVD set "The Mickey Rooney & Judy Garland Collection" on September 25, 2007. The set contains "Girl Crazy", "Babes in Arms", "Babes on Broadway", and "Strike Up the Band". A fifth bonus disc includes one number ("I Got Rhythm") in stereo, although stereo tracks exist for all the film's musical numbers. MGM technicians transferred the original multi-channel optical film tracks to 1/4" audiotape when ordered to destroy all the elements in the early 1950s; these surviving tracks were released on a stereo CD in 1995.

Purani Haveli (film)

Purani Haveli is a 1989 Hindi horror film presented by the Ramsay brothers.The soundtracks were composed by Ajit Singh.
Plot.
The film opens with a young couple Raja(Anil Dhawan) and Rita(Priti Sapru) are driving through a dense forest at night. Tired and sleepy, they decide to stop for the night, and find a "haveli" (mansion) nearby. They fall asleep in the outskirts of the mansion. Around midnight, the husband awakes all of a sudden and gets up to investigate. Then a horrible monster (Manik Irani) attacks him. His wife wakes up hearing him scream and they are both killed by the monster. An old man Narendra (Narendra Nath) suddenly appears, a bit too late but eventually traps the monster in an underground cage and attaches a cross to the latch to keep him from escaping.
The film moves into the lives of an industrialist Kumar (Vijay Arora), his cunning wife Seema (Neelam Mehra) and their niece Anita (Amita Nangia). Kumar’s brother and his wife were killed in a car accident; their vast estate is held in trust by Kumar until Anita comes of age. Kumar is a good human being who loves his niece like a daughter, but his wife Seema is a cunning lady who wishes her younger brother Vikram (Tej Sapru) to impress and wed Anita, so that both of them can milk out the entire estate. But, Anita does not approve of Vikram and is in love with a photographer, Sunil (Deepak Parashar).
Kumar decides to buy the mansion for a sum of twenty five lacs from Mr. Rana. While leaving with Rana to see the mansion, Kumar once again instructs Vikram along with his wife to woo Anita over as soon as possible. Seema asks her husband to send word as soon as he reaches the mansion. Meanwhile, Shankar, Rana's old servant, a habitual drunkard goes to the mansion to clean it up. But the monster controls all the evil forces and as a result, Shankar is killed by an iron statue. Both Rana and Kumar reach the haveli at night and they both get killed by the monster.
A large group of some twenty three folks go to the mansion for an outing. Things get interesting when one of Vikram's friends is killed by the iron statue.Many interesting things happen in due course. Seema and Vikram get increasingly frustrated; Anita is about to come of age and reclaim her estate, and Vikram remains unsuccessful at wooing her. Seema hatches a plot and she lures Sunil into the tehkhana (dungeon) where Vikram is waiting for both of them and attacks Sunil him from behind. He becomes unconscious and then they lock up the dungeon and leave Sunil there thinking that he will eventually die and Anita may eventually agree to wed Vikram.
Sunil recovers in the dungeon and wanders around till he hears the monster from his cage. He is about to open the cage when the old man suddenly appears and stops him from doing so. He leads Sunil out of the dungeon tells him the story of his life and the monster. Vikram goes back to the dungeon to check for himself that Sunil is dead. He hears the monster and unknowingly releases him getting himself killed. The monster now free goes on a violent rampage, killing people everywhere. Everybody vacates the mansion at once fleeing by bus. Seema unwisely stays behind going another escape route and the monster sexually assaults and murders her. 
The monster makes his way to the bus that has broken down by a church and the monster kills two girls and the old man as well. Sunil, Anita and four other friends run into the church. Sunil discovers that holy elements (cross, holy water and visible images of Jesus and Mary) present fatal weaknesses to the monster. They apply all these elements and drive it out of the church; and with a spark of divine intervention, a large cross atop the church falls out and eventually kills the monster. The film ends with Sunil and Anita lighting candles at the church and starting a new life together.

Information war during the Russia–Georgia war

The 2008 South Ossetia War included an extensive information war, fought over historically poor communications infrastructure in the region.
Escalation.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin accused foreign media of pro-Georgian bias in their coverage of the conflict between Georgia and Russia over breakaway South Ossetia. "We want television screens in the West to be showing not only Russian tanks, and texts saying Russia is at war in South Ossetia and with Georgia, but also to be showing the suffering of the Ossetian people, the murdered elderly people and children, the destroyed towns of South Ossetia, and Tskhinvali. This would be an objective way of presenting the material," he said in a statement to Russian news agencies. Western media coverage of the events in the separatist republic is "a politically motivated version" in the eyes of government officials. Many Western media editors disagreed. however, "The Washington Post", for example, argued that Moscow was engaging in "mythmaking".
On August 11, 2008, Russia Today TV accused CNN of presenting video footage of destruction in Tskhinvali in South Ossetia, shot by a Russia Today cameraman, as pictures of destruction in Gori. CNN has not denied the accusation. Western media has defended its coverage, with Chris Birkett, executive editor of Sky News saying: "I don't think there’s been a bias. Accusations of media bias are normal in times of war. We’ve been so busy with the task of newsgathering and deployment that the idea we've managed to come up with a conspiratorial line in our reporting is bananas." CNN has also defended its coverage.
William Dunbar, a reporter for Russia Today TV in Georgia, resigned in protest of alleged bias in the Russian media. He "claimed he had not been on air since he mentioned Russian bombing of targets inside Georgia... He told "The Moscow Times": "The real news, the real facts of the matter, didn't conform to what they were trying to report, and therefore, they wouldn't let me report it. I felt that I had no choice but to resign."" However one senior journalist from Russia Today TV called Dunbar's allegations of bias "nonsense". "The Russian coverage I have seen has been much better than much of the Western coverage," he said, adding, "My view is that Russia Today is not particularly biased at all. When you look at the Western media, there is a lot of genuflection towards the powers that be. Russian news coverage is largely pro-Russia, but that is to be expected."
August 12 through 15.
Human Rights Watch initially called the Russian death toll figure of 2,000 unfounded, citing a doctor who said that between August 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded, more military than civilian. The doctor also said that 44 bodies had been brought to the hospital since the fighting began, both military and civilian. According to HRW, "the doctor was adamant that the majority of people killed in the city had been brought to the hospital before being buried". Human Rights Watch group stated later, however, that
"The 44 figure became the subject of controversy as some mistakenly characterized this as Human Rights Watch's definitive figure on civilian casualties, and others used this as evidence of bias. We were fully aware and noted in media statements that the figures provided from Tskhinvali hospital were not a comprehensive tally. Some of the residents killed in Tskhinvali and especially in the outlying villages were never brought to the hospital; instead, a number of people were buried beside their homes."
Human Rights Watch also state that "Human Rights Watch does not have the capacity to make a definitive estimate as to the number of civilian casualties." But they site different investigation groups, which provide numbers between 160 to 300-400 civilian casualties. Anna Neistat, leader of a HRW team investigating the humanitarian damage in South Ossetia, told "The Guardian" that
While acknowledging that third-party investigations were incomplete, she claimed that the death toll placed by South Ossetian "and" Russian authorities (of "over" 2,000) was "suspicious" and "very doubtful". The South Ossetians later claimed that 1,492 were killed as the result of the bombing of Tskhinvali.
On August 13, Fox News interviewed 12-year-old Ossetian-American girl Amanda Kokoeva, Thereafter the anchorman said "as we know, there are grey areas in war" as the program came to an end. CBS also had an interview with this girl before.
Russian media paid much attention to this incident. It was highlightened in particular on NTV (Russia) and Russia 1. However, the Russian channels allowed many inaccuracies and even editing themselves. First both channels created impression that the anchor stopped the conversation as soon as Amanda's aunt expressed the thought that it was Georgia to blame for the conflict. However, they failed to show that Amanda has been saying the same for almost a minute before, and the anchor did not interrupt her. Second Russia 1 edited the sound superimposing what is supposed to be anchors cough on Amanda's aunt talk, creating an impression that he was trying to prevent audience from hearing her. While in the original footage this sound is absent. The reporters from NTV (Russia) translated the words of Amanda thanking Russian troops while showing Amanda's aunt talking. Both channels also failed to translate the words of an anchor that "the commercial brake would interrupt the broadcast whether they liked it or not"
Regarding the Russian control of Gori, Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, denied that Russian troops were occupying Gori, saying that Russian soldiers "are not in Gori, have never been in Gori and do not occupy Gori," and rejecting news reports that the town was in ruins. Only a day later, Russian Major-General Vyacheslav Borisov addressed reporters in Gori, announcing that the Russian troops would leave Gori 2 days later. The final withdrawal came 10 days after Borisov's interview.
BBC News world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds filed a story on August 15 citing the reports of refugee Ossetians in Russia and a Human Rights Watch report describing much of the damage in Tskhinvali as due to Georgian fire in concluding that the Georgian attack into South Ossetian on August 7 was being "played down" contrary to the "evidence". Reynolds called attention to what he considered exaggerated Georgian claims and the fact most of the western media is based in Georgia (the cause of this, as he writes, being Russia's reluctance to admit western media) is his story about how "mud" thrown in the "propaganda war" has "stuck" to Russia: "the Bush administration appears to be trying to turn a failed military operation by Georgia into a successful diplomatic operation against Russia.
August 17 through September.
On August 17 "The New York Times" reported that while Russian authorities "have given Western journalists little or no access" to areas under its control, "Russian journalists are allowed to move around freely." On August 21 the paper reported that a clip of a Fox News Channel live interview The Russian Mission to the UN published transcript of the interview quoted Sergei Ivanov in detail:
"For everyone in the United States who was here and for everyone in the United States who has been watching this story and has watched the developments since Friday, can you tell me why Russian tanks, troops, warplanes are in, have been in Georgia?""That is a very easy question. First of all, good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to be with you. I have an impression that the American public thinks or intends to think that Russia attacked Georgia.""That what we have heard from the President of Georgia, in his words…""Yes, exactly. Thanks for prompting me on that. [... A big Russian bear attacked a small peaceful Georgia. In fact, the situation is and was vice-versa. It was a big Georgia which attacked a small and tiny breakaway Republic of South Ossetia."
"The New York Times" article resumed the discussion thus:
"A big Russian bear attacked a small, peaceful Georgia,” said Mr. Ivanov, a deputy prime minister, before seeking to undo the damage. “In fact, the situation is and was vice versa. It was a big Georgia which attacked a small and tiny breakaway republic of South Ossetia."
"Der Spiegel" reported that Lev Gudkov, director of the Levada Center, claimed that "On TV there is hardly any free reporting — instead you see a lot of very aggressive propaganda." He claimed summarily it was reminiscent of the worst of times in the Soviet era.
Russia Today TV reported that Europe’s largest magazine, "Der Spiegel", was accused by one of its staff members, Pavel Kassin, of propaganda and taking a pro-American stance. Kassin said he sent 29 pictures showing the devastation left by the Georgian military in South Ossetia to the magazine’s Hamburg headquarters, but was shocked to find that none of them appeared in the issue released the following Monday. Kassin had been working there for 18 years and has never before had any problems getting his photographs published. "Could it be that the most liberal, democratic and independent magazine has gone down the road of ideological one-sided propaganda?" he said. "In my view this is one of the rare cases when "Spiegel" has taken a pro-American one-sided stance." According to Kassin the photos were rejected on political reasons. The decision is considered to be influenced by the ousting in February 2008 of the editor-in-chief Stefan Aust, who had worked for many years in Der Spiegel, and his replacement with Georg Mascolo who had been leading the Washington subdivision of the magazine.
Russian intervention.
According to delayed reports published by some Russian news media, and confirmed by Georgian intelligence, some units of Russia's 58th Army had been deployed in South Ossetia prior to 7 August for the military exercise. However, according to an article in "Der Spiegel", western intelligence agencies reported that Georgia began their artillery assault on Tskhinvali at 10:35 p.m. on August 7, less than an hour before Saakashvili claims Russian tanks entered the Roki Tunnel. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Uvarov claimed in September 2008 troops were ordered through the tunnel to reinforce forces in Tskhinvali around dawn on August 8. Georgia disputed this Russian explanation, rotations of the Russian peacekeeping battalion could be conducted only in daylight and after not less than a month of advance notification according to a mutual agreement in 2004.
On 11 August Agence France-Presse quoted an unnamed United States Defense official as saying: "There was no obvious buildup of Russian forces along the border that signaled an intention to invade. Once it did happen they were able to get the forces quickly and it was just a matter of taking the roads in." Jamestown Foundation affiliated military analyst and "Novaya Gazeta" observer Pavel Felgenhauer said he believed that "Russia's invasion of Georgia had been planned in advance, with the final political decision to complete the preparations and start war in August apparently having been made back in April." The "Financial Times" later concluded, upon analysing weeks worth of information, that: "So swift was the Russian reaction that some analysts believe that, while it did not appear to precede the Georgian assault on Tskhinvali, as Mr Saakashvili claims, it may have been planned in advance, with Mr Saakashvili simply falling into a well prepared Russian trap."

Sotigui Kouyaté

Sotigui Kouyaté (19 July 1936 – 17 April 2010) was one of the first Burkinabé actors. He was the father of film director Dani Kouyaté
and was a member of the Mandinka ethnic group. 
Members of Kouyaté lineage or clan have served as griots for the Keita clan since at least the 13th century. The Kouyatés guard customs, and their knowledge is authoritative among Mandinkas. Keitas have to provide amenities to Kouyatés, who in turn should not hesitate to ask for Keita help. The word Kouyaté translates as "there is a secret between you and me".
Biography.
Sotigui Kouyaté was born in Mali to Guinean parents and is Burkinabé by adoption. When he was a child, he enjoyed koteba performances. He once played on the Burkina Faso national football team. Kouyaté began his theatre career in 1966, when he appeared as adviser to the king in a historical play produced by his friend Boubacar Dicko. That year, he founded a theatre company with 25 people and soon wrote his first play, "The Crocodile’s Lament".
Kouyaté has worked with Peter Brook on his theater and film projects since they became associated with one another while working on Brook's adaptation of the Indian epic "The Mahabharata" in 1983. Kouyaté has appeared in over two dozen films, most recently as Jacob in "Genesis" and Alioune in "Little Senegal". Kouyaté played the central role of Djeliba Kouyaté in Dani Kouyaté's 1995 film "Keïta! l'Héritage du griot", the character being imagined as an old dying man by his son, though portrayed as more forceful than that. The elder Kouyaté also plays instruments, simple melodies on the kora or flute.
From 1990 to 1996 Kouyaté toured the United States and Europe as part of La Voix du Griot ("Voice of the Griot"), a storytelling theater show he founded. When asked in an October 2001 interview whether he felt he was carrying a message from Africa, he replied:
In 2009, Kouyaté won a Silver Bear at the Berlinale Filmfestival for his acting. He played the main male character in Rachid Bouchareb's drama "London River", about the 2005 London bombings. On 17 April 2010, he died in Paris.
Sotigui Kouyate: 
A Modern Griot 
Director: Mahamat-Saleh Haroun
From: Chad/France
Year: 1996 Minutes:58
Language: French with English subtitles
Genre: Documentary
When casting "The Mahabharata", Peter Brook’s assistant scoured through film studios in search of an actor to take on one of the lead roles, Bhisma the sage. “I saw one shot of a tree and a man as tall and slender as this tree, with an extraordinary presence and quality. It was Sotigui,” recalls Brook in this documentary about the actor. Born in 1936 in Bamako (Mali), Kouyaté belongs to an illustrious family of griots–masters of words who are at once genealogists, historians, masters of ceremonies, advisers, mediators, singers and musicians. He has handed down all these talents, as a composer, dancer, actor and father, to his own children and a multitude of “spiritual children” dispersed across the world, for whom he is a precious guide. Filling each of his roles with profound dignity, he has appeared in some 60 films, including "Sia The Dream of the Python" directed by his son Dany Kouyate and "Names Live Nowhere" in which he follows African immigrants in Belgium and tells their story only as a griot could.
Through testimonies by Peter Brook, Jean-Claude Carriere, Jean-Pierre Guigane and Sotigui Kouyate himself, "Sotigui Kouyate: a Modern Griot" dresses the portrait of one of Africa’s greatest actor now based in Paris. From Africa to Europe, the film unveils the multiple facets of Sotigui Kouyate, actor, musician and modern griot. Winner ACCT award at the Amiens Film Festival, 1996.
"Despite years away from home and a career spanning many cultures, Malian actor and griot Sotigui Kouyaté has not strayed from his foremost mission: to break ignorance of Africa's living traditions and spark encounters across continents" - Cynthia Guttman, UNESCO "Courier".

Carson Grant is an American actor and artist. Grant has created characters and stories in visual mediums as drawings, paintings, in films and on stage.
Pursuing acting and art career.
1970s.
Grant moved to New York City in 1970 to study acting technique with Lee Strasberg. He joined the professional acting unions: Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and Actors' Equity Association; and was represented by the William Morris Agency, who created the stage name 'Carson Grant'. He trained with Wally Harper, who coached his baritone voice, and Phil Black who trained him with modern jazz and fencing.
Grant performed various acting roles with New York City Opera and began his film acting career in films as "Man on a Swing", "The Front" and "Death Wish". He portrayed 'Romeo' in "Romeo and Juliet" at New Jersey Shakespeare in the Park and was young 'Thomas Jefferson' in "The Last Ballot" in the WNET 13 Bicentennial series.
Grant painted large oil canvases and constructed many art installations in alternative exhibition spaces as part of the East Village, Manhattan 1970s Art Movement, participating in Colab, Charas PS64 - El Bohio, ABC No Rio, Fashion Moda; and many group art shows in the East Village, the Westside, and the Bronx in alternative spaces. Leo Castelli recognized Grant's installation of living sand sculptures 'Coney Island Bathing Beauties' shown in the "The Coney Island Art Show 1980," and his triptych 'In Life Turmoil' in the "Time Square Show" 1980 organized by Collaborative Project Inc. Colab. Grant had a cobalt blue 'graffiti tag' of a pine tree coastline with his initials CFG, and on a midnight graffiti session, he had painted ten foot high cobalt blue iris flowers stretching the block-long 100 foot wall on the Lower East Side Con Edison plant, at Avenue C and 14th Street, titled "Open your Irises", in protest of the pollution produced by the energy plant. Influenced by Robert Rauschenberg's use of art for social change, Grant's one-man exhibition was called "Nature-Nuclear" at the 1979 Jack Morris Gallery, NYC, where he constructed a large climb-up-into 'scarred Mother Earth Uterus' post-nuclear, with her distorted next-generation traveling down her maimed fallopian tubes into her contaminated womb (30' x 40'. The work, encouraged the viewer to consider alternative energy sources to protect our environment.
During this decade, he helped establish the 'Westside Arts Coalition' with a group of multi-discipline Upper West Side artists at Symphony Space to help establish exhibition spaces and affordable arts studios. In 1981, as the WSAC group marched to Lincoln Center to protest President Ronald Reagan's budget cuts to the Arts, Grant's photographs appeared on the front page of the Westsider Newspaper. In 1981, he organized a 'not-for-profit' art group called 'EAU' "Environmental Artists United" which created educational art exhibitions merging art and environmental conservation, which received grants from America the Beautiful Fund and Avon Foundation. Grant exhibited his artwork in alternative spaces throughout the boroughs, as one of the artists in the New York City 1970's and 1980's Art Movement.
Graduating as a Psi Chi Honors Sociey recipient in Psychology and elected Psi Chi president at CUNY - Hunter College BA program, Grant's master thesis on the "Therapeutic Validity of Drama/Art Therapy", earned him an MA (Summa Cum Laude) at University of Connecticut. He pursued postgraduate work at Columbia University. Grant presented his research at Georgetown's Drama Therapy Association 1985 convention.
Art installations and digital media.
1980s.

He worked as a computer graphic artist, animator and editor using AT&T- NASA software, creating formats for the premiere of CD-ROM and DVD and Internet technology, for companies such as Fusion, Advanced Graphics, Exhibit Technologies, Carabineer, and Ogilvy & Mather Advertising.
Painting on the computer tablet, Carson created animations for the 1991 "Sony's Time Square Video Screen", present-day "Panasonic panel" hung on the One Times Square building, for the Ayer advertising campaign "Breakthrough with the Unexpected" animation of an egg cracking to release a butterfly and also projects for IBM, Intel, Kodak, DeBeers, Shell, American Express, and National Geographic's "Global Access Interactive Gallery" in Washington, DC.
1990s.
For the SIGGRAPH - 1990 Convention, Texas, to honor John F. Kennedy's memory, Grant constructed the suspended 3D hologram sculpture (100' x 100') titled "Harmony Mountain" inside the second floor of the old Dallas Union Train Station, where a viewer could walk around and under the mountainous shape. In the artist's words, "The installation's purpose was to harness viewers' peaceful thoughts and funnel them through the five pointed "Texas Star Vortex" (20' diameter) which was hung between the two massive exterior columns on the balcony over looking the historically tarnished Dallas Dealy Plaza and book depository. Grant was honored with the SIGGRAPH Vision in Art Award.
2000s.

Radiocarbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin

The Shroud of Turin, a linen cloth commonly associated with the crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ, has undergone numerous scientific tests, the most notable of which is radiocarbon dating, in an attempt to determine the relic's authenticity. In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from the Shroud to a range of 1260–1390CE, which coincides with the first appearance of the shroud in France in the 1350s.
This dating has been questioned by some, and doubts have been raised in particular regarding the representivity of the sample that was taken for testing.
History.
1978: the creation of S.Tu.R.P..
The idea of scientifically dating the shroud had first been proposed in the 1960s, but permission had been refused because the procedure would have required the destruction of too much fabric (almost 0.05 sq m ≅ 0.538 sq ft). The development in the 1970s of new techniques for radio-carbon dating, which required lower quantities of source material, prompted the Catholic Church to found the "Shroud of Turin Research Project" (S.Tu.R.P.), which involved about 30 scientists of various religious faiths, including non-Christians.
The S.Tu.R.P. group initially planned to conduct a range of different studies on the cloth, including radio-carbon dating. A commission headed by chemist Robert H. Dinegar and physicist Harry E. Gove consulted numerous laboratories which were able at the time (1982) to carbon-date small fabric samples. The six labs that showed interest in performing the procedure fell into two categories, according to the method they utilised:
To obtain independent and replicable results, and to avoid conflict between the laboratories, it was decided to let all interested laboratories perform the tests at the same time.
The 1985 rift between S.Tu.R.P. and the candidate labs.
In 1982, the S.Tu.R.P. group published the list of tests to be performed on the shroud; these aimed to identify how the image was impressed onto the cloth, to verify the relic's purported origin, and to identify better-suited conservation methods. However, a disagreement between the S.Tu.R.P. group and the candidate laboratories devolved into a P.R. rift: the S.Tu.R.P. group expected to perform the radiometric examination under its own aegis and after the other examinations had been completed, while the laboratories considered radio-carbon dating to be "the" priority test, which should be completed at the detriment of other tests, if necessary.
The "Turin protocol of 1986".
A meeting with ecclesiastic authorities took place on September 29, 1986 to determine the way forward. In the end, a compromise solution was reached with the so-called "Turin protocol", which stated that:
The Vatican subsequently decided to adopt a different protocol instead.
These deviations were heavily criticized. 
The blind-test method was abandoned, because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample. Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly. Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the four not selected by the Vatican), argued in an open letter published in "Nature" that discarding the blind-test method would expose the results - whatever they may be - to suspicion of unreliability. However in a 1990 paper Gove conceded that the "arguments often raised, … that radiocarbon measurements on the shroud should be performed blind seem to the author to be lacking in merit … lack of blindness in the measurements is a rather insubstantial reason for disbelieving the result."
In the heated debate that followed, a Church's spokesperson declared that 
The final protocol.
The proposed changes to the Turin protocol sparked another heated debate among scientists, and the sampling procedure was postponed.
On April 17, 1988, ten years after the S.Tu.R.P. project had been initiated, British Museum scientific director Michael Tite published in Nature the "final" protocol:
Among the most obvious differences between the final version of the protocol and the previous ones stands the decision to sample from a single location on the cloth. This is particularly significant because, should the chosen portion be in any way not representative of the remainder of the shroud, the results would only be applicable to that portion of the cloth.
A further, relevant difference was the deletion of the blind test method, considered by most scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method. The blind-test method was abandoned because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample. Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly.
Account of the testing process.
Sampling (April 1988).
Samples were taken on April 21, 1988 in the Cathedral by Franco Testore, an expert on weaves and fabrics, and by Giovanni Riggi, a representative of the maker of bio-equipment "Numana". Testore performed the weighting operations, while Riggi made the actual cut. Also present were Cardinal Ballestrero, four priests, archdiocese spokesperson Luigi Gonella, photographers, a camera operator, Michael Tite of the British Museum and the labs' representatives. 
As a precautionary measure, a piece twice as big as the one required by the protocol was cut from the Shroud; it measured . A strip showing coloured filaments of uncertain origin was discarded. The remaining sample, measuring and weighing 300 mg, was first divided in two equal parts, one of which was preserved in a sealed container, in the custody of the Vatican, in case of future need. The other half was cut into three segments, and packaged for the labs in a separate room by Dr Tite and the archbishop. The lab representatives were not present at this packaging process, in accordance with the protocol. 
The labs were also each given three control samples (one more than originally intended), that were:
May–September 1988.
Tucson performed the tests in May, Zürich in June, and Oxford in August, and communicated their results to the British Museum.
On September 28, 1988, British Museum director and coordinator of the study Michael Tite communicated the official results to the Diocese of Turin and to the Holy See. 
Official announcement.
In a well-attended press conference on October 13, Cardinal Ballestrero announced the official results, i.e. that radio-carbon testing dated the shroud to a date of 1260-1390 CE, with 95% confidence.
The official and complete report on the experiment was published in "Nature". The uncalibrated dates from the individual laboratories, with 1-sigma errors (68% confidence), were as follows:
As reported in "Nature", Professor Bray of the Instituto di Metrologia 'G. Colonetti', Turin, "confirmed that the results of the three laboratories were mutually compatible, and that, on the evidence submitted, none of the mean results was questionable."
Criticisms of the dating result.
The sample was part of a later repair.
Although the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth. It is hypothesised that the sampled area was a medieval repair which was conducted by "invisible reweaving". Since the C14 dating at least four articles have been published in scholarly sources contending that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole shroud. These included a 2005 article by Raymond Rogers, who conducted chemical analysis for the Shroud of Turin Research Project and who was involved in work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Raymond Rogers argued in a 2005 article that the chemical analysis he performed show traces of tanning products, likely used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection, and stated: "The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/mordant coating and cotton fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials". Rogers stated that after further study he was convinced that: "The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken." Rogers' conclusions are however based on a study of a few threads that Rogers believed were taken from the C14 shroud sample, but there is no evidence to support their provenance or that they are indeed representative of the C14 sample.
The official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample "came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas."
In 2008 former STURP member John Jackson rejected the possibility that the C14 sample may have been conducted on a medieval repair fragment, on the basis that the radiographs and transmitted light images taken by STURP in 1978 clearly show that the natural colour bandings present throughout the linen of the shroud propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would later provide the sample for radiocarbon dating. Jackson stated that this could not have been possible if the sampled area was a later addition. 
Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is an expert in the restoration of textiles, who headed the restoration and conservation of the Turin Shroud in 2002. She has written that it’s possible to repair a coarsely woven fabric in such a way as to be invisible, if the damage was not too severe and the original warp threads are still present, but that it is never possible to repair a fine fabric in a way which would be truly invisible, as the repair will always be "unequivocally visible on the reverse of the fabric." She criticized the theory that the C14 tests were done on an invisible patch as "wishful thinking". She states that Gabriel Vial, a textile expert who was present when the sample was taken, confirmed repeatedly that the sample was taken from the original cloth, and that "neither on the front nor on the back of the whole cloth is the slightest hint of a mending operation, a patch or some kind of reinforcing darning, to be found."
In 2010, professors of statistics Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: "The effect is not large over the sampled region … our estimate of the change is about two centuries."
According to professor Christopher Ramsey of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit in 2011, "There are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up." 
In December 2010 Professor Timothy Jull, a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal "Radiocarbon", coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and found no evidence of a repair, nor of any dyes or other treatments. They found "only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers" and concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.
In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Cesare Nosiglia, Archbishop of Turin and Custodian of the Holy Shroud, responded that "as it is not possible to be certain that the analyzed material was taken from the fabric of the Shroud, the Holy See and the Papal Custodian declare that no serious value can be recognized to the results of such experiments."
The dating contradicts other evidence.
Raymond Rogers argued in the scientific journal "Thermochimica Acta" that the presence of vanillin differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: "The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300- and 3000-years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years". Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates. Rogers also noted that the thread he examined contained a significant amount of cotton, and stated that cotton was absent in the main-body of the Shroud. 
It has further been stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment - heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth. Rogers’ analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as Joe Nickell, who reasons that the conclusions of the author, Raymond Rogers, result from "starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence".
The sample was contaminated.
In 1993 Dr. Leoncio A. Garza-Valdes discovered the presence of polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA)-producing bacteria "Leobacillus rubrus" on Shroud's fabric and confirmed their presence on three Egyptian mummies. According to Garza-Valdes, "the scientists that carried out the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin in 1988, were not aware of the presence of this unsuspected contaminant (natural plastic coating)". Garza-Valdes outlines further, that while studying thin sections from the Shroud fibers it was found that "more than 60% of the fibers' area is bioplastic". Pictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842 indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Wilson and others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.
Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), has also hypothesised that a “bioplastic” bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, would render the tests inaccurate. He has however also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing.
STURP scientist Dr John Jackson has discounted the hypothesis that the sample was contaminated by more recent bioplastic residues from microbial action, on the basis that the samples were carefully cleaned first to eliminate this kind of contamination, and that the quantity of microbial mass required to skew the results would be significantly greater than the mass of the linen itself.
Rodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight. Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe Raman analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers.
Professor Gove notes that different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, and that even if some slight contamination remained, about two thirds of the sample would need to consist of modern material to swing the result away from a 1st Century date to a Medieval date. He inspected the Arizona sample material before it was cleaned, and determined that no such gross amount of contamination was present even before the cleaning commenced.
Others have suggested that the silver of the molten reliquiary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth. The Russian Dmitri Kouznetsov, an archaeological biologist and chemist, claimed in 1994 to have managed to experimentally reproduce this purported enrichment of the cloth in ancient weaves, and published numerous articles on the subject between 1994 and 1996. Kouznetsov's results could not be replicated, and no actual experiments has been able to validate this theory, so far. Professor Gian Marco Rinaldi and others proved that Kouznetsov never performed the experiments described in his papers, citing non-existent fonts and sources, including the museums from which he claimed to have obtained the samples of ancient weaves on which he performed the experiments. The Russian was arrested in 1997 on American soil under allegations of accepting bribes by magazine editors to produce manufactured evidence and false reports.
Likewise proposed was a reaction with carbon monoxide (CO), a trace gas present in air, which it was claimed could add additional “fresh” C14 to the sample. However carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure.
The 2008 documentary "Sindone, prove a confronto" (lit., "The Shroud, comparing evidence") by David Rolfe suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries, as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at Chambéry. Other theories include that candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon-dating unreliable as a dating tool.
The calculations were done incorrectly.
In 1994, J. A. Christen applied a strong statistical test to the radiocarbon data and concludes that the given age for the shroud is, from a statistical point of view, correct.
However critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in "Nature": including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% - rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold. None of these errors would however produce an altered dating supportive of a 1st Century manufacture.
In 2008 the director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Christopher Ramsey, told the BBC that "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence". Ramsey has stressed that he would be surprised if the 1988 tests were shown to be far off, let alone "a thousand years wrong", but said that he would keep an open mind.
Books discussing the carbon-dating.
There are two books with detailed treatment of the Shroud's carbon dating, including not only the scientific issues but also the events, personalities and struggles leading up to the sample taking. The books offer opposite views on how the dating should have been conducted, and both are critical of the methodology finally employed.
In "Relic, Icon or Hoax? Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud" (1996; ISBN 0-7503-0398-0), Harry Gove provides an account of the interaction between Prof Carlos Chagas, chairman of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and Cardinal Ballestrero, with Gove and Gonella. He provides a detailed record of meetings, telephone conversations and correspondence.
"The Rape of the Turin Shroud" by William Meacham (2005; ISBN 1-4116-5769-1) devotes 100 pages to the carbon dating. Meacham is also highly critical of STURP and Gonella, and also of Gove. He describes the planning process from a very different perspective (both he and Gove were invited along with 20 other scholars to a conference in Turin in 1986 to plan the C-14 protocol) and focuses on what he claims was the major flaw in the dating: taking only one sample from the corner of the cloth. Meacham reviews the main scenarios that have been proposed for a possibly incorrect dating, and claims that the result is a "rogue date" because of the sample location and anomalies. He points out that this situation could easily be resolved if the Church authorities would simply allow another sample to be dated, with appropriate laboratory testing for possible embedded contaminants.

Legendary origins.
According to legend, around the seventh century AD (some sources mention that it was probably 721) Prince Krak came from Kraków. Visiting the area, he found the site of the current Wąwolnica, which he named Wąwelnica- from the name of his home. In fact, the coat of arms shows St. George.
History.
Wąwolnica is one of the oldest settlements in Lesser Poland (initially in Sandomierz Voivodeship, and then in Lublin Voivodeship). Together with Bochotnica it formed the heart of the local administrative unit. A manuscript years stored in a monastery on Łysa Góra states: "In 1027 the Fathers of our monastery parish ministry did newly established and newly converted to the Holy Faith Wawelnica settlement." Traces of people here go back to the Stone Age.
Notable buildings.
The present parish church, i honour of St. Adalbert (St Wocjiech Church) was built from 1907-1914. The church was designed by K Drozdowski in the style of "neo-Vistula", with three naves and red brick. In the main altar is a statue of the Madonna from the thirteenth/fourteenth century, carved from lime tree, called the Mother of God, Wąwolnicką. In 2001, Pope John Paul II raised the church to the status of Minor Basilica. A church has been present on the site since the 11th century. 
Next to the church in the presbytery of what remains of the old church, there is a statue of Our Lady Kębelskiej - the object of numerous pilgrimages.

Wąwolnica is located on the edge of the Kazimierz Landscape Park, between the major tourist centers in a triangle of Puławy - Kazimierz Dolny - Nałęczów.

__NOTOC__
The Jurca MJ-14 "Fourtouna" () was a racing aircraft designed in France in the late 1970s. It was an unconventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tailwheel undercarriage. The fuselage had a low profile that required the pilot to sit in a reclined position. The vertical stabiliser was very small, but aft of the cockpit, the fuselage changed shape from being low and broad to being high and narrow.

United States federal building security

United States federal building security refers to the security of federal government installations in the United States. A variety of measures are undertaken to make the buildings safer, while preserving an "open" architecture consistent with democratic governance. This includes glass glazing to reduce the potential for injuries from shattering glass; greater standoff distances implemented by preventing unscreened traffic from approaching within a certain distance of the building; and measures to prevent progressive collapse of buildings.
Security levels.
In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the government classified all buildings into five security levels and established minimum security requirements for them.
Level V.
These buildings contain mission functions critical to national security, such as the Pentagon or CIA Headquarters. A Level-V building should be similar to a Level-IV building in terms of number of employees and square footage. It should have at least the security features of a Level-IV building. The missions of Level-V buildings require that tenant agencies secure the site according to their own requirements.
Level IV.
This type of building has 451 or more federal employees; high volume of public contact; more than of space; and tenant agencies that may include high-risk law enforcement and intelligence agencies (e.g., ATF, FBI, and DEA), the Federal courts, and judicial offices, and highly sensitive government records.
Level III.
This is a building with 151 to 450 federal employees; moderate/high volume of public contact; 80,000 to of space; and tenant agencies that may include law enforcement agencies, court/related agencies and functions, and government records and archives. (According to GSA, at the request of the Judiciary, GSA changed the designation of a number of buildings housing agencies with court and court-related functions from Level III to Level IV.)
Level II.
This type of building has 11 to 150 federal employees; moderate volume of public contact; 2,500 to of space; and federal activities that are routine in nature, similar to commercial activities.
Level I.
This type of building has 10 or fewer federal employees; low volume of public contact or contact with only a small segment of the population; and 2,500 or less square feet of space, such as a small "store front" type of operation. This type of building is more vulnerable to attack.

Szczucin

Szczucin is a town in Dąbrowa County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Szczucin. It lies approximately north-east of Dąbrowa Tarnowska, north of Tarnów and east of the regional capital Kraków. The town has a population of 4,069.
Before Polish administrative reorganization (1999) Szczucin was part of Tarnów Voivodeship (1975–1998). Located on the Vistula river, Szczucin is the ending station of a secondary-importance, one track rail line Tarnów - Dąbrowa Tarnowska - Szczucin, built by the Austrian government in 1906. There were several plans to extend the line northwards, to Busko Zdroj and Kielce, but so far, they have not been carried out. Current shape of the line is the result of Szczucin’s having been located until 1918 on northern border of Austria-Hungary. The Vistula marked the border, beyond which stretched the Russian Empire, and the governments of both countries were not interested in completion of the line, which would otherwise have connected Austrian-controlled Tarnów with Russian-controlled Kielce. 
The town is placed along National Road nr. 73 (Warszawa - Kielce - Tarnów - Jasło), and here regional road nr. 982 stems eastwards, to Mielec, making Szczucin a local transportation hub. The name of the town probably comes from a 14-th century owner of the location, a man named "Szczuka".
History.
First mention of Szczucin (then known as "Sucin", later "Sczucin") comes from 1326, and it refers to a local parish church, which means that it must have been built earlier. Due to town’s location on the Vistula, a river port was established here. Timber from the forests of Sandomierz Wilderness was brought here, loaded on ships and hauled to Gdańsk, the biggest port of the Kingdom of Poland. Furthermore, Szczucin was a crossing point of the Vistula, along a north-south merchant trail. In 1780 the village obtained town rights, but in 1934 it lost them, as its population fell below the then required 3,000. Szczucin regained its town rights on 1 January 2009.
After the Partitions of Poland, Szczucin found itself on the Austrian - Russian border, and the town stagnated. In the autumn of 1914, during World War I, Szczucin was captured by the Russians, who remained here until 1915 (see Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive). In September 1939 Szczucin was the area of several skirmishes between retreating units of Kraków Army, and the advancing Wehrmacht. On September 12, 1939, German soldiers carried out a massacre of Polish POWs, who were kept at a local school. Altogether, 70 soldiers were killed, and this tragedy is commemorated by a monument. During the occupation, Szczucin was a center of resistance movement. In 1943, soldiers of Jędrusie executed here an officer of the Blue Police. In late 1944, Germans ordered evacuation of all Szczucin’s inhabitants, because they prepared defensive positions along the Vistula. 
Szczucin is home to Poland’s only Road Museum (Muzeum Drogownictwa), which has the area of two hectares, displaying ancient road building machines, as well as road signs, road posts, documents and other items.

Port-la-Joye–Fort Amherst

Port-la-Joye—Fort Amherst is a National Historic Site of Canada located in Rocky Point, Prince Edward Island.
This location has the double distinction of hosting one of the first Acadian settlements in present-day Prince Edward Island, as well as the first military fortification on the island while under control of France as well as the first military fortification on the island while under control of Britain.
From 1720 to 1770 Port-la-Joye, later named Fort Amherst, served as the seat of government and port of entry for settlers to the island while under both French and British control. As such, it played an important role as a colonial outpost in the French-British struggle for dominance in North America.
The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada on May 27, 1958 and the property was acquired by the Government of Canada in 1959. The present interpretive centre opened in 1973.
French settlement.
The first European settlers in the area were French military personnel from Fortress Louisbourg who founded a settlement in 1720 named Port La-Joye on the southwestern part of the harbour opposite the present-day city of Charlottetown. This settlement effort was led by Michel Haché-Gallant, who used his sloop to transport Acadian settlers from Louisbourg on Île Royal.
Acadian settlers established farms in the surrounding area while under French control from 1720–1745 and 1746–1758 and the French military established a small military force at the outpost, garrisoned with troops from Louisbourg. Morale was low and troops were infrequently relieved due to its unpopularity. The wood barracks were poor protection from harsh winters when wind, rain and snow swirled between picket walls and rotten planked roofs.
Battle at Port-la-Joye (1745).
The first Siege of Louisbourg by British military forces took place in May–June 1745 as part of King George's War. When the French commander of Louisbourg capitulated to the invasion force composed largely of New England irregulars, this also resulted in the "de facto" surrender of Île Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island).
Following the French surrender at Louisbourg, a British military detachment landed that summer at Port-la-Joye. Under the command of Joseph de Pont Duvivier, the French garrison at that time comprised 20 soldiers. The French troops fled while the British force burned the community to the ground. Duvivier and his soldiers retreated up the Northeast River (present-day Hillsborough River), pursued by the New Englanders until the French troops received reinforcements from local Acadian settlers and the Mi'kmaq. The French troops and their allies were able to drive the New Englanders back to their ships; in the process, nine New Englanders were killed, wounded or made prisoner while the New Englanders took six Acadians as hostages, who were threatened with execution should the Acadians or Mi'kmaq rebell against British control.
The British forces returned to Louisbourg while Duvivier and his 20 troops left to seek refuge in Quebec. After the fall of Louisbourg, the resident French population of Île Royal (present-day Cape Breton Island) were deported to France while the Acadians of Île Saint-Jean lived under the threat of deportation for the remainder of the war. 
Battle at Port-la-Joye (1746).
The British had left a garrison of 200 soldiers (New England irregulars and several British Army regulars) as well as two Royal Navy ships at Port-La-Joye to over-winter. 
To regain control of Acadia for France, Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay was sent from Quebec to the region in 1746 to join forces with the Duc d'Anville Expedition. Upon arriving at Fort Beausejour on the Isthmus of Chignecto, he sent French officer Boishébert to Île Saint-Jean on a reconnaissance to assess the size of the British forces. After Boishebert returned, de Ramezay sent Joseph-Michel Legardeur de Croisille et de Montesson along with over 500 men, 200 of whom were Mi'kmaq, to Port-La-Joye.
The battle took place in July 1746 near the site of Port-la-Joye on the banks of the Northeast River (present-day Hillsborough River). Montesson and his troops killed or imprisoned 34 of the New England irregulars and Montesson was commended for having distinguished himself in his first independent command.
The fall of Port-la-Joye saw Île Saint-Jean return to control by France. French military forces constructed a star-shaped fort on the site between 1748-1749 in a style influenced by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.
Seven Years' War.
The first three years of the Seven Years' War had relatively little impact on Île Saint-Jean, however, the deportation of Acadians from Nova Scotia as a result of the Bay of Fundy Campaign saw an influx of refugees to the colony in the late summer and fall of 1755.
In July 1758 the final Siege of Louisbourg saw the French commander surrender to British forces; just as in 1745, this surrender of the colony of Île-Royale (present day Cape Breton Island) also saw the "de facto" surrender of the colony of Île Saint-Jean and with it its capital at Port-la-Joye. In late August a small British fleet of four ships carrying 500 soldiers under command of Lord Rollo arrived at Port-la-Joye. Lord Rollo, travelling aboard , had been told to expect approximately 300-500 Acadians but was surprised to find roughly 3,000-5,000 instead. The British Army proceeded to round up approximately 3,000 Acadians for deportation back to France. Thirteen additional ships arrived by October and departed overseas; 700 lives being lost due to ships sinking en route to Europe and an estimated 900 additional lives being lost due to disease and illness during the deportation. Approximately 1,600 Acadians evaded capture by hiding in forests in the western part of what the British now called St. John's Island.
After the British seized control of Port-la-Joye they replaced the rudimentary French fortification with a new stockade fort immediately to the east (toward the water). It was built under the supervision of British Army Lieutenant William Spry who reported it to be complete on October 10, 1758. This fortification was named Fort Amherst in honour of General Jeffery Amherst.
The small fort was home to 190 soldiers from the 28th Regiment of Foot, also known as "The Old Braggs" in honour of their Colonel, Lieutenant-General Philip Bragg. The stockade was surrounded by a dry ditch and was crossed by a drawbridge. The foundation of the pallisade was porous sandstone. There were 18 cannon placed at the fort with 4 mounted in each corner and one mid-way on two of the walls. Buildings inside the fort included the commanding officer's headquarters, officer's quarters, soldier barracks, bakehouse, forge, storehouse and a prison. The British Army soldiers were rotated through the fort each spring with fresh replacements from Louisbourg.
A mutiny took place among the garrison at Fort Amherst in 1762, resulting in courts-martial at Louisbourg for the main people involved; demotions and hundreds of lashes by cat o'nine tails and one execution.
The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended the Seven Years' War which saw the garrison reduced at Fort Amherst.
British colonial period.
On March 6, 1764 Samuel Holland was appointed Surveyor-General of North America. On March 23, he received instructions to survey all British possessions north of the Potomac River, which included St. John's Island (present day Prince Edward Island), the Magdalen Islands and Royal Island (present day Cape Breton Island), because of their importance for the fisheries.
St. John’s Island was Holland's first stop on this assignment and he noted that the island's population had decreased significantly following the deportation of the Acadians in 1758. His survey of the island proposed an immigration and resettlement scheme based on a semi-feudal system of land distribution with a feudal land tenure tied to fees.
Holland arrived at Fort Amherst in summer 1764 with his family but realized the fortification was unsuitable for his use and chose instead to build a dwelling approximately south of the garrison at a location he named Observation Cove (present-day Holland Cove). From there, Holland, his deputy surveyor Thomas Wright, engineers, volunteers, and soldiers from Fort Amherst set out to complete the survey, enduring harsh conditions through the winter. The survey divided the island into a system of three counties, 15 parishes, 67 townships, 3 royalties and various town sites.
Holland's survey selected the site of present day Charlottetown to be the colonial capital of St. John's Island. In 1768 Charles Morris of Nova Scotia surveyed the town site for Charlottetown with the help of soldiers from Fort Amherst. Charlottetown was named the capital of St. John's Island by King George III in 1768, it being named after his Consort, Queen Charlotte.
The garrison at Fort Amherst was moved in 1770 to Charlottetown. This resulted in Fort Amherst being abandoned as a settlement and fortification. The palisade and buildings were demolished in the 1770s and by 1779 nothing was left but the ditch and earthworks.
On November 17, 1775 during the American Revolutionary War, the colonial capital of St. John's Island was attacked by Massachusetts-based privateers who stole the Colonial Seal and took several hostages. The Seal and the hostages were later released in Boston, Massachusetts.
In 1801 the British Army upgraded its defences of the colonial capital by establishing the Prince Edward Battery on the western edge of Charlottetown in present day Victoria Park. In support of the Prince Edward Battery's harbour defence duties, shore batteries of cannon were placed on each side of the entrance into Charlottetown Harbour. The western battery was placed southeast of the abandoned Fort Amherst earthworks near what is now known as "Blockhouse Point" in the community of Rocky Point. The eastern battery was placed northeast of the abandoned Fort Amherst earthworks at what is now known as "Battery Point" in the present day town of Stratford.
National Historic Site of Canada.
Following its abandonment by the British Army, the property became part of the township of Lot 65. The feudal owners of the township were Richard Wright, Esq., and Hugh Owens, Esq. In 1781, one half was sold for arrears (to the Owens Holding). The actual land containing the abandoned fortification was the first governor of St. John's Island, Walter Patterson, who acquired the land in 1773. Governor Patterson and his wife, Hester Warren, built a farmhouse on the property and named it "Warren Farm". Patterson was removed from office in 1786 and the land was left vacant until 1796 when his title was nullified.
A variety of landowners farmed the property until 1959 when it was purchased by the Government of Canada for preservation; the federal government having designated the property a National Historic Site of Canada the previous year on May 27, 1958.
The present interpretive centre was officially opened in 1973 as part of Prince Edward Island's celebration of its centennial since joining Confederation.
Special events.
In July 1989 the Port-la-Joye - Fort Amherst National Historic Site of Canada was host to the 7th Canadian Scout Jamboree - "CJ '89" - which resulted in the property becoming the 2nd largest population centre in the province over a two-week period with over 10,000 campers.

Sons of Vulcan

The Sons of Vulcan was an American labor union which existed from 1858 until 1876. The union recruited puddlers, skilled craftsmen who manipulated pig iron to create steel. In the 1870s, it was the strongest union in the United States. It merged with two other iron and steel unions in 1876 to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers—the forerunner of the United Steelworkers.
Formation.
Puddling is the process of stirring pig iron with iron bars, exposing it to the air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. This process creates steel. As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill. Because chemical testing of the molten iron had not yet been developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether too much or too little carbon had been oxidized. Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to boil and bubble as the puddler stirred in scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.
The first strike in the iron and steel industry in the United States took place among puddlers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from December 20, 1849, to May 12, 1850. The employers broke the strike by cutting wages and hiring new puddlers. Labor relations in the iron and steel industry remained tense for much of the next decade. Wages plunged during the Panic of 1857, and the steel industry was slow to recover.
On April 12, 1858, a group of puddlers met at a hotel bar on Diamond Street to form a labor union, which they called the "Iron City Forge of the Sons of Vulcan". The new union resolved to commit itself to craft unionism, accepting only puddlers as members. Miles Humphreys was the new union's "Grand Master" (leader), and offices were established for a vice president ("Grand Vulcan") and secretary. The new union did little for two years, fearing the blacklist. The union's national leadership received no pay, but this changed in 1866 when the three national officers were paid the average industry wage in exchange for devoting full time to union business. Membership in the union was kept secret, for fear of labor spies and physical retaliation.
The Civil War led to a sharp increase in the demand for steel, and wages rose substantially. Employers were loath to fire puddlers during the war because so few replacement workers could be found. This led to renewed interest in the Sons of Vulcan, which expanded rapidly. The locals formed a national union in Pittsburgh on September 8, 1862, calling itself the "Grand Forge of the United States, United Sons of Vulcan".
Expansion.
A second annual convention was held in Wheeling in the newly formed state of West Virginia in 1862, at which a constitution and bylaws were adopted.
As it became apparent in June 1864 that the Civil War might be coming to a close, employers attempted to cut wages. The union responded with a nationwide strike of its members, which lasted eight months. The strike ended on February 13, 1865, when the employers agreed to a wage scale based on the price of iron bars—the first time employers recognized the union, the first union contract in the iron and steel industry, and what may be the first union contract of any kind in the United States.
At the union's convention in Buffalo, New York which opened August 7, 1865, Humphreys reported that "forges" (as local unions of the organization were called) had been established in Illinois, Kentucky, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and the union's membership had tripled. The following year, the union began employing paid organizers across the East. The union had 36 active forges and 1,514 members in 1867.
The union's strike policy, however, nearly proved its undoing. Initially, only the workers with a grievance would strike, with the majority of other workers in the refinery continuing to work. Absent union solidarity, employers easily broke strikes. Financial support for striking workers was provided by voluntary contributions from fellow "forge" members, not the national union. This strike policy led to the collapse of 11 local unions in 1867 and 16 more in 1868. The union counted only 600 members in 1868. In 1870, the Sons of Vulcan instituted a new policy in which only the national union could approve a strike and all workers in a local "forge" were required to walk out if a strike was approved. Additionally, the national union began providing limited financial support to strikers. These changes significantly improved the union's stability, and membership climbed to 3,331 members in 83 "forges" in 12 states by 1873.
The union saw a membership decline of about 25 percent after the Panic of 1873. Nonetheless, by 1876 the Sons of Vulcan was the strongest labor union in the U.S.
Merger.
Other iron and steel unions had also formed in the post-Civil War period, and in 1873 merger of the largest unions was proposed. The Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers, and Roughers had formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1861. This craft union recruited the skilled workers who rolled steel in railroad track mills, but soon expanded its membership to rollers throughout the iron and steel industry. Another union, the Iron and Steel Roll Hands of the United States, formed in Chicago in 1870. This union attracted anyone whom the Associated Brotherhood would not permit as a member. The Roll Hands never achieved much membership growth, which led the union to propose merger as a way of combatting employer resistance to unions.
The main impetus for merger was the growing failure of many strikes. If the puddlers struck, steel and iron already manufactured would continue to be milled by the rollers, heaters, roughers and other mill hands. This enabled the employeer to continue to manufacture product and receive revenue, and so outlast the union. The movement to form an industrial union began in Columbus, Ohio, where locals of the Sons of Vulcan, Associated Brotherhood and Roll Hands amalgamated into a single union. The National Labor Tribune, a newspaper dedicated to labor issues in the iron and steel industry, discussed industrial unionism extensively for the next year. On December 10, 1874, locals of all three unions from Columbus, Louisville, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana, met in Louisville to formulate a proposal, which was published in the National Labor Tribune.
After three years of negotiation, the three unions merged to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. At its convention in Troy, New York, in 1874, the Sons of Vulcan debated the industrial union proposal, and reacted favorably to it. However, the union took no formal action. The Roll Hands sent a representative to the Associated Brotherhood convention of July 1874 to negotiate a merger of the unions. Merger was effected in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 6, 1875. The Sons of Vulcan, meeting at the same time in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, did not accept merger at that time. The Sons of Vulcan replied on August 23, 1875, and informed the merging unions that they would participate. The three unions met in Pittsburgh on December 7, 1875, and drafted a constitution and bylaws. The three unions met separately in Emerald Hall in Pittsburgh on August 2, 1876, and adopted the resolution for amalgamation. On August 3, the three unions as well as a fourth (the United Nailers) met to debate and adopt the new constitution. The new Amalgamated Association was formed on August 4, 1876.
The Sons of Vulcan provided 85 percent of the new union's membership, and dominated the new organization for much of its early history. Its membership was almost exclusive to the iron industry, as steelmaking was still in its infancy.

Soft tissue disorder

Soft tissue disorders are medical conditions affecting soft tissue.
Often soft tissue injuries are some of the most chronically painful and difficult to treat because it is very difficult to see what is going on under the skin with the soft connective tissues, fascia, joints, muscles and tendons.
Musculoskeletal specialists, manual therapists and neuromuscular physiologists and neurologists specialize in treating injuries and ailments in the soft tissue areas of the body. These specialized clinicians often develop innovative ways to manipulate the soft tissue to speed natural healing and relieve the mysterious pain that often accompanies soft tissue injuries. This area of expertise has become known as soft tissue therapy and is rapidly expanding as the technology continues to improve the ability of these specialists to identify problem areas more quickly.
A promising new method of treating wounds and soft tissue injuries is via platelet growth factor (PGF).
There is a close overlap between the term "soft tissue disorder" and rheumatism. Sometimes the term "soft tissue rheumatic disorders" is used to describe these conditions.
