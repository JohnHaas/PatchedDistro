Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance

The Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance (CHLA) was a labor organization formed in 1933 to protect the civil rights of overseas Chinese living in North America and "to help Chinese laundry workers break their isolation in American society." An openly left-wing organization, the CHLA used various means — including the slogans "To Save China, To Save Ourselves" and "Resist Japan and Save China” — to oppose the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
Background.
In the United States and Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the occupation of laundry worker was heavily identified with Chinese Americans to the extent that it became "the stereotypical occupation of a whole ethnic group." Racial discrimination, lack of English language skills, and a deficit of economic capital kept most Chinese Americans out of more desirable careers. Around the turn of the 20th century, one in four ethnic Chinese men in the United States worked in a laundry. Conditions were hard and a typical launderer worked for ten to sixteen hours a day.
According to one description:
Laundry work was especially wearisome, because it meant the soaking, scrubbing, and ironing of clothing solely by hand; moreover, prompt and high quality service was necessary to keep customers satisfied. Workers in laundries and groceries received the going wage of twenty-five dollars per month, and despite long hours the work-week was seven days. For the majority of the Chinese, then, the daily routine was almost solely working, eating, and sleeping. There were a few other occupations available to Chinese.
New York City and the formation of the CHLA.
At the beginning of the Great Depression, New York City had approximately 3,550 Chinese laundries. According to a first hand account:
Chinese laundrymen relied on their hands. On the door of every Chinese laundry were these two big words
in red paint, "Hand Laundry," meaning all ironing was done by hand. In New York, perhaps seven out of ten Chinese survived by working in Chinese Hand Laundries. At the end of almost every residential block or alley, there was always a Chinese laundry. A Chinese laundry was usually small — about the size of five dining tables, equipped only with an ironing board and a shelf to put cleaned, ironed clothes that were packaged and ready to go.
With the support of white people in that same industry, in 1933 the New York City Board of Aldermen passed a law intended to drive the Chinese out of the business. Among other things, it limited ownership of laundries to United States citizens. When their efforts were unsuccessfully opposed by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, a "conservative Chinese social organization", the openly leftist Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance was formed. Where the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association failed, the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance successfully challenged this provision of the law, thereby preserving the livelihood of thousands of Chinese laundry workers. In the wake of that success, the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance continued to advocate for the civil rights of Chinese in North America. For both members and non-members, the cost to engage the aid of the organization was twenty five cents.
Opposition to invasion of Manchuria.
The Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance also strongly opposed the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Like many overseas Chinese, organization members denounced the nonresistance of the China's ruling Kuomintang Party (KMT) led by Chiang Kai-shek and actively engaged in "Save China" campaigns to raise money for the resistant efforts of the Manchurian Chinese. The CHLA sent letters and telegrams to American politicians urging them to support Chinese resistance and to take an anti-Japanese stance.
CHLA members also appealed directly to the customers of their New York area laundries and published articles such as one (originally published in Chinese) in a 1937 edition of the "Chinese Vanguard" which describes their efforts in some detail:
The New York Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance has been extremely dedicated to the work of resisting Japan to save our country. Immediately following the Marco Polo Bridge incident, the HLA began to organize a campaign to raise funds for China. Aside from the sum of around 4,300 Silver Dollars that the HLA collected during its first and second period of fund-raising and which was already sent to China, the Alliance has raised an additional 1,230 Silver Dollars and twenty-seven cents during its third fund-raising period. This sum was given to the two gentlemen Chen Yeh and Chen Chia, who wired it directly from the Bank of China to the Treasury Department of the Chinese Central Government, so that the money could be used to supplement the government’s military funds...because the Alliance realizes that most Americans sympathize with our country, it has initiated a number of activities aimed at Americans, such as that of soliciting donations for medical supplies from American customers of hand laundries. It also contributed significantly by distributing English-language publicity material that called for the boycott of Japanese goods. With winter approaching, refugees and wounded soldiers in China will be in desperate need of relief, and even western customers of hand laundries have frequently suggested that the Alliance broaden its campaign to collect funds for medical supplies. In response to this situation, the Alliance decided last month to broaden its fund-raising activities. It has recently made ready the first 5,000 donation boxes, which will be distributed to hand laundries for the purpose of collecting funds from laundry customers. In addition, on October 31, at 4 PM, the Alliance will be sponsoring an anti-Japan publicity conference at its headquarters, to which Professor Chi Chao...China’s representative to the Pacific Scholars' Conference—has been invited as a speaker. The Mayor of New York has been eagerly assisting the work of the Alliance, and will be sending as his representative to the conference the President of the City Council, Mr. Esser. Undoubtedly, Mr. Esser will be offering an eloquent speech to celebrate the patriotism of Chinese living in America. It is said that the Alliance will especially welcome the participation in the conference of Chinese active in all sectors of Chinese-American society.
An article in the same publication the following year stated in part:
Not only was the HLA the first organization in New York to advocate raising funds to assist Chinese military resistance against Japan after the occurrence of the Marco Polo Bridge incident, the Alliance also initiated the movement to collect donations from westerners by placing relief boxes in hand laundries. At the same times, the Alliance distributed English-language leaflets calling on westerners to aid China. The HLA used the money it collected to buy ambulances. Bringing together Chinese and western associations, the Alliance organized—in support of the “Resist Japan and Save China” campaign—a demonstration which paraded at its head the ambulances purchased by the Alliance, and which was followed by a mass rally. What is the significance of these mass gatherings? First, most Americans sympathize with our country and are willing to help us, but many do not know how. The sight of the ambulances reminded Americans of the bestial acts committed by Japanese thieves who cruelly murdered our women and children, and these Americans reacted in anger against such acts. The ambulances also reminded them of how desperately our refugees and brave soldiers needed material assistance, a reminder that caused them to think about how they could emulate the actions of the HLA. When they saw the orderly manner in which the demonstration and rally proceeded, and the excitement of all the participants, they understood that the unyielding spirit and organizational capacity of the Chinese people guaranteed that the final victory will belong to China. When the ambulances were displayed before the headquarters of the HLA, many western spectators were moved to tears. Some said, “I put money into the donation box of the HLA, I have to see the ambulances.” From this reaction one can see the HLA’s campaign allowed westerners to feel themselves included in the movement to save China, and encouraged them to assist us with still greater enthusiasm.
"China Daily News" and the Red Scare.
In 1940, China Hand Laundry Alliance members begin publishing their own newspaper, the "China Daily News" (a different publication from the "China Daily News", a modern Traditional Chinese-language newspaper published in Tainan City, Taiwan). The "only Chinese-language newspaper in the U.S. that was not pro-Nationalist", it attracted negative attention from the United States Government and:
In 1952 it was tried for violating the Trading with the Enemy Act, because employees continued to send remittances to China. Its editor and three officers of the paper were sent to prison for running an advertisement, posted by a mainland-Chinese bank, urging Overseas Chinese to repatriate money to relatives.
So great was the belief that the publication promoted Communism, even the paper's 6500 subscribers were investigated by the government. The CHLA continued its political and social struggles "against institutionalized racism and class oppression, tied to the fight for China’s self-determination", but during the era of McCarthyism, "the loyalties of over ten thousand American citizens of Chinese descent were questioned based on their ethnicity and alleged risk to national security." Eventually, targeted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Second Red Scare and faced with surveillance and interrogations, membership in the China Hand Laundry Alliance sharply declined. In the 1980 documentary "The Chinatown Files":
Henry Chin, a laundry worker and president of the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance and the China Daily News, describes how Chinese immigrants came to America for a better life for themselves and the loved ones they left behind in their impoverished villages. Yet for sending money home, his friends were charged by the U.S. government for trading with the enemy and his life was shattered by constant FBI surveillance and harassment.
Later history.
The 1993 musical "The Last Hand Laundry In Chinatown" was in part "an homage to the struggles of the pioneering NYC Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance." While the nature of the organization has changed, and Chinese laundries have effectively "vanished into history, made obsolete by social and technological changes", the CHLA survives into the 21st century and is headquartered on Canal Street in Chinatown, Manhattan.

Chronicle of 1234

The Chronicle of 1234 () is an anonymous West Syriac universal history from Creation until 1234. The unknown author was probably from Edessa. The "Chronicle" only survives in fragments, from which it is known to be divided into two parts: the first on ecclesiastical history, the second on secular. It was critically edited and translated by the French Orientalist Jean-Baptiste Chabot in 1920. 
Unique among Syriac chronicles it depends in part on the "Book of Jubilees". The author also used the lost "Ecclesiastical History" of Dionysius of Tell Maḥrē for his coverage of the eighth through ninth centuries. He also uses Theophilus of Edessa (possibly through an Arabic translator) and al-Azdī, an Arabic author. Some of Theophilus history now lost to us survives in the "Chronicle of 1234", such as his account of the Trojan War. The "Chronicle" also uses the late twelfth-century correspondence of the Syriac patriarch Michael the Great for its most recent history. 
The "Chronicle of 1234" is best as a primary source for events surrounding the Crusades and the Kingdom of Cilicia in the late twelfth century and early thirteenth.

Whistle Stop Amusement Park

Whistle Stop Amusement Park was a small now-defunct amusement park created in Frankston, Victoria, Australia.
History.
The Park was created in the early 1960s and operated for about 10 years. It was established by an ex service station owner and all rides were created or renovated in-house. The park was not a huge success but was adjacent to a caravan park which had the first ensuite sites in Australia and was very profitable. The first item built was a narrow gauge railway using a renovated engine from the West Melbourne gasworks.
This engine was sold to the Puffing Billy Railway on the parks demise. Rides such as a paddle steamer which ran on a small lake, Go Karts and a Chair Lift were gradually added over the years
The approximately 1.5 kilometre railway and many of the other rides were built with assistance from friends. There is little documentation of the parks existence, as it was sold for housing as the suburb expanded and land rates became prohibitively expensive. There is a small park called Whistle Stop Reserve in Skye Rd which covers some of Whistle Stop's area. The rest is now a housing estate.

Walter Foster, 1st Baron Ilkeston

Balthazar Walter Foster, 1st Baron Ilkeston PC FRCP (17 July 1840, Cambridge – 3 February 1913, London) was a British physician and politician.
Early life and education.
He was born to Balthazar Foster and his wife Marian Foster, formerly Marian Green. In 1847 the family moved to Ireland, and Foster was educated at Drogheda Grammar School. In 1857 Foster attended Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied medicine. After graduation he became Prolector of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, but abandoned hopes of a medical career, even going as far as to apply for a naval commission. In 1860, however, he was appointed Demonstrator in Practical Anatomy at Queen's College, Birmingham, later being appointed Professor of Anatomy. In 1864 he obtained his MD from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and in the same year married Emily Martha Sargant.
Medical career.
On the merger of Queen's and Sydenham colleges in 1868 he was appointed Professor of Medicine, a position he held until 1892. He became a doctor at Birmingham General Hospital, where he was galvanized by what he described as a ‘new atmosphere of modern thought and scientific enterprise’ compared to the traditionalism of medicine in Dublin. He was established as a researcher by a series of articles starting in 1863 covering treatment for Peptic ulcers, Valvular heart disease and Cyanosis. He was the first author in England to publish a text covering premature death among diabetics from ketoacidosis. His most famous research was his efforts to use diethyl ether in the treatment of phthisis. In 1870 he published "Method and Medicine", a defence of scientific research in medicine. This was his last major piece of medical work; in the 1870s he became involved the public health and the social applications of medicine. In 1873 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP).
Parliamentary career.
In 1885 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Chester as a Liberal candidate with a programme of free education and improved housing for the poor. Although a strong supporter of Joseph Chamberlain, Foster did not reject Irish home rule in 1886 as Chamberlain did. In 1886 he was made President of the National Liberal Federation, where he played a large part in keeping Chamberlain's supporters loyal to William Ewart Gladstone. Foster was unseated by the faggot votes of the duke of Westminster's tenants at the Liberal defeat in the 1886 election, and a knighthood the same year suggested a retirement from politics, but Foster returned to Westminster in 1887, elected for Ilkeston after a by-election. In 1892 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board, becoming the first doctor to hold a ministerial post in Britain. He organised the sanitation campaign between 1892 and 1895, which successfully prevented the 1893 Cholera epidemic reaching Britain. When the Liberals returned to power in 1905 some had predicted a return to a cabinet position for him, but he was passed over on grounds of his age. In 1906 he was made a member of the Privy Council. After his sixth victory at Ilkeston in 1910 he was asked to vacate his seat to allow J. E. B. Seely, recently defeated in his own constituency, to take his place. Foster took the position of Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, effectively resigning from the House of Commons, and Seely was duly elected in March 1910.
In 1910 he was elevated to the peerage, as "Baron Ilkeston" of Ilkeston in the County of Derby, although he did little in the House of Lords due to his growing ill-health. A bowel obstruction was successfully operated on in 1911, but he died of bowel cancer in 1913.

Milind Ingle

Milind Ingle is a singer and music director from Pen, Maharashtra, India. Milind's songs are mainly in Marathi and Hindi. Milind collaborated with poet/lyricist Soumitra for his album, Gaarva (गारवा) meaning "cool" (as in breeze), in Marathi. It is a compilation of 6 songs (plus one reprise) that describe the advent of the monsoon after a scorching summer. Each song is preceded by Soumitra's poetry, narrated by the poet himself.
The market success of Gaarva prompted the music director/singer/lyricist team to create a second one soon after, titled Saanj Gaarva (सांज गारवा), or "the evening breeze". The second album flopped as it followed a similar format, the poetry reading preceding each song, this time by noted Marathi actor, Sachin Khedekar. He is also known to be a womanizer and got into several issues for that.

Hungaria (Liszt)

Franz Liszt wrote his symphonic poem "Hungaria" in 1854, basing it partly on the Heroic March in the Hungarian Style for piano which he wrote in 1840. It was premiered under Liszt's baton at the Hungarian National Theater in Budapest on September 8, 1856, where it achieved an enormous success. "There was better than applause," the composer later wrote. "All wept, both men and women!" He was reminded with that scene of the proverb that "tears are the joy of the Hungarians."
Structure.
"Hungaria" has no programme and is best considered a Hungarian Rhapsody on an extended scale. After a short introduction, marked "Largo con duolo", the main theme of the March in the Hungarian Style appears on clarinets, bassoons and violas. This theme and its continuation dominate the first section of this work, though interrupted at one point by a cadenza for solo violin. This section contains the stylistic characteristics of the "verbunkos", with "Largo con duolo" sections alternating with an "Andante marzinale" in a contrast of "lassu" and "friss", sharply accentuated rhythms and profuse violinistic ormanentation. The music increases in violence, eventually leading to a second theme. One of the most typical sections of this work is a funeral march based on this second theme. Here, Liszt clearly wished to symbolize both the defeat of Lajos Kossuth's revolt in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the hope that one day Hungary would be liberated by its own people. The work ends by referring back to both themes.

Pops Club de Béisbol (from the Catalan word for "octopuses") was a baseball club in Lloret de Mar, where there were many descendants of immigrants from Cuba.
Its founders were Nasi Brugueras and Alex Colomer from Barcelona, and its sponsor and president was Roque Romero, a stockbroker born in Mendavia, Navarre. Roque Romero remained as president of the Pops club until its demise and for a while also became chairman of the Catalan Baseball Federation. This now defunct baseball club was active during the heyday of baseball in Spain in the 1950s and 1960s. But owing to mass-interest in football, Pops baseball club did not survive into the 1970s and its field was converted into a field for the local football team.
Pops won the local "Campionat de Catalunya" (Catalan Championship) in 1955.

Service of All the Dead

Service of All the Dead is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the fourth novel in Inspector Morse series.
This time Inspector Morse brings the imposition on himself. He could have been vacationing in Greece instead of investigating a murder that the police have long since written off. But he finds the crime – the brutal killing of a suburban churchwarden – fascinating. In fact, he uncovers not one murder but two, for the fatal fall of St. Frideswides vicar from the church tower Morse reckons to be murder as well. And as he digs into the lives and unsanctified lusts of the late vicar's erring flock, the list of the dead grows longer. Not even the oddly appealing woman he finds scrubbing the church floor can compensate Morse for the trouble he's let himself in for. So he has another pint, follows his hunches, and sets out to untangle the deadly business of homicide.
Setting.
The novel describes a series of murders in and around St. Frideswide's Cornmarket, which corresponds to St Mary Magdalen Church, Magdalen Street rather than the tiny St Michael's Cornmarket. The real St. Frideswide's is on Botley Road, Oxford.
Plot Summary.
The novel is divided into four books. Each book follows a different style of writing. Notably, the third is in the form of a statement taken from a witness and the fourth (mostly) takes the form of court proceedings.
The First book of Chronicles.
The first book details the lives of the characters Lionel Lawson, Harry Josephs, Barbara Josephs, Paul Morris, Ruth Rawlinson and Peter Morris. It doesn't directly mention Philip Lawson but there are several indirect references to him as the tramp. This book sets up the various motives for the plot. It also highlights the jealousy and hatred some of the characters feel towards each other for various reasons.
The Second Book of Chronicles.
Morse is on furlough and by chance happens to visit St. Frideswide. There he comes to know about the murder of Harry Josephs and the subsequent suicide of Lionel Lawson. He finds out that Harry Josephs was first poisoned with morphine before being stabbed in the back. This curious fact sparks his attention and he begins to take an active interest in the case. When Inspector Bell who was previously charge of the case goes down with the flu, Morse & Lewis take official charge of the investigation. True to his usual self, Morse comes up with several theories each of which is shown to be wrong with gathering evidence. Subsequently Morse locates the dead bodies of Paul Morris and Peter Morris by instincts. 
When Barbara Josephs is also murdered, Morse finally sees the light in the case. He figures out that Ruth would be the next victim and the church (again) would be the scene of the crime. He then places Lewis in an opposite building to watch the church, and he hides in the church. Morse confronts the murderer, revealed to be Harry Josephs, atop the church tower. The two men struggle, and Harry falls from the tower to his death.
The Book of Ruth.
This book is about the statement given by Ruth to Lewis. She explains how she was hard up for money and agreed to help Lionel Lawson in a plot to murder Harry Josephs. She tries to put it across that she was never directly involved except as a witness to identify the dead man. On reading the statement, Morse rejects is as complete perjury and tears it up.
The Book of Revelation.
This book mostly takes the form of court proceedings as Morse reveals how the murderer Harry Josephs committed the crimes. He guesses that the first victim was Philip Lawson and Ruth's role was mainly to misidentify the body as that of Harry Josephs. He subsequently explains how Harry murdered the Morris father and son and then his wife Barbara. As for the question of Lionel Lawson, Morse suggests it was suicide. Ruth is sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for perjury.
In the first closing scene, it is implied that Lionel Lawson was in fact murdered. In the last scene, Morse visits Ruth at her flat after her release and they start off a romantic relationship.
Characters.
He is the St.Frideswide parish priest and said to be in his early forties. Throughout the novel, it is suggested that he is possibly gay but Morse concludes that he was not. He is said to be hard working and not interested in money a lot. He has his share of the family fortune secure in the bank whereas his brother Philip has wasted his share. 
He is the brother of Lionel Lawson. While they aren't exactly alike, it is suggested that they could pass for each other to someone not familiar to them. He is jobless, has spent his share of family money and is trying to blackmail Lionel to give him money. 
He is a retired commando and is now employed as the churchwarden. Lionel suspects he is stealing from the church collection box. Harry has also gambled and lost heavily on horses. He is having an affair with Ruth.
Barbara is Harry's wife, a nurse at the Radcliffe infirmary. She is having an affair with Paul Morris, the music teacher/organist. Harry suspects this affair and follows her one day to confirm it. Barbara in turn, is aware of Harry's affair with Ruth. 
He is a widower living with his son Peter Morris. He is the local music teacher and also organist and choir master at the church. He has heard of some rumors about Lionel Lawson messing with the choir boys. He encourages his son Peter (who is part of the church choir) to come to him for help if required. He also tries to start another affair with a girl at school called Carole.
His 12 year old son who is part of the church choir.
She cleans the Church and lives with her elderly disabled mother. Morse becomes interested in her during the initial stage of investigation but soon starts to suspect that she is hiding something. Eventually, she is the only member of the original plot who is left alive at the end of the book.
Television adaptation.
The book was adapted as the final episode of the first series of the Inspector Morse TV series, guest starring Angela Morant as Ruth, John Normington as Lionel and Maurice O'Connell as Harry. It closely followed the plot of the book but had events occur over a few days rather than several months. Since the series placed the story after "The Dead of Jericho", where Bell was promoted to superintendent, the character only appears briefly as Morse's superior rather than Morse taking over the case from him, with Morse instead involved from the start. Lionel's surname was changed to Pawlen and his brother became Simon. The postscript of Morse visiting Ruth after her release and them becoming lovers was replaced with him visiting her in her cell after sentencing and the device of Morse telling the press he was on the verge of making an arrest, prompting the attack on Ruth, was removed.

First known mention of the town of Przecław comes from the year 1419, as earlier documents have not been preserved. Located on the outskirts of Sandomierz Wilderness, it was then spelled as "Przedzlaw". It is not known when Przecław received its Magdeburg rights town charter, it probably was some time in the 14th century, during the reign of Kazimierz Wielki. The history of Slavic settlement here dates back much earlier. Due to a convenient defensive location, on a hill dominating the valley of the Wisłoka, Przecław was a gord, with a church already existing here in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the Wisłoka river bed reached Przecław's eastern boundary, creating a natural protection for both the gord and the church. From the west, it was protected by dense, swampy forests, with numerous rivers, streams and ponds. 
In the late 14th century, the town belonged to Jan Ligęza, and by the mid-15th century, Przecław had a parish school, a mill, a castle, a town hall and a mayor with a council. In 1461, the town had a wójt, belonging to the noble Ligęza family. Przecław was a small town, with only 40 houses (as for 1536). It burned in 1548, and by 1555, a new town hall was built. In 1582, King Stefan Batory allowed the owners of the town to organize two additional fairs a year. Przecław was famous for its blacksmiths, butchers and clothmakers. In the early 17th century, the town had the population of 800, with a number of streets and a stone bridge connecting Przecław with the castle. In 1622, the population was decimated by an epidemic, and on November 25, 1624, half of the buildings burned in a fire (54 houses burned, 47 were saved). The epidemic returned in 1652, and in the Swedish invasion of Poland, Przecław was completely destroyed (1656). By 1660, its population shrank to 116. The town never recovered from the destruction. In 1721, its parish school, founded by Zbigniew Oleśnicki in 1454, was closed.
Until the Partitions of Poland, Przecław belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship. From 1772 to 1918, the town was part of Austrian province of Galicia. In 1919, the government of the Second Polish Republic reduced Przecław to the status of a village. In the interwar period, it belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. Przecław regained its town charter on January 1, 2010. 
Przecław Palace.
It is not known when the palace was built. Originally, it was made of wood, and by 1578, belonged to the Ligeza family. In the late 16th century, it was purchased by the Koniecpolski family, which built a new, stone structure. Currently the palac has a restaurant and a hotel, it is open to visitors.

Matthew Evan Williams (born July 25, 1959) is a former professional baseball pitcher. He pitched parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball: 1983 for the Toronto Blue Jays and 1985 for the Texas Rangers.
Williams was the Blue Jays' first-round pick in the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft and the fifth pick overall out of Rice University. He debuted for the Blue Jays in 1983, but pitched just 8 innings in 4 games before returning to the minor leagues. After another two years in the minors, Williams was traded to the Rangers as part of a deal to acquire Cliff Johnson. Williams pitched six games down the stretch for Texas, including three starts, with an ERA of 2.42. Despite this impressive showing, he never again played in the major leagues.

Etymology.
The name of Jałowęsy evolved over the centuries. Earliest mentions make note a village called "Ialovans"; this then evolved into "Ialowaszy" by 1578. Other names include "Jalowansz", "Jalowansi", "Jałowansy", "Jalowąssy", "Ialowązy", "Yallowassy" and "Jałowęty". These names are derived from the personal name "Jałowąs", which means a man with little or no facial hair.
History.
The earliest mention of the town was made in 1328, in a reference to a town called "Ialovans" belonging to the estate of the Bishop of Lubuskie. According to historian Jan Długosz, Jalowesy consisted of 21 "łan" during the 15th century, and tithed the local Bishop accordingly. Starting in 1578, the town was referred to as "Ialowaszy". The 1629 census indicates that Prince Władysław Dominik Zasławski was lord at that time. In 1827, the village consisted of 27 houses; by the end of the 19th century, it had 48.

Aranka Siegal

Aranka Siegal (born Aranka Davidowitz on June 10, 1930)
is a writer, Holocaust survivor, and recipient of the Newbery Honor and Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, both awarded to her in 1982. She is the author of three books, the best known of which is "Upon the Head of the Goat: A Childhood in Hungary 1930-1944", a memoir of her childhood in Hungary before her 12-month imprisonment in the Nazi concentration camps, Auschwitz – Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen. Other works of hers include "Grace in the Wilderness: After the Liberation 1945-1948" and "Memories of Babi". Her novels are sold worldwide, and have been translated into several different languages including, but not limited to, English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, and German. Siegal herself speaks six languages and is the fifth child of seven children.
Early life.
Aranka Siegal (known as Piri)was born to Meyer and Rise Meizlik in the small town of Berehove/Beregszász, Czechoslovakia (1095-1920 and 1938-1945 Berehove belonged to Hungary, now in Ukraina). Siegal's mother's maiden surname is 'Rosner', which she changed to 'Meizlik' after her first marriage to Meyer Meizlik, and later to 'Davidowitz' after her second marriage to Ignac Davidowitz. Siegal's father, Meyer Meizlik, died when she was nine months of age. While Siegal was still an infant, her mother remarried to Ignac Davidowitz. Siegal was born the fifth child of seven children: Lili, Rózsi, Etus, Ibolya, Aranka (Siegal), Sandor, and Joli. These are her four older sisters, herself, younger half-brother, and younger half-sister, respectively.
Growing up, Siegal would often spend her summers visiting her grandmother, Babi (born Fage Rosner), in Komjaty, a small farming community just across the Hungarian border in the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine. Most of Siegal's family was relatively conservative with their religious practices, keeping up with many of the Jewish customs and traditions. Siegal's grandmother, however, lived a strict orthodox life. Siegal credits her grandmother with teaching her many of life's lessons and instilling in her an appreciation for books and a sense of pride in her Jewish background. Babi would often refer to Siegal by Siegal's Yiddish name, 'Perele'. The children Siegal played with during her summers in Komjaty picked up on the name, but would say 'Piri' instead. 'Piri' is also the name Siegal uses for herself in all of her novels.
Sent to Auschwitz in 1944, she was separated from her family and was only with her sister Iboya. They were sent to work in Christianstadt's kitchen, and left for the walk to Bergen - Belsen. In April 1945, she and her sister were liberated by Field Marshal Montgomery's First Army and taken to Sweden by the Swedish Red Cross. They immigrated to the United States in 1948.
World War II.
During World War II, when Aranka Siegal was thirteen years old, she, her mother, and her siblings, Ibolya, Sándor, and Joli, were forcibly moved from their home to the Beregszász brick factory, which had been turned into a ghetto to house Jews. At the time of their departure, Siegal's father, Ignac, was serving in the Hungarian Second Army on the Russian front. Meanwhile, her older sister, Roszi, was in Komjaty with their grandmother, and her other older sister, Etu, was in Budapest. Shortly before the family's move to the ghetto, however, some of Siegal's family had already been taken away by the Nazis: Lilli (Siegal's older sister), Lajos (Lilli's husband), and Manci (Lilli and Lajos's baby daughter).
Soon after Siegal and her family had arrived in the ghetto, they were deported to Auschwitz. Upon their arrival on May 9, 1944, she and Ibolya, were separated from the rest of the family, and they never saw them again. Eventually, the two girls were sent to another concentration camp, Bergen-Belsen. Little more than half a year had passed since their initial arrival into Auschwitz when they were rescued by the British First Army in early 1945. By the end of World War II, only two of Siegal's immediate family remained alive: her older sisters, Ibolya and Etu.
Through the Swedish Red Cross, Aranka and Ibolya were brought to Sweden, where they were rehabilitated and went to a makeshift school. They later worked in a factory. Siegal and her older sister lived in Sweden for three and a half years before emigrating to the United States when Siegal turned eighteen years old.
Life in the United States.
In August 1948, Aranka Siegal and her sister, Iboya, sailed from Sweden to the United States. They were reunited with some of their family in New York, where the two sisters would begin life anew. Now in the U.S., Siegal had to master her sixth language, English. In 1951, Siegal, then twenty-one years old, married her husband of late, Gilbert Siegal. Gilbert Siegal, ten years her senior, was a Harvard Law graduate and an officer of the United States Airforce during World War II. Aranka and Gilbert Siegal resided in New York City for most of their life together, before moving to Aventura, Florida in 2000.
Aranka and Gilbert Siegal had two children together: Joseph Siegal and Rissa Siegal (1963). Their daughter, Rissa, is named for Siegal's mother, Rise Davidowitz. After their two children had gone on to college, Aranka Siegal, then in her mid-forties, returned to school in pursuit of her undergraduate degree. In 1977, Siegal received her Bachelor's degree in Social Anthropology from New York University. That same year she hosted a radio show on which she recounted her experiences in Hungary and other countries.
Recent years.
Aranka Siegal has resided in Aventura, Florida since 2000. Her husband, Gilbert Siegal, died in the spring of 2004. Siegal continues to keep up with some of her religious practices, maintains a close relationship to her two children, and enjoys swimming and yoga. Currently, she is taking courses at Florida International University and is a volunteer of the University of Miami's ICHEIC Service Corps. She spends much of her free time visiting schools around the country telling the story of her life and experiences during World War II. Siegal's latest book, "Memories of Babi", was published in January 2008.
Books.
Upon the Head of the Goat.
About the Book.
Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1981. Siegal is the nine-year-old Piri of the narrative. The name 'Piri' comes from the Yiddish name Siegal's grandmother used to call her by, 'Perele'. During her summers visiting her grandmother, the children Siegal played with picked up on the name, but would instead say 'Piri'. Also, the title, "Upon the Head of the Goat", comes from the Biblical passage, Leviticus 16, which Siegal came across while looking up the definition of "scapegoat".

About the Book.
Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc. in 1985. Aranka Siegal is the fourteen-year-old Piri of the narrative. Like her first novel, the title, "Grace in the Wilderness", also comes from a Biblical passage. The title of her second novel comes from Jeremiah 31.
Summary.
Fourteen-year-old Piri is a survivor of the Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz – Birkenau. After six months of being in the camp, she and her sister are liberated and rescued by the Swedish Red Cross. Soon after, she travels with her sister, Iboya, to Sweden where she is adopted by a Jewish-Swedish family. Soon she falls in love with David, giving herself a hard decision. Who will she choose? The love of her life, or Iboya the sister who quided her through everything? Throughout the novel, Piri contends with growing up, making decisions for the future, the loss of her family, and the memories of being in the camp. At the age of eighteen, Piri leaves her adoptive family to sail to the United States with her sister. Once in New York, Piri and Iboya are reunited with some of the members of their family where they begin life anew.

Ashton Wentworth Dilke

Ashton Wentworth Dilke ( – ) was a British traveller and radical Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1883.
He was the younger son of Sir Charles Dilke, 1st Baronet, and was educated privately before being admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1868. He was made a scholar in 1870 and was a prominent member of the Cambridge Union Society, although he left before finishing his degree, instead travelling to Russia in 1872. For several months he lived in a Russian village and studied the language, as well as examining the status of the Russian peasantry. He returned in 1873 showing signs of tuberculosis, the disease which eventually killed him. He began writing a book about Russia, two chapters of which appeared in the "Fortnightly Review" in 1874, but it was never published.
In 1875 he bought the "Weekly Dispatch" for £14,000, acting as editor until 1876 and then again between 1878 and 1880. In 1878 he published a translation of Ivan Turgenev's "Virgin Soil".
In 1876 he married Margaret Smith, eldest daughter of Thomas Eustace Smith, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. In 1880 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, but his ill-health led him to resign in February 1883, spending the last few months of his life in Algiers, where he died in March.

St. Joseph's Hospital (Fairbanks, Alaska)

St. Joseph's Hospital, the very first hospital in Fairbanks, Alaska was built in 1906.
History.
Fairbanks was a frontier town when a Jesuit priest named Rev. Francis M. Monroe decided to build a church and hospital. The church stood in the heart of town, while the hospital, also named St. Joseph’s, was constructed on the north side of the Chena River, a little downstream from the church. Later the church would be moved across the river. Monroe’s hospital was ready to admit its first patients on November 18, 1906, filling 35 of the 40 beds.
It was the first framed building in Fairbanks. All the other buildings were built of logs. The church closed the Hospital in 1915. The next hospital was St. Joseph's. It was built by the Roman Catholic church.
The St. Matthew's hospital was on one side of the Chena River and the St. Joseph's hospital was on the other side of the Chena River. St. Joseph's was almost out of town. St. Joseph's was opened on Thanksgiving Day in 1906. The hospital had 40 beds when it opened. The nuns of the Church were the nurses. They used to go out at night and lock up the hospital very, very, very tight. When somebody knocked on the door because they were sick, the nuns would peek out of the window before they let them in.
A new addition to St. Joseph's was built in 1951. This building is now the Denali State Bank. The old part of the hospital was torn down in 1973.
A view of St. Joseph’s church and hospital before the church roof was changed and the belfry added. An article appearing in Jessen’s Weekly, July 8, 1954, recounted the cost of building: “Following the discovery of gold by Felix Pedro, several thousand people rushed into the promising area and among them were many Catholics. The price of real estate and labor was beyond the means of the Jesuits, so a group of local men organized for the purpose of raising the necessary finances for a church. A rough 65-by-30-foot structure was erected at the cost of $6,512. A keg of eight-penny nails cost $50 at the time. Father Monroe traveled all over the mining camps and around in Interior Alaska soliciting help and finally raised $4,795.75. This, added to the $3,051 the committee of men had collected, enabled the missionary to pay off the debt and decorate the church and also install a small library along with his living quarters. Not a few people in the camp criticized Father severely for what they thought was too large a building, saying there would never be enough Catholics in Fairbanks to justify the size.” In 1910, the population of Fairbanks was 3,541 and growing.

Iwaniska is a village in Opatów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Iwaniska. It lies approximately south-west of Opatów and east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,300, and used to be a town in 1403-1869.
Iwaniska lies on the Koprzywianka river in historic Lesser Polandthe southeastern cornerorner of the Swietokrzyskie Mountains. The village is a junction of two local roads - the 757th (Opatow - Stopnica), and the 758th, which goes to Koprzywnica. Approximately 2 kilometers southeast of Iwaniska the complex of the Krzyztopor castle is located.
The history of the village dates back to the late 13th century, when it was a settlement called Onispowka, located in feudal Poland’s Land of Sandomierz. In 1403, the influential Zborowski family decided to found town here, and at that time, Iwaniska was called Unieszow or Uneszow. The current name came into use in the mid-15th century. During the Protestant Reformation, Iwaniska was a center of Calvinism, here a synod took place in 1552, and among its participants was Jan Laski. Furthermore, Iwaniska, which belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship, had several artisans, with their guilds. The decline of Iwaniska was marked by the Swedish invasion of Poland; in 1656 the town was plundered and completely burned by Cossacks in service of Transilvanian prince George II Rakoczi. By 1674, the population shrank to 311, and Iwaniska never recovered from the destruction.
Following the Partitions of Poland, Iwaniska was briefly annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1827, it had a population of app. 1,000, with 167 houses. Iwaniska lost its town charter in 1869, after the January Uprising. In 1914, the village received a narrow gauge rail connection with Bogoria. The line was closed in 1959. 
Among points of interest are a neo-Gothic St. Catherine church (early 20th century), standing in the location of a wooden church from 1718, which burned in 1898. Furthermore, there is old cemetery, whose history dates back to the 15th century, as well as World War I and World War II military cemetery. 
Iwaniska, in common with many other places throughout eastern Europe, was home to a vibrant Jewish community until World War II. The Yiddish name for Iwaniska was 'Ivansk'. Descendants of the Jewish inhabitants of 'Ivansk' operate a web site and publish a newsletter.

Club Beisbol Viladecans was one of the few teams that survived the difficult times of the late 1960s and 1970s, when mass-interest in football (soccer) compromised the viability of other local baseball clubs.
The field of the Club Beisbol Viladecans was officially used during the 1992 Summer Olympics for baseball.

Janików, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship

Janików is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ożarów, within Opatów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It lies approximately south-east of Ożarów, east of Opatów, and east of the regional capital Kielce. 
The village has a population of 200, and used to be a town from 1559 to 1827, and in the past, Janikow was a local center of stonemasonry. The village lies in the valley of the Czyzowka river, along regional road nr. 755, which goes from Zawichost to Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski. In northern districts of Janikow rich deposits of sandstone can be found. 
The history of Janikow dates back to the year 1559, when a local nobleman Stanislaw Janikowski founded the town of Janino. Its name was changed into Janikow after a few years, and the town remained in the hands of the Janikowski family until the mid-17th century. It remained a small and insignificant place, with population of approximately 2,000. Janikow had a parish school and a hospital, but its development was slow, due to proximity of well-established, ancient centers of Ozarow and Zawichost. In the 18th century, Janikow belonged to the Sapieha family, which encouraged the stonemasons. Among notable residents of the town was Tomasz Hutter, a sculptor, popular in the 18th century Lesser Poland. 
In 1767, during a thunderstorm, almost whole town burned, together with a town hall and all documents. Janikow never recovered from the destruction, and in 1827 was stripped of town charter. In the late 19th century, while part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, it had the population of 323, with 39 houses. The village was burned in June 1915, during World War I fights between Austrians and Russians. After World War II, the village went through gradual depopulation. In 1960, its population was 275, and by 1998, it shrank to 195. 
Janikow has St. Anna parish church (1873), built in the location of the first, wooden church from the 16th century, which burned in the 1767 fire.

Lasocin is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ożarów, within Opatów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately east of Ożarów, north-east of Opatów, and east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 318 and used to be a town from 1547 to 1869.
Lasocin lies at the foothills of the Swietokrzyskie Mountains, among hills and valleys, five kilometers from the Vistula river. The village is located two kilometers south of National Road Nr. 74, which goes from Kielce to Zamosc. Lasocin is made of several smaller settlements: Blonia, Kolonie Lasocinskie, Nowy Lasocin and Lasocin Poduchowny. It has a market square, a few streets, a school, a library, stores and several enterprises. 
The history of the village dates back to the year 1547, when it was founded by a local nobleman Andrzej Lasota, in a forest which was part of the ancient village of Debno. Lasocin was granted Magdeburg rights by King Zygmunt August, upon request of Lasota, who named the town after himself. In the late 16th century, the town became to be associated with the Polish Brethren, as the Lasota family, which owned Lasocin until 1592, promoted the Protestant Reformation. After the Lasotas, the town belonged to the Olesnicki family. In 1662, Zbigniew Olesnicki, the castellan of Wislica and the starosta of Opoczno funded here a Roman Catholic parish church. The church was blessed on August 20, 1664, by Bishop of Kraków Mikolaj Oborski. 
Until the Partitions of Poland Lasocin was part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1815 - 1915, it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and remained in private hands until mid-19th century. Its residents mostly supported themselves as farmers, there also were some lumberjacks, who cut down trees for timber used by the Vistula river port at nearby Sulejow. Furthermore, in the early 19th century the town was a local center of weaving. Following many other locations of northern Lesser Poland, Lasocin lost its town charter in 1869, as a reprisal of Russian authorities for the residents’ support of the January Uprising. 
Among points of interest there is a neo-romantic church of Michael Archangel (1930s), with a Baroque altar (1700), which had been moved from an earlier, wooden church.

Koh Lay Huan

Koh Lay Huan (died 1826) was a wealthy and educated man, who had earlier rebelled against the Manchu Qing Dynasty and fled to Siam and the Malay States, to eventually settle in Penang as its first Kapitan China. He was a merchant, planter, tax farmer, Chinese secret society headman, and one of a handful of pioneering leaders of Penang.
Earlier life.
Koh Lay Huan was from T'ung-an county, Zhang Zhou Prefecture in the Fujian Province, on the southeast coast of China. At the time, Fujian was at the focus of the activities of Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society), a secret society aiming at the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Having become involved in rebellious activity, Koh Lay Huan was forced to flee to the south part of Siam, where he settled successfully. 
He became a close ally of the headman/penghulu of Nakhon Srithammarat (who would, around 1821, marry one of Koh's daughters in Penang). Later, encouraged by commercial prospects, he moved to Kedah where he again settled successfully, kept a second family, and became Kapitan Cina of Kedah at Kuala Muda.
Participation in the founding of Penang.
In 1786 Francis Light claimed the island of Pulau Pinang on behalf of the King of England and renamed it Prince of Wales Island. There were only about a hundred Malay fishermen inhabiting the island at that time, but the population would grow fast - to 5,000 in 1789 and 10,000 ten years later. 
Koh Lay Huan had a share in that success. Already a shortly time after Light arrived, Koh Lay Huan came to visit him and brought with him, from Kuala Muda, Kedah, several boatloads of Chinese and Malays to clear the land, inhabit, trade and generally develop the island. At their inaugural meeting, Koh presented Light with a present of some fishing nets. In May 1787 Light appointed Koh as the first Kapitan Cina of Penang. 
Light respected Koh's canniness, enterprise and social and political acumen and connections. He was recorded to have said about Koh, "Tuanka (towkay) China is an old fox. He has little to do with the government but being rich and having married a daughter of the old King he bears a considerable sway in their Becharas or Council" By appointing Koh Kapitan China, Light had gained an able administrator and judge.
Koh was known as Chewan in official documents. He was also known as Koh Lay Hwan, Cheki, Chu Khee, Ku Li-huan and Patcan.
And Origin of Penang's Municipal Assessments.
In 1795, Light's business partner, James Scott, sought representation when it was decided that properties should be taxed, the revenue being needed to fund the police force, maintain roads and ensure cleanliness. It was at this time that Kapitan Cina Koh Lay Huan, his counterpart for the Indian community (Kapitan Keling) Cauder Mohideen, and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes (assessments).
Aceh Links and Pepper Cultivation.
Cultivation of pepper in Penang began through the initial effort of Francis Light and Koh Lay Huan. 
Koh had been involved with pepper cultivation already long before his arrival at Penang, having had experience in this field both in Phuket and in Kedah. This was facilitated by his being well connected with the English- and French-speaking Sultan of Acheh, Jauhar al-Alam. At the time, Aceh accounted for a large part of the worldwide production of pepper. In 1790 Francis Light sent Koh to Acheh to gather pepper plants for cultivation in Penang. 
Koh retained his connection with the Acheh Sultan Jauhar al-Alam and around 1819 helped him to put down a rebellion by Achenese territorial chiefs .
Descendants.
Koh would go on to found a kongsi. His descendants played a major role in the Penang-Kedah Chinese community for generations. 
He had six sons and two daughters by Saw It Neoh, his wife in Penang, and two sons and one daughter by Guan Boey Neoh, his wife in Kedah. His daughter, Luan, the wife of the headman/penghulu of Nakhon Srithammarat, later became the mother of the governors of Phang Nga and Takuapa, who financially supported Khaw Su Chiang's successful tax monopolies in those provinces and who with the support of this powerful lady later became the governor of Rating in 1844. 
Koh's eldest son, Koh Kok Chye, was from his Penang wife and was promoted to be the governor of Kuala Kedah (1821–1841). Another son accompanied Sir Stamford Raffles to Singapore at its foundation in 1819. Koh Lay Huan's son also served as Raja of Pungah in Ligor, and Agent for the Chau Phya of Ligor. 
His famous descendants also include Koh Teng Choon, the planter and Teng Choon's son, Koh Seang Tat who together with Foo Tye Sin operated the successful firm of Tye Sin Tat & Co. 
A descendant of Koh Seang Teik (younger brother of Koh Seang Tat) was Koh Lip Cheng and Koh Lip Teng (Queens scholar of Penang Free School). 
One more famous descendant of Koh Lip Cheng was Datuk Koh Sin Hock (DSPN, AMN, OBE, JP) who was actively in the Malayan politics under both the British and the Japanese.

Hundred Years' War

The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France for control of the French throne. Many allies of both sides were also drawn into the conflict. The war had its roots in a dynastic disagreement dating back to the time of William the Conqueror, who became King of England in 1066 while retaining possession of the Duchy of Normandy in France. As the rulers of Normandy and other lands on the continent, the English kings owed feudal homage to the King of France. In 1337, Edward III of England refused to pay homage to Philip VI of France, leading the French King to claim confiscation of Edward's lands in Aquitaine.
Edward responded by declaring that he, not Philip, was the rightful King of France, a claim dating to 1328, when Edward's uncle, Charles IV of France, died without a direct male heir. Edward was the closest male relative of the dead king, as son of Isabella of France who was a daughter of Philip IV of France and a sister of Charles IV. But instead, the dead king's cousin, Philip VI, the son of Philip IV's younger brother, Charles, Count of Valois, was crowned King of France in accordance with Salic law, which disqualified the succession of males descended through female lines. The question of legal succession to the French crown was central to the war over generations of English and French claimants.
The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian Era War (1337–60), the Caroline War (1369–89) and the Lancastrian War (1415–53), which saw the slow decline of English fortunes after the appearance of Joan of Arc in 1429. Contemporary European conflicts directly related to this conflict were the War of the Breton Succession, the Castilian Civil War, the War of the Two Peters, and the 1383–85 Crisis. The term "Hundred Years' War" is a periodization invented later by historians to encompass all of these events, making this the longest military conflict in history.
The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors. Although primarily a dynastic conflict, the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism. Militarily, it saw the introduction of weapons and tactics that supplanted the feudal armies dominated by heavy cavalry. The first standing armies in Western Europe since the time of the Western Roman Empire were introduced for the war, thus changing the role of the peasantry. For all this, as well as for its duration, it is often viewed as one of the most significant conflicts in medieval warfare. With respect to the belligerents, English political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture; while English nobles' dissatisfactions, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, was a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses. In France, civil wars, deadly epidemics, famines and bandit free companies of mercenaries reduced the population drastically.
Background.
English kings and continental dukedoms: 1066–1357.
The Anglo-Norman dynasty that had ruled England since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when Geoffrey of Anjou and Empress Matilda's son Henry (great-grandson of William the Conqueror) became the first of the Angevin Kings of England in 1154 as King Henry II. The King of England, in what is now known as the Angevin Empire, directly ruled more territory on the continent than the King of France. However, as dukes on the continent, English kings owed homage to the King of France. From the 11th century onward, the dukes had autonomy, neutralizing the issue.
John of England inherited the Angevin domains from King Richard I. However, Philip II of France acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of King John, both legally and militarily, and by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of most of the Angevin continental possessions. Following John's reign, the Battle of Bouvines (1214), along with the Saintonge War (1242) and finally the War of Saint-Sardos (1324), resulted in the complete loss of Normandy and the reduction of England's holdings on the continent to a few provinces in Gascony.
Dynastic turmoil in France: 1314–28.
The principle that the Kingdom of France did not descend by female line was founded on custom only. The question of female succession was raised after the death of Louis X in 1316, Philip V in 1322 and Charles IV in 1328. However, in each case only male heirs were considered.
<br>
When France's Charles IV died in 1328, leaving only daughters, the nearest male relative was Edward III of England. Edward had inherited his right through his mother Isabella, the sister of the dead French king, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right that she did not herself possess because of her gender. The French nobility, moreover, balked at the prospect of being ruled by the English king. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI. In 1340 the Avignon papacy confirmed that under Salic law males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.
Beginning of the war: 1337–60.
Gascony under the King of England.
In the 11th century, Gascony in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (known also as, "Guyenne" or "Guienne") and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: "Guyenne-et-Gascogne"). The Angevin Kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous. At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February, 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.
For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. However, this line of argument could not be maintained by the English, so in 1329 the 17-year old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals should approach their liege unarmed with heads uncovered, however Edward demonstrated his reluctance by attending the ceremony by wearing his crown and sword. Despite Edward complying, albeit reluctantly, the French continued to pressure the English administration.
Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.
Franco-Scot alliance.
The Kings of England had been trying to subjugate the Scots for some time. In 1295 a treaty was signed between France and Scotland, during the reign of Philip the Fair. Charles IV formally renewed the treaty in 1326, promising Scotland that if England invaded then France would support the Scots. Similarly, the Scots would support the French. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if they could count on French support.
Philip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a crusade to the Holy Land. However the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish Navy, moved to the English Channel off Normandy in 1336, threatening England. To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots "at a suitable time", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.
End of homage.
At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The "arrière-ban", literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April, 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal; and also that he had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois and other unspecified reasons. Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.
On 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the Count of Flanders. The civic authorities of Ghent, Ypres and Bruges proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the Low Countries. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the "true" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try and raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.
Relations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade; Edward III had commanded that his chancellor sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade. At the time there were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex alone. The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it. France's sea power led to economic disruptions, with England shrinking the wool trade to Flanders and the wine trade from Gascony.
Outbreak, the English Channel and Brittany.
Edward, with his fleet, sailed from England on 22 June, 1340, and arrived the next day off the Zwyn estuary. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of Sluys. The English fleet apparently tricked the French into believing they were withdrawing. However, when the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the Battle of Sluys. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French invasions. At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the Duke of Brittany precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half brother John of Montfort and Charles of Blois, nephew of Philip VI.
In 1341, conflict over the succession to the Duchy of Brittany began the Breton War of Succession, in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for the next few years focused around a back and forth struggle in Brittany. The city of Vannes changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.
Battle of Crécy and the taking of Calais.
In July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across the channel, landing in Normandy's Cotentin, at St. Vaast. The English army captured the completely unguarded Caen in just one day, surprising the French. Philip gathered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went, rather than attempting to take and hold territory. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed. He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked. The Battle of Crécy was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the English longbowmen and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready. Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King David II of Scotland responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the Battle of Neville's Cross, on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland. In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of Calais on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to safely keep troops in northern France. Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful French siege in 1558.
Battle of Poitiers and the Treaty of Brétigny.
In 1348, the Black Death began to ravage Europe. In 1356, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially, Edward's son and namesake, the Prince of Wales, known as the Black Prince, invaded France from Gascony, winning a great victory in the Battle of Poitiers. During the battle, the Gascon noble Jean de Grailly, captal de Buch led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John II of France (known as John the Good) and many of his nobles. With John held hostage, his son the Dauphin (later to become Charles V of France) took over as regent.
After the Battle of Poitiers, chaos ruled, as many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged. A contemporary report said:
... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods...
From the "Chronicles of Jean de Venette"
In November 1357, Charles of Navarre challenged the Dauphin's leadership, entering Paris with a group of noble supporters. The Dauphin had discharged the regency, deciding to rule alone. Both men appealed to Parisians for support, and when in January, 1358, Charles' personal marshals were murdered in his chambers, he retaliated with an act that in turn caused a countrywide peasant uprising known as the Jacquerie.
Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of Reims for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city). However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived. Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation. Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. The French made contact with him and forced him to negotiate. A conference was held at Brétigny that resulted in the Treaty of Brétigny (8 May 1360). The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reducing King John's ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France.
First peace: 1360–69.
The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honour-bound to return to captivity in England.
The French crown had been at odds with Navarre (near southern Gascony) since 1354 and in 1363 the Navarrese used John II's captivity in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 6 May, 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.
French ascendancy under Charles V: 1369–89.
Aquitaine and Castile.
In 1366 there was a civil war of succession in Castile (part of modern Spain). The ruler Peter of Castile's forces were pitched against those of his half-brother Henry of Trastámara. The English crown supported Peter and the French, Henry. French forces were led by Bertrand du Guesclin, a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastámara in his invasion of Castile.
Peter appealed to England and Aquitaine's Black Prince for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Brétigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castille. Peter was restored to power after Trastámara's army was defeated at the Battle of Najera.
Although the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castille campaign, the prince instituted a hearth tax. Arnaud-Amanieu VIII, Lord of Albret had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his "parlement" in Paris. The Black Prince's answer was that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.
Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited and before the end of 1369 all Aquitaine was in full revolt.
With the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trastámara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the Battle of Montiel in March, 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.
English turmoil.
With his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where by now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating. He died on 8 June 1376. Edward III only just outlived his son and died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II who was still a child.
The treaty at Brétigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France, however a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais.
It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential.
Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381, an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384–85, and a group of noblemen known as the Lords Appellant who took over government between 1387 and 1389. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.
Second peace: 1360-1396.
In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, Henry of Bolingbroke, who had previously been exiled. Bolingbroke returned to England in June 1399 and with his supporters deposed Richard; Henry had himself crowned Henry IV. One cause of Richard's unpopularity had been his reluctance to continue the war in France. Henry was aware of this and planned to resume hostilities. However this did not happen, as he was plagued with financial problems, declining health and kept busy putting down rebellions.
In Scotland, the English regime change prompted border raids that were countered by an invasion in 1402 and the defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Homildon Hill. A dispute over the spoils between Henry and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland resulted in a long and bloody struggle between the two for control of northern England, resolved only with the almost complete destruction of the Percy family by 1408.
In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr was declared Prince of Wales on 16 September 1400. He was the leader of the most serious and widespread rebellion against English authority in Wales since the conquest of 1282–3. The rebellion was finally put down only in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.
In the meantime Charles VI of France was descending into madness and an open conflict for power began between his cousin John the Fearless and his brother, Louis of Orléans. After Louis's assassination, the Armagnac family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war. In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who massacred the Count of Armagnac and about 2,500 of his followers. 
Throughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by pirates that heavily damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such privateering campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war. The French responded in kind and French pirates, under Scottish protection, raided many English coastal towns.
The domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade.
Henry IV of England died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. Charles VI of France's mental illness allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. Henry V was well aware of these divisions and hoped to exploit them. In 1414 while he held court at Leicester, he received ambassadors from Burgundy.
Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter Catherine of Valois. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.
Resumption of the war under Henry V: 1415–29.
Burgundy alliance and the taking of Paris.
Battle of Agincourt (1415).
In August 1415, Henry V sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to Harfleur. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, he elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of Crécy, he found himself outmaneuvered and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the Battle of Agincourt, north of the Somme. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed. Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.
Treaty of Troyes (1420).
Henry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and Rouen on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with the Duchy of Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke John the Fearless in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the Treaty of Troyes, by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, Charles VII, was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the Estates-General.
Death of Clarence (1421).
On 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress, in his French campaign, experienced an unexpected reverse. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir Thomas, Duke of Clarence in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by John Stewart, Earl of Buchan at the Battle of Baugé. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing melée, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by Alexander Buchanan. The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury, who conducted the English retreat.
English success.
Henry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and Gâtinais before returning to Paris. From there he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of Meaux. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October, 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May, 1422.
At the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at Senlis. While there it became apparent that he was ill (possibly dysentery) and when he set out to the Upper Loire he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August, 1422. The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later, on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, Henry, later to become Henry VI.
On his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France (as Henry VI was only an infant). The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the Battle of Verneuil, (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baugé, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.
Joan of Arc and French revival.
Joan of Arc's appearance sparked a revival of French spirits and the tide began to turn against the English.
In 1428, the English laid siege to Orléans. Their force was insufficient to fully invest the city. In 1429 Joan convinced the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops and they attacked the English redoubts, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.
Shortly afterwards, a French army broke through the English archers at Patay, crushing an army commanded by John Fastolf and taking John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to Reims for his coronation as Charles VII (16 July 1429).
Joan changed the way that the French forces engaged with the English in battle. Her tactics were not to engage prepared English lines, with a full frontal assault, as had been the traditional way.
French victory: 1429–53.
Henry's coronations and the desertion of Burgundy.
Henry VI was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.
Joan was captured by the Burgundians in 1430. Charles refused to pay her ransom so she was sold to the English. Accusing her of being a witch, they tried her for heresy. Joan was found guilty and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.
After Joan of Arc's death the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English. Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais whereas Cardinal Beaufort was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the congress of Arras, in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, Philip III, duke of Burgundy deserted to Charles VII, signing the Treaty of Arras that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France. The Duke of Bedford died 14 September 1435 and was replaced by a lesser man.
French resurgence.
Burgundy's allegiance remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains into the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in France. The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use and centralising the French state. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege fell after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.
By 1449, the French had retaken Rouen and in 1450 the Count of Clermont and Arthur de Richemont, Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future Arthur III, Duke of Brittany) caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen at the Battle of Formigny and defeated it. The English army had been attacked from the flank and rear by Richemont's force just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army.
Fall of Gascony.
After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were defeated at the Battle of Castillon 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordnance officer Jean Bureau and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.
End of the war.
Although the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the War of the Roses, that started in 1455.
The Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke Charles of Burgundy, counting on English support, took up arms against Louis XI of France. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying Edward IV of England off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in an agreement signed at the Treaty of Picquigny (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England continued to keep the lilies of France (Fleur-de-lis) on their coat of arms and even bore the title, until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King Louis XVIII of France, who was living in England after the French Revolution.
Charles the last duke of Burgundy met his end at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, where he was hauled from his horse and beaten to death. He left a daughter, Marie, who was stripped of the duchy by Louis XI.
Significance.
The Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that warfare taught.
Before the Hundred Years' War, heavy cavalry was considered the most powerful unit in an army, but by the war's end, this belief had shifted. The heavy horse was increasingly negated by the use of the longbow (and, later, another long-distance weapon: firearms). Edward III was famous for dismounting his men-at-arms and have them and his archers stand in closely integrated battle lines; the horses only being used for transport or pursuit. The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as hobelars. Hobelars tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would also dismount to engage the enemy.
By the end of the Hundred Years' War, these various factors caused the decline of the expensively outfitted, highly trained heavy cavalry and the eventual end of the armoured knight as a military force and of the nobility as a political one.
The war stimulated nationalistic sentiment. It devastated France as a land, but it also awakened French nationalism. The Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralized state. The conflict became one of not just English and French kings but one between the English and French peoples. There were constant rumours in England that the French meant to invade and destroy the English language. National feeling that emerged from such rumours unified both France and England further. The Hundred Years' War basically confirmed the fall of the French language in England, which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest until 1362.
Lowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore French kings found alternative ways to finance the war – sales taxes, debasing the coinage – and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.
Bubonic Plague and warfare depleted the overall population of Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. France, for example, began with a population of about 17 million, but by the end of the Hundred Years' War it had declined by about one-half. Some regions were affected much more than others. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population. In the Paris region, between 1328 and 1470 the population was reduced by at least two-thirds, while the Black Death killed between a fifth and a third of the English population.

Jewish History.
During WWI, in 1915 the town was captured by Russia, during the Rosh Hashana (Jewish new year) festivities. Some Jews were killed during the rampage that followed. In 1918 local peasants attacked Jews and took Jewish belongings and property. 
The town had about 1000 Jews, most of them Hassidic (ultra orthodox), and several religious Zionists.
On September 17, 1939, (On the Jewish 'Gedalya' fast day) German soldiers entered Dubiecko, two days after the slaughter of the Jews of Dynow on the second day of Rosh Hashana (September 15, 1939). They caught 11 Jews and killed them, burning the synagogues and beating the men attempting to save holy scrolls, including the Rabbis.
A week later (eve of the Succoth festivities week), on September 27 the remaining Jews were ordered to assemble at the town square. From there they were marched across the border, and the San river, while being beaten and brutalized, to Soviet territory. Some drowned during the crossing. Peasants on both sides of the river robbed the Jews of whatever little possessions they had. Some ended up in Przemyśl others in Lvov. Many perished on the way. The young Rebbe of the town perished with his wife in Przemyśl, after returning from Jerusalem to Poland just before the war. Most of these Jews perished later after Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, almost two years later.

Cobblestone Farmhouse at 1229 Birdsey Road

Cobblestone Farmhouse at 1229 Birdsey Road is a farmhouse in the town of Junius, New York, in Seneca County, New York. It is significant as a well-preserved example of cobblestone architecture, in a vernacular Greek Revival style. North of the house, there is also a large barn believed to date to the late 19th century. This property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 2008. It is the sixth property listed as a featured property of the week in a program of the National Park Service that began in July, 2008.
House.
The house is thought to have been built in the 1830s or 1840s. walls of the two-story structure are made with rounded field stones between limestone quoins that both decorate and stabilize the walls. The multi-colored field cobbles are held in place with limestone mortared "V" joints, typical of cobblestone construction of the Middle Period. The quoins are twelve inches (305 mm) high, and there are three to four courses of cobblestones for each quoin. The house is laid out with two windows on either side of a central entrance. The one-story porch outside the front door has Victorian details under a hip roof. The Greek Revival features of the entrance include square pilasters and half side-lights. The builder and/or architect is not known.
Architecture.
Cobblestone architecture was developed in New York State to a high degree. A survey identified 660 cobblestone structures in 21 New York counties. There may be approximately 300 elsewhere in the United States, concentrated in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Vermont.
Barn.
The barn on the property is constructed of wood siding attached vertically to the frame. It is itself significant as a typical example of late 19th century barn construction.
Location.
The property is located on Birdsey Road, a north-south county road, directly adjacent to the New York State Thruway, effectively on the northeast corner of that intersection. The town of Junius remains largely rural in character. The property is what remains of the original farmstead. The topography is fairly flat, and the land mostly cleared, with scattered groups of trees.
There are three other cobblestone farmhouses in the same township which are also listed on the National Register: Cobblestone Farmhouse at 1027 Stone Church Rd., Cobblestone Farmhouse at 1027 Stone Church Rd., and John Graves Cobblestone Farmhouse.

Jack Powers

Jack Powers (John Power) (1827 – November 1860) was an Irish born gambler, outlaw, highway-robber, gang leader, and murderer in southern and central California during the Gold Rush era. For a time in the 1850s, robberies and murders committed by his group of bandits made the stretch of El Camino Real between San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara the most dangerous route in the state, and he and his gang had almost complete control of the small city of Santa Barbara. He was eventually driven out of town, but only after intimidating and defeating the sheriff and a posse of 200. He eventually fled the area, and after a brief career running a ranch in the Mexican state of Sonora, he was murdered in a fight over a woman, and his body was fed to a pen of starving pigs.
Early career.
Born in Ireland as John Power, he came to the United States with his parents in 1836, and settled with them in New York City. While there he learned gambling, courtly manners, and how to ride a horse; he also made the acquaintance of many street toughs in the run-down districts of the Bowery and Hell's Kitchen. When the Mexican-American War commenced in 1846, he joined the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers with many of his friends from the streets of New York, and went west to be a soldier. The New York Volunteers was a unit organized by Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson to occupy and settle California, and men in the unit were promised land in the region should the war be successful.
By the time his unit had reached San Francisco, sailing around Cape Horn, Powers had already become a sergeant, under Captain Francis J. Lippitt in Company F of Stevenson's regiment which was tasked with occupying Santa Barbara. When they landed at West Beach the war was already over for Santa Barbara. John C. Frémont had captured the town on December 27, 1846, and accepted the surrender of the Mexican forces in Los Angeles two weeks later. Powers and his men from the Bowery entered the town in early 1847 as an occupying force.
It did not take long for the charismatic Powers to become popular with the locals. He had good looks, good manners, and his horsemanship impressed even the local "caballeros", who expected the ability from a gentleman, but not from a Yankee. But when Powers' unit was mustered out on August 7, 1848 after the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, he left town, going north to San Francisco. Many of the men of his Regiment went instead to the gold fields, intending to get rich. Powers intended to do so as well, but by using his peculiar talents, those that required a city.
Powers' skill as a gambler paid off richly in San Francisco, where he amassed a fortune in the gambling halls in that rowdy frontier town. Briefly he was involved with the Barbary Coast-neighborhood gang of toughs known as "The Hounds," which took part in robbery, murder, and rape of the non-"American," and particularly Hispanic and Catholic, residents of the city; many of the members of this gang were fellow refugees from the streets of the Bowery, Five Points, or Hell's Kitchen in New York. Powers fled town to avoid being lynched by vigilantes, and returned to Santa Barbara around 1849, where he found a job caring for the horses belonging to the influential De la Guerra family.
Santa Barbara - Rise to power.
It was a profitable choice of employment, for he intended to be a highwayman. De la Guerra owned numerous ranches along the length of El Camino Real, all with good horses; charged with their care, and out of sight of his employer, he could do what he wanted. When Salomon Pico's band was broken up in 1851, Powers brought its remnants together under his own leadership. Powers arranged for fast horses to be available at points along the route to assist him and his gang with getaways. During this period, ranchers were making a fortune on the gold fields – not on ore, but on selling cattle to the hungry mining camps at an enormous profit. After driving their cattle north from the ranches of Santa Barbara County, they would return with their baggage full of gold dust or "octagonals" – gold ingots or "slugs" worth fifty dollars – and in the lawless climate these travelers were a tempting target.
The Sheriff in Santa Barbara at the time was Valentine Hearne, who shared Powers' hatred of the Hispanic residents from whom the town had so recently been taken. He gave little resistance to Powers, as Powers and his "Band of Five" began what historian Walker A. Tompkins described as a "reign of terror" that lasted until approximately 1855. During this period, in which Powers and his gang were active as highway robbers up and down El Camino Real, the route connecting the old Mission towns, the stretch from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo was notorious as the most dangerous place to travel in California. Mutilated bodies appeared regularly along the road; Powers had the uncanny knack for appearing in the gambling halls of Los Angeles or elsewhere almost instantly after a new murder along the route, fooling people into thinking he was uninvolved: but what they did not know was that he always had fresh and fast horses ready at strategic points along the trail. Yet suspicion persisted because some of the eyewitnesses told tales of magnificent horsemanship by one of the masked bandits – a skill Powers had earlier been too proud to hide.
Matters came to a head in 1853. Powers was confident enough to cease his banditry and come into the open, and he seized the Mission Santa Inés along with the adjacent Rancho San Marcos. This fertile and profitable operation was leased to prominent local rancher Nicolas A. Den, coincidentally a fellow Irishman who had come to California during Mexican times. Powers attempted to steal the cattle from the ranch but Den caught them during the attempted roundup, and with an armed force he humiliated Powers, making him run for his life, and recovering all the cattle in the process. Powers, not one to turn the other cheek, came back for Den – but not right away.
Battle of Arroyo Burro.
Powers seized control of an uninhabited structure in the Arroyo Burro (now San Roque Canyon, in the vicinity of Stevens Park at the Foothill Road bridge), and claimed it as his own, along with his company of bandits, many of whom were supported by the recently arrived American residents of Santa Barbara. His gang of squatters fortified the place, ignoring calls to leave. Den won a judgment against them in district court. Powers even appealed to the California Supreme Court, but lost. The new sheriff, William W. Twist, was required by law to serve notice on them to leave, so he gathered a posse of 200 men at the Aguirre Adobe, at Carrillo and Anacapa Streets, to go to Arroyo Burro, about three miles away, and evict them.
Powers was not one to wait: seizing the initiative, he sent a small band of his outlaws to disrupt the organization and assassinate the sheriff. Reaching the Aguirre Adobe, one of them fired one shot at the district attorney, who had just stepped out of the building, putting a hole in his hat; another stabbed Sheriff Twist in the back, seriously injuring him; but a barrage of gunfire from the assembled force brought both outlaws down and the others ran, with the posse in pursuit. 
The posse arrived out-of-breath at Arroyo Burro Canyon, to be met with a hail of bullets, and stopped short. After a brief negotiation, Powers informed the leader of the posse (Twist, injured, had stayed behind) that his gang would kill any man that passed a huge sycamore tree (the "Outlaw Tree", still standing at 134 North Ontare, not far from State Street). Seeing that the bandits were dug in, well-armed, and determined, the posse backed away in defeat.
Powers continued his highway robbing in the vicinity, but not for long. He abandoned his camp in Arroyo Burro when he heard that a band of better-organized and uniformed vigilantes, similar to the one that had defanged the "Hounds" in the Barbary Coast, was riding down from San Luis Obispo to eliminate him (according to another source, he heard that a company of U.S. Marines was on its way). By the time the vigilantes reached Santa Barbara, he was gone, leaving behind nothing but the persistent legend of buried treasure which accompanies most hurried bandit exits. However Powers and his gang continued to plague the central coast under Pio Linares while Powers moved to Los Angeles. 
Twist later recovered from his knifing, but along with the mayor he resigned in 1855 due to the continued lawlessness in the area, lack of competent backup, and an anti-Anglo backlash. While a judge occasionally issued arrest warrants, there was no one to carry them out until later in the decade. At one point, California Governor John Bigler dispatched a U.S. Navy warship to Santa Barbara to restore order.
Later career and death.
The departure of Powers was just one step on the tenuous return of law and order in Santa Barbara and the surrounding region, which had been lawless since the takeover from Mexico. After leaving Santa Barbara, Powers went first to Los Angeles, where he became overlord of a gambling operation, but in 1858 his role in the activities of Pio Linares and his gang in San Luis Obispo County came to light. Finally there were enough warrants for his arrest that he left the country, going to Mexico.
Details of the last years of his life are sparse. He left Los Angeles in 1859, probably to escape a lynch mob, going to the Mexican state of Sonora where he ran a ranching operation in the mountains northeast of Hermosillo. In November 1860, he fought with one of his own men over a woman. She and her lover murdered him and hurled his body into a mesquite-fenced enclosure filled with starving hogs. 
The uneaten portion of his corpse was buried in the Arizona Territory south of Tubac, near the town of Nogales, Sonora.

Rhus copallina

Rhus copallina (orth. var. "Rhus copallinum"), Shining Sumac, Dwarf Sumac, Flameleaf Sumac or Winged Sumac, is a species of flowering plant in the cashew family (Anacardiaceae) that is native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree growing to tall and an equal spread with a rounded crown. A 5-year-old sapling will stand about .
Description.
Shining sumac is often cultivated, where it is well-suited to natural and informal landscapes because it has underground runners which spread to provide dense, shrubby cover for birds and wildlife. This species is valued for ornamental planting because of its lustrous dark green foliage which turns a brilliant orange-red in fall. The fall color display is frequently enjoyed along interstate highways, as the plant readily colonizes these and other disturbed sites.

Bristol Bullet

The Bristol Type 32 Bullet was a British biplane racing aircraft. It was designed in 1919 by Frank Barnwell as a high-speed testbed for the Jupiter engine being developed in Bristol by Roy Fedden for the Cosmos Engineering company and also to publicise the company's name by participating in air races.
The Bullet was a conventional single-seat biplane with single-bay wings of thin low-drag section braced by N struts. The fuselage was a wooden four-longeron structure faired to a circular section.
The finished airframe was exhibited with a dummy engine at the Paris Aero Salon in December 1919 but an engine did not become available until June 1920, when the aircraft was first flown. It was flown by Cyril Uwins in the Aerial Derby of July that year. Its performance in the race was disappointing, and the aircraft was substantially modified, including a new cowling, a large hemispherical spinner and wings of greatly reduced span and gap. By the time the modifications were complete Cosmos had gone bankrupt and the aero-engine business had been bought by Bristol, and the Bullet was used for the task of accumulating flight hours of the Jupiter in order to gain Air Ministry type approval, a job it shared with the Bristol Badger.
Modified, the Bullet's maximum speed was increased to , and it finished fourth in the 1921 Aerial Derby at an average speed of 141 mph (227 km/h). 
A more powerful 380 hp (280 kW) Jupiter II engine was fitted, and, piloted by Rollo A. de Haga Haig, came second in the 1922 Aerial Derby at an average speed of 145 mph (233 km/h), beaten only by the Gloster Mars (which had also won the 1921 race
It was entered for the 1923 Aeriel Derby and Kings Cup races, but following the death of Leslie Foot, the intended pilot, flying the Bristol M.1D in the Grosvenor Cup race Bristol withdrew from racing and the Bullet was retired, and eventually scrapped in 1924.

John McPhun

John David McPhun (born September 8, 1940 in Salisbury, Rhodesia) was a first-class cricketer who played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup.
McPhun struggled early in his career, making just 147 runs from his first eight first-class matches, with a highest score of 39. After a two and a half year absence he returned to the side for a fixture against Border in the 1963/64 Currie Cup and, opening the batting with Ray Gripper, scored 131. Rhodesia went on to win the match by an innings and 74 runs. Scores in the following two matches of 93 and 69* respectively saw him finish the season with an average of 106.00.
His form again fell away and in his next 11 matches could only manage two half centuries. McPhun however remained in the Rhodesian team and came good in 1970/71 with 525 runs at 75.00 in first-class matches, including 453 runs at 75.50 in the Currie Cup. He made his highest first-class score of 154 in a match against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein in 1970.
He was also a Rhodesian field hockey international and competed at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. One of his teammates was fellow cricketer Robert Ullyett.

Soundtracks Volume 2

Soundtracks Volume 2 is a 2003 album of film music by Marc Ribot released on Tzadik Records.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Sean Westergaard states "The already eclectic Marc Ribot may have released his widest-reaching album to date with "Soundtracks, Vol. 2". From neo-Dixieland to spooky electronica to solo shakuhachi, Ribot turns in a head-spinning program of disparate genres that hang together surprisingly well as an album... Ribot's guitar credentials have never been in doubt, but his recent works for Tzadik is showing him to be an impressive composer with a broad palette as well".

Tarłów

Tarłów is a village (a town in 1550-1870) in Opatów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Tarłów. It lies approximately north-east of Opatów and east of the regional capital Kielce. It is approximately north of the town of Ozarow. The village has a population of 790, and belongs to historic province of Lesser Poland.
The history of Tarłów dates back to 1550, when a local nobleman, Andrzej Tarło, founded the town named after himself, which replaced the already existing village of Czekarzewice. Tarłów received its charter in 1550 from King Zygmunt August, in Piotrków Trybunalski. The town’s inhabitants, thanks to the King’s order, were exempt from paying taxes for 20 years. In 1614 Tarłów got its first, wooden church, founded by Mikołaj Oleśnicki. In 1636 a hospital was opened, and in 1647, the wooden church was replaced with a brick church of Holy Trinity, which still stands.
During the Deluge, Swedish invaders destroyed and ransacked most of Lesser Poland’s towns, including Tarłów. After the wars, the town never recovered. In 1851, when Tarłów already belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, it almost completely burned - all that remained were four houses and the church. During the January Uprising Tarłów was one of the centers of the rebellion, for which in 1869 the Russians stripped it of the town rights. In 1873, a pandemic of cholera decimated the population, including local artisans, famous for their pots. In 1877 Tarłów got a courthouse of the gmina, and in 1905 - first fire station. In 1927, the government of the Second Polish Republic opened here an elementary school, in a complex which is still used. In 1915, during World War I, 1st Brigade, Polish Legions fought here with Russian troops. During World War II, Tarłów's Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust. In 1943, the Home Army company "Tarłów" was created, which in the summer 1944 took part in the Operation Tempest.
Famous Rabbis.
Jacob Joshua Falk (1680 - 1756) the famous Talmudist and author of the Pene Yehoshua was Rabbi in Tarłów for a time. 
Rabbi Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg (1859-1935) was rabbi in Tarłów from 1885-1889 or 1890 (he had married a woman from Tarłów in 1877) and became known in Poland as Rav Yudel Tarlow’er. 
A prolific author, Rabbi Rosenberg assumed a number of positions in Poland, before moving to Toronto, Canada, where he became rabbi of Beth Jacob, a Polish Jewish congregation that was established in 1897. There he founded the Eitz Chaim school (which still exists today), before moving to Montreal in 1919,where he served as one of its most prominent rabbis, until 1935, when he passed away at the age of seventy-five. Scholars believe that many of the stories told today about the Golem of Prague (attributed to the Maharal of Prague - Judah Loew ben Bezalel) were in fact first authored by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg.
Fate of Tarłów's Jewish Population.
After World War I, about 1,000 Jews lived in Tarłów, roughly half of the small town's
population. They worked in crafts and small time trade - some farmed small plots of land near their homes. Most of its Jewish population was traditional (Orthodox)
with a smaller percentage identifying with Zionism.
In September 1939, the Germans occupied Tarłów. They established a Judenrat, and forced them to collect large sums of money in ransoms, and also gathered Jewish residents for forced labor.
The ghetto in Tarłów was set up in December 1941. ln June 1942, seventy
young Jews were sent from the ghetto to the Skarżysko-Kamienna labor camp.
A few months later, the Germans brought Jews from nearby towns to the Tarłów ghetto, and the ghetto population swelled to approximately 7,000 people.
On October 29, 1942, the majority of ghetto inhabitants were deported to Treblinka. During the deportation, more than 100 Jews were murdered, and dozens who were found hiding were executed in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Tarłów. 
Today there is not a single Jew left in Tarłów or even within miles of the town. Not far from the centre, the town's former synagogue (built in 1786) lies in ruins, overrun with bushes and trees. 
Cemetery Restoration.
In the fall of 2011, the Jewish cemetery in Tarłów, which had laid in ruins since the Holocaust, was rededicated in a ceremony attended by Jewish people from around the world with roots in Tarłów, along with the town's residents. The initiative to restore the cemetery had begun a decade earlier, with the efforts of a local Polish citizen, Dr. Jan Curylo, who had organized the cemetery reclamation effort. 
The inscription at the newly restored cemetery reads:
"In memory of the righteous Jews of Tarlow, those brutally murdered during the war, whose graves will forever be unknown, and those whose graves were desecrated here - at the hands of the soulless Nazi murderers.
May the descendants of Tarlow's Jews honor their memory through the observance of Torah and Mitzvot and by creating peace in the world.
This cemetery has been restored by North American Jews with roots in Tarlow and the surrounding region."

The town was formed when due to several routing errors of trains in occupied Poland, Nazi German renamed the railway station to Jasice to resolve the issue. In the period after the war several homes built near by incorrectly took the name of Jasice rather than Bidziny leading to the development of the village of Jasice which consists of the Station and several close houses only. To highlight this, the local farm supplies store which is approximate 20 m from the station on the same road is located in Bidziny in addition to several nearby houses.

Enuig

The enuig, enueg or enuech (; "complaint, vexation") is a genre of lyric poetry practised by the troubadours. Somewhat similar to the "sirventes", the "enuig" was generally a litany of complaints, few of them connect topically to the others. The word ""enuig"" appears frequently in such works. The Monge de Montaudon was the first master of the "enuig".
Raymond Hill defined an "enueg" as "the enumeration in epigrammatic style of a series of vexatious things". He finds the genre continued in later medieval Catalan, Italian, French, and Galician-Portuguese literature. Ernest Wilkins considered William Shakespeare's Sonnet LXVI an example of an English "enuig", citing also example from Petrarch. Richard Levin considers the anonymous English poem beginning "Whear giltles men ar greuously opreste" to be an "enuig".

Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge

The Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge is set forth in a proposal by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) entitled "Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21st century". This proposal seeks to identify and implement improvements to the education and licensure process for civil engineers in the United States of America.
Current status.
In the United States, the body of knowledge necessary to obtain a license to practice engineering is defined by the laws or regulations of each state or territory. Most states have a standard that is a four step process. First, an individual must obtain a Bachelor's degree from a university program that is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. A two-step examination process administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying must be completed. The first eight-hour test is the Fundamentals of Engineering exam; the second, also eight hours long, is the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam. The other step is to work an apprenticeship, usually of four years in length, under an already-licensed engineer. The second exam is generally the fourth and final step; the fundamentals exam can be taken before or after the apprenticeship in most states.
The first state to regulate the practice of engineering was Wyoming in 1907. After that, ASCE established a model law for licensure. The last state to pass licensure laws for engineers was Montana.
Many states now require continuing education to maintain a license to practice engineering. In 1979, Iowa became the first. Since then about half of the states have added continuing education to their engineering laws.
History.
The ASCE board of directors adopted a policy in 1998 (Policy Statement 465) that supported a change to make the master's degree be the first professional degree to enable practice of civil engineering. This proposed change was not widely accepted within the civil engineering profession and the policy was first revised in 2001 to support a requirement for a "master’s degree or equivalent". It was revised again in 2004 to support "the attainment of a body of knowledge for entry into the practice of civil engineering at the professional level"
The ASCE board created a standing committee, the Committee on Academic Prerequisites for Professional Practice (CAP3), charged with the implementation of Policy Statement 465. CAP3 determined that the best implementation of PS 465 was to define the body of knowledge (BOK) that would form the foundation of the licensure process. CAP3 in turn established the Body of Knowledge Committee which wrote the first (2004) and second (current, 2008) versions of the BOK.
Content the BOK.
The body of knowledge defines twenty-four outcomes that make up the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to practice civil engineering. The outcomes are divided into three categories: foundational, technical, and professional.
1. Mathematics 2. Natural sciences 3. Humanities 4. Social sciences
5. Materials science 6. Mechanics 7. Experiments 8. Problem recognition and solving 9. Design 10. Sustainability 11. Contemporary issues & historical perspectives 12. Risk and uncertainty 13. Project management 14. Breadth in civil engineering areas 15. Technical specialization
16. Communication 17. Public policy 18. Business and public administration 19. Globalization 20. Leadership 21. Teamwork 22. Attitudes 23. Lifelong learning 24. Professional and ethical responsibility
The body of knowledge uses Bloom's Taxonomy to outline the necessary level of achievement for each of the twenty-four outcomes.
Implementation status.
ASCE has formed the BOK Educational Fulfillment Committee (BOKEdFC) to focus on the changes needed to engineering education. This committee is composed of representatives from universities with four-year civil engineering programs.
NCEES considered the implementation of the BOK at their 2008 annual meeting and decided to establish a task force. The task force is provide an analysis of "(1) the potential educational, professional, regulatory, and economic impact of the master's or equivalent; and (2) any alternative solutions besides the master's or equivalent that could potentially address the challenge of better preparing engineering licensure candidates to enter the profession."
In 2008, Nebraska became the first to consider legislation requiring college-level education beyond the Bachelors degree as a requirement for a professional engineering license. The legislation was not enacted, in part to testimony from engineering associations. The Nebraska section of the American Council of Engineering Companies stated that the new requirement might have made it more difficult for companies located in their state to hire and keep entry-level engineers.

Pwnie Awards

The Pwnie Awards recognize both excellence and incompetence in the field of information security. Winners are selected by a committee of security industry professionals from nominations collected from the information security community. The awards are presented yearly at the Black Hat Security Conference.
Origins.
The name Pwnie Award is based on the word "pwn", which is hacker slang meaning "to compromise" or to "control" based on the previous usage of the word "own" (and it is pronounced similarly). The name "The Pwnie Awards" is meant to sound like The Tony Awards, an awards ceremony for Broadway Theater in New York City.
History.
The Pwnie Awards were founded in 2007 by Alexander Sotirov and Dino Dai Zovi following discussions regarding Dino's discovery of a cross-platform QuickTime vulnerability and Alexander's discovery of an ANI file processing vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
Winners.
2012.
The award for best server-side bug went to Sergey Golubchik for his MySQL authentication bypass flaw. Two awards for best client-side bug were given to Sergey Glazunov and Pinkie Pie for their Google Chrome flaws presented as part of Google's Pwnium contest.
The award for best privilege escalation bug went to Mateusz Jurczyk ("j00ru") for a vulnerability in the Windows kernel that affected all 32-bit versions of Windows. The award for most innovative research went to Travis Goodspeed for a way to send network packets that would inject additional packets.
The award for best song went to "Control" by nerdcore rapper Dual Core. A new category of award, the "Tweetie Pwnie Award" for having more Twitter followers than the judges, went to MuscleNerd of the iPhone Dev Team as a representative of the iOS jailbreaking community.
The "most epic fail" award was presented by Metasploit creator HD Moore to F5 Networks for their static root SSH key issue, and the award was accepted by an employee of F5, unusual because the winner of this category usually does not accept the award at the ceremony. Other nominees included LinkedIn (for its data breach exposing password hashes) and the antivirus industry (for failing to detect threats such as Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame).
The award for "epic 0wnage" went to Flame for its MD5 collision attack, recognizing it as a sophisticated and serious piece of malware that weakened trust in the Windows Update system.

2008 Samsung FEI Nations Cup Promotional League

The 2008 Samsung FEI Nations Cup Promotional League was the 2008 edition of the second division of the Samsung Super League, an international team Grand Prix show jumping competition run by the FEI. Ireland won the Promotional League the previous year and had been promoted to the 2008 Samsung Super League. France joined the series, having been relegated from the 2007 Samsung Super League.
Before the beginning of the 2009 season of the Meydan FEI Nations Cup (the follower of the Samsung Super League), the number of participating nations teams in the Meydan FEI Nations Cup has been increased up to ten. Thus, after the descent of Sweden, three nations starting positions are reassigned. This was done by the placement of best placed show jumpers from every nation in the world rankings. The emerging nations to the 2009 Meydan FEI Nations Cup were Sweden, France and Canada. The national equestrian federation of Canada refrained, so Italy moved into the Meydan FEI Nations Cup for the 2009 season.

The points of the seven best results of each nation are added to the final result.

"(Between 1975-1998 Ocieka was in the Rzeszów Voivodeship)". The village has a population of 1,233 and lies on the main road between Ropczyce and Mielec. It is situated in the Sandomierz Wilderness (), one of the biggest forests in southern Poland, which covers large parts of the Sandomierz Basin, an areas was once popular with Polish nobility () for hunting and fishing. Ocieka lies on the Tuszymka river, a tributary of the Wisłoka river. In the past this area was known for iron smelting and iron goods.
History.
Since its formation in the late 15th century Ocieka has been known by several different names; although these appear to be phonetic variations of the same name. Parish documents and chronicles show it as "‘Otsijeka’", "‘Odszycha’" and "‘Ucieka’". The village was named by Anna "née Ocieska" Mielecka and it is probably the ancestral seat of the "‘Ocieskis’", who also owned Rzemień, a village to the north of Ocieka. In the 15th century the area was popular with Polish nobility () for hunting. The Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło was said to be a frequent visitior to the area, listing it as one of his "‘favourite’" places for "‘hunting and recuperation’".
According to a local legend, in the region near Ocieka there occurred a battle against the Tatars. The Polish knights achieved a resounding victory. To commemorate this, a hill close by became known as "‘Góra Tatarska’" (Tatar Hill). In 1531 the Grand Crown Hetman, Jan Amor Tarnowski led a Polish army against the Moldavian Prince ("‘Hospodar’") Petru IV Rareş () in the Battle of Obertyn. Despite being outnumbered four to one, the battle ended with a Polish victory, a complete Tatar surrender, and the reconquest of Pokuttya or "‘Pokuttia’" (, , ). Tarnowski brought his Tatar prisoners-of-war back to Ocieka. These prisoners became the first occupants of a new settlement near Ocieka called ‘Sadykierz’. The name ‘Sadykierz’ has distinct Tatar origins, just as do today's inhabitants of the same village ("The original settlement of ‘Sadykierz’ was located by a post-glacial lake, home to a rare species of white water-lily.")
Ocieka became an independent parish in 1610. At this time, Ocieka had a very industrial character; tar and wood charcoal was manufactured here, as was iron. In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a glass foundry nearby.
At this time the ownership of the village passed from the ‘Ocieski’ family to the ‘Romerów’ (or ‘Romer’) family.
World War II.
During the Second World War, the church in Ocieka was converted into a warehouse, for the storage of specialist test-rocket construction materials. From 5 November 1943 until early July 1944, a team of German scientists, led by Wernher von Braun, built and tested V-2 rockets in the nearby village of Blizna.
