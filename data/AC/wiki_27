Double Jeopardy Clause

The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: "or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in criminal or civil cases . . . ." The four essential protections included are prohibitions against, for the same offense:
Jeopardy attaches in jury trial when the jury is empaneled and sworn in, in a bench trial when the court begins to hear evidence after the first witness is sworn in, or when a court accepts a defendant's plea unconditionally. Jeopardy does not attach in a retrial of a conviction that was reversed on appeal on procedural grounds (as opposed to evidentiary insufficiency grounds), in a retrial for which "manifest necessity" has been shown following a mistrial, and in the seating of a second grand jury if the first refuses to return an indictment.
"Same offense".
In "United States v. Felix" 503 U.S. 378 (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled: "a...offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes."
Sometimes the same conduct may violate different statutes. If all elements of a lesser offense are relied on to prove a greater offense, the two crimes are the "same offense" for double jeopardy purposes, and the doctrine will bar the second prosecution. In "Blockburger v. United States", , the Supreme Court held that "where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not". The test was applied in "Brown v. Ohio", , where the defendant had first been convicted of operating an automobile without the owner's consent, and later of stealing the same automobile. The Supreme Court concluded that the same evidence was necessary to prove both offenses, and that in effect there was only one offense. Therefore, it overturned the second conviction.
In other cases, the same conduct may constitute multiple offenses under the same statute, for instance where one robs many individuals at the same time. There is no explicit bar to separate prosecutions for different offenses arising under the same "criminal transaction", but it is not permissible for the prosecution to re-litigate facts already determined by a jury. In "Ashe v. Swenson", , the defendant was accused of robbing seven poker players during a game. John Ashe was first tried for, and acquitted of, robbing only one of the players; the defense did not contest that a robbery actually took place. The state then tried the defendant for robbing the second player; stronger identification evidence led to a conviction. The Supreme Court, however, overturned the conviction. It was held that in the first trial, since the defense had not presented any evidence that there was no robbery, the jury's acquittal had to be based on the conclusion that the defendant's alibi was valid. Since one jury had held that the defendant was not present at the crime scene, the State could not re-litigate the issue.
"Twice put in jeopardy".
Retrial after acquittal.
Once acquitted, a defendant may not be retried for the same offense: "A verdict of acquittal, although not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense." Acquittal by directed verdict is also final and cannot be appealed by the prosecution. An acquittal in a trial by judge (bench trial) is also generally not appealable by the prosecution. A trial judge may normally enter an acquittal if he deems the evidence insufficient for conviction. If the judge makes this ruling before the jury reaches its verdict, the judge's determination is final. If, however, the judge overrules a conviction by the jury, the prosecution may appeal to have the conviction reinstated. Additionally, although a judge may overrule a guilty verdict by a jury, he or she does not have the same power to overrule a not guilty verdict.
More specifically, as stated in "Ashe v. Swenson", 397 U.S. 436 (1970): "...when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit." "Res judicata" is a term of general application. Underneath that conceptual umbrella is the concept of collateral estoppel. As applied to double jeopardy, the court will use collateral "estoppel" as its basis for forming an opinion.
If a defendant charged with murder in the first degree is convicted for murder in the second degree, and later the jury's conviction is overturned on procedural grounds, the defendant may be retried for second degree but not first degree murder; the jury, by convicting the defendant of second degree murder, is deemed to have implicitly acquitted them of first degree murder.
As double jeopardy applies only to charges that were the subject of an earlier "final" judgment, there are many situations in which it does not apply, despite the appearance of a retrial. For example, a second trial held after a mistrial does not violate the double jeopardy clause because a mistrial ends a trial prematurely without a judgment of guilty or not, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in "United States v. Josef Perez" (1824). Cases dismissed because of insufficient evidence may constitute a final judgment for these purposes, though many state and federal laws allow for substantially limited prosecutorial appeals from these orders. Also, a retrial after a conviction that has been set aside following the grant of a motion for new trial, that has been reversed on appeal, or that has been vacated in a collateral proceeding (such as habeas corpus) would not violate double jeopardy because the judgment in the first trial had been invalidated. In all of these cases, however, the previous trials do not entirely vanish. Testimony from them may be used in later retrials, such as to impeach contradictory testimony given at any subsequent proceeding.
Prosecutors may appeal when a trial judge sets aside a jury verdict for conviction with a judgment notwithstanding verdict for the defendant. A successful appeal by the prosecution would simply reinstate the jury verdict and so would not place the defendant at risk of another trial.
If a defendant appeals a conviction and is successful in having it overturned, they are subject to retrial. 
Retrial is not possible if the verdict is overturned on the grounds of evidentiary insufficiency, rather than on the grounds of procedural faults. As noted above, if the trial court made a determination of evidentiary insufficiency, the determination would constitute a final acquittal; in "Burks v. United States" 437 U.S. 1, (1978), the Court held that "it should make no difference that the reviewing court, rather than the trial court, determined the evidence to be insufficient." 
If the earlier trial is a fraud, double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial because the party acquitted has prevented themselves from being placed into "jeopardy" to begin with.
Grand juries and double jeopardy.
The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not attach in a grand jury proceeding, or bar a grand jury from returning an indictment when a prior grand jury has refused to do so.
Retrial after conviction.
A person who is convicted of one set of charges cannot in general be tried on additional charges related to the crime unless said additional charges cover new facts against which the person in question has not yet been acquitted or convicted. The test that determines whether this can occur is the Blockburger test.
An example of this are the charges of "conspiring to commit murder" and "murder". Both charges typically have facts distinct from each other. A person can be charged with "conspiring to commit murder" even if the murder never actually takes place if all facts necessary to support the charge can be demonstrated through evidence. Further, a person convicted or acquitted of murder can, additionally, be tried on conspiracy as well if it has been determined after the conviction or acquittal that a conspiracy did, in fact, take place.
"Double Jeopardy" and double jeopardy.
A misconception regarding double jeopardy after a conviction comes from the movie "Double Jeopardy". In the film, the main character Libby Parsons is convicted of murdering her husband Nick. She later discovers that he faked his death. In a jailhouse conversation, disbarred attorney Margaret Skolowski makes this statement to Libby about the double jeopardy clause:
It says no person can be convicted of the same crime twice, the state says you already killed your husband right? So, when you get out of here, you track him down, and you can kill him. You can walk up to him in Times Square put a gun to his head and pull the fucking trigger and there's nothing they can do about it!
The original murder charge alleged that Libby Parsons killed her husband Nick Parsons. The fact Nick was alive while the prosecution was saying he is not would invalidate the original indictment, if that were pursued. One such case where this has occurred is the 19th-century case of Jesse and Steven Boorn, convicted of murdering a man named Russel Colvin. Colvin was later found alive and the Boorns subsequently released weeks before their scheduled execution.
If Libby were to kill Nick after discovering he was actually alive, such as "in the middle of Times Square", this would present the same action against the same victim as alleged in the original indictment. It would, however, be at a different time and, very likely, a different place than the original indictment alleged, making it a new offense, which could result in a new indictment. John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute elaborated while speaking specifically of the movie "Double Jeopardy":
Prosecutors must plead their cases in very specific terms. They must note the time, place and method of a particular crime. This is done for two reasons. First, the Fifth Amendment protects the defendant from being prosecuted again for the same crime. This is known as "double jeopardy."
The second reason is to protect the prosecutor. For example, imagine a prosecutor bringing a person into court for burglary. If that same person had been tried for burglary last week, he might claim that the law against double jeopardy protects him from being tried in this second instance. However, if the prosecutor shows that last week's burglary took place in Virginia on a Tuesday night and this week's burglary took place in Maryland on a Wednesday night, the prosecutor can prove that double jeopardy doesn't apply--the defendant is being tried for different burglaries.
Whitehead continues by saying that the original indictment would have "stated a specific time and place for the crime." Actually killing Nick would present a new time and place, albeit for the same action and victim, making it a new crime for which she could be indicted without violating the double jeopardy clause.
Retrial after mistrial.
Mistrials are generally not covered by the double jeopardy clause. If a judge dismisses the case or concludes the trial without deciding the facts in the defendant's favor (for example, by dismissing the case on procedural grounds), the case is a mistrial and may normally be retried. Furthermore, if a jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial and order a retrial as was addressed in "United States v. Josef Perez", 22 U.S. 579 (1824). When the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, even if the prosecutor or judge caused the error that forms the basis of the motion. An exception exists, however, where the prosecutor or judge has acted in bad faith. In "Oregon v. Kennedy", 456 U.S. 667 (1982), the Supreme Court held that "only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to 'goad' the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion."
Multiple punishments.
The defendant may not be punished twice for the same offense. In certain circumstances, however, a sentence may be increased. It has been held that sentences do not have the same "finality" as acquittals, and may therefore be reviewed by the courts. Sentence increases may not, however, be made once the defendant has already begun serving his term of imprisonment. 
The prosecution may not seek capital punishment in the retrial if the jury did not impose it in the original trial. The reason for this exception is that before imposing the death penalty the jury has to make several factual determinations and if the jury does not make these it is seen as the equivalent of an acquittal of a more serious offense.
In "Arizona v. Rumsey", , it was ruled that in a bench trial, when a judge was holding a separate hearing after the jury trial, to decide if the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, the judge decided that the circumstances of the case did not permit death to be imposed. On appeal the judge's ruling was found to be erroneous. However, even though the decision to impose life instead of death was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law by the judge, the conclusion of life imprisonment in the original case constituted an acquittal of the death penalty and thus death could not be imposed upon a subsequent trial. Even though the acquittal of the death penalty was erroneous in that case, the acquittal must stand.
"of life or limb".
Double jeopardy also does not apply if the later charge is civil rather than criminal in nature, which involves a different legal standard (crimes must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas civil wrongs need only be proven by preponderance of evidence or in some matters, clear and convincing evidence). Acquittal in a criminal case does not prevent the defendant from being the defendant in a civil suit relating to the same incident (though "res judicata" operates within the civil court system). For example, O.J. Simpson was acquitted of a double homicide in a California criminal prosecution, but lost a civil wrongful death claim brought over the same victims.
If the defendant happened to be on parole from an earlier offense at the time, the act for which he or she was acquitted may also be the subject of a parole violation hearing, which is not considered to be a criminal trial. Since parolees are usually subject to restrictions not imposed on other citizens, evidence of actions that were not deemed to be criminal by the court may be re-considered by the parole board. This legal board could deem the same evidence to be proof of a parole violation. Most states' parole boards have looser rules of evidence than is found in the courts – for example, hearsay that had been disallowed in court might be considered by a parole board. Finally, like civil trials parole violation hearings are also subject to a lower standard of proof so it is possible for a parolee to be punished by the parole board for criminal actions that he or she was acquitted of in court.
In the American military, courts-martial are subject to the same law of double jeopardy, since the Uniform Code of Military Justice has incorporated all of the protections of the U.S. Constitution. The non-criminal proceeding non-judicial punishment (or NJP) is considered to be akin to a civil case and is subject to lower standards than a court-martial, which is the same as a civilian court of law. NJP proceedings are commonly used to correct or punish minor breaches of military discipline. If a NJP proceeding fails to produce conclusive evidence, however, the commanding officer (or ranking official presiding over the NJP) is not allowed to prepare the same charge against the military member in question. In a court-martial, acquittal of the defendant means he is protected permanently from having those charges reinstated.
The most famous American court case invoking the claim of double jeopardy is probably the second murder trial in 1876 of Jack McCall, killer of Wild Bill Hickok. McCall was acquitted in his first trial, which Federal authorities later ruled to be illegal because it took place in an illegal town, Deadwood, then located in South Dakota Indian Territory. At the time, Federal law prohibited all except Native Americans from settling in the Indian Territory. McCall was retried in Federal Indian Territorial court, convicted, and hanged in 1877. He was the first person ever executed by Federal authorities in the Dakota Territory.
Double jeopardy also does not apply if the defendant were never tried from the start. Charges that were dropped or put on hold for any reason can always be reinstated in the future—if not barred by some statute of limitations.
Incorporation.
Although the Fifth Amendment initially applied only to the federal government, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the double jeopardy clause applies to the states as well through incorporation by the Fourteenth Amendment ("Benton v. Maryland").
Dual sovereignty doctrine.
The "separate sovereigns" exception to double jeopardy arises from the dual nature of the American Federal-State system, one in which states are sovereigns with plenary power that have relinquished a number of enumerated powers to the Federal government. Double jeopardy attaches only to prosecutions for the same criminal act by the same sovereign, but as separate sovereigns, both the federal and state governments can bring separate prosecutions for the same act.
As an example, a state might try a defendant for murder, after which the Federal government might try the same defendant for a Federal crime (perhaps a civil rights violation or a kidnapping) connected to the same act. For example, the officers of the Los Angeles Police Department who were charged with assaulting Rodney King in 1991 were acquitted by a jury of the Superior Court, but some were later convicted and sentenced in Federal court for violating King's civil rights. Similar legal processes were used for prosecuting racially motivated crimes in the Southern United States in the 1960s during the time of the Civil Rights movement, when those crimes had not been actively prosecuted, or had resulted in acquittals by juries that were thought to be racist or overly sympathetic with the accused in local courts.
Federal jurisdiction may apply because the defendant is a member of the armed forces or the victim(s) are armed forces members or dependents. U.S. Army Master Sergeant Timothy B. Hennis was acquitted in state court in North Carolina for the murders in 1985 of Kathryn Eastburn (age 31) and her daughters Kara, age five, and Erin, age three, who were stabbed to death in their home near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Two decades later, Hennis was recalled to active duty, court-martialed by the Army for the crime, and convicted. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, observed of this case, "Certainly, no one the US has been exonerated and then returned to death row for the same crime except Hennis."
Furthermore, the "separate sovereigns" rule allows two states to prosecute for the same criminal act. For example, if a man stood in New York and shot and killed a man standing over the border in Connecticut, both New York and Connecticut could charge the shooter with murder.
Only the states and tribal jurisdictions are recognized as possessing a separate sovereignty, whereas territories, commonwealths (for example, Puerto Rico), the military and naval forces, and the capital city of Washington, D.C., are exclusively under Federal sovereignty. Acquittal in the court system of any of these entities would therefore preclude a re-trial (or a court-martial) in any court system under Federal jurisdiction.
"Petite" policy.
Though the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the dual sovereignty doctrine as an exception to double jeopardy, the United States will not exercise its dual sovereignty power on everyone who becomes subject to it. As a self-imposed limitation on its dual sovereignty power, the United States Department of Justice has a policy called the "Petite" policy, named after "Petite v. United States", . The formal name of the policy is "Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy" and it "establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion by appropriate officers of the Department of Justice in determining whether to bring a federal prosecution based on substantially the same act(s) or transactions involved in a prior state or federal proceeding."
Under this policy, the Department of Justice presumes that any prosecution at the State level for any fact applicable to any Federal charge vacates any Federal interest in those facts, even if the outcome is an acquittal. As an example, a person who commits murder within the jurisdiction of a State is subject to that State's murder statute and the United States murder statute (). The Federal government will defer to the State to prosecute under their statute. Whatever the outcome of the trial, acquittal or conviction, the Department of Justice will presume that prosecution to vacate any Federal interest and will not initiate prosecution under the United States Code.
However that presumption can be overcome. The policy stipulates five criteria that may overcome that presumption:
The existence of any of these criteria is to be determined by an Assistant Attorney General of the United States. If a prosecution is determined to have proceeded without authorization, the Federal government may and has requested the Court vacate an indictment. Such a move is in line with the Courts vacating indictments wherein prosecutions were discovered to have violated Department of Justice policy. Indictments have also been vacated when the Federal government first represents to the Court the prosecution was authorized but later determines that authorization to have been mistaken.

Forum of Arcadius

The Forum of Arcadius (, ), was built by the Emperor Arcadius in the city of Constantinople, now Istanbul. 
Built in 403, it was built in the Xerolophos area and was the last forum before reaching the Constantinian city walls and the Golden Gate in a line of forums, including the Forum of Theodosius, the Forum of Constantine, the Forum Bovis, and the Forum Amastrianum, built westward from the city center along the Mese.
The forum was later converted to a bazaar by the Ottomans, referred to as the Avrat Pazarı or "Women's Bazaar", which was mistaken with the Slave Market at Tavukpazari near Nur-u Osmaniye used for the auctioning of female slaves, otherwise known as 'Cariye', who technically during the period had a completely different social status than regular slaves. This practice was abolished in 1847 during Reshid Pasha's time possibly due to the British influence Slavery Abolition Act 1833.
The Column of Arcadius, located in the center of the forum, was decorated with spiral bands of sculpture in bas relief representing the triumphs of the emperor, like Trajan's Column in Rome. At the top of the column, which was more than 50m high, there was an enormous Corinthian capital surmounted by an equestrian statue of Arcadius, placed there in 421 by his son, Theodosius II. This statue was eventually toppled from the column and destroyed during an earthquake in 704. The column itself remained standing for another thousand years until it was deliberately demolished in 1715, when it appeared to be in imminent danger of collapsing on the neighboring houses. Now all that remains are the mutilated base and some fragments of sculpture from the column which are on display in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.

Roberto Cueva del Río

Roberto Cueva del Río (born April 28, 1908 in Puebla City, Mexico as Rodolfo Roberto De La Cueva Del Río) was a Mexican muralist.
When he was 6, he and his family moved to Mexico City where took elementary studies. In 1923 he worked with Ernesto García Cabral in "Excélsior," a newspaper political cartoon shop.
From 1924-1928 he attended Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes de la Universidad Nacional & Academy of San Carlos. His teachers were Germán Gedovious, Sóstenes Ortega, Raziel Cabildo. The dean Alfonso Pruneda granted a monthly scholarship support ($40), to foment his studies in Fine Arts academy. With this scholarship and his work selling he became a drawing & painting teacher for some Mexican states, teaching in rural schools as a cultural mission.
In 1926 painted his first murals in elementary schools from the Educational Department of Mexico.
In 1928 open his first draws and political-cartoons expo.
In 1930 was suggested for Diego Rivera, Fine Arts Director as the best muralist to be designated for the murals in Mexican embassy in Washington D. C. The governor of the Mexican State of Puebla Leonidas Andrew Almazán supported his talent and promoted this job. Howard S. Phillips, "Mexican Life Magazine" editor sent a note to Anita Brenner, where he extols Cueva's work and thinks is a great opportunity so he can get fame and fortune in United States as many painters does.
In 1930 painted new murals in Cuernavaca Morelos, Mexico, as typical folklore themes.
In 1931, in New York City he was invited to expose his work in Delphic Studios Gallery, owned by Alma Reed. His art got excellent comments from U.S. critics, and got attention from Juan José Tablada.

Ashe v.

The Double Jeopardy Clause prevents a state from relitigating a question already decided in favor of a defendant at a previous trial. Here, the guarantee against double jeopardy enforceable through the Fourteenth Amendment provided that the government could not prosecute the criminal defendant in a second trial as it related to a different victim but the same robbery the criminal defendant was acquitted of in the first trial.

Rime of the Ancient Mariner (film)

Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a 1975 film by director Raúl daSilva. It is a photoanimated-live action visualization of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem of the same name, featuring a direct reading given by renowned British actor Sir Michael Redgrave. DaSilva's film has won multiple awards and recognitions and has been said to effectively render the otherwise-difficult poem comprehensible by even the youngest of readers.
Planning.
Raúl daSilva's film introduces additional sensory perception elements to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by taking the poem, which was written in a faux-archaic (purportedly Elizabethan) form of English and visualizing it. This was accomplished with the help of Sir Michael Redgrave (who'd taught the epic poem as a young schoolmaster before becoming an actor) and with the additional use of sound and music to enhance, support, and illustrate the poem's dramatic and often difficult language.
The Wikipedia article on photoanimation explains the technique used for this film. It is a time consuming, 
arduous procedure that includes the analysis and breakdown of the entire sound track and the planning of frame to frame exposure of all visual elements. Using the Oxberry master series animation stand the process took six months. The film took two years of production to complete.
International Film Festival Recognition.
The film was entered into six international film festivals and won six prizes, five of which were in the first-place category.
Application.
Raúl daSilva used the film in his classes as a teaching aid. Not only did students enjoy it, but their overall comprehension rose from fifty to one-hundred percent. They found it easier to understand the poem’s timeless message, many going on to reread the poem with a much greater degree of understanding. In his efforts to study students’ reactions he also showed it to a number of student groups—some as young as third Grade—where it was equally enjoyed and understood. In the ensuing years Raúl received unanimous critical acclaim for his production, with letters coming from as far as Australia offering expressions of gratitude from English teachers. From that point it began to accumulate interest from the general public.
Television Broadcast History.
On June 11, 1978 an ABC affiliate in Rochester, NY scheduled the one hour program for a prime-time slot opposite CBS’s popular news program, "60 Minutes". The broadcast title for the film was "The Strangest Voyage" and included a short biography on the poem's author, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The fact that local newspapers ran front page stories on the broadcast might have helped as it completely eclipsed 60 Minutes in viewer response. The then program manager reported that by the end of the broadcast the telephone switchboard was flooded with calls from viewers expressing praise and gratitude for the broadcast. Similar reports came from the program’s sponsor, Columbia Banking, and according to their senior vice president marketing, hundreds of letters were received after the broadcast, many from people who said they planned on opening accounts at the bank.
Current history.
The film has been distributed on VHS since 1985 and starting in April 2007 on DVD. The film was released to a responsive commercial market despite the fact that it has never been promoted or advertised.
A review in the April 1986 edition of Library Journal called it "a must for schools, and an excellent choice for public libraries."
It remains one of the most successful efforts in American filmmaking and has been celebrated by a half dozen film festival juries, and has enjoyed universal critical acclaim by both the media and consumers whose positive reactions can be found on the Internet. daSilva plans to have the film circulated worldwide where it has thus far not been released, believing Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s intrinsic message about the sanctity of all life on Earth is just as important today as it has ever been.

Qin Rigang (秦日綱, 1821–1856), né Qin Richang(秦日昌), was a Hakka military leader of the Taiping Rebellion, known during his military tenure as the King of Yen or Yan King (燕王), which means "swallow". He served under Hong Xiuquan's Taiping Administration and led Taiping forces to many military victories.

Rock 'N Roll Train

"Rock 'N' Roll Train" is a song by Australian rock band AC/DC. It is the first track on the album "Black Ice" to receive radio airplay. The band released a 7-inch vinyl single that featured the song "Rock 'N' Roll Train" on Side A, and "War Machine" on Side B. The 7-inch single came in a sleeve with its own unique artwork. The 7-inch vinyl was also made available in the United States through some independent record shops.
As with the success of the "Black Ice" album, the single was released to huge success. It was used in many television advertisements, more often being used as ESPN sports bumpers. It hit No. 1 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, staying there for over three weeks. The song was also one of the first AC/DC songs on the "Billboard" Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Background.
Originally composed with the title "Runaway Train", the song was first heard by fans on 15 August 2008, at the shooting of the music video in London. The song was notable for being the first song from a major artist to be leaked online legally when one Scottish fan at the video shoot memorized the riff and sung it on YouTube on 17 August. Angus Young initially conceived the song, and his brother Malcolm Young created the backing vocal harmony of the chorus ("Running right off the track").
On 27 August 2008, close to midnight, the single was uploaded to AC/DC's official website and AC/DC's MySpace. It made its worldwide radio debut on at 17:00 New Zealand time on The Rock radio station. Many Australian stations played the song straight after their news services. The song later made its way onto classic rock radio stations Planet Rock, Virgin Radio Classic Rock, Radio Caroline, radio2XS and Rock Radio in the UK. The song made its North American debut on on CKQB-FM in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. "Rock 'n' Roll Train" debuted at number one on the Canadian rock chart for the week ending 5 September.
On 30 August 2008, the first Saturday of the U.S. college football season, the song was played extensively on ESPN and ABC college football broadcasts as intro and bumper music, along with other AC/DC songs "Thunderstruck" and "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)". It was also played on a promo for CBS's "Criminal Minds". It peaked at number one on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In November 2008 the song became AC/DC's first song to enter the U.S. dance chart.
Throughout the month of November, the World Wrestling Entertainment website featured the music video for "Rock 'N' Roll Train", as well as the song "Spoilin' for a Fight", which was the theme to the Survivor Series 2008.
The song was used to open shows on the "Black Ice" tour. A cartoon was played on the giant video screen above the stage; at the end of this cartoon a life-sized train came crashing out onto the stage. It is at this point that the band came out on stage and proceeded to play the song.
The song "Rock 'N' Roll Train" was also used in an episode of "Knight Rider" titled "Knight to King's Pawn".
Music video.
On 15 August 2008, AC/DC filmed the music video to accompany the song in London, where 150 contest winners and their guests were present. The video premiered on 19 September on the band's official website.
On 23 October 2008, the band released the music video online in ASCII art in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format – the first music video to be produced in such format.
The video also featured clips of the short film "London to Brighton in Four Minutes".
Awards.
In 2009, "Rock 'n' Roll Train" was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It also won an APRA Award for Most Played Australian Work Overseas.

Mt. Blanco Fossil Museum

The Mt. Blanco Fossil Museum is a creationist museum in Crosbyton, Texas, opened in 1998. Its motto is "Digging up the facts of God's Creation: One fossil at a time."
The warehouse-sized museum contains a mixture of fossilized skeletons and cast replicas. The replicas include a juvenile "Triceratops", a full-sized mastodon skeleton, the largest hadrosaur leg ever found, and the world's largest ice age bison skull. Real bones displayed include the head of a metoposaur, and once included the world's largest four-tusked mastodon skull.
The museum also bases the Mount Blanco fossil excavation team who go on digs and investigate fossil evidence according to a creationist view. The museum has collaborated with Carl Baugh of the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas, in casting alleged mixed human and dinosaur footprints. Those prints have been strongly criticized as incorrectly identified dinosaur prints, other fossils, or outright forgeries.

Its owner, director, and curator is Joe Taylor (b circa 1945) who was an artist-turned-expert in making castings of ancient bones. Taylor was born to a farm family in Crosbyton, and was raised in the Primitive Baptist church. He worked as a commercial artist in Hollywood, California, on billboards on the Sunset Strip, magazine illustrations, the lettering on the original Mr. Pibb soda cans, and many album covers, which still fill a room in the museum. He became interested in fossils after cleaning and preparing bones at the La Brea tar pits, and made a 10-foot-by-40-foot casting of the Waco, Texas mammoth site, now on exhibit at Baylor University. He returned to Texas in 1984, to make a living as a fossil collector and mold-maker. In 1986, he painted a 40 feet long and 10 feet high mural of the history of Crosbyton for the nearby Crosby County Pioneer Memorial Museum.
"Lone Star" mastodon skull.
The largest mastodon skull on record was found in February 2004 in a gravel pit near La Grange, Texas. It was in pieces, and acquiring and assembling the skull took the museum a year and a half, and $141,000. The skull weighed 700 pounds, and was almost the size of a Volkswagen. It was named "Lone Star", and became the centerpiece of the museum.
However, in 2001 and 2002, Taylor and the Mount Blanco fossil excavation team had cooperated with another team in excavating the skeleton of an "Allosaurus" outside Dinosaur, Colorado. The exact nature of each team's contributions became contentious, and the groups argued publicly until an agreement in April 2004, which awarded Taylor $124,843 out of $200,000 for his share of the "Allosaurus", and committed all parties to refrain from disparaging the others. Over the next three years, Taylor continued to disparage the other side on the Internet, resulting in a fine of $136,000 in damages.
On January 20, 2008, as the sheriff's department was preparing to force the sale of the museum to pay the fine, the Mt. Blanco Fossil Museum auctioned off the prize exhibit of its collection. The world's largest mastodon skull was auctioned with Heritage Auctions of Dallas, and sold for $191,200, of which Taylor received $128,000, enabling the museum to stay open.
Taylor never received the $127,000 owed to him from the sale of the Lone Star mastodon. Heritage Auction House turned the money over to Pete DeRosa Sr. to settle the suit won by DeRosa against Taylor. This caused Taylor to close his museum for two years, opening sporadically until the last two museum workers were forced to leave. Taylor re-opened in 2010.

<doc id="18917185" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18917185" title="St Swithun's School, Winchester">
St Swithun's School, Winchester

St Swithun's School is an independent school for girls in Winchester, Hampshire. It is named after Saint Swithun, a Bishop of Winchester and patron saint of Winchester Cathedral.
History.
St Swithun's was founded as "Winchester High School" by Miss Anna Bramston, daughter of John Bramston, the then Dean of Winchester, with the ambition of educating "daughters of worthy citizens of Winchester". Not having sufficient money of her own, funds were raised by subscription. It opened on 5 May 1884 with seventeen pupils. Pupil numbers soon grew and the school began taking in boarders as well. In 1909 the school rented ten acres on Magdalen Hill for sports. The school’s name was changed to Winchester Girls’ School and then, after World War I, to St Swithun’s School: the recorded virtues of this saint – Caritas, Humilitas, Sinceritas – were adopted as the school’s motto in 1928.
St Swithun's moved to its present location overlooking the Hampshire Downs on the edge of Winchester in 1931. Princess Mary the Princess Royal opened the new buildings formally in 1932, but the outbreak of World War II saw the school turned into a hospital and by 1942 St Swithun’s became an American casualty clearing station. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1959 with the Duke of Gloucester as a special guest.
Today, St Swithun's includes both junior and senior schools meaning pupils can attend from nursery all to way to sixth form level. Boys may attend up to age 7.
St Swithun's retains a strong Anglican tradition through its links with Winchester Cathedral. It holds six services there every year and the girls' choir sings at the cathedral.
Curriculum.
St Swithun's has traditionally had a strong academic reputation. In 2011 GCSEs, it topped the results table for the city of Winchester with a 100% passing rate and all candidates achieving at least 5 A*-C grades, surpassing Winchester College. The same year, it broke its records in the A Levels with 11 girls scoring 3 or more A* grades. Since the year 2000 the school has had 100% pass rate in both GCSEs and A-Levels.
School Organisation.
Junior School.
The Early Years and Pre-Prep departments (nursery to Year 2) are coeducational. The prep department comprises Years 3 to 6 and girls are prepared for the Common Entrance Examination. The Junior School is a member of the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools.
Houses.
Each girl belongs to a house. Girls are assigned to either a boarding or day house except for those in Upper Sixth (Year 13), who belong to a single house. The house system is an integral part of school life as there are inter-house competitions in many co-curricular activities such as sports, public speaking and drama.
Boarding.
St Swithun's school offers boarding facilities for girls of any age who enrol in the senior school. Just under half the girls in senior school are boarders and about 70% of them board only on weekdays. Boarders are offered a wide range of co-curricular activities both in after school and weekend programmes and activities. The library and swimming pool are open at specific times during the weekend ensuring that boarders enjoy the school facilities to the fullest.
Culture.
Current headmistress Ms J Gandee describes the school as 'unashamedly but appropriately academic' and a place where girls are expected to work hard in class and at homework but then invited to put books away and have a go at something completely different with the understanding that the best learning is often achieved through initial failure but then perseverance to succeed. The principle of the school is to work hard in the day,and then be invited to put down the books and do something fun.
Uniform.
The school has a fairly modern winter uniform consisting of a cream open necked shirt,blue pullover and school kilt. In the summer the girls wear the school dress, blue and white striped. The sports uniform is a navy blue scort and a light blue T-Shirt.
Facilities.
Sports facilities include 8 lacrosse pitches, 13 tennis courts (1 indoors), 6 netball courts, a 25 meter indoor swimming pool and a multi-purpose sports hall. In 2003, the PAC (Performing Arts Centre)- now 'The Harvey Hall' - was opened, and it has a large auditorium to sit over 700, and also includes a Studio Theatre, Green Rooms, Box Office and a smaller SPS (Small Performance Space). A new library was opened in 2007 by the Mayor of Winchester Chris Pines and The Very Rev James Atwell, Dean of Winchester.
Sports.
St Swithun's has a strong sporting tradition and enjoyed success at county level and inter-school competitions. The school was national lacrosse champions in 2008. Girls are encouraged to take up a sport and may choose a variety of different sports including athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, lacrosse and netball, Zumba, Handball, Trampolining, Touch Rugby, Tennis, Pilates and Fitness..
Admissions.
As for many other independent schools, candidates for entry to St Swithun's must sit the Common Entrance Examination.
Candidates for academic scholarships are selected based on the results of the Common Entrance examinations (11+ and 13+) and are invited to attend an interview soon after completion of the examination. Sixth form scholarship candidates (16+) are selected based solely on the results of academic assessments in the subjects that they intend to take at A level.
Music scholarships may be awarded each year to suitable applicants at 11+, 13+ and 16+. The minimum ABRSM standard required for music scholarships is Grade 5 at 11+, Grade 6 at 13+ and Grade 7 at 16+ on two instruments.
Girls can also apply for a sports scholarship, where they should be county level at two or more sports.
Former pupils.
Alumnae are known as "Old Swithunites".

The Minister of Rationing and Supply (, "Sar HaKitzuv VeHaAspaka") was a short-lived portfolio in the Israeli cabinet. It was created on 26 April 1949 following a speech by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion introducing the country's austerity programme, and was held by Dov Yosef. However, Ben-Gurion soon wanted the ministry closed down, and achieved his goal when forming the second government in October/November 1950 (the first government's collapse had been partially due to an internal crisis in the Mapai over the ministry's liquidation).

Donatas Motiejūnas

Donatas Motiejūnas (; born September 20, 1990) is a Lithuanian professional basketball player who currently plays for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Motiejūnas was selected 20th overall in the 2011 NBA Draft.
European career.
Motiejūnas began his career playing with the youth team Arvydas Sabonis School of Kaunas. He made his professional debut with Žalgiris Kaunas in a Baltic League game against the ASK Riga. He scored 15 points in 22 minutes.
Motiejūnas helped Žalgiris Kaunas win a Baltic Championship, a Lithuanian Championship and a Lithuanian Cup. He averaged 5.6 points in 10.1 minutes per game in the Baltic League.
He signed with Aisčiai Kaunas in 2008. With Aisčiai, he averaged 19.9 points and 7.0 rebounds in 29.3 minutes per game, and he scored a season-high 29 points in a Lithuanian League game against Nevėžis on March 22, 2009.
He moved to the Italian League club Benetton Treviso in August 2009. There, he got off to a great start, scoring 18 and 21 points in two friendly matches against other European clubs. In 2011, Motiejūnas won the Eurocup Rising Star award after helping his team Benetton Treviso reach the Eurocup 2010–11 Final Four, averaging 10.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, 0.9 steals, and 4.4 fouls drawn per game.
In September 2011, he signed a contract with Prokom Gdynia of the Polish League for one season. On December 7, 2011, he grabbed a career high 21 rebounds (18 defensive) against Union Olimpija, the most defensive rebounds in a Euroleague game in the Euroleague Basketball era (2000–01 season onwards). He also helped to lead Prokom Gdynia to a ninth consecutive PLK title in a row in 2012. During the seventh and final game of the PLK Finals, he scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.
NBA career.
He was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 20th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, but was traded in a package with Jonny Flynn to the Houston Rockets for Brad Miller and Nikola Mirotić (the 23rd overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft). Because of his difficult first and last name for foreigners, Motiejūnas was called D-Mo by Kevin McHale at the first Houston Rockets press conference. Since Motiejūnas chose to play in European basketball for the following season, his rights were held by the Rockets.
On July 6, 2012, Motiejūnas signed a four-year deal worth $4.23 million with the Houston Rockets. In his first game as a Houston Rockets member in the NBA Summer League he played 25 minutes and scored 25 points (FG: 11/13, including 2 three-pointers), grabbed 9 rebounds, made two steals, two assists and one block. After the game, he quoted a famous Lithuanian idiom describing his debut: "Jeigu bijai vilko – neik į mišką" ("English:" If you're scared of wolves, don't go into the woods). Overall, he averaged 16.3 points and 7.8 rebounds per game in the Summer League, shooting 62% from the field in 25 minutes of game action.
On November 14, 2012, Motiejūnas was assigned to the NBA D-League. He played two games as a Viper. In his debut game against Bakersfield Jam, he scored 31 points, grabbed 8 rebounds and recorded three assists. During his second game he scored 17 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, recorded three assists and led his team to the first victory of the season.
Following his second game, the Rockets announced that they would be bringing Motiejūnas back into the NBA. He was re-assigned to the Vipers on December 14, 2012, and recalled on December 18, 2012. On January 22, 2013, he was re-assigned to the Vipers once again. He was recalled on January 28, 2013.
On October 30, 2013, the Rockets exercised its 2014–15 option on Motiejūnas' contract. So far in the 2013–14 season, he has played 19 games averaging 2.9ppg and 1.9rpg. As a result of a disappointing start to the season, Motiejūnas said: “When you give everything you got, you want to get something back and we are not getting for a long time. It’s really not easy to just sit and watch when others are playing. I try to stay positive. I try to help the team. I try to be productive in practices. That’s all I can do. That’s all that is in my power and other things are not in my power so I can not be worried about those things.” He also stated that his agent Arn Tellem is working with Rockets GM Daryl Morey to find a place where he can play.
Lithuanian national team.
Motiejūnas was a part of the Lithuanian Under-16, Under-18, and Under-20 junior national teams. With Lithuania's junior national teams, he played at the 2006 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, both the 2007 and 2008 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championships, the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, and the 2009 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship.
He led Lithuania's junior national team to the silver medal at the 2008 Under-18 Championship. Despite losing to Greece's junior national team in the gold medal game, he was named the MVP of the tournament, after averaging 18.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. At the 2008 Under-20 Championship, he averaged 11.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game.
In 2013, he won a silver medal at the FIBA EuroBasket tournament.
Personal life.
Motiejūnas has a large tattoo on his chest of an eagle clutching a basketball. He explained, "I really like the attitudes of eagles. They never give up. When they grab a fish or something else, they never let it go."

St. Stephen's Abbey, Würzburg

St. Stephen's Abbey in Würzburg, Germany, was a Benedictine monastery, founded c.1013. It existed until 1803.
History.
St. Stephen's Abbey was founded by Henry of Rothenburg, Bishop of Würzburg, about 1013, for regular canons who followed the Rule of St. Chrodegang. In 1057 Bishop Adalbero of Würzburg replaced the canons by thirty Benedictine monks from Ansbach.
After a short period of decline in the first half of the fifteenth century, the abbey joined the reform Bursfelde Congregation in 1459. After suffering another period of decline in the latter half of the sixteenth century, it continued in a flourishing condition until its secularization in 1803.
After that, the abbey church and the monastery were used as a Protestant parish church and school.
The historian Ignaz Gropp (1695–1758) was a monk of St. Stephen's. He wrote the history of several Franconian saints and monasteries, and edited "Collectio novissima scriptorum et rerum Wireceburgensium a saecula XVI hactenus gestarum" (4 vols., Frankfort and Würzburg, 1741–50).

Malcolm Bruce Ronaldson (13 April 1917 – 2 December 2004) was a South African cricketer. A right-handed batsman, he played first-class cricket for Eastern Province in 1938 and later played for Tanganyika and East Africa in the 1950s.
Biography.
Born in East London in 1917, Bruce Ronaldson played five matches for Eastern Province in the 1937/38 Currie Cup, his first coming against Border and his last coming against Transvaal. Opening the batting, often without gloves, his highest score of 94 came in the match against Western Province.
World War II prevented him from playing first-class cricket again, but he played for, and captained Tanganyika throughout the 1950s. Most of his matches were against Uganda, with one match each against Kenya and the MCC. He also played twice for East Africa - against Sunder Cricket Club in 1957 and against a South African Non-Europeans team captained by Basil D'Oliveira in 1958.
Ronaldson trained Tanzanian marathon runner John Stephen Akhwari who competed in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. Akhwari is notable for his honourable last place finish. He fell early in the race, cutting his knee and dislocating the joint but went on to complete the race, stating to journalists that "My country did not send me 10,000 miles just to start the race; they sent me to finish the race." 18 other competitors did not finish the race.
He moved to the United Kingdom in 1962 and spent 20 years as company secretary of Oxfam. He died in Oxford in 2004, aged 87. His son Chris Ronaldson was world champion in real tennis, winning back to back grand slams in 1984.

Ten Seconds to Hell

Ten Seconds To Hell (released in the UK as The Phoenix) is a 1959 British and West German film directed by Robert Aldrich and based upon Lawrence P. Bachmann's novel, "The Phoenix". The Hammer Films/UFA joint production stars Jack Palance, Jeff Chandler and Martine Carol.
Set in the aftermath of World War II, the film focuses on a half-dozen German POW's who return to a devastated Berlin and find employment as a bomb disposal squad, tasked with clearing the city of unexploded Allied bombs. Their fatalistic duties lead them to form a macabre pact; they donate a part of their individual paychecks into a pool that those still surviving at the end of three months divide the money. Eventually, only two men are left, and they are both in love with the same woman.
Robert Aldrich's direction is noted for its meticulous attention to the techniques of bomb deactivation and disposal.
Plot.
In post-war Berlin, British Major Haven (Richard Wattis) recruits members of a returning German bomb disposal unit, Hans Globke (James Goodwin), Peter Tillig (Dave Willock), Wolfgang Sulke (Wesley Addy), Franz Loeffler (Robert Cornthwaite), Karl Wirtz (Chandler) and Eric Koertner (Palance), to defuse unexploded Allied bombs scattered throughout the city.
Delighted by the well-paying position, Karl bets Eric that he will outlive him. Although initially taken aback by the wager, the other men soon agree that half of their salaries will go to the survivors of the dangerous mission in three months' time. The British provide the men new uniforms and equipment, and assign Frau Bauer (Virginia Baker) as their liaison. Karl volunteers to lead the unit, but the men vote for the reluctant Eric instead.
Later, Karl and Eric move into an Allied-approved boarding house run by pretty young widow Margot Hoefler (Carol), a French woman whose German husband died during the war.
Several weeks go by in which the men successfully and safely defuse numerous bombs; then the men are stunned when young Globke is killed while defusing a British 1000-pound bomb. Suspecting that the bomb has double fuses, Eric asks Haven to request information from British armaments on its design. At the boardinghouse, Karl continually flirts with Margot, to Eric's annoyance. One evening when Margot loudly protests Karl's drunken advances, Eric bursts into Margot's room to help her and Karl retreats, ridiculing Eric for his motives. Deducing that Eric disapproves of her behavior, Margot explains that her uneasy situation as a traitor to the French and an outsider to the Germans has left her jaded and willing to take happiness wherever she can find it. When Eric remains critical, Margot accuses him of denying his own desires.
A few days later, Frau Bauer receives a report that Tillig has been trapped under a live bomb by the partial collapse of a ruined building. With the other men away on assignments, Eric and Karl race to the site, and despite Tillig's protests, inspect the bomb. After Eric defuses the bomb safely, a doctor arrives and upon examining Tillig declares there is no chance for his survival. Refusing to accept the pronouncement, Eric hurries outside to request equipment to lift the bomb, but as Karl expresses his doubts, the building collapses on Tillig and the doctor. Distraught, Eric returns to the boardinghouse where he seeks solace from Margot. The next day, Eric takes Margot to another ruined section of the city and reveals that before the war he was an architect. Eric struggles to conceal his growing feelings for Margot, admitting that he is confused about becoming romantically involved while his life is in danger daily.
Back at headquarters, Haven tells Eric that because of the post-war chaos, they have been unable to gather information on the thousand-pound bombs. When Haven discloses that he knows of Eric's former profession, Karl, unaware that his colleague was an esteemed architect, expresses surprise. Eric tells Haven that he was forced into demolitions when he fell into disfavor for making anti-Nazi political statements. Karl and the other men were all pressed into demolitions as punishment for some indiscretion and all vowed to do everything they could to survive the war. Mocking Eric's growing anxiety, Karl urges him to quit the unit and give up the wager, but Eric refuses.
A month before the wager's deadline, Sulke is killed while defusing a double fused bomb. Eric, Loeffler and the men agree to adhere to the terms of the wager but discuss giving the salaries to Sulke's widow and child. When Eric presents the proposal to Karl, he scoffs at the suggestion, explaining that his motto has always been to look after himself. The next day Loeffler is called to defuse a bomb found in a canal. Later, Eric learns that Loeffler has drowned in the attempt. That afternoon when Margot urges Eric to give up the bet and quit the unit, Eric explains he must know whether he can triumph over Karl's greed and selfishness.
A few days later, Karl is assigned to defuse a thousand-pound bomb and Eric joins him at the site to make an inspection. The men discuss a strategy to avoid the potential second fuse, then Eric departs, but worriedly hovers nearby. After removing the top of the bomb, Karl gently handles the cap then abruptly calls for help, claiming the detonator pin has slipped. Eric rushes in and provides a pencil, which he offers to hold in place of the pin while Karl retrieves his tools from the landing. Moments later, Eric is stunned when the rope Karl used earlier to remove the top pulls tautly across his hand, forcing him to release the pencil. The bomb does not explode, however, and Eric realizes that Karl has tried to kill him. Eric punches Karl in the face. Once Karl gets back on his feet, he says, "Guess it's still my bomb." Eric replies, "Still your bomb." Eric then gets his coat and walks away. Karl resumes defusing the bomb. Once Eric is a safe distance away, the bomb explodes, killing Karl.
The film closes after saluting the efforts of the ordnance removal teams, which have allowed Berlin to rebuild.

Man with a Camera

Man with a Camera is an American 1950s television crime drama starring Charles Bronson.
Throughout the 1950s, Bronson spent most of his early acting career performing in TV shows as well as small parts in films, until he landed the lead in this ABC series. This is the only series in which he played the lead role. He would go on to have supporting roles either as a guest star or a recurring character in dozens of TV shows after this series was cancelled.
Plot.
Bronson portrayed Mike Kovac, a former World War II combat photographer freelancing in New York City who specialized in getting the photographs that other lensmen could not. He usually assists newspapers, insurance companies, the police and private individuals, all of whom want a filmed record of an event. 
By often acting as a private eye, Kovac gets himself into plenty of troubles involving criminals of every kind, helping with cases the police could not handle. 
Besides an array of cameras for normal use, for surreptitious work Kovac employs cameras hidden in a radio, cigarette lighter and even his necktie. He also has a phone in his car, and a portable darkroom in the trunk where he could develop his negatives on the spot. 
Kovac's police liaison is Lieutenant Donovan (James Flavin), though he frequently seeks advice from Anton Kovac (Ludwig Stössel), his immigrant father.
Production and DVD Release.
"Man with a Camera" was filmed on locations in Hollywood (doubling for New York City) at Desilu Studios. The series had two abbreviated seasons in 1958-59 and 1959–60 and was aired on the ABC-TV network, Friday nights at 9:00 pm. The entire run of the series' 29 episodes was released in 2007 by the Infinity Entertainment Group, in collaboration with the Falcon Picture Group and the UCLA Film & Television Archive, from which the source prints were obtained.
Alpha Video has released three individual volumes on DVD, each containing four episodes from the series. A fourth volume is slated to release on February 25, 2014

<doc id="18917549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18917549" title="National Extension College">
National Extension College

The National Extension College was set up years ago as a not-for-profit organisation for distance learning for people of all ages. It was originally founded in 1963 as a pilot study for the Open University.
The College teaches around 20,000 learners a year on over 100 home study courses, and provides open-learning resources for organisations and training providers including schools, further education colleges, local authorities and NHS Trusts.
The National Extension College was founded by Brian Jackson and Michael Young, Lord Young of Dartington (9 August 1915, Manchester - 14 January 2002), a British sociologist, social activist and politician.
A registered educational charity, the College works in partnership with organisations including The Open University, The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE), the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations and learndirect.
Curriculum.
The National Extension College offers a comprehensive range of GCSEs, IGCSEs and "A" levels, as well as a number of vocational and business courses.
Subjects covered at GCSE and IGCSE level include the sciences, English literature and language, foundation and higher maths, French and business studies.
"A" levels offered by the college include traditional subjects such as biology, business studies, economics, geography and philosophy, as well as more special interest topics including classical civilisation, critical thinking and environmental studies.
Other qualifications available from the NEC include courses leading to teaching qualifications, childcare diplomas, business and management qualifications and various courses in book-keeping and accounting.
Teaching methods.
The National Extension College produces its own learning materials, which are delivered both directly to home-based learners and via other organisations and training providers.
When a learner enrolls with the National Extension College they receive a full set of course materials and a course handbook. They are also allocated a personal tutor, who is contactable by email and telephone. The personal tutor is responsible for marking the learner's work and providing feedback for the duration of the course. In addition to the personal tutor, each course has a dedicated coordinator whom each learner or their sponsor/employer can also contact for support or advice.
Further support for learners comes from NEC's online student groups, which enable learners to contact each other, provide access to downloadable course materials, allow the uploading of assignments and suggest potentially useful websites.
The NEC initially offered a limited range of courses including "O" level English and mathematics, various vocational courses and a range of programmes in conjunction with the University of London's external degree programme. The College made effective use of local television to increase public awareness of its existence and received more than 3,000 enquiries from potential students in its first eight weeks.
A major increase in the College's size came in 1964, when the NEC took over the failing University Correspondence College, a Cambridge-based organisation dating back to 1888. The takeover granted the NEC an additional 50 staff, an enlarged portfolio of correspondence courses and a larger office from which to operate.
The NEC continued to expand through the 1960s and 1970s. The late 1970s saw a change in emphasis, as the College began offering a range of experimental courses as well as the more traditional "O" and "A" level qualifications. At the same time the organisation was diversifying and changing its profile, moving from being a traditional correspondence college towards becoming a prolific educational publisher and provider of educational services to both the private and public sectors. This broadening of the College's remit necessitated a move to a larger headquarters, so in 1979 the NEC moved to 18 Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge, the building that would be its base for the next 22 years.
A Growing Organisation: 1980-1999.
In the early 1980s the NEC's focus moved away from enrolling new students and further towards the publishing of educational materials. In response to the extremely high rate of unemployment at the time (three million in 1982), the College concentrated more on producing materials that would enhance learners' employability than developing programmes for traditional academic subjects. By 1986 the emphasis had shifted so far towards producing educational materials for learners studying at other organisations that the then-director, Richard Freeman, wanted the NEC to become a materials provider with no actual students of its own. At the same time, the national "O" level qualifications were being replaced by GCSEs, meaning that if the NEC was to continue to enlist new students on traditional courses a tremendous amount of work would be required to bring its courses up-to-date. However, the departure of Freeman in January 1987 saw the NEC reaffirm its commitment to being a College in its own right and a major investment in new courses brought with it a significant increase in enrollments.
By the time the College celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1988, it had provided courses through distance learning to more than 250,000 students. The organisation marked the occasion with a major conference on open learning, "Open Learning in Transition". The end of the 1980s also saw an increased focus on vocational courses, with new programmes on business administration, accounting and book-keeping being introduced.
The College continued to expand through the 1990s, growing both in terms of staff numbers and enlisted students. By 1999 it was dealing with more than 10,000 new enrolments each year, and was fast outgrowing its Brooklands Avenue base. To cope with its increase in scale, in 2000 the organisation moved to The Michael Young Centre on Purbeck Road, Cambridge, which remains its home to this day.
Recent Years: 2000-Present Day.
Operating from its new headquarters, the NEC continued to grow throughout the 2000s. The new "A" level curriculum, introduced in 2000, was another extremely busy time for the organisation, with its editorial team producing more than 16,000 pages of materials to accommodate the change. At this time the College was 
educating more than 20,000 students each year and providing more than 150 tutor-supported home-learning courses. At the same time it continued to produce materials for other educational institutions, maintaining a portfolio of more than 200 learning resources for colleges, trainers and employers.
The end of the 2000s was a time of major change for the College, the most significant aspect of which was its merger with the Learning and Skills Network in 2010. Both charitable organisations, the LSN and NEC had many shared objectives that suggested the two would make good partners. The merger was short-lived however, as the LSN went into administration in late 2011.
It did not take long for the NEC to find a new partner with which to progress its educational work, and in December 2011 the College joined forces with the Open School Trust, another education charity founded, like the NEC, by Michael Young.
Working with its partners, including The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education, the NEC is now looking to expand the service it offers to students, further increase the range of courses it provides and continue to work in accordance with the principles on which it was founded.

Death of Azelle Rodney

Azelle Rodney, from London, was suspected of drug crime and shot dead by armed officers of the Metropolitan Police on 30 April 2005. 
In July 2013 a judicial inquiry found that the Authorised Firearms Officer who fired the fatal shots had "no lawful justification" for opening fire. The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to determine whether a prosecution should be launched.
Biography and background.
Azelle Rodney as born and brought up in west London. He had two brothers. Rodney was known for his sporting abilities at school, his football and athletic development came to an end after a hip injury and two subsequent operations when he was 16. He also had an interest in music, and developed this and attended the local gymnasium.
His mother stated after his death that her son barely knew the two men from whom he had accepted a lift, that he was not a gangster, and had only had a minor criminal record. A judicial report compiled for the public inquiry later described Azelle Rodney as a mid-level career criminal at the time of the shooting.
His girlfriend gave birth to their daughter after he was killed.
Death.
On the night of 30 April 2005, Rodney was driven by associates Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham in a hired silver Volkswagen Golf to get a haircut. After leaving the barber shop, the three drove across north London. They were seemingly unaware that their car had been under surveillance for some time and that it was being followed by armed police in unmarked vehicles. It was later revealed at the trial of Lovell and Graham for drugs and firearms offences that they had been under police surveillance for two days and that the car had been tailed for several hours on 30 April.
According to information later released to Rodney's family by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the armed police following the VW Golf moved at some point to "State Red", meaning that the car was to be intercepted as soon as possible. This occurred as the car was passing the Railway Tavern on Hale Lane in the London Borough of Barnet at 7:43 pm, the police using a manoeuvre known as a "hard stop". An unmarked police Audi swerved in front of the VW Golf, a Vauxhall Omega halted alongside, and a third vehicle impacted the rear of the VW.
Fourteen members of the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Firearms Command (CO19) emerged from the cars. Hatton rounds - a form of shotgun breaching round - were fired to puncture the VW Golf's tyres. During this, a CO19 officer later referred to by his call sign of E7, who had 20 years of firearms experience, leant across from the rear passenger seat of the Vauxhall Omega and fired eight rounds through the side of the VW Golf at Rodney, six of which hit him in the face, head, neck and chest.
An immediate police search of car found ammunition and three guns: a .45 Colt calibre pistol; a Baikal pistol; and a smaller gun described as looking like a key fob. A later search of Lovell's flat revealed that it had been used to produce a "significant quantity" of crack cocaine.
Before family liaison officers called on his family, Metropolitan Police officers had called at a neighbours house to confirm Rodney's identity. That evening various news agencies reported incorrectly that Rodney had been holding a gun when he was shot, and later described him as a "drugs baron" and a crack dealer. "The Times" mentioned after Lovell and Graham's trial that he had been "visiting a drug factory that he ran". Police only called at his mother's house to inform her of his death on the afternoon of 1 May 2005, almost 24 hours later.
Investigation.
The shooting was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission which was then passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). However, the CPS concluded in July 2006 that there was insufficient evidence to convict any individual involved for Rodney's death. John Yates, the Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner at the time, said that "The situation facing our officer that evening clearly left him with no option than to take the course of action he did."
The officer responsible said: "Everything about his actions led me to believe that he was fully ready to fire with a fully automatic weapon." However, the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed that Rodney was not seen holding a gun when he was shot.
Lovell and Graham trial.
Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, who had been in the car with Rodney, were later sentenced to seven years and six years imprisonment respectively at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court on 24 January 2006 for drugs and firearms offences. The court was told that three guns were found in the car and that Lovell's flat had been used to produce crack cocaine.
The trial also revealed that there was some dispute regarding the guns present in the VW Golf at the time of Rodney's death. In a statement, Scotland Yard said that the guns were "loaded and fully operational", however evidence given by the prosecution differed; it was stated that a Colt .45 pistol which Graham admitted to owning was on the back seat but had been deactivated and could not fire, while Lovell's pistol - which had been converted from a tear gas gun - was found inside a rucksack along with a loaded double-barrelled handgun.
Inquest.
In August 2007, coroner Andrew Walker, sitting at Hornsey North London, said that a full inquest into Rodney's death could not be held because of the large number of redactions in police officers' statements. The Rodney family's solicitor, Daniel Machover, said that the redactions were made under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which covers information obtained from covert surveillance including telephone taps and bugs. He also said that he had written to the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice asking that the law be changed to allow the coroner to proceed with the inquest. 
In May 2009, Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, filed a case in the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that her human rights were breached by the failure to hold a "reasonably prompt" and public investigation into her son's death. 
A public inquiry into Rodney's death was announced in March 2010 and began on 6 October 2010, chaired by a former high court judge, Sir Christopher Holland. The chair ruled that evidence previously kept secret can in fact be made public.
At the beginning of September 2012, the public inquiry into his death began, seven years after the incident. In July 2013 the judicial inquiry found that the Authorised Firearms Officer who fired the fatal shots had "no lawful justification" for opening fire. The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to determine whether a prosecution should be launched.

St. Burchard's Abbey, Würzburg

St. Burchard's Abbey, Würzburg, Germany, was a Benedictine monastery, initially known as St. Andrew's Abbey.
History.
St. Andrew's was founded by Burchard of Würzburg shortly after 748, and soon became known for its monastic school. After a period of decline in the tenth century it was reformed in 988 by Hugo von Rothenburg, Bishop of Würzburg. He rebuilt the church and the monastery and placed Arnold, a monk of Hirsau Abbey, as abbot over it. On 14 October 984, this bishop had transferred there the body of St. Burchard, and from that time the monastery became known as St. Burchard's Abbey.
Church and monastery having been destroyed by fire about 1030, Abbot Wilemuth rebuilt both (1033–42), and in 1042 Bishop Bruno of Würzburg dedicated the new church in presence of Emperor Henry III and six bishops.
Yielding to the request of the monks, Pope Pius II, in a Papal bull dated 4 February 1464, changed the abbey church into a collegiate church, and permitted the former monks to remain as canons.

Big Dam Film Festival

The Big Dam Film Festival is an annual event organized by Young Professionals of the Quincy Area, a Non-Profit Networking and Community Development organization in Quincy, Illinois. The festival features independent films from around the world in a showcase format usually held on a Saturday evening during the spring.
The proceeds from the event are used to organize and support events and endeavors throughout the community of Quincy, Illinois.
Origins.
The Big Dam Film Festival was established by Clinton Begley and Christopher Mackenzie, who are both natives of Quincy, Illinois and members of the Young Professionals of Quincy board.
The festival is named after Lock and dam, #21 on the Mississippi river which is an icon local to Quincy, and a source of revenue for the city.
The inaugural event occurred in February 2006, featuring 23 films selected from over 80 total films that were submitted for selection. A short video introduction by Ed Begley, Jr. began the event.
History.
Since its inception, each event has sold out well in advance. It has been subject to rave reviews and praise.
Clinton Begley and Christopher Mackenzie actively participated in the planning and coordination of the events throughout the transitional year of 2009 when a sub-committee of Young Professional's Quincy took over the majority of planning. Begley and Mackenzie have since divested themselves of planning future festivals.
The 2010 festival, under direction of the newly formed committee, saw a change in direction and format. Instead of a single evening of short films, two separate evenings of feature length films were shown. Locally produced "Hampshire" was screened on Thursday, May 7 at McHugh Theater on the campus of Quincy University. Friday night hosted locally produced short " A night in Woodlawn" and critically acclaimed An Education as the feature presentation.
In 2011, the two-night format was retained and the feature length documentary "Beer Wars" was screened Friday night while the original "shorts" festival was preserved for Saturday night at the State Room.

Toomorrow (film)

Toomorrow is a 1970 British musical film starring Olivia Newton-John, and directed by Val Guest.
Synopsis.
A group of students pay their way through school by forming a pop band called Toomorrow; sonic vibrations from a special instrument called a "tonaliser" cause an extraterrestrial to abduct the group, and have them entertain the Alphoid population. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) this movie is based on the 1967 film "The Gang".
Production.
James Bond film producer Harry Saltzman entered into a three-picture deal with Don Kirshner. Kirshner had helped create The Monkees. However, according to director Val Guest, Kirshner and Saltzman grew to loathe each other during the increasingly troubled production.
Saltzman hired novelist David Benedictus to write the script, but after 30 pages neither Saltzman nor director Val Guest felt it was working. Guest concedes that it was "very well written, but a little bit too 'high-faluting'." Saltzman advised Guest to write a new script. However, unbeknownst to Guest, Saltzman never informed Benedictus. Only during production did Benedictus learn that a new script had been commissioned.
Guest had been working on the film for six months beyond the time specified for in his contract and still hadn't been paid, nor had anyone else who worked on the film. Saltzman didn't have the money nor did his company "Sweet Music" which was in Switzerland. Guest waited until after the film's premiere at the London Pavilion to obtain an injunction. The film could not be shown until Guest and the other people who worked on the film were paid. According to Guest in 1994, he still had not been paid and the injunction was still in effect.
As a result, the film, which took about two years to make, was shown (in the London Pavilion, then a cinema) for only one week, then was shelved. Aside from isolated showings in the British forces cinemas during 1971 and early 1972 on British military bases, and one showing in Los Angeles in 2000 (see below), "Toomorrow" was not seen in public for over four decades.
Response.
In a March 1971 edition of the British music magazine, "NME", Newton-John commented "Our film died a death and it was all a bit of a shambles. But it was a good experience".
According to onlyolivia.com:
Don Kirshner died in January 2011, and in March 2012 the movie was released on DVD in the UK by Pickwick having licensed the film from the estate of writer and director Val Guest. Unfortunately, the DVD release was of low quality: It was sourced off an inferior video element and the audio is of marginal quality, and they failed to make it dual-mono: The sound only comes out of one stereo speaker. It is hoped that eventually a Film Transfer will be done from the copy housed in the British Movie Archives, but for now the Pickwick version will have to suffice.

The Dawn (book)

The Dawn () is an 1881 book by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (also translated as "The Dawn of Day" and "Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality)."
Nietzsche de-emphasizes the role of hedonism as a motivator and accentuates the role of a "feeling of power." His relativism, both moral and cultural, and his critique of Christianity also reaches greater maturity. In "Daybreak" Nietzsche devoted a lengthy passage to his criticism of Christian biblical exegesis, including its arbitrary interpretation of objects and images in the Old Testament as prefigurements of Christ's crucifixion. The clear, calm and intimate style of this aphoristic book seems to invite a particular experience, rather than showing concern with persuading his readers to accept any point of view. He would develop many of the ideas advanced here more fully in later books. Early English translator J.M. Kennedy says of "The Dawn", "This book was written for psychologists."

Military of Estonia

The Estonian Defence Forces () is the name of the unified armed forces of the Republic of Estonia. The Estonian military is a defence force consisting of Estonian Land Forces, Merevägi ("Navy"), Õhuvägi ("Air Force") and a paramilitary organization Kaitseliit ("Defence League"). The national defence policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, the integrity of its land area, territorial waters and airspace and its constitutional order. Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the Defence Forces in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and European Union member states and their capability to participate in the full range of Alliance missions.
History.
After the German Revolution, between 11 and 14 November 1918, ending the German occupation in Estonia, the representatives of Germany formally handed over political power to the Government of Estonia. A few days later Estonia was invaded by the military forces of Bolshevist Russia, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence. The small, poorly armed Estonian military, also known as the () ("Peoples Force"), was initially pushed back by the Red Army into the vicinity of the capital city of Estonia - Tallinn. A mere 34 kilometers separated Tallinn and the front line. Partly due to the timely arrival of a shipment of arms brought by a British naval squadron the Bolsheviks were stopped.
In January 1919, the Estonian armed forces launched a counteroffensive, the "May Offensive", under Commander-in-Chief Johan Laidoner. The Ground Forces were supported by the Royal Navy as well as Finnish, Swedish and Danish volunteers. By the end of February 1919, the Red Army had been expelled from all of the territory of Estonia. On 2 February 1920, the Peace Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After winning the Estonian Liberation War against Soviet Russia and German Freikorps volunteers, Estonia maintained its independence for twenty-two years.
In August 1939, just prior to the start of World War II, Stalin and Hitler secretly decided the fate of the Republic of Estonia, in which the two leaders agreed to divide Eastern Europe into "spheres of special interest" as outlined in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its . According to this treaty Estonia was to be occupied by the Soviet Union. The Estonian government was forced to give their assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for "mutual defence". On 12 June 1940, the order for a total military blockade of Estonia was given to the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Given the overwhelming Soviet force, in order to avoid bloodshed and a futile and hopeless war, on 17 June 1940 the Estonian government decided not to resist. The military occupation of Estonia was complete by 21 June 1940. The armed forces of Estonia were disarmed in July 1940 by the Red Army according to Soviet orders. Only the "Estonian Independent Signal Battalion" stationed in Tallinn at Raua Street continued to resist. As the Red Army brought in additional reinforcements supported by armoured fighting vehicles, the battle lasted several hours until sundown. There was one dead, several wounded on the Estonian side and about 10 killed and more wounded on the Soviet side. Military resistance ended with negotiations and the "Signal Battalion" surrendered and was disarmed.
The "Eesti Kaitsevägi" was restored on 3 September 1991 by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia. Since 1991, the armed forces of Estonia have re-opened and restored more than 30 old and new units and several army branches.
Structure.
Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the EDF in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and EU member states and their capability to participate in the full range of Alliance missions.
In peacetime the main tasks of EDF are to monitor and maintain control over territorial borders and airspace, maintain combat readiness, train conscripts and develop reserve units, participate in NATO and UN-led international missions, and provide assistance to civilian authorities in case of national emergency. 
In crises the main tasks of EDF are to increase the readiness levels of units as required, prepare for transition to wartime structure and begin mobilization as ordered, integrate units from other ministries, and prepare for assistance from and reception of friendly forces. 
In wartime the main tasks of EDF are to defend the territorial integrity of the state, to facilitate the arrival and deployment of forces from other countries and co-operate with them, to maintain control over national airspace and facilitate the air defence of strategic assets in co-operation with forces from other countries.
Headquarters and budget.
In peacetime the Estonian Defence Forces and the national defence organisations, including the National Guard, are led by the Commander of the Defence Forces. In wartime all these components are commanded by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces. The Chief of the Defence Forces and the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces are appointed and released from office by the Riigikogu on the proposal of the President of the Republic of Estonia. Starting from 5 December 2011 the Chief of the Defence is Brigade General Riho Terras. 
The Kaitseväe Peastaap is the headquarter of the military of Estonia and the working body of the Kaitseväe Juhataja of the Defence Forces. The General Staff is a joint staff engaged with operational leadership, training and development of the Defence Forces. Operational leadership is implemented by the Operational Staff, which plans and controls operations and ensures defence readiness and mobilisation. The departments for training and development are responsible for long-term and mid-term planning, resource planning, organisation and control of the planning of training and implementation of national defence activities. The General Staff of the Defence Forces is headed by the Chief of the Headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces.
Leadership of the national defence.
The national defence of Estonia is conducted on the principles of civilian control inherently bound with the democratic organisation of the state. Democratically elected and appointed executive institutions make decisions on the use of the Defence Forces and determine the respective objectives, allocate the necessary resources and monitor the attainment of the objectives.
The implementation of the principles of civilian control is guaranteed by defence-related rights, obligations and responsibilities legislatively laid upon the Parliament, the President of the Republic and the Government of the Republic.
The highest leader of the national defence is the President of the Republic advised in national defence matters by the National Defence Council composed of the Chairman of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Defence Forces (the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces in wartime), the Defence Minister, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the Parliamentary National Defence Committee. Executive power in the leadership of the national defence is executed by the Government of the Republic.
Organization.
The Defence Forces consist of regular military units totaling 5,600 officers and men, and a voluntary corps, the Defence League with about 12,600 soldiers. The planned size of the operational (wartime) structure at the moment is 30,000 personnel. The Defence Forces are a reserve force, and as such, "all physically and mentally healthy male citizens" must undergo compulsory military service for the duration of either 8 or 11 months, during which time the conscripts are taught the basic skills needed to be mobilized into active duty. The Defence Forces are stationed within four defence districts with headquarters in Tallinn, Tapa, Luunja, Pärnu.
The Estonian Army is structured according to the principle of a reserve force which means that the main part of the defence forces of the state are units in the reserve. For a state with few human and economic resources, a reserve force based on the will of defence of the citizens is the most viable form of national defence.
In peacetime the reservists conduct normal lives and the state takes care of their training and the procurement of equipment and weapons. In wartime the reservists are mobilized into military units. The reserve units are formed on the territorial principle, i.e. conscripts from one area are called up at one time to one unit and after service they are sent to the reserve as one unit. The Estonian Army is always in constant defence readiness in co-operation with the other services.
Land Forces.
The Estonian Land Forces is the main arm of the Defence Forces. The average size of the military formation in peacetime is about 5,500 of whom about 2,700 are conscripts. The Army component of the operational structure consists of an infantry brigade and 4 Regional Commands. Infantry brigade acts as a training and support frame for deployable units. 
The Land Force development priorities are the capability to participate in missions outside the national territory and the capability to perform operations to protect the territory of Estonia, also in co-operation with the Allies.
Naval Force.
The "Merevägi" is responsible for all naval operations and protecting of the territorial waters of Estonia. The main functions of the naval force are the preparation and organisation of the defence of the territorial waters and coastal line, ensuring the maritime security, communications and sea traffic in the territorial waters and co-operation with NATO and the navies of other friendly countries around. In case of a crisis situation the "Merevägi" must be ready to defend sea approaches, harbour areas, sea lines of communication and to co-operate with the coalition units. The "Merevägi" includes units of patrol ships, minesweepers, a frigate and coast guard units, necessary to ensure the security of maritime communications lines and to establish and clear mine barriers. The majority of the naval forces are situated at the Miinisadam naval base. The current structure operates the Mineships Division which also includes a divers group. In addition there are the Naval Academy, Naval Base at Miinisadam and the Naval Headquarters which are situated in Tallinn. 
Since 1995 numerous mine clearance operations have been carried out in Estonian waters in close co-operation with other navies of the Baltic Sea region in order to find and dispose ordnance and contribute to safe seagoing. In 2007 the "Merevägi" mineships fleet was modernized and equipped with the "Sandown" class minehunters. In 2010, according to the long-term defence development plan, it was announced that the "Merevägi" will receive some new capabilities. Of those new warfare capabilities the procurement of multirole fast patrol boats will be the priority. The operational need for such vessels is likely to ensure defence of territorial waters and to improve maritime surveillance. In addition to the current capabilities the command and control and shore-to-vessel communications will also be further improved.
Air Force.
The "Õhuvägi" is the main arm of the Estonian aviation forces which has an important role in enhancing flight safety in Estonian airspace. One of the main goals of the "Õhuvägi" is to build up an air surveillance system, which will be the cornerstone of the air traffic safety and airspace control and the development of an air surveillance system to a level which allows close cooperation with the NATO air defence system.
The Estonian airforce was slow to reform because of the severely damaged and destroyed infrastructure left by the Russians. The Eesti Õhuvägi (Estonian Air force) formed on April 13, 1994. In February 1993 the German government donated two Let L-410UVPs transport aircraft. In October 1994 three Mi-2's were delivered, followed by four MI-8s in November 1995. Initially was task with ground based air surveillance and air defence using only old soviet radars and AAA equipment, but on 15 May 1997 the airforce moved into the former soviet SU-24 base at Amari south of Tallinn. In 1997-98 two of the MI-8's were upgraded. 
The "Õhuvägi" has been rebuilding the destroyed military infrastructure left behind by the Russian Army. Most of the funds have been directed to the Ämari military airfield which will be completed in 2012. The objective of developing Ämari Air Base is to prepare it for cooperation with NATO and the air forces of partner nations and allow it to supply the standardized airfield and aircraft services necessary for host nation support. Due to the lack of modern and developed military aviation infrastructure, the Air Force development has been very slow.
Defence League.
The Defence League is a voluntary military national defence organisation, which acts in the area of government of the Ministry of Defence. The Defence League possesses arms and engages in military exercises. The main goal of the Defence League is, on the basis of the citizens’ free will and initiative, to enhance the readiness of the nation to defend its independence and its constitutional order, including in the event of military threat.
The Defence League plays an important role in supporting the civil structures. Its members aid in putting out wildfires, volunteer as assistant police members, and ensure safety at various events. Units, consisting of voluntary members of the Defence League, also participate in international peace support operations such as in the Balkan states. The Defence League and its afﬁliated organisations have positive relations with partner organisations in the Nordic countries, the United States and the United Kingdom.
The organisation is divided into 15 Defence League regional units whose areas of responsibility mostly coincide with the borders of Estonia’s counties. Today, the Defence League has over 11,000 members. The afﬁliated organisations of the Defence League combine more than 20,000 volunteers, in all, and include the Estonian Defence League’s women’s corps Naiskodukaitse, the Estonian Defence League’s boys’ corps Noored Kotkad, and the Estonian Defence League’s girls’ corps Kodutütred.
Modernization.
International cooperation.
Since 2004 Estonia has been a full member of the NATO; it had been one of its foremost priorities since the restoration of independence. The United States is among the countries with which Estonia has very close cooperation in the defence and security fields. Currently Estonia takes seriously participation in the NATO Response Force and contributes in NTM-I (NATO Training Mission - Iraq). Until 2009, Estonia had 40 soldiers fighting alongside American Forces in the Iraq War and 150 soldiers, or about 3% of its total active military force, fighting alongside British Forces in Afghanistan. Estonian forces have since been withdrawn from Iraq. In both cases, the units were regularly rotated. Estonia also provides peacekeepers for international missions in both Bosnia and Kosovo within the framework of the KFOR, and also contributes to EU battlegroups and NATO Response Force rotations and the EU’s anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia. The Estonian military employs STANAG (NATO interoperable) weapons and equipment acquired from Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Great Britain, the United States and Israel.
By year 2018, Estonia plans to have either IFVs or tanks (Models and quantity are still unknown)
Electronic warfare.
The Military of Estonia is introducing a new 21st century based cyber warfare and defence formation in order to protect the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia. Currently the leading organization in the Estonian cyber defence is the CERT (the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia), established in 2006, as an organisation responsible for the management of security incidents in .ee computer networks. Its task is to assist Estonian internet users in the implementation of preventive measures in order to reduce possible damage from security incidents and to help them in responding to security threats. The unit deals with security incidents that occur in Estonian networks, are started there, or have been notified of by citizens or institutions either in Estonia or abroad. 
On 25 June 2007, Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves met with the president of USA, George W. Bush. Among the topics discussed were the attacks on Estonian e-infrastructure.
The attacks triggered a number of military organisations around the world to reconsider the importance of network security to modern military doctrine. On 14 June 2007, defence ministers of NATO members held a meeting in Brussels, issuing a joint communiqué promising immediate action. First public results are estimated to arrive by autumn 2007.
In the aftermath of the Cyberattacks on Estonia 2007, plans to combine network defence with Estonian military doctrine, and related NATO plans to create a Cybernetic Defence Centre in Estonia, have been nicknamed the "Tiger's Defence" (), in reference to Tiigrihüpe.

The Secret of the Kingdom

The Secret Of The Kingdom is a 1959 novel by Finnish author Mika Waltari about the early days of Christianity. The story is told through the eyes of Marcus, a Roman citizen who arrives in Jerusalem on the day Jesus is crucified. As he rides into the city he sees a distant hill on which three men are being crucified. When he pays the customary courtesy call on the governor, Pontius Pilate, he learns that one of the three men, Jesus of Nazareth, is the leader of a religious sect suspected of sedition. Pilate confides to Marcus that there are rumors that the disciples of Jesus will steal his body and then claim he is risen from the dead. To prevent this, Pilate has posted a guard of Roman soldiers at the tomb of Jesus. 
A couple of days later, Marcus is summoned before Pilate. He is told that the soldiers at the tomb claim to have been blinded by a great light, and that when they regained their sight, the body of Jesus was gone. Pilate suspects that the guards were drunk or sleeping on guard. He asks Marcus, as a newly arrived and presumably impartial observer, to go to the tomb and investigate. 
Marcus becomes convinced that Jesus did rise from the dead, and over the next weeks and months he tries to learn all he can about the man Jesus, who he was and what he stood for. He talks to anyone he can find who knew Jesus or who had any contact with him, including Mary Magdalene, a number of the disciples, Lazarus, whom Jesus reportedly raised from the dead, and even Simon of Cyrene, the man dragged out of the crowd and forced to carry the cross of Jesus. 
What Marcus learns is that all those whose lives were touched by Jesus are changed in some way, in varying degrees, but all remain human, with human flaws and frailties. Mary Magdalene, for example, is envious of the disciples and their special relationship to Jesus, resentful at what she sees as their lack of sufficient respect for her, and contemptuous of what she considers their lack of sophistication. And Zaccheus, the man Jesus called down from the tree, is much more generous than he had been before his encounter with Jesus, but is also vain of the special favor shown to him.
As Marcus learns more about the teaching of Jesus, or The Way, as the disciples call it, he becomes a believer, and longs to be a part of the Kingdom of God. But the Disciples, while quite willing to accept Marcus's assistance, financial and otherwise, are not yet ready to accept him into their circle, nor to interpret Jesus's commission to spread his gospel 'to all the world' as meaning acceptance of Gentiles into full Christian fellowship.
Most of the latter half of the novel recounts the quest of Marcus for acceptance into the Kingdom. In the end, he finds peace, as he reconciles himself to his own unique place in the birth of this new faith.

Vale do Sinos Technology Park, VALETEC Park

The Vale do Sinos Regional Development Association, VALETEC, was established in 1998 as a non-profit private civil partnership. Its goal is to promote technological development in the Vale do Sinos region by stimulating regional integration, providing incentives for entrepreneurship, while creating, attracting, hosting, and developing companies. In order to achieve this goal, VALETEC develops and manages environments for technological innovation, such as incubators, entrepreneurial condominiums, technology parks and complexes, as well as other initiatives aligned with this focus. VALETEC’s main commitment is to contribute for the improvement of the Vale do Sinos quality of life, while forging links between educational and research institutions and the society, governments, and companies. This contributes to generate jobs and wealth, boosting the sustainable development of the Vale do Sinos technopolitan project.
One of VALETEC’s main initiatives was the creation of the Vale do Sinos Technology Park, VALETEC Park. The park currently works as a regional, multicampi and multisector enterprise, with its main axis following the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, the Innovation Route. The first segment of the VALETEC Park was launched in the city of Campo Bom, in December, 2004. The second segment will consist of an urban park, to be established within the Hamburgo Velho’s Historical Center, in the city of Novo Hamburgo. The park currently encompasses important educational institutions, research centers, labs, companies with intensive focus on knowledge, advanced services, incubators, entrepreneurial centers, facilities for the installation and expansion of companies, living areas and rooms for shared use.
The VALETEC Park is ready to host entrepreneurs, new or consolidated companies and institutions that develop or plan on developing clean technology, applied to the following priority areas: agriculture, animal husbandry, and agribusiness; automation and informatics; biotechnology; leather and footwear industry; design; energy; environment; telecommunications; and creative economy. In the city of Campo Bom, the park segment has capacity for over 120 companies, research centers, scientific and economic development organizations, and advanced service providers. The park’s initially encompasses an area of 365,000 m², surrounded by lovely sceneries, a result of our deep respect for the environment. The surroundings have been keeping up with the park’s growth. This is the result of the expansion and diversification of existing companies, along with the creation of spaces to host new business models and new areas for companies to operate in.
Companies can be installed in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park under three different modalities: inside the Feevale’s Technology Incubator, ITEF, for pre-incubation and incubation; in business accelerators and business condominiums, such as the Alberto Santos Dumont Business Center and the Montserrat Business Condominium; and in individual facilities, which companies may choose to either purchase or rent. Feevale is a regional community university (public, yet not state-owned) which operates in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park through its Academic Extension Center. This is a space for learning, research and extension activities, with an auditorium, event hall, meeting rooms, restaurant and areas for partners and advanced service providers. In the surroundings of the Academic Extension Center, there are several green preservation areas which make perfect spots for relaxing outdoors, with plenty of shadow to contemplate nature and exercise creativity.
Innovation Route.
The Innovation Route represents the VALETEC Park’s main axis. It is located along the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, and its initial project encompasses eight cities. After the Campo Bom segment was established, an opportunity to expand the park was envisioned. This was motivated by the fact that the city’s master plan has, since the 1960s, been preserving a minimum of 350 meters on each side of highway RS-239 exclusively for business use. The project received resources from the Research and Projects Financing, FINEP, the Brazilian Innovation Agency, a division of the Ministry of Science and Technology, in order to plan, develop, and implement the best practices identified by VALETEC during its international missions. The studies performed made it possible to identify several advantages that ensured the VALETEC Park’s success as a regional enterprise.
Members.
One of the VALETEC’s stylemarks is shared management through a network of alliances. Companies that associate to VALETEC also become members of the VALETEC Park, and have access to a wide range of advantages, such as a relationship network that enables them to develop cooperative projects and receive financial funding for innovation. In addition, members have access to the shared infrastructure and high added value services, along with the possibility of establishing relationships with associated educational and research institutions.

Kevin Trainor

Kevin Trainor is an actor from Kilkeel, County Down, Northern Ireland. He attended St Colman's College in Newry before going up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he read English. He is notable for portraying the younger version of Trevor Bruttenholm (played as an older man by John Hurt) in the film "Hellboy"; as the character John in "The Catherine Tate Show" (from the "Ulster Mum" series of sketches); as Charles Adams in the HBO miniseries "John Adams"; and - most recently - as living statue Keiran Barker in Sky 1 television comedy drama 'The Cafe'.
After Cambridge, Trainor trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from 2001 to 2004 (making an early cameo appearance in the 2001 film "The Hole") and appeared in the 2005 Royal Shakespeare Company season.
Selected Theatre Work.
In 2008, Trainor appeared as Moth to Peter Bowles's Don Armado in Sir Peter Hall's "Love's Labour's Lost" at the Rose Theatre, Kingston.
Trainor played Jonesy, a savant with pervasive developmental disorder in the first production of "Lost Monsters" by Laurence Wilson at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool in 2009.
In 2010, he played Trent Conway in "Six Degrees of Separation" at the Old Vic, London. In the same year Trainor took a leading role in Jonathan Harvey's new play, "Canary", in the Hampstead Theatre and on tour. His character was unrepentant gay man "avant la lettre" and campaigner, Billy, whose life as portrayed spans the modern period of gay liberation in Great Britain. Billy's initial betrayal at the hands of his closeted lover and, later, that of society in the form of committal for aversion therapy, which leads ultimately to the character's imprisonment when he kills his treating doctor in an encounter in a gay bar - Harvey offers this as a reminder to his audience of the numerous hopeless casualties of the struggle for gay rights. Trainor himself has spoken of his pride in being centrally involved in such a ""campaigning piece"".
In 2011, Trainor starred as Bertie Wooster in the revival of "By Jeeves", a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn, at the Landor Theatre in Clapham, London. He was off-stage for just thirty seconds during the performance. Later in the year he returned to the Old Vic to play a ""strapping"" Shawn Keogh in "Playboy of the Western World" directed by John Crowley.
Trainor returned to his native Northern Ireland in 2012 to appear in ensemble play "Titanic (Scenes from the British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry 1912)" by Owen McCafferty at the new MAC Theatre in Belfast.
In 2013, Trainor starred as Faustus opposite Siobhan Redmond's Mephistopheles in Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus" in an "avant-garde" co-production between Glasgow's Citizens Theatre and the Leeds West Yorkshire Playhouse. New scenes were written to complement Marlowe's incomplete text by Irish playwright Colin Teevan.

Chatterley Whitfield

Chatterley Whitfield Colliery is a disused coal-mine on the outskirts of Chell in Stoke-on-Trent. It was the largest mine in North Staffordshire and was the first colliery in the UK to produce 1,000,000 tons of saleable coal in a year. 
In 1974 it was decided that Chatterley Whitfield coal could be more easily worked from Wolstanton Colliery and an underground roadway was driven to join the two pits. In 1976 coal drawing at Chatterley Whitfield came to an end. Two years later, a Trust was formed to establish the Chatterley Whitfield Mining Museum. 
The Museum opened to the public in 1979 and offered an underground tour of the disued tunnels to visitors, which included a trip down the main 700 ft. deep Winstanley access shaft. In 1989 the National Coal Board's national collection of mining artefacts was brought to Chatterley Whitfield for permanent exhibition, heightening hopes that the site would become Britain's primary mining museum. There were proposals to extend the attractions by building a group of miners' cottages and a pub, as well as running a monorail linking Chatterley Whitfield with Ford Green Hall. 
However, in 1986, the guided tour of the old pit workings had to be withdrawn after they were flooded following the closure of Wolstanton Colliery, which was connected underground to the Chatterley Whitfield complex. This caused the number of visitors to the museum to reduce almost by a half after reaching a peak of 75,000 in a year. The underground tour was replaced by a simulated pitshaft and workings, but the fibreglass imitation mine was only 30 feet below the surface and held less appeal for visitors.
The Museum Trust found itself with an £80,000 overdraft which couldn't be repaid, as revenue from visitors had fallen and an annual grant from the city council had been reduced. The Chatterley Whitfield Museum Trust was forced into liquidation and the NCB collection was transferred to Caphouse Colliery in Yorkshire.
However, many of the donated items were sold off by the liquidators at an auction. This created such resentment that the rules on selling museum items in future were changed.
The Museum operated for twelve years in total but finally closed in August 1991. The site was then declared a local nature reserve in 1991 and a scheduled monument by English Heritage in 1993. It is owned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council.
Future plans.
The Chatterley Whitfield Partnership was set up in 1999 between English Heritage, Stoke-on-Trent City Council, Advantage West Midlands and Joan Walley MP to find a way to restore the derelict colliery.

Atomizer nozzle

An atomizer nozzle is an aspirator nozzle for producing a fine spray of a liquid based on the Venturi effect.
Principle of operation.
When a gas is injected under pressure through a tube with a decreasing section, it speeds up, generating a pressure drop at the narrowest point (due to Bernoulli's principle).
The reduced pressure, due to the pressure difference between the two points, sucks up a liquid from a reservoir through a narrow tube into the moving gas flow, and projects it forward as a fine spray of droplets (although not atoms as the name suggests).
They may be automated or manually operated, the latter being typically by means of a manual pump (rubber ball or piston), this being a traditional type of atomizer used for perfume.
Applications.
Atomizer nozzles are used for spraying perfumes, for applying paint, in fuel injection systems, and in spray drying installations.

Convenience store crime

For a variety of reasons, convenience stores are often very popular targets for a variety of crimes, most notably shoplifting and robbery. In some cities, convenience store crime has become such a problem that special task forces have been created or some stores have been completely closed down. American convenience stores are often direct targets of armed robbery. In some areas of the United States, it is not unusual for clerks to be working behind bulletproof glass windows, even during daylight hours. Some convenience stores may even limit access inside at night, requiring customers to approach a walk-up window specifically for such situations to make purchases. The main dangers are that almost all convenience stores only have one person working night shift, most of the transactions are in cash, and easily resold merchandise, such as liquor, lottery tickets, and cigarettes are on site.
Most convenience stores have a cash drop slot into a time-delay safe so clerks may limit the amount of cash on hand. Many have installed security cameras to help detect robberies and shoplifting. Because of their vulnerability to crime, nearly all convenience stores have a friendly relationship with the local police. To reduce burglaries when the convenience store is closed, some convenience stores will have bars on the windows.
The reasons for the higher rate of crime at convenience stores may be attributable to various factors, including:
Robbery.
In the 1970s, the amount of convenience store crime, such as shoplifting and armed robberies, became an emerging problem, which put the spotlight on store security. As the industry grew, so did robberies and hold-ups. To address this issue, stores used training material provided in part by the National Association of Convenience Stores such as the six security workshops in 1971, including the "Why Hold Up Convenience Stores?" workshop, featuring a panel of six ex-convicts — including Ray D. Johnson, who became the first maximum-security prisoner to escape from Folsom Prison. Johnson was also an anti-crime consultant for the Southland Corporation and an anti-crime lecturer. Today, many of the panelists' recommendations still ring true: keep windows clear from clutter, minimize the cash on hand, and place the checkout area at the front of the store, visible from the street.
To gain a better understanding of ways to control and deter convenience store robberies, the Southland Corporation (former name of 7-Eleven Corporation) conducted an in-depth study into convenient store robberies and the individuals most likely to commit the crimes. They discovered that the most important things would-be robbers considered when deciding whether or not to commit a crime were the ease of escape from the store/surrounding area and how much money they thought the store would have on hand. They also discovered that while the acquisition of money was the most important motivation for robberies, a sense of power or thrill from committing the crime was often mentioned as well.
In 2009, gasoline theft cost the U.S. convenience store industry $89 million, a steady decline from the record $300 million reported in 2005. Gas theft cost the industry $109 million in 2008 and $134 million in 2007. The average loss per store in 2009 was $761, and that figure is conservative, since it only includes reported thefts and is based on all convenience stores that sell gasoline, including those in states that mandate full-serve (New Jersey and Oregon) and stores in areas where prepay in the norm. Gasoline theft has declined since September 2005 (post-Hurricane Katrina, when gasoline rapidly increased and topped $3 per gallon) when more stations began mandating prepay for fuel.
Shoplifting.
While robberies may be the crime most often associated with convenience stores, shoplifting is also extremely common in such establishments. Statistics suggest that 54% of all shoplifters regularly steal from convenience stores. An increasingly common crime is shoplifting by juveniles. Almost 90% of juveniles say they know someone who has shoplifted, and more than half of adult shoplifters claim they began doing so as teenagers. As many convenience stores attract groups of minors, especially after school or on the weekends, they face the challenge of offering their services in a professional manner while closely monitoring the activities of the patrons. Multiple customers at the same time can create opportunities for theft, as one or more members of a group can distract the employees or block their view of certain areas of the store.
Non-criminal customer actions.
Law enforcement officials and often store employees themselves strongly discourage customers not involved in the commission of a crime from involving themselves in the situation. The Southland study concluded that in cases where someone was seriously injured or killed during a convenient store crime, the most likely cause of such an outcome was employees or other customers not following the demands set forth by the criminal. However, in recent history there have been numerous documented cases of customers stepping in to try and prevent crimes that they witnessed at convenience stores. Examples include:

Stephanie Brown Trafton

Stephanie Brown Trafton (born December 1, 1979) is an American track and field athlete who won the discus throwing gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was a somewhat unusual athlete in that she had become a two-time Olympian before she had competed at a World Championships in Athletics. Her first World Championships in 2009 ended with a sub-par performance in the discus final.
Pre-Olympic career.
Brown Trafton has said she was inspired to become an Olympian as a 4-year-old watching Mary Lou Retton perform in the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
After a youth of attempting several different sports, she eventually divided her time between athletics and basketball. She competed in the discus and shot put at Arroyo Grande High School, and was the CIF California State Meet high school champion in shot put in 1996. After placing second in 1997, she recaptured the California shot put title in 1998. At the same meet, she added the California discus title to her resume. As of 2008, her throw to secure victory remains one of the 10 best "American" high school discus throws in history. 
Nevertheless, she seemed to be headed towards a career in basketball, after being awarded a scholarship for both basketball and track and field to Cal Poly-SLO. Her career was ended in that sport prematurely by a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Thereafter, she concentrated on track and field. She competed at the collegiate level in shot put and discus from 1999 to 2003, but missed 2000, while recovering from the knee injury. Brown-Trafton was named as an NCAA All-American 6 times in her college career, two times during the indoor season as a shot putter and four times in the outdoor season for discus and shot put. Her highest finishes at the NCAA Division I national championships were second in discus in 2003 and fourth in shot put in 2003.
2004 Olympics.
Stephanie competed in the 2004 Olympic Trials in Sacramento, CA in both the shot put and the discus throw. Her best throw coming in to the discus competition was 192 feet. In the first throw of the discus final, Brown threw a 9 foot personal best of 201 feet 3 inches, surpassing the international A-standard mark, and qualified for her first Olympic team.
In August 2004, Stephanie Brown competed at the Athens Games, and her best mark in the qualifying round failed to advance her to the finals. She placed 22nd with a throw of 192 feet even (58.54 m), under her 203 feet 1 inch (61.90 m) personal best at the time. She has expressed contentment with her performance there, saying, "2004 gave me an awesome experience. I came to the Olympics just out of college."
The 2008 Season.
In the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, Brown Trafton made what observers called "stunning improvement". 
She began 2008 with a personal best that was unchanged from 2004. However, she improved that mark in March, April and May 2008. Coming into the Beijing Olympics, her personal best was 217 feet 1 inch (66.17 m), achieved at the Hartnell Throwers Meet in Salinas, California. 
Until a June 21, 2008 mark of 218 feet 1 inch (66.51 m) by Romanian Nicoleta Grasu, 
this throw stood as the longest on record anywhere in the world in 2008. Moreover, it was the third-best American throw of all time, behind efforts by Suzy Powell and Becky Breisch.
Prior to Beijing, she had placed third at the U.S. trials with a throw of 205 feet 5 inches (62.63 m).
Asked to explain her dramatic improvement, Brown Trafton pointed to a key difference in her training regimen. Unusually for her, she did not take time off between the 2007 and 2008 seasons. Instead, she spent what would have normally been the season hiatus working on the "supplemental training" of "balance, agility and flexibility" with Tony Mikia, a physical therapist/sports performance trainer at Sacramento-based Results Physical Therapy and Sports Performance.
2008 Olympics.
Performance.
Although called by the mainstream American sports press "an unlikely savior of U.S. pride" and a "field filler more than a medal contender", a radically improved Brown Trafton actually came to Beijing with a reasonable possibility of winning. She had executed the second-best throw posted in the sport in 2008. And she had progressively upped her personal best by over 4 m across several meets during the 2008 season. 
The first of her six throws displayed her progress to her competitors in Beijing. At 212 feet 5 inches (64.74 m), it bettered the field by almost two meters. She threw into the net on her second and third throws, then posted a 191 feet 7 inches (58.39) and a 201 feet 1 inch (61.30). By the sixth round, it was unnecessary for her to throw to win the gold medal, as the two remaining competitors had not bettered her initial mark. In the end, no one got within a meter of her first throw.
An American breakthrough.
On a personal level, her victory in Beijing was the culmination of a number of months of steady improvement for the athlete, after years of steady progress but nonetheless inconsistent throws above the 60 m mark. It was also the United States' first track and field gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, after a few initial days of failure. But Brown Trafton's gold medal in Beijing was more broadly notable for being the first American gold in the event for 76 years. 
It was only the second American medal in women's discus at a fully attended Olympiad, along with Lillian Copeland's silver medal at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. 
It was the second American gold in the event, after Copeland's gold at the Depression-handicapped 1932 Summer Olympics. It was the fourth medal in American history, behind Leslie Deniz' silver won at the politically boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics. Additionally, it was the first American medal in the sport won outside the city of Los Angeles since Copeland's silver medal in Amsterdam.
Global perspective.
Despite the significance of the victory to the US Track and Field program, Brown Trafton's winning distance of 212 feet 5 inches (64.74 m) caused one track and field reporter to label Beijing a "low-standard competition". It wasn't a personal best for the athlete. Nor was it an Olympic record, as Copeland's gold had been in 1932. And it failed to approach Gabriele Reinsch's 1988 world record of 251 feet 11 inches (76.80 m). In fact, not only was Leslie Deniz' 24-year-old silver medal-winning throw longer than any throw of the 2008 Olympics, but no gold medalist since Lia Manoliu in the 1968 games had posted a shorter winning distance. Only 2 of the 12 finalists at the Beijing Olympics had a personal best "under" Brown Trafton's winning throw, and the average personal best of the field was 219 feet even (66.75 m). However, she was peaking when most of the field was in personal decline. When viewed against the prism of 2008-only performances, the only members of the field "other" than Brown Trafton to better the winning 212 feet 5 inches (64.74 m) mark were Aretha Thurmond, Nicoleta Grasu and Yarelis Barrios. In fact, only six women other than Brown Trafton had thrown better in 2008, and they were not all present in Beijing. 
Matters were not helped, as one commentator noted, by the Beijing weather. The windless, humid conditions on the evening of the competition were hardly ideal for discus throwing. And maybe, as Brown Trafton herself remarked, the competition was "a little more open" thanks to the banning of the prohibitive favorite, Russian Darya Pishchalnikova, for suspicion of doping.
Impact on personal life.
Unlike many 21st century American Olympians, Brown Trafton had a day job as she prepared for the Beijing Games. Using skills rooted in her undergraduate degree from Cal Poly-SLO, is the Director of Operations for Track & Field and Cross Country sports at Sacramento State University, and she worked as a computer-assisted designer for an environmental consulting firm in Sacramento, California called Sycamore Environmental Consultants, Inc.
Upon returning to her residence in Galt, California after her gold medal performance, Brown Trafton was presented with the key to the City of Galt by Mayor Andrew Meredith.
She and her husband are both recreational hunters. She quipped to reporters that the downside of the Beijing Olympics was that they occurred just as hunting season opened in California.
Later in the year she won the Jesse Owens Award, USATF's highest award to the Athlete of the Year.
Post-Olympics.
Brown Trafton confirmed her intention to compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics immediately after winning in Beijing. Noting the difficulties her sport has had with doping, she set a personal goal for the future of being "the first world-record holder that's a clean world record".
The following season, she won her first national title in the discus, and as a result she qualified for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics where she qualified for the finals but finished in last place in the finals with her lone legal throw.
In 2011, she repeated her national championship which again qualified her for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Again making the final, she finished 5th overall.
Her 2012 season showed continued improvement in an Olympic year. On May 4, she beat Suzy Powell-Roos's American record by 3 inches, throwing 67.74m (222' 3") at the Altius TC Throwdown in Maui, Hawaii (the same place where Powell-Roos had set the previous record). That week she was named the USATF Athlete of the Week for the first time.
At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the preliminary round was held in rainy conditions that were difficult for all competitors. Brown-Trafton fell twice in the ring, her final attempt finally assuring he a spot in the finals though her off balance second attempt was measured and proved to be sufficient. Under better conditions in the final, she easily outdistanced the field, leading from the first attempt and ultimately throwing almost 3 meters past second place Aretha Thurmond's best throw.

Irena Adamowicz

Irena Adamowicz (11 May 1910 – 12 August 1973), was a Polish-born scout leader and a Resistance worker during World War II.
Adamowicz was born in Warsaw, to a Polish noble family and held a degree in social work from the University of Warsaw before World War II. She served as one of the leaders of the Polish Scout movement ("Harcerz Polski") coordinating its activities as a Senior Girl Scout. A Polish Roman Catholic, Adamowicz provided counseling and educational services not only for the Catholic Scouts, but also for the Jewish youth movement called Hashomer Hatzair (Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir) in the 1930s, working in close co-operation with Arie Wilner.
Following the Nazi German invasion of Poland, Adamowicz became a member of the underground Home Army ("Armia Krajowa") as a clandestine courier. She delivered messages and provided aid and moral support for the Jewish ghettos in several distant cities.
In 1985, Adamowicz was posthumously bestowed the title of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem for her heroic stand against the German Nazi Holocaust.
Liaison missions.
Due to her work for both, Polish and Jewish youth before the invasion of Poland, and her close contact with the Jewish Zionist movement, Adamowicz, a devout Christian, was able to come to the aid of Jewish Fighting Organization's efforts to establish a channel of communication between the ghettos of different cities. At a meeting in Warsaw in late 1941 a decision was made to embark on this perilous effort, by the representatives of AK including Irena Adamowicz and Stanislaw Hajduk, and, on the Jewish side, by Mordechaj Anielewicz, Icchak Cukierman, Josef Kaplan and Cywia Lubetkin. Throughout the summer of 1942 Adamowicz went on a daring trip across Poland and Lithuania to establish contact between clandestine organizations in the ghettos of Warsaw, Wilno (now Vilnius), Białystok, Kovno (now Kaunas) and Shavle (Šiauliai). Her visits became a source of both vital information and moral encouragement, such as her inspirational presence in Kovno Ghetto in July 1942. She earned a Jewish nickname "Di chalutzishe shikse", the Pioneering Gentile.
Following the end of World War II, Adamowicz remained in close contact with the survivors of the Holocaust, with whom she had worked in the Jewish underground. Thanks to their efforts, she was named Righteous among the Nations in 1985. Her personal experience became a part of the book by Bartoszewski and Lewin entitled "Righteous Among Nations; How Poles Helped the Jews, 1939–1945."

Atlantic Foundry Company

The Atlantic Foundry Company was an Akron, Ohio-based iron casting manufacturer that operated from 1905 to 1989. The company was founded by Charles Reymann Sr., a French immigrant from Alsace-Lorraine, along with 4 fellow foundryman, Ewald Erickson, Emil Krill, Fred Spalding, and Phillip Willenbacker, who had crossed the Atlantic Ocean when they migrated to America and named their new business The Atlantic Foundry. To meet the growing demand for iron, in 1910 they built a modern iron foundry at 182 Beaver Street and in 1919 they added a huge steel foundry at the same site and began a steel casting business. By this time Erickson and Krill had sold their interest to Reymann and he eventually became the President of the company, and the company was privately owned and operated by the Reymann family until its closing. 
At its peak, the company employed 450 people including William Knotts Jr, one of the most valued employees. It operated its own credit union. The company also created a division called Akron Mattress Co., which was later sold in the late 1960s to a private concern that became Schubert Industries Inc. 
Atlantic Foundry closed on January 13, 1989. Thomas Reymann, the company’s final president, said the manufacturing plant had not been profitable during its final six years. The Ohio Employee Ownership Center (OEOC), a non-profit program affiliated with Kent State University, attempted to work with the foundry’s employees to purchase the company from the Reymann family under the terms of an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). However, a lawsuit brought by 125 foundry retirees seeking the resumption of health and life insurance benefits derailed the ESOP negotiations.

Cambridge Arts Theatre

Cambridge Arts Theatre is a 666-seat theatre on Peas Hill and St Edward's Passage in central Cambridge, England. The theatre presents a varied mix of drama, dance, opera and pantomime. It attracts some of the highest-quality touring productions in the country, as well as many shows direct from, or prior to, seasons in the West End. Its annual Christmas pantomime is an established tradition in the city. From 1969 to 1985, the theatre was also home to the Cambridge Theatre Company, a renowned national touring company.
The Cambridge Arts Theatre has also been home to performances of Cambridge University's Marlowe Society, and it provides a venue for the university's triennial Cambridge Greek Play performed in Ancient Greek. In previous years it also housed performances by Footlights, the Cambridge University Gilbert & Sullivan Society and the Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society.
History.
The Cambridge Arts Theatre opened on 3 February 1936 with a gala performance by the Vic-Wells Ballet, featuring among others Robert Helpmann, Margot Fonteyn and Frederick Ashton. The theatre was paid for by a share scheme supervised by its founder John Maynard Keynes, at a cost of £15,000. When only £2,300 was raised by subscription of the town, Dr Keynes underwrote the rest himself. Intending to represent both "town and gown", the Trust included the Provost of King's College, its English and Music professors, the mayor and the deputy mayor. Keynes' wife, the renowned dancer Lydia Lopokova was also key to the theatre's foundation.
Dadie Rylands went on to be the theatre's chairman from 1946 to 1982. The theatre hosted the world première of Harold Pinter's "The Birthday Party" in 1958. Other premières have included "Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know" and "Someone Like You". In September 2008 it hosted the world premiere of a new stage adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's play "Girl with a Pearl Earring", prior to a transfer to the West End. Artists to have appeared here include Ian McKellen (in a Marlowe Society production of "Cymbeline"), Derek Jacobi, and, more recently Susan Hampshire, Nigel Havers, Simon Callow, and Warren Mitchell.
Cambridge Theatre Company.
The Cambridge Arts Theatre was home to the Cambridge Theatre Company (established in 1969), which became one of the most respected and influential touring companies in the UK. Formed as a sister company to Toby Robertson's Prospect Theatre Company and Ian McKellen's Actors' Company (presented as part of CTC), the Cambridge Theatre Company enjoyed enormous loyalty in its home town, and many excellent emerging actors were featured in its wide repertoire.
Under Jonathan Lynn (1976–1981) many of the company's productions transferred to the West End. Lynn, a 1963 Cambridge graduate along with John Cleese and others in the Footlights, used his many contacts to build up a successful repertoire of quality drama. He commissioned plays from Frederic Raphael ("After the Greek") and Royce Ryton ("The Unvarnished Truth" with Tim Brooke Taylor and Graeme Garden), and his production of "Songbook", a spoof musical by Julian More and Monty Norman, transferred to London in 1978.
Like the Prospect Theatre Company and the Actors' Company, CTC initially operated a repertory system of a company of around 14 actors. For example, the 1974 six-play season featured Zoë Wanamaker, Oliver Ford Davies, Roger Rees and Ian Charleson. Sheila Hancock was a regular under Lynn, becoming Associate Director. Maureen Lipman starred in her husband Jack Rosenthal's play "Smash!" based on the ill-fated West End musical "Bar Mitzvah Boy", itself based on the smash hit 1976 television play of the same name in which Lynn and Lipmann had featured.
During the 1970s and early 1980s a primary function of the Cambridge Theatre Company, along with the Oxford Playhouse Company, was to provide middle-scale theatres such as in Harlow, Swindon, Darlington, Mold, Southampton, Croydon, Peterborough, Cardiff, and Stirling with good quality touring drama. The company's Arts Council of Great Britain grant was dependent on this.
The directors of the company were Richard Cottrell (1969–1975), Robert Lang (1975–1976), Jonathan Lynn (1976–1981), Bill Pryde (1981–1988), Robin Midgley (1988–1991), and Mike Alfreds (1991–1999). The company's headquarters were moved to London in the mid-1990s, and its name was changed to "Method and Madness". In 1999 the company dissolved in the face of declining interest in quality drama in the provinces.

William Weston (Jesuit)

William Weston (born at Maidstone, "c." 1550; died at Valladolid, Spain, 9 June 1615) was an English Jesuit missionary priest.
Life.
Educated at Oxford, 1564-1569 (?), and afterwards at Paris and Douai (1572–1575), he went thence on foot to Rome and entered the Society of Jesus, 5 November 1575, leaving all he possessed to Douai College. His novitiate was made in Spain, and there he worked and taught until called to the English mission.
There was not then a single Jesuit at liberty in the country. He reached England, on 20 September 1584, receiving into the Catholic Church Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel. Weston left an autobiography full of the missionary adventures. One salient feature was the practice of exorcisms, at which a number of other priests assisted; and this movement made for a time a good impression. So far, however, as we can now discover, the subjects were not suffering from diabolic possession, but only from hysteria (then called "mother"). Yet there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the exorcists, for Catholics and Protestants alike were then credulous on this subject. The first to object to these witchcraft proceedings were the older priests. A recrudescence of persecution put an end to the exorcisms after a year, before any serious harm had ensued ("The Month", May, 1911). The exorcists, almost to a man, were arrested and imprisoned, Weston amongst them (August, 1586). Many were executed.
In 1588 the Government moved Weston and a number of other priests to Wisbech Castle, where for four years their confinement was strict. But in 1592 the prisoners were, for economy's sake, allowed to live on the alms supplied by Catholics, and freedom of conversation was permitted. The Catholic faithful came to visit the confessors, who on their part arranged to live a sort of college life. This was not accomplished without much friction, in what became called the "Wisbech Stirs". The majority with Weston (20 out of 33) desired regular routine with a recognized authority to judge delinquencies, e.g. quarrels and possible scandals. The minority dissented, and when the majority persisted, and even dined apart (February, 1595), a cry of schism was raised, and Weston was denounced as its originator, the pugnacious Christopher Bagshaw taking the lead against him. In May, arbitrators (John Bavant and Alban Dolman) were called in, but without result, as one espoused one side, one the other. In October two more arbitrators, John Mush and Dudley, were summoned, and they arranged a compromise amid general rejoicings. The whole body agreed to live together by a definite rule (November, 1595). 
In the spring of 1597 the troubles of the English College, Rome, spread to England, and led to a renewal of the "Wisbech stirs", which were soon overshadowed by the Appellant controversy. Weston took no part in this, as he was committed, early in 1599, to the Tower of London, where he almost lost his sight. 
In 1603 he was sent into exile and spent the rest of his days in the English seminaries at Seville and Valladolid. He was rector of the latter college at the time of his death. His autobiography and letters show a man learned, scholarly, and intensely spiritual, if somewhat narrow. A zealous missionary, he strongly attracted many souls, while some found him unconciliatory. Portraits of him are preserved at Rome and Valladolid.

Devon Kennard

Devon Kennard (born June 24, 1991) is an American football linebacker. He currently attends USC. Kennard was considered one of the top football prospects in the United States. He was a U.S. Army All-American.
High school career.
As a sophomore in 2006, he recorded 81 tackles and seven quarterback sacks. During his junior year, Kennard had 111 tackles and 24 ½ sacks, helping the Desert Vista Thunder to the Class 5A Division I title game. For his senior year, Kennard was expected to play both fullback and tailback on offense for the Thunder in addition to his defensive duties, until top tailback Marcus Washington, an Arizona State recruit, returned from a stress fracture in his leg.
In Desert Vista's 21-20 victory over Chandler High School, Kennard suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, causing him to miss the rest of the football season. On the season Kennard had 16 carries for 132 yards with five touchdowns. Defensively, he had 18 tackles and 1½ sacks while facing double and triple teams. He played in the 2009 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
Recruited by over forty schools nation-wide, Kennard initially considered Arizona State, California, Florida, Miami, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, UCLA, and USC. He eventually cut his list to California, Texas and USC. Kennard attended summer camps with USC following his sophomore and junior seasons in high school, and grew close to USC-commit Matt Barkley. At one point, Barkley and Kennard were ranked #1 and #2 for overall prospects in the class of 2009 by Rivals.com. He was rated the No. 1 defensive prospect by a CSTV analyst, and the top defensive end by ESPN.com.
Kennard called the recruiting process "a business," telling his local paper, "They're trying to go after good players. They think you're a good player, and that's an honor, but they think somebody else is a good player, too. If you get all caught up, your head is going to get huge. I consider the whole process a business. It's a business on my end and on theirs. They've got to try to get the best players and I've got to try to go to the best program for me." Kennard announced his decision to attend USC at press conference on January 27, 2009.
College career.
In his true freshman year at USC, Kennard began the season as a backup defensive end, but by midseason was seeing key action primarily in pass rushing situations. He then was moved to strongside linebacker. Appearing in 12 games and starting in five, he had 34 tackles, including 2 for losses, plus 3 deflections, 1 fumble recovery and 1 forced fumble. He made the 2009 Pac-10 All-Freshman first teams by "ESPN" and "Sporting News", and won USC's John McKay Award.
In 2010, Kennard was moved and started at a third position, middle linebacker, where he played in all thirteen games, with games starts, and had 72 tackles, including 7 for losses with 2 sacks. Kennard moved back to defensive end for the 2011 season, where he played in all twelve games, with five starts, and 29 tackles, including 4 for losses (with 2 sacks, one which resulted in a safety). Kennard sat out the 2012 season with a torn chest muscle.
In 2013, Kennard started all thirteen games at outside linebacker, recording 60 tackles and team-highs of 13.5 tackles for loss, nine sacks, and ten quarterbacks hits. He made the All-Pac-12 Defensive Team and was named a Lott Trophy Finalist.
Personal.
Kennard received his bachelor's degree in communication at USC in the spring of 2012 and is working on a master's degree in communication management. He maintained the team's highest GPA. Kennard made the 2011 Pac-12 All-Academic second team and 2010 Pac-10 All-Academic second team. He and 15 of his USC teammates spent 5 days in Haiti in the spring of 2012 building homes and assisting those in need. He was selected to be one of USC's representatives at the 2011 APPLE (Athletic Prevention Programming and Leadership Education) Conference in Austin, Tex., designed to promote student-athlete health and wellness. Kennard is the son of Derek Kennard, who played in the National Football League with the Arizona Cardinals, the New Orleans Saints and the Dallas Cowboys, helping the latter to win Super Bowl XXX. The elder Kennard, a native of Stockton, California, attended the University of Nevada, Reno.

Calandreta

A Calandreta () is a bilingual school in Occitania in the South of France where the Occitan language is taught alongside the French language. These schools are based on the same principle as the "Gaelscoileanna" movement in Ireland, the "Ikastolak" movement in the Basque Country, the "Ysgolion Meithrin" movement in Wales, the "Diwan" schools of Brittany, and the La Bressola schools of Northern Catalonia.
Bilingualism from an early age is recommended by many linguists, as it helps children become more adept at learning additional languages. Some studies have shown that bilingual children have advantages over monoglot children in other subjects.
The first Calandreta appeared in 1979 in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques. Fifty-five primary schools exist as of 2013, as well as two high schools comprising about 3278 students in all. The Calandretas are privately run, secular and free of charge. They follow a program approved by the Ministry of National Education.

It has a strongly eccentric orbit, crossing that of Neptune near perihelion but bringing it more than 1,500 AU from the Sun at aphelion. It takes about 22,500 years to orbit the barycenter of the Solar System. The large semi-major axis makes it similar to and 90377 Sedna. With an absolute magnitude (H) of 8.1, it is estimated to be about 60 to 140 km in diameter. Mike Brown estimates that it has an albedo of 0.08 which would give a diameter of around 110 km.
The object could possibly be a comet. The discoverers hypothesize that the object could come from the inner Oort cloud, but other scientists like California Institute of Technology's Michael E. Brown also consider other possibilities, as "it may have formed from debris just beyond Neptune the Kuiper belt and been 'kicked' into its distant orbit by a planet like Neptune or Uranus".
Perturbation.
More than half of the simulations of show that it gets too close to either Uranus or Neptune within the next 180 million years, sending it in a currently unknown direction. This makes it difficult to classify this object as only a centaur or a scattered disc object. The Minor Planet Center (MPC), which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, lists centaurs and SDOs together. (29981) 1999 TD10 is another such object that blurs the two categories.
Given the extreme orbital eccentricity of this object, different epochs can generate quite different heliocentric unperturbed two-body best-fit solutions to the aphelion distance (maximum distance) of this object. With a 2005 epoch the object had an approximate period of about 22,000 years with aphelion at 1557 AU. But using a 2011 epoch shows a period of about 32,000 years with aphelion at 2006 AU. For objects at such high eccentricity, the Sun's barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates. Using JPL Horizons with an observed orbital arc of only 2.9 years, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2008-May-14 generate a semi-major axis of 796 AU and a period of 22,466 years.

Emil Appolus

Emil Appolus (born 10 March 1935 in Vaalgras, Karas Region - died 28 May 2005 in Keetmanshoop) was a Namibian politician and businessperson. Living in Cape Town, Appolus was part of early discussions on Namibian independence. In 1957, Appolus became a founding member of the Ovamboland People's Congress, the forerunner to the current ruling party, SWAPO. When the OPC merged to create SWANU, Appolus, Sam Nujoma and Fanuel Kozonguizi were three of the five members of the executive committee. He authored the OPC's constitution as well as the first Black newspaper in Namibia, The South West News (Afrikaans Die Suidwes Nuus). The South West News was later banned for nationalistic content. After involvement in the 1960-65 Congo Crisis, Appolus ended up in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where he was deported to Pretoria, South Africa for illegally leaving the country. After receiving bail, Appolus fled to Bechuanaland (now Botswana) en route to Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Appolus was the first SWAPO representative in Cairo, an important position for drawing support for national liberation. In 1969, Appolus was sent to represent SWAPO at the United Nations.
Break with SWAPO.
Appolus, along with Andreas Shipanga and others, broke with SWAPO during the 1975-76 SWAPO crisis. Beginning in 1975, he led the Namibia Democratic Party. Returning to Namibia in 1978, Appolus became an early member of SWAPO-D. From 1985-89, SWAPO-D was part of a Transitional Government of National Unity and Appolus was a member of the National Assembly. However, the TNUG and SWAPO-D were unpopular and SWAPO-D did not earn a seat in the first national elections in Namibian history, held in 1989.
Post-politics.
Appolus retired from politics following the disbandment of SWAPO-D in 1989. He became a businessperson and at one time owned a fishing company.
Death.

FASCINATOR

FASCINATOR is a series of Type 1 encryption modules designed in the late-1980s to be installed in Motorola digital-capable voice radios. These radios were originally built to accept a DES-based encryption module that was not approved by NSA for classified communications. The FASCINATOR modules replaced the DES units and can be used for classified conversations at all levels when used with appropriately classified keys. FASCINATOR operates at 12 kbit/s for encryption and decryption. It is not compatible with DES-based voice systems.
NSA originally supplied keys for FASCINATOR on paper tape for loading using KOI-18 or KYK-13 fill devices and a special adaptor box and cable. The standard cryptoperiod was 7 days, i.e. keys had to be changed weekly.
FASCINATOR was adopted by the U.S government as Federal Standard 1023, which establishes interoperability requirements regarding the analog to digital conversion, encryption (with related synchronization), 
and modulation of encrypted voice associated with frequency modulation (FM) radio systems employing 25 kHz channels and operating above 30 MHz. Voice is digitized using 12 kbit/s continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD) and then encrypted using a National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP) Type 1 encryption algorithm based on the KY-57/58.

Khojaly (city)

Khojali () or Ivanyan (also Ivanian ), also, Ay-Khodzhaly, Khodgalou, Khodzhalv, Khodzhaly, Khojalu, and Khozhali, is a town in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, located some 10 km northeast of its capital Stepanakert. Internationally, it is still considered a "de jure" part of Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan counts it as the capital of its Khojali Rayon.
History.
During the Soviet period, Khojali was a village in the Askeran rayon of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. As the Karabakh conflict started, the Azerbaijani government began to implement a plan to create a new district center. From 1988 to 1990 the population of Khojali increased from 2135 to 6000 residents, mostly consisting of immigrants from Soviet Central Asia (including more than 2000 Meskhetian Turks) and Armenia (about 2000). In April 1990 Azerbaijan abolished the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and its internal divisions. Khojali was given city status and became the regional center for the newly created Khojali Rayon composed of the former Askeran rayon and part of Martuni.
Khojaly was captured by ethnic Armenian forces on 26 February 1992 during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The name became internationally notable after the Khojaly Massacre of February 1992.
In 2001 the settlement was renamed "Ivanyan", after the late general of the Karabakh Defense Army, Kristapor Ivanyan.
Sister cities ("refuted").
In February 2010, media reported a claim by the Azeri-Czech Society that representatives of the Azeri administration of Khojaly in exile and the Czech town of Lidice were to sign an agreement making Khojaly and Lidice sister cities and that a street in Lidice was to be named "Khojali". In March 2012, reports quoted the Mayor of Lidice, Veronika Kellerova, as officially stating that Lidice and Khojali had never been sister cities. She further repudiated reports that there exists a street named 'Khojaly' in Lidice.

USCGC Sagebrush (WLB-399)

USCGC "Sagebrush" (WLB-399) was a USCG seagoing buoy tender. An "Iris" class vessel, she was built by Zenith Dredge Corporation. On 15 July 1943 the keel was laid; she was launched on 30 September 1943 and commissioned on 1 April 1944. She was decommissioned on 26 April 1988 and scuttled on 28 April 1988.
Ship history.
Sagebrush was built by the Zenith Dredge Corporation of Duluth, Minnesota during World War II. The original cost for the hull and machinery was $925,134. From March to April 1944 she acted as an icebreaker on the Great Lakes. She spent the rest of her service life home-ported in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from which she maintained floating and fixed aids-to-navigation (AtoN) in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and surrounding waters.
In addition to her main duties, she performed law enforcement, Search-and-Rescue (SAR), drug and illegal alien interdiction patrols, and provided logistical services in her area of operations. She also made occasional "show the flag" visits to various independent and colonial islands around the Leeward Islands to foster international familiarity and cooperation in the region.
She participated in the unsuccessful search for the body of Roberto Clemente after the aircraft on which he was flying crashed into the sea north of Puerto Rico. In 1974, her crew, under then Captain, LCDR. Lindon Onstad, also conducted the successful rescue of four persons from an overturned cabin cruiser in the surf on the rocky north coast just west of the entrance to San Juan Harbor. Several members of the crew received personal commendations for that action.
The ship underwent a three-month Service Life Extension & Rehabilitation yard maintenance program at the United States Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland, in the spring of 1973. She then returned to San Juan and worked out her service career there. She was run aground in the Mona Passage, a narrow strait of water with numerous corral outcroppings located between Puerto Rico and Haiti sometime between 1975 and 1979. In April 1988, she was decommissioned, then salvaged by a group who intended to use her as part of a man-made reef off the Georgia coast between St. Simons Island and Savannah. She was scuttled off of St. Catherines Island, Georgia on 28 April 1988.
The helm from "Sagebrush" is on display in the National Aids to Navigation Museum in Canfield Hall at the Coast Guard's Training Center Yorktown.

North Staffordshire Coalfield

The North Staffordshire Coalfield is an historic coalfield in the County of Staffordshire, England. The Coalfield emcompasses an area of nearly and that area is virtually wholly contained within the boundaries of the city of Stoke on Trent and the borough of Newcastle under Lyme. There are three other smaller coalfields which are associated with the North Staffs field and they are the tiny Shaffalong and Goldsitch Moss Coalfields near to Leek and the Cheadle Coalfield.
Coal mining in North Staffordshire was recorded as early as the 13th century by the monks at Hulton Abbey but the industry grew during the Industrial Revolution when coal mined in North Staffordshire was used in the areas famous Pottery industry of the Potteries, and also the local Iron industry as ironstone deposits were also found with the coal in certain areas.
The heyday of the industry was in the period before the First World War when over 20,000 men worked in the industry and over 50 pits were in operation. After Nationalisation in 1947 the industry was gradually reduced in size as the smaller pits were closed or merged with the larger, more modern mines. The industry began its final decline after the 1984-85 Miners strike and the last deep mine in the coalfield, Silverdale, was closed on Christmas Eve 1998.
Geology.
The superficial geology in this area predominantly consists of Devensian glacial tills, which overlie the Middle and Upper Pennine Coal Measures; the same sequences of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams as forms the impressive coalfields of Lancashire. The North Staffordshire Coalfield is a compact and heavily faulted coalfield,which is triangular and troughed like a saucer in its shape. However for its relatively small size it has an amazing number and variety of workable seams;
History.
Coal and ironstone were being dug in the Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire area as early as 1282, and by 1467 the Great Row coal seam was being mined and used for firing pottery. The actual area within which the coal is exposed at the surface is , which is small compared to other coalfields, but along the central part of this the thickness of the seams is much greater than that of any other English coalfield except Lancashire.
The coal industry gradually expanded due to demand from the pottery and iron industry. It was also due to the establishment of the new transport system, canals (1777) and later railways (1837).
The coal industry went from private small owners to big group iron-master owners, to nationalisation in 1947, until the last deep mine (Silverdale) was closed in December 1998.
Most former colliery sites have since been reclaimed. Chatterley Whitfield, bordering Chell Heath, which was the first UK mine to produce more than 1 million tons of coal per annum, closed in 1976. Two years later it was reopened as a museum, dedicated to the local industrial heritage. This closed in 1991 and the site was declared a local nature reserve, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument by English Heritage in 1993.
The Phoenix Trust, an independent not-for-profit foundation, is campaigning to turn the North Staffordshire Coalfield into a World Heritage Site due to its historic economic significance, leading role in the industrial revolution and role as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism.

Ottawa Senators (FHL)

The Ottawa Senators were a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Canada. The team only existed for the final 1909 season of the Federal Hockey League (FHL). The team was composed mainly of ex-Ottawa "Silver Seven/Senators" Hockey Club players—a team that played in the competing Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) that same season. The club was formed to help boost the rivalry between the FHL and the ECHA so as to foster a Stanley Cup challenge. However, both the FHL and the ECHA folded after the season, leading to the eventual formation of the National Hockey Association (NHA).
History.
The club was organized on December 23, 1908. Led by Alf Smith, the club featured Bouse Hutton in goal, Rat Westwick at rover, and Arthur Moore on defense, all former "Silver Seven" players.
The team played against three other Ontario-based teams: Cornwall, Renfrew Creamery Kings, Smiths Falls. The team compiled a 3–3 record to place second to Renfrew. While the team drew crowds in the thousands for their first matches against Edmonton Hockey Club and Renfrew, attendance declined to the point where only a few hundred attended the final game against Cornwall.

A250 road

The A250 road is a minor British A-road on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. The route runs from Sheerness to Queenborough via Halfway.
Route.
The A250 begins in Queenborough where it splits off from the A249, with the formerly northbound A249 turning northwest towards Blue Town and the A250 heading northeast on the Queenborough Road towards Halfway. 
When the route reaches a set of traffic lights in the middle of Halfway, it abruptly turns to the northwest towards Sheerness onto Halfway Road. It used to continue straight on towards Minster, but this route is now designated as the B2008. 
Halfway Road continues all the way to Sheerness, where it then becomes Sheerness High Street. Within Sheerness, westbound and eastbound traffic are split by the town's one-way system. While westbound traffic follows the High Street, eastbound traffic diverges at the western end of the town onto the Broadway before following Trinity Road, Cavour Road and finally Invicta Road to rejoin the High Street at the eastern end of the town. 
Following the A250 west, it passes Sheerness-on-Sea railway station, becoming Bridge Road as it does so. A little further along Bridge Road comes a roundabout where the A250 re-encounters the A249 which spawned it. This roundabout marks the termination point of both routes.

<doc id="18918685" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18918685" title="Mobility (military)">
Mobility (military)

Mobility in military terms refers to the ability of a weapon system, combat unit or armed force to move toward a military objective. Combat forces with a higher mobility are able to move more quickly, and/or across more hostile terrain, than forces with lower mobility.
Mobility is regarded as a vital component of the modern battlefield, as the ability to deliver weapon systems or combat units to their objective quickly can often mean the difference between victory and defeat. Armies around the world have massively increased their mobility over the last one hundred years. In World War I, for example, most combat units could only move on the battlefield as fast as a soldier could walk, resulting in stalemate and an inability to outmaneuver the enemy. By World War II, battlefield mobility had greatly improved with the development of the tank, and with tracked and other mechanized vehicles to move forces to and from the battlefront.
Since the end of World War II, armies have continued to develop their mobility. By the 1980s, for example, intercontinental travel shifted from sea to air transport, enabling military forces to move from one part of the world to another within hours or days instead of weeks.
Mobility has also been referred to as a combat multiplier. A highly mobile unit can use its mobility to engage multiples of its own combat strength of less mobile units i.e.; German panzer divisions in world war two were considered the equivalent of two or three infantry divisions partly due to their superior mobility and partly due to inherently greater firepower.
Mobility has also been defined in terms of three generally recognised levels of warfare; tactical, operational, strategic. Tactical mobility is usually defined as the ability to move under fire. Operational mobility is usually defined as the ability to move men and materiel to the decisive point of battle. Strategic mobility is the ability to move an army to the area of operations.
In WWI most armies lacked tactical mobility but enjoyed good strategic mobility through the use of railroads thus leading to a situation where armies could be deployed to the front with ease and rapidity, but once they reached the front became bogged down by their inability to move under fire.

Loreto Convent Lucknow

Loreto Convent, Lucknow is an educational institution for girls founded in 1872 and located in Lucknow, the capital of the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. Loreto Convent is under the management of the Sisters of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, usually known as the Loreto Nuns. Boys were admitted up to the 1960s. The institution maintains a deep concern for the unprivileged.
The primary aim of Loreto Convent Lucknow is to educate catholic girls, but girls from other religions are also accepted without any discrimination.
History.
Loreto was founded in 1616 by an English woman, Mary Ward (1585–1645). It pioneered a new type of religious life, which undertook the education of girls as its main work. The 18th century saw the spread in development of the institute in England and Europe. It was introduced into Ireland by Frances Teresa Ball, who in 1821 established the first House of the Irish branch there. She called it Loreto, the name by which all subsequent foundations are known. 
The Loreto Sisters came to India in 1841 and established schools in Northern India. The aim of the school is to give its pupils a sound moral education while devoting special attention to their intellectual, social and physical development. 
In 1872, a group of seven Sisters led by Mother Joseph Hogan, arrived in Lucknow. They came from Darjeeling at the invitation of Rev. Paul Tosy, the Catholic Bishop of Lucknow. They were given a welcome by the Parish Priest, Father Lewis, who conducted them to the house he had secured for them adjoining to the Church, in what is know Shahnajaf Road. It was in this House that the first Loreto School started in Lucknow on the 4th November 1872.
The earlier days in Lucknow were of great privation as they had few possessions and the heat was tiring for the Sisters, dressed as they were in heavy black habits. In 1873 the first Boarder arrived, Amy Glynn, and when others joined, Mother Joseph knew that the little Convent was far too small. In April of the same year, she secured a large house which was later to become the Royal Hotel, but which was to be Loreto Convent for eight years. 
For the transport of the children Mother Joseph designed, and had built, an 'omnibus', the first to be seen in Lucknow. In 1880, the present Convent, then known as the Cantonment Hotel, was purchased. The grounds once formed part of the Nawab of Oudh's hunting grounds. Later, wings were added to accommodate classrooms and dormitories, but in 1915 the northern part of the building suffered very seriously during the floods of that year, and the Nuns were compelled to spend entire nights under umbrellas. Arches gave way and the roof of the Chapel collapsed crushing every priedieu and chair under its weight but the Sisters escaped death. After this the northern part of the building had to be pulled down and the present handsome edifice was built.
Houses.
There are four houses - Ball (red), Hart (green), Hogan (yellow), Ward (blue).

CRT Lanaudière

The CRT Lanaudière (CRTL) is responsible for organising public transportation services throughout the administrative region of Lanaudière, northeast of Montreal, in central Quebec, Canada. 
The Quebec Ministry of Transport produced a report in 1999 which analyzed the Lanaudière region's transport problems. This report overwhelmingly favoured a public transportation service managed within the region instead of the integration of existing public transit in L'Assomption and Les Moulins with either of the large Montreal (STM) or Laval (STL) systems. The result of this was the creation of the Conseil régional de transport Lanaudière in 2002, under the management of the six regional county municipalities of D'Autray, Joliette, L'Assomption, Matawinie, Montcalm and Les Moulins, with additional transit user representation on the board. This also required each MRC to manage operations in their territory, with a structure which may vary depending on different local needs.
Services.
The southern municipalities within the region are still serviced by MRC Les Moulins public transit (Transport en commun de la MRC Les Moulins) and RTC de la MRC de L'Assomption (Réseau de transport collectif de la MRC de L'Assomption), while the communities at a longer distance from Montreal are the ones that are serviced by CRT Lanaudière. Specialized accessible transportation is administered locally within each member regional county municipality.

Make Mine Mink

Make Mine Mink is a 1960 British comedy farce film directed by Robert Asher and featuring Terry-Thomas, Athene Seyler, Hattie Jacques, Billie Whitelaw, Elspeth Duxbury, Jack Hedley and Raymond Huntley, with cameos by Kenneth Williams and Irene Handl. A group of eccentric misfits go on a spree, stealing mink coats for charity in a Robin Hood-style gang. It was based on the play "Breath of Spring" by Peter Coke, and its sequels.
Plot.
A group of lodgers, Major Rayne, Nanette and Pinkie, staying at the home of Dame Beatrice, a formerly wealthy old lady, express boredom with their humdrum lives. A chance for some excitement comes when Lily, Dame Beatrice's beautiful, young housekeeper, one day gives in to temptation and lifts a brand new mink coat from their neighbours. She does this is a misguided way to thank Lady B by replacing old, thoroughly worn,-out old fur. Dame B is at first delighted but, upon learning how Lily came by the coat she and her lodgers spring into action with a plan to replace the coat without anyone knowing.
Lily has a prison record for juvenile delinquency and theft. Knowing that her heart was right won't save her from prison if discovered. Very fond of Lily, aware of her predicament as well as of her gratitude and great affection for her benefactress, the lodgers: Major Rayne, Nanette and Pinkie, join with Dame B in an effort to return the fur coat before its owners realise its absence. Despite several comical mishaps the gang manages to return the mink without raising suspicions, thanks to a plan drawn up by the retired Major.
The four are so enthused from the success of their little commando operation they decide to set themselves up to burgle from the wealthy in order to donate funds to the needy, stealing rather than returning, mink coats then giving the proceeds to charity.
Their first attempt to rob a boutique goes half-assedly wrong but they still manage to get away with a fur coat. However, now that they have a mink, they discover that it is difficult to dispose of. The Major goes to a shady-looking cafe in Limehouse where he's told how to find a fence. It turns out to be a Salvation Army outlet. They keep on searching, all the while keeping their activities from Lilly, who is now taken up with a policeman whom she dates frequently.
Eventually Dame Beatrice is able to locate a actual, even reliable, fence only to find to her chagrin it is run by her nephew, who hugely enjoys the joke of his dotty old auntie turning out to be a latter-day Robin Hood. He agrees to pay her £550 for the mink and Dame B assures him that she can provide many more for her charity, an orphanage fallen on hard times. The money raised by Dame B's gang will save it from closure. The mirthful misfits go on a spree, stealing numerous minks from boutiques and storerooms. Having saved the orphanage the gang decides to help other worthy causes. Their amateurish escapades become widely known through reports appearing in London newspapers. As their notoriety grows, the chances of being caught increase exponentially. On more than one occasion the members of the gang are so bumbling they only narrowly evade capture.
Then Lily discovers their nefarious doings. Horrified, she explains how lucky they are not to be behind bars due to their ineptitude and lack of criminal professionalism. Thoroughly disappointed with Dame B and the others, she makes them promise to stop the criminal activity. Everyone agree. However, when a request for money comes from a children's home, they decide to pull off one last job. The Major plans a raid on a high-tone but nonetheless illegal gambling party. Dame Beatrice enters the place as a titled gambler out on a lark while the rest of the group dress up as police officers. They stage a raid of the premises planning to make away with all the fur coats in the cloakroom. Their plan goes awry when, little did they know, a real police raid is launched. The gang manages to escape with difficulty, still able to grab a few furs.
Lily confronts them with the new furs and, feeling guilty for having broken their promise to Lily, the gang expects to be arrested at any moment when Inspector Pape from Scotland Yard turns up on their doorstep. Their edginess increases when he begins talking about stolen furs. Without much hardship they convince the Inspector that they're a group of harmless eccentrics. They're heartily relieved to learn, as it turns out, that the Inspector had come round in connection to the original fur stolen from Dame Beatrice rather than about their burgling sprees.
Once the Inspector departs, a furious Lily demands again that they promise to stop stealing minks ever again. The now contrite gang promises never to steal another fur.
But then another plea reaches Dame Beatrice for a charitable donation. In a discussion with her friends she shares the desperate plea. After a short confab, they decide that, while they cannot break their promise to Lily to steal no more minks, they said nothing about not stealing anything else.
The final scene shows them dressed to the gills as Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London heading in the direction of the Crown Jewels.

Rachelle Viinberg

Rachelle Viinberg (née De Jong, born April 30, 1979) is a retired Canadian Olympic rower and Naturopathic Doctor who currently resides in Toronto, Ontario. She was a member of the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Canadian Olympic Rowing teams. In 2012 she won her first Olympic medal in the Women’s Eight, where they were second to Team USA by 1.4 seconds.
Early life.
Viinberg was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia, located on Vancouver Island. She has an older brother named Simon. Her mother, June de Jong (née Mayhew) is an actress. Her father, Hielke de Jong, who died Dec. 7, 2009, was a retired government employee. Viinberg’s ancestry includes Dutch, English, and Ukrainian.
At the age of eight, Viinberg and her family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan. She attended Argyle Elementary school and graduated from Sheldon Williams Collegiate in 1997. Viinberg wasn’t always a rower. From the moment she saw Calgary Olympian Mark Tewksbury win the 100-metre backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she aspired to be a swimmer. Once adolescence hit at 13, however, Viinberg underwent a massive growth spurt, preventing her from pursuing the sport much further.
Ultimately, it was Viinberg’s parents who introduced her to rowing. “They helped me discover rowing after seeing all the rowers train every morning on Wascana Lake when they drove to work. I thought I had nothing to lose, and my 6’0 frame seemed to be the ideal body type,” said Viinberg.
Olympics.
In 2004 Viinberg made her first Olympic team in Athens, Greece. She was not satisfied with her position of being a spare, and pursued another four years of rowing. In 2008 Viinberg was selected to compete in the Women’s Quad at the Beijing Olympic Games. When one of the members of the crew was suffering with a rib fracture, the team did their best with an eighth place finish. Unsatisfied, Viinberg pursued an additional four years of rowing in hope of being on the Olympic podium. She qualified once again for the 2012 Olympic Rowing Team, and won a silver medal in the Women’s eight. When asked about her team’s performance against the Americans, Viinberg replied, “They are an extraordinary crew and I tip my hat to an amazing performance by them. I’m so proud of how we did. We were up against a [U.S.] program that throws a lot of money into rowing development, and we gave it our all. There are no regrets, and I’m so happy with how we executed our race plan.” Viinberg retired from rowing after this final race to pursue her career as a Naturopathic Doctor.
Education.
In 2005 Viinberg graduated from the University of Victoria with a BSc in Biology. That same year, she was accepted into a four year post-secondary medical program at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. She graduated in 2010 as a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine after taking one year off for the Beijing Olympics, and completed her Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam that same year. Viinberg confesses that going through such a vigorous program while training was one of the most challenging points of her life.
Private Practice.
Immediately after the 2012 Olympics, Viinberg started her private practice as a Naturopathic Doctor in Toronto, Ontario. She works with elite athletes and business professionals on a regular basis, with a focus on athletic performance, weight management, pain management and hormonal balancing.
Personal life.
Viinberg married her husband, Alex, in 2009 after meeting in 2005. He proposed on the Great Wall of China after the 2008 Olympic Games. She attributes much of her success to his support.
In 2009 Viinberg’s father died from Leukemia. Eighteen months later, her mother was diagnosed with Stage 3C colon cancer. Urging her mother to seek a combination of Conventional and Naturopathic Medicine, she was in full remission to watch Viinberg stand on the podium at the 2012 Olympic Games. When asked about her mom after the race, she replied, ““She battled stage three colon cancer so she could be in the stands to watch me perform my dream. We both achieved our goals”.

Pornoviolence

"Pornoviolence" is an essay by American author Tom Wolfe. It first appeared under a longer title in the July 1967 issue of "Esquire" magazine, and was later published in the collection "Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine". The essay introduced the term "pornoviolence" in reference to graphic written or audiovisual depictions of violence, which Wolfe argued were used in newspapers, magazines, and film to stimulate prurient audience interest.
The essay was intended to decry the media's habit of glorifying violence as a way of gratifying their audience, in the same way a pornographic film does using sex. Aside from attacking popular culture, such as the articles of "The National Enquirer" and its imitators, Wolfe also levels his criticism at more mainstream art, including Truman Capote's controversial non-fiction novel "In Cold Blood". He argues that, in the absence of mystery and the unpredictable, Capote's book retains the audience's attention with the promise of disclosing gruesome details about the true crime it discusses, thus degenerating the work to the level of sadistic sensationalism, or, indeed, pornoviolence.
"Pornoviolence" as a term has subsequently been used to disparage excessively violent content in books, horror films, and video games, including recently on the subject of the "torture porn" horror film trend of the 2000s.

SS Montanan

SS "Montanan" was a cargo ship built in 1912 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I service for the United States Army, she was known as USAT "Montanan". "Montanan" was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened.
In World War I, USAT "Montanan" carried cargo and animals to France, and was in the first American convoy to sail to France after the United States entered the war in April 1917. While in another eastbound convoy in August 1918, USAT "Montanan" was torpedoed and sunk by some west of Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France. Of the 86 men aboard the ship, 81 were rescued by a convoy escort; five men died in the attack.
Design and construction.
In September 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for four new cargo ships — , , "Montanan", and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash, with nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Montanan", including financing costs, was $73.62 per deadweight ton, which came out to just over $692,000.
"Montanan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 126) was the second ship built under the original contract. She was launched on 25 January 1913, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in April. "Montanan" was , and was in length and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast — such as fresh produce from Southern California farms — to the East Coast. "Montanan" had a single steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers which drove a single screw propeller at a speed of .
Early career.
When "Montanan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports — Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo — and traversed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Montanan" sailed in this service on the east side of North America.
While headed from New York to Coatzacoalcos in October 1913, "Montanan" ran aground on Mantanilla Reef, north of The Bahamas. Answering "Montanan"s distress calls, the Standard Oil Company tanker "Rayo" assisted in freeing "Montanan" from the reef. Although she was leaking slightly, "Montanan" continued on to her destination, and put in for repairs after a return trip to New York.
Following the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships were being held in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route.
On 2 December, "The Washington Post" reported an incident involving "Montanan". While headed down the Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, "Montanan" was approached by a Japanese warship, which fired a warning shot for "Montanan" to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to "Montanan". When the American identity of "Montanan" was established to the satisfaction of the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding "Montanan". The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.
On "Montanan"s next trip, the ship allided with a wharf in Los Angeles Harbor. "Montanan" had arrived in Los Angeles from Puget Sound on 22 January 1915 to complete her load before sailing for New York and Boston. The almost fully loaded ship was slow to respond to the helm and ended up "ploughing through" of Municipal Pier A on Mormon Island channel before coming to a stop at a stone bulkhead. One hull plate on "Montanan" was dented, but the ship was otherwise undamaged. "Montanan"s captain, who had a local license, did not take on a harbor pilot and American-Hawaiian was liable for the damage, estimated by the harbor engineer to be $2,500.
Contemporary news reports offer hints at cargoes that "Montanan" carried during this period. In April 1915, the "Los Angeles Times" reported on the sailing of "Montanan" with a full cargo. The majority of the cargo was rice — from Japan, China, and California — which was destined for the United Kingdom to feed Indian troops fighting in Europe. In June, "The Wall Street Journal" reported that "Montanan" and (of the Grace Line) had sailed from Tacoma, Washington, with 2,500 tons of copper between them.
In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Montanan", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again. "Montanan"s exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service, or she may have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.
U.S. Army service.
After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army — needing transports to get its men and materiel to France — had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected "Montanan", her sister ship "Dakotan", and 12 other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their bunkers for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After "Montanan" discharged her last load of cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 29 May.
Before troop transportation began, all of the ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including "Montanan" and "Dakotan", were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry animals. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the guns were put in place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.
The American convoy carrying the first units of the American Expeditionary Force was separated into four groups; "Montanan" was in the fourth group with her sister ship "Dakotan", Army transports and , and escorts consisting of cruiser , U.S. Navy transport , and destroyers , , and . "Montanan" departed with her group on the morning of 17 June for Brest, France, steaming at an pace. A thwarted submarine attack on the first convoy group, and reports of heavy submarine activity off of Brest, resulted in a change in the convoy's destination to Saint-Nazaire where the convoy arrived 2 July.
"Montanan" departed Saint-Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates "El Occidente", "Dakotan", and "Edward Luckenbach". Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed collier , Navy oiler , and cruiser , the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the head of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force.
Sources do not reveal "Montanan"s movements over the next months, but on 1 August 1918, "Montanan" sailed in Convoy HB-8 with U.S. Navy cargo ships , , and 13 others for France. Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser , the convoy was west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, German submarine launched three torpedoes at "Montanan". The first two, spotted by lookouts aboard "Montanan", missed, but a third, unseen torpedo struck "Montanan" amidships on her port side, opening a large hole. "Montanan" began to settle and was abandoned quickly. Two of "Montanan"s Naval Armed Guardsmen drowned when their lifeboat capsized in the heavy seas; three of her civilian crewmen also died in the attack. "Montanan"s 81 survivors were rescued by convoy escort "Noma".
Shortly after "Montanan" was attacked, "West Bridge", which had previously developed engine trouble and was drifting, was torpedoed by and abandoned. By the morning of 16 August both "Montanan" and "West Bridge", with decks awash, were still afloat some apart. "Montanan"s captain and several officers reboarded the ship the next morning for an attempt to get her under tow, but despite their efforts, the ship sank later that morning.

<doc id="18918799" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18918799" title="Breeching (tack)">
Breeching (tack)

Breeching ( "britching") is a strap around the haunches of a draft, pack or riding animal. Both under saddle and in harness, breeching engages when an animal slows down or travels downhill and is used to brake or stabilize a load. 
Harness breeching.
When a horse, mule, or other animal is in harness, harness breeching (also known as full breeching) helps the animal to slow or control the forward movement of a vehicle. Animal-drawn vehicles have either a pair of shafts or a single pole projecting forwards for about the length of one animal. An animal between shafts wears harness breeching, which attaches forward to the shafts. As the animal slows, the vehicle runs forward, and the shafts pull the breeching forward against the haunches of the animal, which can thus slow the vehicle. A vehicle with a pole has a pair of animals either side of it – their breeching works in a similar way, attaching forward to the pole either directly or by way of their collars. In a larger team, the leaders are in front of the shafts or pole and thus cannot slow the vehicle; nevertheless, they sometimes wear breeching for show.
Breeching may be omitted where the animal does not need to provide substantial braking. For example, in very light harness, such as in a sulky used for harness racing or in a light cart used with fine harness, the weight of the vehicle and passenger is little enough that the girth and crupper of the harness provide sufficient braking support. Breeching may also be omitted if the vehicle has efficient brakes on the wheels – examples include larger carriages and modern vehicles with disk brakes. Similarly, breeching and the requisite shafts or pole are not needed for a dragged load such as a plow or a log that will not move on its own, nor for a canal boat, which is towed by a long rope from the bank.
Historically, additional animals were sometimes used to brake very heavy vehicles on steep downhills, being hitched in harness breeching "behind" the load. This is still done when logging in very steep terrain.
Breeching is not normally used for oxen in yokes, where braking is provided by pulling back on the yoke or girth (depending upon the type of yoke).
False breeching.
On a light vehicle with shafts, "false breeching" is sometimes fitted to the vehicle, instead of using harness breeching. A horizontal strap is attached between the shafts of the vehicle, just behind the animal. When the animal slows or goes downhill, the vehicle runs forward, pushing the false breeching against the haunches of the animal, which can then push backwards to slow the vehicle. False breeching is generally limited to use with well-trained, steady animals, because if the animal rears or falls there is a risk of the false breeching running up over its back. It is sometimes used to help show off the animal's haunches, which would be partly covered by harness breeching.
Saddle breeching.
On both pack and riding stock, if breeching is used then generally a breastplate is used as well.
Pack animals.
Breeching may be used to stabilize the pack saddle of a packhorse or other pack animal, by keeping the saddle from sliding forward, especially on downhill tracks. Pack horse breeching may be supplemented with a crupper to provide additional stability.
Riding animals.
Breeching is occasionally used in a similar manner as that of a pack saddle, especially when riding mules. Mules often have lower withers and flatter backs than horses, making it likely that the saddle will slide forward when going downhill with a rider. However, a crupper is more commonly used on riding animals in general.
Training.
An animal is often trained in harness with breeching before being hitched to a vehicle.

History.
Topflight was founded in 1943 as the Topflight Tool Company, a precision machine shop that made components for World War II aircraft. Identifying the components became necessary, and Topflight designed printing presses to label the parts. After the war, the company moved into the emerging pressure-sensitive label market. Topflight continued to design its own presses throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and added high-performance products like shrinkable film, tamper-evident labels, and conductive printing. In 1998, Topflight moved its headquarters to Glen Rock, Pennsylvania.
Sister companies.
In 1961, Topflight created Adhesives Research to chemically engineer adhesive solutions existing companies could not achieve. To specifically meet the technical needs of membrane switches and biosensors, Conductive Technologies was formed in 1979. Both companies are now separate entities, but maintain a relationship with Topflight Corporation.
International affiliates.
Topflight also created the following international corporations:

Vladimir Ignatowski

Vladimir Sergeyevitch Ignatowski, or Waldemar Sergius von Ignatowsky and similar names in other publications (* March 8/20, 1875 in Tbilisi, Georgia; † January 13, 1942 in Leningrad), was a Russian physicist.
Life and work.
Ignatowski graduated in 1906 in Saint Petersburg. 1906-1908 he continued to study at the University of Giessen, with his dissertation in 1909. 1911-1914 he taught at the Higher Technical School in Berlin. Afterwards he worked for different institutions in the soviet union. Then he became a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn reported in his book The Gulag Archipelago, that Ignatowski was put under arrest by soviet officials, who raised absurd allegations against him. It was claimed that Ignatowski was recruited by the German secret service in 1909, not to spy in the next war (World War I), but to spy in the ""war after the next war"" (World War II). So Ignatowski was executed in 1942 in Leningrad. He was rehabilitated in 1955.
Ignatowski wrote some papers on special relativity. In 1910 he was to first who tried to derive the Lorentz transformation by group theory only using the relativity principle, and without the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light (1910b, 1911b, 1911c, 1911h). Although he derived the correct transformation, the invariant limiting speed remained undefined. Ignatowski had to resort to length contraction of moving electrostatic fields in order to identify this limiting velocity with the velocity of light in vacuum. While some said that this approach was insufficient and the second postulate is still needed, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate (see Postulates of special relativity). Ignatowski also investigated the status of rigid bodies within special relativity (1910a, 1911a). He concluded that velocities greater than the speed of light are possible, even though he showed that those are not signal velocities and therefore are not in conflict with relativity (1910b, 1911g). He also formulated a relativistic theory of hydrodynamics (1911f).
Ignatowski is also known for his work in the field of optics, whereby he founded the only optical-mechanical facility in the Soviet Union.

Attorney General v Edison Telephone Co of London Ltd

Attorney General v Edison Telephone Co of London Ltd (1880–81) LR 6 QBD 244 is an interesting English law case on the application of the old Telegraph Act 1869. It held that the monopoly of the Post Office under the statute extended to telephone companies.
Judgment.
Stephen J and Pollock B gave judgment. They held the Act covered ‘communications by any wire and apparatus connected therewith used for telegraphic communication, or by any other apparatus for transmitting messages or other communications by means of electric signals’ (249) This meant that the telephone companies were subject to the licensing and monopoly provisions of the Act. It effectively allowed the Post Office to take over the businesses, which had acted without an authority.

After the victory of the DEMOS coalition on the first democratic elections in Slovenia in April 1990, Dimitrij Rupel became head of the secretariat, gradually transforming it into a ministry of foreign affairs of Slovenia which was starting its process of secession from Yugoslavia. Jarc had an important role in this process which ended in the international recognition of Slovenian independence in 1992. In 1993, Jarc shortly moved to Brussels and got employed as an advisor to the European Commission, in the General Directorate for the Policy on Small and Medium Enterprises. At the end of the same year he got employed as an expert on the Slovenian Ministry for Economic Relations and Development.

The same year, he was named by the Slovenian government led by Andrej Bajuk as member of the negotiation group for Slovenian entry in the European Union. In 2001, he was named Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture, which he remained until 2004, when he became the Slovenian ambassador to Israel.
In 2007, after the resignation of Minister of Agriculture Marija Lukačič, Jarc was named as the new Minister of Agriculture of Slovenia in the centre-right cabinet led by Janez Janša. In the parliamentary elections of 2008, he did run on the list of any political party and instead chose to get back into diplomacy. Following the victory of the centre-left coalition led by Borut Pahor, Jarc was replaced as Minister of Agriculture by Milan Pogačnik. 
In December 2008, after several months of delay, he was appoined by the President of the Republic Danilo Türk as ambassador to the United Kingdom.

Los Solidarios

Los Solidarios (“Solidarity”), also known as Crisol (“Crucible”), was a Spanish anarchist armed-struggle group founded in 1922 or 1923 in Barcelona, as a reply to the dirty war strategy used by the employers and government against trade unions.
Los Solidarios.
"Los Solidarios" was created as a successor of a previous group called "Los Justicieros" (“The Avengers”), created in San Sebastian by Durruti and local anarchists such as Ruiz, Aldabatrecu, Marcelino del Campo or Suberviola. The group was integrated by anarcho syndicalists, and it set up a network in order to buy and store guns, with which to attempt on members of the Sindicato Libre, (“Free Trade Union”), an employer-obeying organization. "Los Solidarios" are considered responsible for bank robberies, such as the Bank of Spain Robbery (September 1923), and for the murder of the Zaragoza cardinal Juan Soldevilla y Romero (1923). After that, and pressured by the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Durruti, Francisco Ascaso and other members fled to France, and then to Latin America, where they were charged with more robberies. They returned to Europe, settled down in France, and were charged with attempting on Alfonso XIII on a visit to Paris, so they had to live clandestinely. They were expelled from France and settled down in Belgium, where they were allowed to stay. With the advent of the Spanish Second Republic (1931), some of the members that had been able to return to Catalonia decided to enter the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (“Iberian Anarchist Federation”), as a group called "Nosotros" (“Us”), holding more radical points of view than those of the FAI itself. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the group dissolved as such, but they kept working inside the FAI. 
Juan García Oliver, member of Los Solidarios, stated in a speech, whose recording has survived, that the members of the group, were the best working-class terrorists and "the kings of Barcelona's workers pistol", the ones with the best chance to strike back against the “white terrorism” directed towards workers by the employers, such as the murders of Salvador Seguí and Francesc Layret .

Wally's Cafe

Wally's Cafe located in the South End of Boston, Massachusetts, is the oldest continually operating jazz club in the United States. It has been home to talent from the greater Boston area, including many coming from the nearby Berklee College of Music. 
Wally's was founded by Joseph L. Walcott who was a Barbadian who immigrated to America in 1910. After reaching Ellis Island, Mr. Walcott, better known as "Wally," joined his brother, who had migrated a few years earlier, in Boston. Wally held many jobs, and with his savings he opened Wally's Paradise at 428 Massachusetts Avenue in 1947. Wally was the first African American to own a nightclub in New England; he brought new acts to town and the nightclub became an attraction for jazz aficionados who rushed to see the famous bands of the day.
The Sixties arrived, and the Big Band era was diminishing. Wally maintained his commitment to jazz by featuring young musicians who were attending prominent academic institutions such as Berklee College of Music, the Boston Conservatory, and the New England Conservatory of Music. Mr. Walcott hired these young music students and mixed them with seasoned professionals who were veterans of the Big Band era. This mix of talent was special, and the format enabled Mr. Walcott to continue to serve the jazz loving audiences of New England.
In 1979, Wally closed its original location at 428 Massachusetts Avenue and moved across the street to 427 Massachusetts Avenue, the present location of the nightclub. Wally's Café now features live music 365 days a year. Many of the musicians are professionals, but Wally's still maintains its tradition of providing students with a stage to perfect their craft.
After Wally's death in 1998 at age 101, his three children took over the bar, and today Wally's is a family club managed by Walcott's daughter, Elynor, and his three grandsons, Paul, Frank, and Lloyd Poindexter.
Joseph L. Walcott (Wally) adopted Elynor as a child, whom at birth was named Elynor Penn. Elynor's birth mother Laurice Penn, Wally's actual daughter is Joseph L. Walcott's only child. Laurice aka "Penny" gave birth to eight children of which Elynor is the oldest. Penny worked at Wally's cafe when it originally began at 428 Massachusetts Avenue for many years and died in the 1960's. Joseph L. Walcott had several grand children who worked at Wally's Paradise in the 70's until the late 90's: Darrell Penn, Sharon Penn, Doreen Penn, Michael Penn, Sandra Penn and Laurence Penn. Kathleen Penn the second to the oldest child raised her sisters and brothers after Laurice's death. Each of Elynor's siblings supported the family business in a variety of ways for many years. These family members listed are the actual birth grand children of Joseph Lloyd Walcott. Wally's Cafe was in jeopardy of closing according to the Boston Globe's article after Wally's death due to the inheritance dispute between Madeline Walcott (Wally's wife until the day he passed) and Elynor Walcott. This situation adversely affected the entire family. Columns written by Adrian Walker from the Boston Globe and other local newspapers followed the ongoings of the probate battle but never wrote an article concerning the settlement or the resolve between the siblings which the news reporters instigated. However in spite of all that happened they are a very close family in full support of Wally's Cafe.
Moreover, the award winning, legendary, and oldest Jazz Club in the United States, maintained and held by one family, is still thriving under the management of Elynor and her three sons whom from blood lineage are his actual great grand children. Four generations going strong maintaining Wally's Cafe.

Mo's Irish Pub

Mo's Irish Pub is a small chain of Irish-themed restaurants in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Indiana.
Background.
Mo’s Irish Pub is a Wisconsin-based small chain of Irish-themed pub style restaurants owned and operated by Milwaukee restaurateur John Vasallo, otherwise known as Johnny V. There are currently three locations for Mo’s, one in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, another in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the most recent opening in May 2008 in Noblesville, Indiana.
History.
The first Mo’s Irish Pub was opened in August 2003 as a continuation in a series of other Mo’s restaurants, most notably Mo’s...A Place for Steaks and Moceans, an upscale seafood restaurant. Moceans has since closed its doors in order for the expansion of Mo’s Irish Pub and Mo’s...A Place for Steaks.
Atmosphere.
In the tradition of many popular sports pubs, Mo’s contains several flat screen televisions with a variety of sporting events on at all times. The décor is casual with a multitude of large Irish-themed prints and photos lining the walls. There is also a strong attempt to maintain a modern feel within the restaurants with an emphasis on sponsoring events pertaining to the early twenties generation.
Food and drink.
Mo’s menu is a combination of authentic Irish and contemporary American cuisine. On the Irish side, they offer a traditional Reuben made with their very own slow-cooked corned beef. Other menu items include Irish stew, fish and chips and the popular Boxty. Their drink menu is highlighted by the “perfect pint” or Guinness, a highly popular Irish beer.

Pseudobiceros hancockanus

Pseudobiceros hancockanus is a species of hermaphroditic marine flatworm in the family Pseudocerotidae.
Description.
According to the "Baensch Marine Atlas," ""P. hancockanus" is intense blue to black with white and orange peripheral bands and a purple fringe. The two short cephalic antennaie are easily overlooked because they are the same color as the body. Inferiorly, this species is purple with a medial line."
"P. hancockanus" is very similar in appearance to "P. uniarborensis", although the margin of "P. uniarborensis" is translucent gray with a white line only on the outside, while the margin of "P. hancockanus" is pure bright white.
Habitat and distribution.
"Pseudobiceros hancockanus" lives in warm seas, sometimes on coral reefs, other times among coral fragments or stones. It has been observed near such places as Indonesia, Fiji, and Kenya.
Behavior.
"Pseudobiceros hancockanus" can travel long distances, swimming by undulating the edges of its body.
Reproduction.
Like other members of the "Pseudobiceros" genus, "P. hancockanus" is hermaphroditic with each individual able to function as either a male or female. Mating between two such worms involves penis fencing, as each worm tries to inject sperm into the other with one of its two stubby penises, while trying to avoid being inseminated itself. One explanation advanced for this behavior is that the female role entails more investment in the resulting fertilized eggs. Another possible explanation is that the duel awards mating advantage to the better of two dueling partners—so that penis duel's loser, becoming the "female," is compensated by creating offspring with genes even better than hers.

<doc id="18919271" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18919271" title="Foreign Sports Talent Scheme">
Foreign Sports Talent Scheme

The Foreign Sports Talent Scheme (FST) is a scheme used by sports officials and organisations in Singapore to scout and facilitate the migration of non-Singaporeans deemed to possess sports talent to play in Singapore colours in sporting events. Introduced in 1993 by the Singapore Table Tennis Association, it also aimed to boost local sporting standards by importing sporting expertise. 
In March 2008, it was announced in the Parliament of Singapore that 54 athletes had benefited from the programme and received Singapore citizenship, of which 37 were still in active training.
As of November 2009, 4.6 per cent, or 39 athletes, of the total number of national athletes in Singapore are foreigners who are brought in through the scheme. The majority of the foreign sports talent are 19 for badminton and 11 for table tennis.
Debate.
The achievement of Singapore's women's table tennis team in winning a silver medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the country's first Olympic medal since 1960, reignited debate over the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Some critics said that the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) has relied too much on it, as the team comprised three China-born players, Feng Tianwei, Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu.
A day earlier, STTA president Lee Bee Wah had said: "It doesn't mean that we should look at them table tennis players differently because they're not born and brought up in Singapore. The important thing is that they have embraced Singapore and want to be a part of it. And they wanted so badly to win a medal for our country. We should not be harping on where they are born. I hope mindsets change." In addition, during his Mandarin National Day Rally speech on 17 August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said:
In a 2009 Parliament session, Nominated Member of Parliament Joscelin Yeo questioned if a minimum ratio of local athletes versus athletes who graduate under the FST Scheme is needed, to ensure Singapore-born hopefuls have the opportunity to realise their full potential. In a written response, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) Vivian Balakrishnan said that Singapore will continue to embrace talented foreign athletes who want to represent the country, as long as they raise the standard of sports in Singapore.
Balakrishnan also laid down the three principles that guide the FST policy: openness to global talent, fairness in treatment of FSTs and local-born athletes, and ensuring the integration of the foreign-born athletes into society. FST application is processed by MCYS and the Singapore Sports Council, with the Ministry of Home Affairs final approval for each athlete to gain Permanent Residency and subsequent Singapore citizenship. Balakrishnan maintained that there was no need to set a ratio on the number of FSTs in each sport as the Singapore Youth Sports Development Committee is working to grow the pool of young local athletes by spotting young talent early and nurturing them, and giving them greater exposure to competition.
Balakrishnan revealed that FSTs currently make up 4.6 per cent of the total number of athletes among the development and national squads of the seven key sports in the country. Badminton and table tennis have the most number of FSTs in their teams with 19 FSTs out of 97 badminton players, and 11 FSTs out of 85 table tennis players.
Athletic.
Singapore Athletic Association's (SAA) President, Loh Lin Kok, brought in shot put specialists Du Xianhui, Zhang Guirong and Dong Enxin from China under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme in 1998. Dong became a Singapore citizen in May 2001 while Du and Zhang became Singapore citizen in October 2003.
Another shot putter, Luan Wei, and hammer thrower, E Xiaoxu, were brought to Singapore in 1999.
Du and Zhang went back to China after training and salary disagreements ; Luan and E Xiaoxu were involved in court cases with the SAA over unfair dismissal; while Dong had disappointed in performance
Loh admitted in an interview that the scheme had failed miserably for the SAA but will not abandon the scheme.
Football.
The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) adopted the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme in 2000 but was limited to scouting talent for the Singapore national football team to boost Singaporean football. Its goal is to attract foreign players in Singapore to change nationality and thus play for Singapore. The scheme is described as the second key pillar of the FAS football excellence plans.
Launched in the year 2000, its objective was to complement the FAS Youth Development programme by identifying the playing positions in the national team that were lacking, especially from its youth development output and to fill these gaps with FSTs. The first FSTs were inducted in Jan 2002.
In 2002, the national team welcomed Croatian-born Mirko Grabovac, Brazilian-born Egmar Goncalves and English defender Daniel Bennett to strengthen the national team. The Nigerian-born pair of Agu Casmir and Itimi Dickson received their Singapore citizenship in 2003 and 2004 respectively. The FAS, with the help of the clubs, has identified several other talented U-21 foreign players under this scheme. Their performances are being closely monitored in the S.League.
From 2007, the FAS accepted changes to the scheme which requires new foreign sports talents to play in the S.League for a minimum of two seasons after being granted Singapore citizenship.
When the FAS first launched the FST scheme in 2000, the intention was to offer citizenship to about 2 to 3 foreign players a year. However, due to the stringent selection process and early success to the youth development programme, to-date, only nine foreign-born players have been granted Singapore citizenship. All of them have played in the S.League to contribute to the local football scene and also played for the national team.

Khojavend (town)

Khojavend (, named Martuni () by locals) is a town and the provincial capital of the Martuni Province of the "de facto" independent but unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It is located approximately 41 kilometers east of the republic's capital of Stepanakert. Its population according to the 2005 Nagorno-Karabakh census stands at 4878.
History.
Excavations in Khojavand have uncovered a number of tombs dating to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Khojavand is also home to several ruined medieval churches and remains of settlements, and "khachkars" have also been preserved.
During Soviet times, Khojavand was the capital of the eponymous district located in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. The population of the town, grouped into "kolkhozes", largely occupied itself with raising livestock, grape growing, wheat cultivation, and gardening. 
Khojavand, and the district itself, became a frontline city during the latter stages of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In early February 1992, Vazgen Sargsyan, the then Defence Minister of Armenia, appointed Monte Melkonian as Chief of Headquarters and assigned him to lead the defense of Martuni and the surrounding regions. Melkonian, who remained as regional commander until he was killed in combat in June 1993, and the forces under him were able to halt and prevent the Azerbaijani military from occupying the district throughout the entirety of the war.

Cast.
The fictional ship HMS "Sherwood" in the film is played by a "Daring"-class destroyer. Other ships shown include the battleship and the frigate during the title sequence, two "Dido"-class cruisers in early background scenes, and a Loch-class frigate during the closing credits. There are several scenes filmed in Admiralty House, in Portsmouth Naval Base.

Portway, Bristol

The Portway is a trunk road, approximately long, which links central Bristol, England, with its port at Avonmouth. It is part of the A4 road, which was the primary east west highway in Southern England before the construction of the M4 motorway.
The road starts at Hotwells and runs through the Avon Gorge, under the Clifton Suspension Bridge, parallel to the serpentine path of the River Avon. It passes through the suburbs of Sea Mills, where it crosses the River Trym, and Shirehampton, before terminating at a roundabout in Avonmouth at a junction with the M5 motorway. 
Construction.
Construction of the Portway started in 1919, partly on the line of the Bristol Port and Pier Railway. In 1924, approximately of newly constructed concrete embankment slid into the river, posing a hazard to navigation and adding 12 months to the duration of the work. The Portway was the most expensive road in Britain when it was opened by the Minister of Transport, Colonel Wilfrid Ashley, in 1926, costing £800,000.
Electric lighting was provided to illuminate the new road, but for one year after the opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.
Rockfalls from the limestone cliffs of the Avon Gorge have caused a hazard to motorists on occasion and every year the road is closed to allow for inspection of the cliffs for potentially dangerous cracks and loose rocks, and to allow remedial works. In 1980, a glass fibre reinforced concrete canopy was constructed over the road where it passes under the Clifton Suspension Bridge in order to protect traffic from danger at that point.
In 2001, a water main burst near the junction with Bridge Valley Road, causing a major collapse and putting the road out of action for several months. One passer-by was swept into the river but was rescued uninjured.
Other facilities.
The Portway Park and Ride is in Shirehampton near the M5 junction. A bus lane on the inbound section of the road from Sea Mills is designed to allow quicker access for buses to the city centre. The railway stations of both Shirehampton and Sea Mills are both very close to the road and there is a proposal to build a new station at the Park and Ride.
The annual Bristol Half Marathon uses the Portway as part of its route and the annual "Bristol's Biggest Bike Ride" also uses the road which is closed to motor traffic for the day. In June 2009, city councillor John Rogers proposed that the Portway be closed to motor traffic on summer Sundays to allow cycling in a car free environment.

Poppy seed roll

The poppy seed roll is a pastry consisting of a roll of sweet yeast bread (a viennoiserie) with a dense, rich, bittersweet filling of poppy seed. An alternative filling is a paste of minced walnuts, making it a walnut roll.
It is popular in parts of Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Israel. It is commonly eaten at Christmas and Easter time.
It is traditional in several cuisines, including Hungarian cuisine ("mákos bejgli"), Russian cuisine ("bulochki s makom" ), Serbian cuisine ("маковњача"), Bosnian cuisine ("makovnjača"), Polish cuisine ("makowiec"), Czech cuisine ("makový závin"), Slovak cuisine ("makovník"), Lithuanian cuisine ("aguonų vyniotinis"), Croatian cuisine ("makovnjača"), Romanian cuisine ("ruladă cu mac" or "ruladă cu nuci"), and Austrian cuisine ("Mohnkuchen" or "Mohnstriezel"), Danish cuisine ("wienerbrød (Vienna bread)": [ˈʋiːˀnɔˌbʁœːˀð]) and Latvian cuisine ("magonmaizite").
Ingredients.
The dough is made of flour, sugar, egg yolk, milk or sour cream and butter, and yeast. The dough may be flavored with lemon or orange zest or rum. The poppy seed filling may contain ground poppy seeds, raisins, butter or milk, sugar or honey, rum and vanilla. Sometimes a tablespoon of apricot jam, which is one of the most popular jams used in the Hungarian cuisine, is substituted for sugar. The walnut roll filling contains raisins, rum, butter or milk, lemon rind and chopped walnuts. This filling may be spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove or vanilla.
The dough is at first quite heavy, stiff and dry, but with kneading and resting becomes very elastic and strong. It is rolled out into a large sheet, thick or thin depending on taste. One aesthetic principle is that the dough and filling layers should be equal thicknesses. Another is that more layers are better. The filling is spread over the dough, which is then rolled into a long cylinder or log. Traditional recipes usually involve brushing the log with the egg white left over from the yolk used in the dough. Other recipes use different washes, or an icing added after baking. The unbaked log is gently transferred to a sheet pan, left to rise, then baked until golden brown.
Christmas traditions.
Hungarian Christmas sweets and pastries served at Christmas time are not numerous. In general, no other pastries are served, and the traditional candy "szaloncukor", large amounts of wrapped decorative fondant candies hung on the Christmas tree as a decoration, also consumed during the Christmas holidays. All Hungarian families serve both the walnut and the poppy seed rolls, often accompanied with fruit wines, like red currant wine.
Variants.
The poppy seed filling is a paste of ground poppy seeds, milk, butter, sugar and/or honey, often with additional flavorings such as lemon zest and juice. It may have raisins. The walnut filling is a paste of ground walnuts, milk, butter, sugar, and raisins, often with additional flavorings such as coffee or orange zest.
A very long roll may be bent so that it fits on a baking sheet; the result is called a "patkó" (). Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be finished with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.
In Hungarian cuisine the rolls, one with each filling, are served together. The combination is known as "mákos és diós" (poppy seed and walnut). However, in some English language cookbooks there may be no mention of the walnut filling, as if poppy seed were the only filling used. Some other non-Hungarian food writers combine the poppy seeds and walnuts together in one filling.
Because Poland and Czech culture have intermingled, immigrants to America sometimes use the term "Kolache" to describe it.
As a new trend, a chestnut-filled variant (gesztenyés bejgli) is emerging, mainly among younger urban families.

Lodge St. Olaus to the white Leopard

Lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard (Danish: "St. Olaus til den hvide leopard") is a Freemasonic Lodge within the Norwegian Order of Freemasons. It was established on June 24, 1749 on the island of "Ladegaard", in the building of "Bygdøy Kongsgaard" in Christiania. The original name of the lodge was St. Olai, and it was named after the Norwegian king Olaf the Holy one (Olai is a Latin genitive form of Olav). In 1780 the lodge changed its name to Saint Olaus to the white leopard.
In 1785, the second City Hall of Christiana (built 1733) was bought by St. Olai Lodge. The inauguration of the lodge rooms was carried out by Bernt Anker, and the lodge had its residence in the ground floor and the first floor until 1811. Today, the lodge resides inside the headquarter of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons in "Nedre Vollgt. 19", Oslo, as a neighbour building of the Norwegian Storting.
The coat of arms of the Lodge carries the Latin inscription ARTIS OPE FEROCIAM EXUIT: "With the help of the Art, it (the leopard) shall get rid of its wildness (or rage)".
St. Olai Lodge was the first Masonic lodge in Norway, and the mother lodge of many lodges in the Norwegian Order of Freemasons. It was founded by Count Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig, probably with the Danish king Frederick V of Denmark present at the initiation ceremony. The lodge is an offshoot of the Danish lodge St. Martin which existed in Copenhagen from 1743 to 1767.
Nationality.
The lodge received its directives from Danish Freemasonic lodges from 1749 to 1818. Its first mother lodge was «St. Martin», founded in Copenhagen in 1743. In 1745, the lodge «Zorobabel», also in Copenhagen, was founded as an offshoot of «St. Martin», with a Patent from the Premier Grand Lodge of England dated 25 October 1745. The two lodges «St. Martin» and «Zorobabel» was unified into the new lodge «Zorobabel to the Nothern Star» on 9 January 1767, upon which the new lodge became the new directing lodge of St. Olaus.
In 1818, due to the union between Norway and Sweden, the lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard became member of The Swedish Order of Freemasons. The lodge was one of the six founding members of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons («Province X») on 24 June 1891.
Rites.
On its foundations in 1749, St Olaus was a pure lodge of St. John, a «blue lodge» practising the Craft degrees. In 1752 the lodge also gradually began to practise the high degrees of Rite of Strict Observance. The establishment of the rites was finished in 1762 and was practised in cooperation with the Copenhagen-lodges until 1782.
The rectified rite was introduced in Denmark and Norway in 1782. It was influenced by French Freemasonry and was less concerned with Christian institutions. Among other things, it removed the legend about the Knights Templars from the teachings.
In 1818, St. Olaus became directed from the Swedish Grand lodge, and in 1819 it was transformed into a «blue lodge» of St. John practising the three Craft degrees since then.

Swede Patch 2000

The Hagström Swede Patch 2000 is the first guitar/synthesizer hybrid. It was manufactured by Hagström in collaboration with Ampeg. The guitar appears to be a normal Hagström Swede but the neck is specially wired to transmit an input to a synthesizer when the strings come in contact with the frets. This gives the player the option of playing the instrument as a guitar, as a synthesizer or a combination of both.
Development.
Preparations for the development started in 1975 when twelve guitars were to be finished for a music convention. In April the same year Hagström received the electronics provided by Ampeg who were the supplier of the advanced electronics. The idea was to place a digital receiver within the body of the guitar that was controlled by a switch which selected between the traditional guitar sound and the synthesizer sound. If more than one string was used it automatically selected the highest fret and lowest string. The receiver was connected to the strings and frets, every string and fret had an own individual code. Due to this, each string had to be electrically isolated, this meant that Hagström had to develop a new tailpiece/bridge system. The newly developed bridge looks like a typical Hagström, except the centers of the saddles made of are dense plastic, not metal. Instead of 1 tailpiece each string terminates at a separate block set in 2 rows. 
The PC inside the guitar received signals as soon as a string came in contact with a fret and the signal was sent through a special cable (the guitar was equipped with two outlets) to the Patch 2000-box. The Patch-2000 box was equipped with a pitch pedal that raises the pitch in semitone increments up to one full octave, a glide pedal that controls the portamento (the time it takes for the one note to change to another) and a Fifth Harmony Switch produces a tone seven semitones, or a natural 5th, above the note played. From the Patch-2000 box the signal was sent on to an analog synthesizer which turned the signal into musical tones. Synthesizers were not provided by the manufacturer. With the Patch 2000 in mind, the American synthesizer company Steiner-Parker developed and recently sold a small micro synthesizer without the keyboard, but with all the facilities of a "big" synthesizer.
The guitar was tried by a test-panel which included Mick Box (Uriah Heep) Bob Welch and John McView who said that "It had very clear solo sounds, but the fact is that you couldn´t use chords, which is an integral part of your music…you can only use it just for solos." The triggering system was monophonic, a polyphonic consumer model was never produced. He supposedly also claimed it was very convenient since you could play it using only your left hand, which allowed you to drink beer with your free hand. A total of 498 right hand models were produced from 1976 to 1979 (the vast majority to Leo's Music, Don Weir and Guitar Center in the Bay Area and LA. 11 left-handed models based on the Hagström Swede were manufactured in 1977. There were also a small run of Swede and Jazz basses equipped with the Patch 2000 system.

Associated Catholic Charities

Associated Catholic Charities is a nonprofit organization located in Baltimore, USA. Affiliated with the Archdiocese of Baltimore, it operates under the trade name, Catholic Charities of Baltimore, providing care for more than 160,000 people each year. It serves over a quarter million meals every year to the poor, and operates 80 charitable service programs in Baltimore City and Baltimore, Harford, Howard, Carroll, Anne Arundel, Frederick, Washington, and Garrett Counties of Maryland. The organization cares for children and families, people who are poor and disadvantaged, seniors, and those who have developmental disabilities. 
Mission.
Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Baltimore’s mission is to:
Services.
Catholic Charities provides services to people of all faiths:
The services provided include:
Donors.
87% of total expenditures went directly toward program services during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. Donations are important to the organization and account for 10% of operating income. 
Volunteers.
The agency has a permanent staff of about 2,000, but relies on more than 15,000 volunteers to provide services for more than 160,000 people. 
Geography.
Associated Catholic Charities provides services within the geographic boundaries of the Archdiocese of Baltimore–Baltimore City and Baltimore, Harford, Howard, Carroll, Anne Arundel, Frederick, Washington, and Garrett Counties of Maryland. Most donors, volunteers, employees and clients come from the same area, though some come from outside the Archdiocese.
History.
Catholic Charities began with the establishment of the Catholic Church in America. John Carroll, the first Bishop of Baltimore, declared in 1792 that one-third of all parish revenues should go to “the relief of the poor.”
In the mid-19th century, services focused on caring for orphaned immigrant children. The first program, St. Vincent’s Orphanage, opened in 1856. Over the next century, homes for such children were established by the Archdiocese, as Baltimore became the point of entry for more 19th century immigrants than any other U.S. city outside of New York.
In 1923, the Archdiocese incorporated all of the children’s orphanages under a new “Bureau of Catholic Charities” and the care of disadvantaged people became the mission of Catholic Charities, which continues today. Over the next century, the orphanage focus changed as the need for treating neglected and abused children and those with emotional disabilities became greater. As a result, St. Vincent’s Center and Villa Maria opened in Dulaney Valley in the 1960s.
Catholic Charities became innovators in developing programs for people with developmental disabilities through the establishment of the Francis X. Gallagher Center in the 1970s. Also located in Dulaney Valley, both the residential and day programs have grown and now have multiple locations.
In the following decade, the agency expanded to include programs for poor, homeless, and unemployed people. Our Daily Bread, a daily hot meal program, opened its doors in 1981 and has never missed a day of service since. Our Daily Bread has become Catholic Charities’ most well-known program, involving thousands of volunteers from around the region. These individuals respond by providing and serving the vast majority of the nearly quarter million meals each year. As the necessity arose, additional programs opened to serve the related needs of the homeless men (Christopher Place Employment Academy) and women (My Sister’s Place).
In the 1980s, Catholic Charities began evolving into one of Baltimore’s largest providers of services for seniors. The first of 18 independent living apartment communities for seniors, Basilica Place, opened in 1980. The agency transformed the Jenkins Memorial Home into what is today the Jenkins Senior Living Community, a campus that includes two independent senior living apartment buildings (St. Joachim House and DePaul House), St. Ann Adult Day Services, Caritas House Assisted Living, and St. Elizabeth Rehabilitation and Nursing Center.
In June 2007, Catholic Charities undertook its most ambitions effort to date with the opening of Our Daily Bread Employment Center. It is Baltimore’s resource center for people who need not only food, but assistance and guidance to achieve long-term employment and housing. An array of services in one location shifts the focus from primarily dining to achieving self-sufficiency.

Departure (The Moody Blues song)

"Departure" is a short 1968 song by the progressive rock band The Moody Blues. Written by drummer Graeme Edge, it was released on the album "In Search of the Lost Chord". The song itself is only 48 seconds long, making it one of their shortest songs.
"In Search of the Lost Chord" is a concept album about the search for spiritual fulfillment. "Departure" is the opening track and introduces the album's concept, basically leading the "departure" for the search. The lyrics are spoken rather than sung as it is presented in the form of a poem in the mode of the climactic "Late Lament" portion of the "Nights in White Satin" track on "Days of Future Passed", and they are recited by Graeme Edge, making it one of the very few Moody Blues songs to feature Edge on vocals, or, in this case, narration. 
The song begins with the strumming of a tambura, which is followed by Edge's vocal track over the mellotron. Those two sections are separated by hit of the drums. The vocals begin with a gentle recitation, which gradually gets louder until it becomes hysterical laughter. The end of the laughter then fades into "Ride My See-Saw", the album's next track.

Chronica Naierensis

The Chronica Naierensis or Crónica najerense (originally edited under the title "Crónica leonesa") was a late twelfth-century chronicle of universal history composed at the Benedictine monastery of Santa María la Real in Nájera. In Latin it narrates events from Creation to its own time, with a focus on the Bible, classical history, the Visigothic in Spain, and the kingdoms of Castile and León. It was an important model for later Spanish Latin historiographers, notably the "De rebus Hispaniae" of Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, the "Chronicon mundi" of Lucas de Tuy, and the "Estoria de España" of the patronage of Alfonso X of Castile. 
Besides its classical and Biblical authorities, the "Chronica Naierensis" relied heavily on material culled from the "cantares de gesta". The "Chronica" is not an original work in any rigorous sense, but rather a compilation. Its Visigothic history is based squarely on Isidore of Seville and its more recent Spanish history incorporates the "Corpus Pelagianum", a work supervised by Pelagius, Bishop of Oviedo, mid-century. The date of the "Chronica"'s completion was long dated to 1160, but the 1995 critical edition published by Juan Estévez Sola revised the "terminus post quem" to 1173, for it was not until that year that Pedro Coméstor finished his "Historia Scholastica", which the "Chronica" uses as a source. The "terminus ante quem" of the "Chronica" can be placed in 1194, the earliest date for the composition of the "Linage del Cid", which used it as a source. These dates make it contemporary with the "Historia Roderici", though the influence of the latter in the "Chronica" is evident.

Ship Ahoy (album)

Ship Ahoy is a rhythm and blues album by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays, released on November 10, 1973 on Philadelphia International Records. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching #1 on Billboard's "Black Albums" chart and #11 on the "Pop Albums" chart and launching two hit singles, "For the Love of Money" and "Put Your Hands Together." Conceived as a theme album built around the title track, "Ship Ahoy" includes socially relevant tracks and love songs under a cover that is itself notable for its serious subject matter. The album, which achieved RIAA platinum certification for over 1 million copies sold in 1992, has been reissued multiple times, including in a 2003 edition with a bonus track. "Ship Ahoy" was the highest selling R&B album on the Billboard Year-End chart for 1974.[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=%22O%Jays%22&format=Album&go=Search&perPage=25]
Songs and music.
The songs on "Ship Ahoy" balance the romantic with the politically and socially conscious. In its review of the 2003 re-issue, "Rolling Stone" noted that the album's "main achievement was proving that it was indeed possible to be thoughtful and articulate without losing your funk."
The album's lead single was "Put Your Hands Together," a song urging cooperation and optimistic prayer for "a better day to come." Rickey Vincent, author of "Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One", describes the song as "fairly standard musically", "with a strong gospel feel." The second single, "For the Love of Money," is a protest against materialism with a groove that "Rolling Stone" described as "downright orgiastic". The song was written around a bass line composed by Anthony Jackson, which in 2005 "Bass Player Magazine" described as "landmark." "Bass Player" went on to note that the song has "become one of the most recycled singles ever, sampled continually by rappers, and appearing on over 75 compilation CDs, numerous movie soundtracks, and, most recently, the theme for TV's "The Apprentice"."
The album's title song, "Ship Ahoy," was built around the theme of African captives being transported in a slave ship as part of the Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade. It had originally been penned by Gamble and Huff for inclusion in the soundtrack to "Shaft in Africa", but the producers decided instead to give it to the O'Jays as part of a concept album centered around slavery. The song brought in the sounds of waves and cracking whips to add immediacy to lyrics which, according to PopMatters, personalized "the 'voyage' in ways that few black popular artifacts had previously done so—some three years before the publication of Alex Haley's "". The book "A Change is Gonna Come: Music, Race and the Soul of America" notes that unlike the seminal work by Haley, "Ship Ahoy" is a hopeless, ominous song that offers "no sense that things are going to work out fine." In its 1974 review of the album, "The New York Times" characterized the song as "dark and occasionally spine-chilling." In 1993, "The Miami Herald" called it "a dark, atmospheric, frightening masterpiece that'll send a shiver up your spine."
In 1995, "The Los Angeles Times" dubbed "Ship Ahoy", along with the song "Don't Call Me Brother" as among "he cream of the vocal trio's angry music." "Don't Call Me Brother" is a nearly nine-minute long album track that protests hypocritical claims of racial unity from backstabbers.
Cover image.
The cover of the album depicted the band in a slave hold with illustrations of slaves. In its review, PopMatters commented that the use by producers Gamble and Huff of this imagery demonstrated not only their freedom as the heads of Philadelphia International Records, but also "how seriously the duo viewed popular music as a vehicle to 'teach and preach'." According to "The Greatest Album Covers of All Time", the production of such politically conscious imagery from a band known for its popular music "was enough to make even the most myopic of white music fans take note that something was changing." Illustrator James Barkley was otherwise better known for illustrating children's books and a postage stamp—a 1972 image of Mount McKinley, Alaska—along with commercial design and other nature paintings.
Reception.
Ship Ahoy reached #1 on Billboard's "Black Albums" chart and #11 on the "Pop Albums" chart and contained two hit singles, "For the Love of Money" (#3 "Black Singles", #9 "Pop Singles") and "Put Your Hands Together" (#2 "Black Singles", #10 "Pop Singles"). The album certified "Gold" by the RIAA on January 21, 1974 and "Platinum" on August 11, 1992.
In addition to its commercial success, the album was critically well-received. In a 1974 review, "The New York Times" described it as "fine recent album" representing producers "Gamble and Huff at their creative best". Allmusic describes the album in its review as "[the "other" O'Jays album masterpiece", with "shattering message tracks and stunning love songs".
Releases.
The album has been multiply reissued by Philadelphia International was well as Epic Records, Legacy Records, Columbia Records, Sony Records and Sis Records. In 2003, it was re-released by Sony and Epic with a bonus track, a live version of "Put Your Hands Together" recorded in London in 1974.
Track listing.
"All songs written by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, except where noted."

<doc id="18919567" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18919567" title="Valerie of Limoges">
Valerie of Limoges

St Valerie of Limoges (also "Valeria of Limoges") is a legendary Christian martyr and cephalophore, associated with the Roman period, whose cult was very important in Limousin, France, in the medieval period. She has been an important subject for Christian art since the middle ages and for porcelain figurines over several centuries.
Dating and hagiography.
The incident most insistently retold about St Valerie is that she was beheaded for her faith and then carried her own head to set before her bishop, Saint Martial, who had converted her. This firmly sets her in the Roman period, although Saint Martial himself has notoriously been moved by hagiographers among the first three centuries.
On the other hand, Valerie's legend is also retold with a Duke Stephen of Guyenne (Aquitaine) as her antagonist and executioner. According to this version, she was pressured to marry Duke Stephen, who was a pagan. For her refusal, he had her beheaded. This moves her into the medieval period, though precisely how it squares with her being a Christian in a pagan environment is unclear. Obviously the duke's name is Christian. There are neither recorded dukes of Aquitaine with that name nor any pagan dukes of Aquitaine.
Although she was considered the first martyr of Aquitaine, it is probably best to see Valerie as a legendary figure whose cult has nourished a certain amount of narrative elaboration, attracting narrative elements of varied, sometimes inconsistent, origins.
Parallels.
The most obvious parallels to the legendary figure of St. Valerie are those that manifest the distinctive trait of cephalophory. France is fairly rich in these, including most notably the capital's patron saint, Denis. The severed head that goes on preaching is a powerful assertion of autonomy, or perhaps theonomy in the face of persecution, with the bishop Denis continuing his work of prophecy and preaching. In St Valerie's case, the severed head is returned to where it belongs, the deceased person's bishop, pastor and confessor. In both cases there is a continuity in the relationship to the Church beyond death.
The more basic theme of decapitation widens the field of comparison greatly. An obvious source of parallels is the deuterocanonical book of Judith, in which we find a young woman pledging herself to virginity after seducing and decapitating a tyrannical enemy of the faith, and presenting his head to her countrymen. The mythemes are differently configured, but there seem to be a similar underlying concerns in which the faith community is threatened by both persecution and exogamy.
The most obvious parallels are perhaps with the Biblical and post-Biblical narrative of John the Baptist. Here we find not only a beheading, but a problematic marriage (with suggestions of incest rather than exogamy), defiant denunciation of tyranny, a centrally-important young woman and presentation of the head to a third party. Here, however, the threat to the faith community seems to come from inside. The thematic parallel, nevertheless, was strong enough for the builders to back St Valerie's shrine in St Michel des Lions with a fine stained glass window depicting John the Baptist.
Cult.
St Valerie was venerated alongside Martial and her alleged remains buried alongside his at the Abbey of St Martial, in the city of Limoges. The original shrine was destroyed in a fire in the mid-10th century and a new building erected. The reputed tomb of St Valerie under this building was among those uncovered in excavations under the Place de la République, Limoges, in 1960–62. 
Around 985 at least part of the relics was transferred to the Benedictine abbey at Chambon-sur-Voueize, to the north-east of Limoges, which became a centre of her cult. A large 15th-century painting of her martyrdom and a reliquary bust remain important centres of attention in the abbey. Images of the martyrdom became an important theme of Limousin art, both painting and sculpture, and later Limoges enamels.
After the destruction of the abbey at Limoges, the remaining relics of St Valerie were gathered together and installed alongside those of St Martial and St Loup of Limoges, in the Church of St Michel des Lions, in the commercial heart of Limoges.

Kyle Arrington

Kyle Chandler Arrington (born August 12, 1986) is an American football cornerback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football at Hofstra. Arrington also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Early years.
Arrington was born in Accokeek, Maryland. He attended Gwynn Park High School, where he played football as a defensive back and kick returner, as well as basketball and track and field. He was a second-team all-county selection in football.
College career.
After graduating from high school, Arrington attended Hofstra University beginning in 2004. As a freshman, he played in seven games, recording three tackles. He started seven of the ten games he played as a sophomore, picking up 21 tackles and one forced fumble. In 2006, he played in 11 games, recording 69 tackles and an interception. In 2007, he played in 11 games again, recording 53 tackles and an interception. Arrington is one of Hofstra's last football players to make in to the NFL, as the school cut its program in 2009 due to costs and declining interest.
Professional career.
Philadelphia Eagles.
Arrington was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent following the 2008 NFL Draft. He was waived by the Eagles on August 30 and re-signed to the team's practice squad a day later. He was released from the practice squad on September 10.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Arrington was signed to the practice squad of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 17, 2008, where he spent the remainder of the season before being re-signed to a future contract after the season. He was waived by the Buccaneers on September 5, 2009 during final cuts and re-signed to the team's practice squad the next day. He was elevated to the 53-man roster on September 10, playing in the Buccaneers' season opener. He was waived by the team the next day.
New England Patriots.
He currently plays and starts for the New England Patriots. Arrington was added to the Patriots practice squad and ultimately promoted to their 53-man roster on November 8, 2009 after Cleveland Browns' head coach Eric Mangini made an attempt to sign Arrington to his roster.
In 2010, Arrington earned the starting cornerback job after Week 2, and kept that role for the rest of the season. He finished that year with one interception, which he returned 36 yards for a touchdown against the Packers. Arrington also scored on a return of a blocked field goal against the Dolphins in Week 4.
In 2011, he began the season as the nickel corner, since cornerback Leigh Bodden had returned from the injured reserve list, but regained the starting role early in the season. He led the NFL with 7 interceptions for the 2011 season.
In 2013, Arrington will stay with the Patriots after agreeing in principle on a four-year deal.
Personal life.
On March 17, 2012, Arrington married his girlfriend, Vashonda Murphy. They had their first child, Kyle Chandler Arrington Jr, almost exactly a year later, on March 16, 2013.

Whereas the Japanese concept of "haragei" denotes a deliberate form of non-verbal communication, "ishin-denshin" refers to a passive form of shared understanding. "Ishin-denshin" is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as sincere, silent communication via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, "uchi"), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, "soto"), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities. Such concepts are related to the traditions of Zen, where the term "ishin-denshin" refers to direct mind transmission.
"Ishin-denshin" continues to influence many aspects of contemporary culture, ranging from business practices to end-of-life care. Research supports the view that Ishin-denshin is a mechanism for norm regulation that does not rely on explicit information exchange or costly reinforcement, but rather on the sensitivity of group members to social cues in their environment which can signal a threat to one’s inclusionary status in the group and (as in Japan) motivate people to shift their attitudes to be in line with group social norms.
Western need for clarity in interpersonal communication are often described as repellent by Japanese people who believe themselves more accustomed to "ishin-denshin" and implicit rather than explicit forms of understanding.

Anzov Yardımılı rayonunun böyük kəndlərindən biridir. Əhalsi 1000 nəfərdən artıqdır. Anzov kəndini tarixi 400 ildən artıqdır, yəni ilk məskunlaşma 400 il bundan əvvələ təsadüf edir. Kənddə İlk məskunlaşan QILINCXAn olmuşdur. O, buraya İranın KƏLƏNSURA kəndindən gəlmişdir. İlk məskunlaşma Həsən Kərimim adıyla əlaqələndirilsə də, Həsən Kərim Qılıncxanın oğlu olmuşdur. Görünür, Qılıncxanın yaşı cox olduğundan o, burada çox ömür sürə bilməmiş və sonradan kənddə məskunlaşanlar Həsən Kərimi burada görmüş və onu buranın ilk insanı sanmışlar.
Kəndin ümumi ərazisi genişddir. Anzov sözünün mənasını talış dilinin sözü hesab edənlər olsa da, belə burada tarix boyu talış yaşamamıdır. Əslində ANZOV sözü Türk dilindən tərcümədə XANSOYLU, XANNƏSİLLİ deməkdir.

Coğrafiyası və iqlimi[redaktə]
Anzov kəndi Talış silsilə dağlarının qərb qurtaracağında, maili dağ yamaclarının ətəyində yerləşir. Kənd ərazisi şimal tərəfdən Qaraçay, cənubdan təxminən 3 km uzunluğunda gədiklə əhatə olunub. Şərqdən Hamarkənd kəndi, qərbdən isə Seyidlər və Osnaqaran kəndi ilə həmsərhəddir.
Kəndin iqlimi Yardımlıya və cənub bölgəsinin dağlıq hissəsinə məxsus sərt kontinental iqlimə uyğundur. Ərazi üçün demək olar ki,bütün fəsillər xarakterikdir. Burada payız və qış fəsillərinin iqlimi Naxçıvanın quru və sərt iqliminə oxşayır. Bu iqlimsə Türkiyənin, hətta Yunanıstanın cənubundakı ərazilərin iqliminə bənzəyir. Burada yayda orta temperatur 20-24 dərəcə Selsi, qış aylarında isə orta temperatur 3-5 dərəcə Selsidir. İllik yağıntının miqdarı 300– 700 mm-dir.
Ərazi region üçün xarakterik olan Talış seysmik zonasına daxildir. Tez-tez qeyd olunan xırda təkanlarla bərabər ərazidə dağıdıcı gücə malik zəlzələlər də özünü göstərmişdir. Belə zəlzələlərdən biri ümumilikdə rayon ərazisi daxil olmaqla 1998-ci ilin iyul ayının 9-da, saat 19_23-də Bakıdan 240 km cənubda, Talış dağlarında 6,5 bal gücündə özünü göstərmişdir. Bu, Yardımlı tarixində misli görünməmiş hadisə olmuşdur. Bütün kəndlər də daxil olmaqla rayon üzrə 10 şəxsi ev tamam uçmuş, 265 ev qəza vəziyyətinə düşmüş, 1100 ev ciddi, 1500 ev isə qismən zədə almışdır. Sosial obyektlərə də külli miqdarda ziyan dəymişdir. 62 təhsil, 10 səhiyyə obyekti, 9 mədəniyyət müəssisəsi, digər ictimai binalar zədələnmişdir.
İlk əvvəllər kəndin torpaq ehtiyatı geniş əraziləri əhatə etmişdir. Əhaliyə məxsus olan torpaq sahəsi təxminən 400 hektara yaxın olmuş, kolxozlaşma dövründə isə bu ərazi 360 hektar civarında qalmışdır. Coğrafi şəraitə görə kəndin mərkəzi hissəsi ərazinin quzey hissəsində yerləşmişdir. Təxminən 250-300 il bundan qabaq kənd əhalisinin əksəriyyətinin maldarlıqla, o cümlədən qoyunçuluqla məşğul olduğdnu nəzərə alsaq görərik ki, kəndin geniş otlaq sahələrinin olması, ərazinin iki çayın arasındakı ərazidə yerləşməsi (şimaldan Qaraçay, cənubdan Zenqaran çayı), ərazinin təbii-coğrafi şəraiti, eyni zamanda əkinçilik üçün münbit torpaqların, bol sulu bulaqların olması kənd əhalisinin məhz bu ərazidə məskunlaşmasında əsas stimul rolunu oynamışdır. Otlaq sahələrinin əksər hissəsi güney hissədə yerləşir. Burada ilk sakinlərin çoxillik təcrübələrinə əsaslanan əməli iş – qoyun yatağının, yəni Qışlaq adlı sahədə qış qoyun yatağının salınması çox diqqətə layiqdir. Belə ki, həm şərqdən, həm də qərbdən bu sahə yüksələn təpə yamacları ilə əhatə olnub.Təpələr yatağı soyuq küləklərdən qoruyur. Yatağın ətrafında suvarma şəbəkəsi üçün 2 bol sulu bulaq, meşə sahəsi və geniş otlaq sahəsi vardır.
Kəndin digər torpaqları ərazinin şərq hissəsində güneybasarda yerləşən piramida şəkilli ərazidən, Ban diki, Pojalar, Yaz yurdu, Percon, Tülcon, Gənci yatağı, İmam yeri, Yol Əli, Söyüdbulaq, Gədik, kənd ərazisindəki Xırdalar, Çolakəş, Ləjon, Mkomon, Əyri ulas, Əliməmməd ölən poja sahələrindən ibarətdir. Bu torpaqlar müvafiq olaraq Osnaqaran, Bozayran, Bürzünbül, Hamarkənd və Zenqaran kəndləri ilə həmsərhəddir.
Kəndin yay otlaqları – yəni elat heyvandarlıq sahələri isə daha böyük əraziləri əhatə edir. Bu yaylaqların hamısı kəndin cənubundadır. Tarixlər şahidi Haça yurd, Halavar daşı, Dib yurd, Vənəköç, Soyuqbulaq, Balaxan yurdu, Güney və Quzey üstə kolat, Sarıbulaq, Əmbüs, Tiy daş, Aslan yurdu, Çəktə, Xuaxıl (Şahbazəli bəyin payız oturacağı), Ağasən yurdu, Bəbir yurdu, Qoyunyatan dərə, Çur-çur və Yuvagah yaylaqlarıdır. Haça yurd yaylağındakı Xoca Döngə dəniz səviyyəsindən 2230 metr hündürlükdə yerləşir.
Kənddə ta qədimdən bir neçə bol sulu bulaq olmuşdur. Bu bulaqlardan biri kəndin şərq hissəsini su ilə təmin edən Böyük bulaqdır. Kəndin bu his – səsi mal-qaranın suvarilmasında, qab-qacaq və pal-paltarın yuylmasında, eyni zamanda indiki qlobal istiləşmədə içməli su ehtiyacının ödənilməsində bu bulaqdan istifadə edir.Ta qədimdən nənələrimiz – Anaxanım nənə, Söhbi nənə ,Qərib nənə, Güllü nənə, Nəsi nənə, Əfruz, Sona, Gülsümə nənə nehrəyə atmaq üçün suyu Böyük bulaqdan götürüblər.
Kəndin mərkəzi hissəsi isə içməli suya olan tələbatını Musa bulağının hesabına ödəyiblər. Sifay nənə, Meyxanım nənə, Balanaz nənə, Sitay nənə, Teyiş, Balqız, Vəsi nənə, Bibixanım nənə, Zərnişan nənə, Xurma nənə nehrə suyunu bu bulaqdan götürüblər.
Kəndin qərb hissəsi isə daha çox Yolçu bulağı və Ləjon bulağından istifadə ediblər. Söhbi nənə, Həlimə nənə, Qərəqız nənə, Gülqız nənə, Narıngül nənə içməli su, nehrə suyunu bu bulaqdan götürüblər.
Kəndin bir hissısi isə Drosun bulağından istifadə ediblər. Paki, Xanbacı, Sanay nənə, Bəstigül nənə, İstifa nənə bu bulaqdan nehrə suyu, içməli su və qab-qacağın yuyulmasında istifadə ediblər. Sadalanan insanların demək olar ki, hamısı haqq dünyasına qovuşublar. Behiştlik olsunlar!
Sadalanan bulaqlardan başqa kəndin örüş-otlaq və biçənək sahələrində Daşbulaq, Söyüdbulaq, Percon bulağı, Liməpoja bulağı, Xosu lingi bulaqlarından yayda dəryaz çalınarkən, ot yığılarkən əhali içir, yuyunur, ətrafında dincəlirlər.
Kəndətrafı meşə zolağında Qarabulaq (kükürdlü su), Kəndəlaşbulaq, Batdaq bulaq (Batdaqlı göl də deyirlər), İsti su (müalicəvi əhəmiyyətlidir), Çinarbulaq, Şahverdi bulağı, yaylaqlardakı büllur kimi şəffaf, diş göynədən Soyuqbulaq, Çur-çur bilağı, Daş bulaq dillər əzbəri olmuşdur. İsti yay günlərində isti hava nəfəsləri təngidəndə kənd camaatı, kəndə gələn qonaqlar bu bulaqlardan içib sərinlənir, üstündə dincəlirlər.
Bundan başqa ərazi müalicəvi əhəmiyyətli suları (kükürdlü su) ilə də zəngindir. Ümumiyyətlə, ərazi bol sulu olması ilə fərqlənir. Belə ki, kənddə xırda və böyük bulaqlarla yanaşı 25-dən artıq, ətraf ərazilərdə isə 20-yə yaxın bulaq (şirin sulu ) vardır.
Son vaxtlarda isə əhali kəndin təxminən 3 km, cənub hissəsindən keçən Zenqaran çayından rezin borular vasitəsilə su çəkib. İndi demək olar ki,hər qapıda diş göynədən çay suyu axır.
Anzov əhalsinin əsas məşğuliyyəti üçün oturaq maldarlıq xarakterik olmuşdur. Əhalinin bir qismi oturaq (əkinçilik, sənətkar - lıq), başqa bir qismi isə heyvandarlıq, əsasən də qoyunçuluqla məşğul olmuşdur. Havalar istiləşəndə, yazın gəlişi ilə kənd camaatının yaylağa köçü başlanır, yenə yurd yerləri – Sarıbulaq, Əmbüs, Haça yurd, Qoyunyatan dərə, Tiy daş, Vənəköç, Çəktə alaçıqlarla bəzənərdi. Yenə də obadakılar mal-qaranı, qoyun-quzunu otlaqlara haraylar, dağların səsli-küylü cah-cəlalı başlar, yastı- yastı qayalar çobanların “yastığına” çevrilərdi. Yaylaq maldarlıgı əvvəlki gümrahlığı ilə olmasa da indinin özündə yenə də davam edir.
Anzov ərazisi flora və faunası ilə zəngin bir areala malikdir. Flora və faunası rayonun bütün əraziləri üçün xarakterikdir. Torpaq örtüyü kənd ətra- fındakı ərazilərdə əsasən boz-qonur və gilli torpaqlar, yaylaq və meşələrdəki torpaqlar isə çəmən, meşə-qonur və qara torpaqlardan ibarətdir. Kənd ərazisi bitki örtüyü ilə çox zəngindir. Kənd arası və meşə-yaylaq torpaqlarında min bir dərdin dərmanı olan müxtəlif bitkilər vardır. Bu gün əczaçılqd, həm də müasir xalq təbiətində geniş istifadə olnan gülxətmi, çaytikanı, batbat, dəvədabanı, bulaqotu, yarpız, bağayarpağı, gicitkən, quşəppəyi, cincilim, dağ keşnişi,(istiot), yabanı sogan ( aybə, vəcələ), baldırğan, kəkotu, sancıgülü, sarıçiçək,( romaşka), ayıdöşəyi, turşəng və başqaları, kol bitkilərindən itburnu, ardıc, zəriş, yemişan, əzgil, cır armud, alma və onlarla digər dərman bitkiləri bu ərazinin florasının bəzəyidir. Uzun müddət yaylağa köç edən adamlar, qoyunçuluq və maldarlıqla məşğul olanlar elə bitkilər tanıyırdılar ki, bu bitkilər vasitəsilə südü qıcqırdıb qatığa və ya maya əvəzində südü pendirə çevirmək mümkün idi.
Meşələr üçün yuxarıda sadalanan bitkilərdən başqa endemik və relikt bitkilər xarakterikdir. Endemik bitkilərdən şabalıdıyarpaq palıd (dialektdə uruq), Qarağac, Göyrüş( vən), Azat (nil ), həmişəyaşıl, Zərgent adıyla xalq arasında tanınan kol bitkisi və yarpaqlarının uc hissısi tikanlı burket, Vələs, qızılağac, dağdağan, məxməryarpaqlı ağcaqayın, xan çinarı, cökə, həmişəyaşıl iynəyar -paqlı ardıc, gəvən, iynəyarpaqlı qaraçöhrə, amburçəy və başqa ağaclar meşələrin göz oxşayan bəzəyi, elin qiymətsiz sərvətidir.
Ərazinin faunası da çox zəngindir.Belə ki, ərazidə keçmişdə ceyran, pələng, ayı, dağ keçisi Tura təsadüf olunmuşdur. Sonralar təbii istifadə ilə əlaqədar olaraq meşələr seyrəldikcə bunların nəsli kəsilmişdir.İndinin özün də isə heyvanlar aləmi rayonun bütün ərazisi üçün xas olan səciyyədədir. Çöllərdə və meşə zolaqlarında canavar, tülkü, dovşan, çaqqal, oxlu çaqqal, dələ, sincab, yenot, kirpi, qonur ayı (nəsli kəsilmək üzrədir ), porsuq, vaşaq, ayaqlı və ayaqsız kərtənkələ, ilanlardan yelmar, gürzə, amfibilərdən (suda-quruda yaşa – yanlardan) adi triton, ağac və su qurbağası, su hövzələrində zəli, xərçəng (qırxayaq), qaya və daşlıq, ərazilərdə əqrəblər, quşlardan “Qırmızı kitab”a adı düşən kəklik, qırqovul, alabaxta, bildirçin, alacəhrə, qaratoyuq, sığırçın, qara və ala qarğa, sağsağan, yarasa, bayquş və başqa heyvanlar yaşamaqdadır.
Kəndin qərbindəki Çinarbulaq adlı ərazidəki çinar ağacı özünəməx –susluğu ilə seçlir. Belə çinar ağacına eyni bir düz xətt boyunca rayonun ətraf ərazilərində, o cümlədən Ökü kəndində, Urakəran, Zenqaran, Solqard ərazilərində rast gəlinir. Maraqlı burasıdır ki, bu çinarlar çoxalmır, başqa yerlərdə təsadüf olunmur. Hamısı da bol sulu bulaqların üstündədir. Çinarların ətrafında qədim yaşayış məskəni olmuşdur. Belə ki, Çinarbulağın ətraf ərazisi böyük bir qədim qəbristanlıqdır. Xalq arasında bu çinarlar haqqında ikili fikir dolaşmaqdadır: Bəziləri deyir ki, bu çinarlar ərazidən keçən mühüm tranzit ticarət və karvan yolunun göstəricisidir. Başqa bir qisim isə bu çinarların Səfəvilər dövründə (daha dəqiq I Şah Abbas dövründə(1587-1629)) dövlət sərhəddini bildirmək üçün əkildiyini iddia edir. Və bu çinarlara Xan çinarı deyirlər. Hər halda bizə elə gəlir ki, ikinci versiya həqiqətə daha çox uyğundur. Bu ağaca əhali arasında müqəddəs ağac kimi baxırlar. Onun qorunmasına xüsusi fikir verirlər. Son vaxtlar ətrafı qırıldığıdan bu çinar ağacı daha da əzəmətli görünür. Kölgəsində yerləşən, rişələrindən süzülüb çıxan su isə içməliliyi, şirinliyi və özünəməxsusluğu ilə seçilir.
Göründüyü kimi bölgənin özünəməxsus flora və faunası vardır.

Luscombe Phantom

The Luscombe Phantom was a 1930s American two-seat cabin monoplane and the first product of the Luscombe Aircraft Engineering Company. 
Design and development.
Donald A. Luscombe formed the Luscombe Aircraft Engineering Company in 1933 at Kansas City, Missouri. The Phantom or Model 1 was the first aircraft built by the company, and first flew in 1934. It was a high-wing braced monoplane with conventional fixed tail-wheel landing gear, and was powered by a nose-mounted 145 hp (108 kW) Warner Super Scarab radial engine. The fully enclosed engine cowling, with individual air vents for each cylnder, was unique for a radial engine aircraft. Apart from the fabric wing surfaces, the aircraft was all-metal, and had a luxury interior with two side-by-side seats in an enclosed cabin. All compound curves were formed by one employee, Nick Nordyke. As a luxury aircraft, it failed to sell in the economical climate of 1930s America, and the company went on to develop cheaper and simpler aircraft.

List of Ottoman governors of Egypt

The Ottoman Empire's governors of Egypt from 1517 to 1805 were at various times known by different but synonymous titles, among them beylerbey, viceroy, governor, governor-general, or, more generally, wāli. Furthermore, the Ottoman sultans very often changed positions of their governors in rapid succession, leading to complex and long lists of incumbents (this being the main reason for a political crisis in 1623, where the local Ottoman soldiers successfully sued to keep Kara Mustafa Pasha as governor after his replacement by Çeşteci Ali Pasha after only one year).
Governors ruled from the Cairo Citadel in Cairo. They ruled along with their divan (governmental council), consisting of a kadı (judge) and defterdar (finance minister). The title "beylerbey" refers to the regular governors specifically appointed to the post by the Ottoman sultan, while the title "kaymakam," when used in the context of Ottoman Egypt, refers to an acting governor who ruled over the province between the departure of the previous governor and the arrival of the next one. Although almost all governors were succeeded and preceded by a kaymakam due to the traveling distance from their old post to Egypt, only the most notable are included in this list.
Below is a list of Ottoman "wālis" of Egypt (then the Egypt Eyalet) from 1517 (the Ottoman conquest of Egypt) to 1805 (the beginning of the Muhammad Ali dynasty; see List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty). Acting governors (kaymakams) are not included in the numbering.

Randy Blumer

Randy Blumer, born in Edmonton, Alberta on October 21, 1958 is widely acknowledged as having started the multibillion dollar online poker industry with the launch of Planet Poker, the world's first real money online poker room on January 1, 1998.
Early life.
Randy Blumer was the younger of two boys. In 1970, the family moved to Europe when Randy’s father, Carl, got the opportunity to work as a school counselor on a 2 year exchange in Germany. Randy started playing poker in Germany in Grade 6 while traveling on road trips with the peewee all-star hockey team frequently returning from trips with additional pocket money gained from playing poker.
Randy made his first trip to Las Vegas when he turned 21 and was exposed to a “new” form of poker (limit Texas hold 'em) in both cash game and tournament format. Upon his return to Edmonton he introduced the game to his poker playing buddies. Throughout his time at university, Randy supplemented his student income by wagering in a variety of formats. Poker was his preferred pastime as it offered both an intellectual challenge and significant financial opportunity.
Randy graduated from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering (1983) and found employment as a Marine Systems Engineer in the Canadian Navy. After graduating and finding employment, marriage became the next priority. Randy married Bev in Victoria BC on July 26, 1985.
His engineering background was used for the majority of his naval career working in Canada’s largest ever warship construction program. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander before accepting an early retirement offer with the intent to make his fortune in online poker.
Poker career.
Randy started Planet Poker in the summer of 1997. It became the first online real money cardroom when it converted from a free play site to a real money site on 1 Jan 1998. Mike Caro and Roy Cooke both joined the Planet team in 1999 to provide their expertise in promoting Planet Poker. He subsequently acted as a poker consultant to several other online casinos and cardrooms. His second place finish in a field of over 6000 players in 2007 in the PokerStars million was his biggest poker payday to date. Despite all of his successes in the poker arena, Randy is strictly an amateur player. He has played poker at various venues in England, Ireland, France, Canada, the US and the Caribbean.
Planet Poker has reverted to “play for fun” status in response to changes in the legal status regarding real money online poker introduced in 2006 by the United States. Randy also launched Skillride.com in 2007, the internet’s first play for fun subscription based poker site to fully comply with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.
He remains married to Beverly and is the father to two boys (Matthew and Zachary).
