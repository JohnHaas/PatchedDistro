Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings

The Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings, also known as the Monroe Block, is a historic district located along a block-and-a-half stretch at 16-118 Monroe Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, just off Woodward Avenue at the northern end of Campus Martius. The district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The thirteen original buildings were built between 1852 and 1911 and ranged from two to five stories in height. The National Theatre, built in 1911, is the oldest surviving theatre in Detroit, a part of the city's original theatre district of the late 19th century, and the sole surviving structure from the original Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings of the Antebellum period.
History and significance.
The early buildings on the block were constructed in Victorian commercial style, designed by architects such as Sheldon and Mortimer Smith during the mid-to-late 19th century. The Johnson block, in particular, constituted what was at the time one of the last remaining blocks of pre-Civil War buildings in Detroit. In the nearby Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District, the building at 1244 Randolph St. is a rare survivor from the 1840s. The Victorian styled Odd Fellows Building (1874) is located at the corner of Randolph and Monroe.
The Monroe buildings were occupied by numerous short-term tenants through the years, including grocers, confectioners, and saloons. In the early 20th century, a wave of European immigration brought jewelry shops, pawn shops, and tailors to the area.
At around the same time, the Campus Martius area was developing into the entertainment center of Detroit. The Detroit Opera House, then located on the north side of the Campus across Monroe Avenue from the buildings in this district, anchored the area, and, in 1901, the Wonderland vaudeville theatre moved next door.
The early 20th century was the dawn of the movie age, and in Detroit it began on Monroe Avenue. The first movie theater in Detroit, the Casino, was opened on Monroe Avenue in 1906 by John H. Kunsky. It was reputedly the second movie theatre in the world, and it propelled Kunsky to a 20-theatre empire worth $7 million in 1929. Later in 1906, Detroit's second movie theatre, the Bijou, opened literally two doors down from the Casino. These were the first of a string of theaters along this section of Monroe; three new movie theatre buildings were constructed in the area in the next five years: the Star (1907), designed by Frank G. Baxter and Henry A. O'Dell; the Columbia (1911), designed by the noted theatre architect C. Howard Crane; and the National Theater (1911), the only theatre designed by Albert Kahn. In addition, the Family Theater opened in 1914 in an older building in the district. Other nearby theaters included the Temple Theater at Woodward Avenue across Monroe, the Liberty (located behind the Star), and the Palace at 130-132 Monroe.
In the 1920s, the Detroit cinema hub centered around Grand Circus Park, with nearby Monroe Avenue receiving less attention. 
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. In early 1990, most of the aging structures were cleared away, leaving only the National Theater as a reminder of the history of the area.
Structures.
The buildings that once stood in this site were a mix of pre- and post-Civil War architecture, along with a group of movie theaters from the early 20th century. 
Second Williams Block (16-30 Monroe Avenue).
John Constantine Williams, a member of one of Detroit's wealthiest mid-19th centiry families and son of John R. Williams, built this structure in 1872-73, directly adjacent to his earlier structure (the first Williams block) at 32-42 Monroe. Architect Mortimer L. Smith designed the building. The building originally served as an office building, with storefronts on the ground floor. In 1880, the upper floors of the building were converted into the Kirkwood Hotel, which survived for a decade under various management. The lower floors remained commercial space. The building reverted to office space in the 1890s, then reopened as the Hotel Campus (later the Hotel Fowler) in 1901.
In 1909, most of the building was completely gutted and converted into the 934-seat Family Theater; the Family was converted to show movies in 1914. The Family stayed open through much of the century, and was renamed the Follies in 1967. Six years later, in 1973, the Follies burned to the ground. The Follies section of the building (including four of the seven bay Williams Block) was demolished soon thereafter, leaving only the three western-most commercial and retail spaces. In the late 1970s the city vacated the property, and the remainder was demolished in early 1990.
The second Williams Block was five stories tall, divided into bays containing three windows per floor; each floor had slightly different window shapes. The building was constructed of brick, sheathed on the front with sandstone. A cast iron cornice and flat roof topped the structure. Belt courses were located above and below windows, and additional decoration consisted of bas relief carvings and cast iron entabulatures.

First Williams Block (32-42 Monroe Avenue).
The first Williams block was built by John Constantine Williams in 1859, and was designed by architect Sheldon Smith. The building was originally used as an office building with commercial space on the first floor. In the late 1880s, the building was converted into a 52-room hotel, known first as the Stanwix, then as Gies' European hotel, with a restaurant on the first floor. In 1909, the hotel and restaurant was renamed the Berghoff, then the Tuxedo, and, in 1919, the Frontenac. The Hotel Berghoff was owned by Wm. D. C. Moebs & Co. who were also the proprieters of the adjoining Berghoff Cafe. In December 1913 Wm. D.C. Moebs opened the Cafe Frontenac next to the Hotel Berghoff. In 1918 the name of the hotel was changed to the Tuxedo Hotel and Grill still under the same owners. The name change was short lived because in 1919 the businesses were called the Frontenac Restaurant and the Frontenac Hotel Company still under the ownership of Wm. D.C. Moebs, President. The Frontenac Hotel remained in business through 1960. Wm. D.C. Moebs died November 16, 1921 and the once grand Frontenac Restaurant was sold to pay back taxes in 1923. By 1940, the restaurant had been replaced again with retail space, which remained in the building until the city of Detroit vacated the property in 1978. The building was demolished in early 1990.
The first Williams block was five stories tall, constructed of red brick with a flat roof, and measured 60 feet by 100 feet. The Monroe Avenue facade was separated into three bays, each with three windows. Brick was used decoratively on the facade, and cast iron crowns over the windows and column capitals accented the elevation. The original cast iron cornice was removed in 1942.

Columbia Theater (50 Monroe).
The Columbia Theater was built in 1911 for John H. Kunsky, and designed by C. Howard Crane to seat over 1000 people. When built, the theater had its own pipe organ and house orchestra. The Columbia was closed in 1956, and has since been demolished.
<br clear = "all">
Johnson Block (52-54, 58, 62, 66-68, and 70-72 Monroe Avenue).
Hiram R. Johnson purchased land along Monroe in 1852 and constructed a series of commercial buildings collectively known as the "Johnson Block." These buildings are the five located at 52-54, 58, 62, 66-68, and 70-72 Monroe Avenue.
All five buildings were constructed of brick and stood four stories tall, and were designed in a similar fashion. The first four (52-54, 58, 62, 66-68 Monroe) measured 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, with three windows per story on the upper levels. The last building (70-72 Monroe) measured 30 feet wide and 100 feet deep, and was divided into two bays with two windows per bay on each story. Windows in all buildings were rectangular in shape with cast iron lintels featuring a scroll and urn motif. The buildings originally had a cornice at the top; these were removed in the 20th century, most in 1958. The buildings were demolished in early 1990.
Two of these five buildings were instrumental in the establishment of the movie theater business in Detroit. In 1905, William H Klatt opened a cent-odeon (similar to the nickelodeon) in a former furniture store at 62 Monroe. The next year, John H. Kunsky opened the first true movie house in Detroit, the Casino Theater, two doors away at 70-72 Monroe. Klatt quickly converted the Bijou into Detroit's second movie house and reopened it later in 1906 as "The Bijou." The building remained a movie house for the next seventy years, changing its name to "The New Bijou" in 1918. In 1966, the New Bijou became "The Cinex," an adult movie venue; it closed in 1978. Kunsky's Casino Theater, however, closed in 1915; later tenants in the space at 70-72 Monroe included the Famous Barrel Bar and Father and Son Shoes.
Tenants of the other Johnson Block buildings were primarily small commercial establishments and eateries. The tenants of 52-54 Monroe included a series of saloons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a soft drink shop/restaurant from 1913–1928, and a series of clothing and shoe stores until the 1970s, when the building was vacated. 58 Monroe had a series of tenants, including a jewellery store at the turn of the 20th century, followed by a lunch counter, pawn broker, clothing store, and another jewellery store. The building at 66-68 Monroe housed an umbrella factory from 1888–1912, then a pawnbroker, shoe repair shop, men's clothiers, and a bookstore.
74-78 Monroe Avenue.
The building at 74-78 Monroe was constructed in approximately 1852, fronting on both Monroe Avenue and Farmer Street. At the turn of the 20th century, a restaurant and saloon inhabited the first floor. Later tenants included a tailor, cigar store, and shoe stores. A barber shop operated continuously in the building from 1915 until the late 1970s, and a second-floor dentist's office existed from the 1920s through the late 1970s. The building was demolished in early 1990.
The building was originally virtually identical to the structure next door at 70-72 Monroe, including the cast iron lintels featuring an urn and scroll. The building was, however, set back four additional feet from Monroe Avenue. The building was four stories tall and constructed of red brick. Both the Monroe Avenue and Farmer Street facades had tall narrow windows with a combination of segmental and fully arched window tops, dcorated with projecting brick.
<br clear = "all">
Star (Royal) Theater (100-102 Monroe Avenue).
This structure was built in 1907 as the Star Theater; it was designed by Frank G. Baxter and Henry A. O'Dell. The Star operated for only a year; in 1908 the theater changed into the Theatre Royale, and in 1912 it changed to the Royal Theater. The Royal closed in 1922. Afterward, a variety of retail establishments were housed in the building, including a cigar store, jewelers, shoe store, tailor, and barber. The building was demolished in early 1990.
The Star was a four-story building, measuring 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, constructed of red brick, with yellow brick veneer. A large arched window on the Monroe facade fills the third and fourth stories. This facade originally had a thick cornice supported by scrolled brackets, and a decorative arch above the entrance. Seven rectangular windows per story are on the Farmer elevation. The theater space originally took up both the first and most of the second stories, and thus there was only a single window on the second floor at the rear. However, in 1922 after the closure of the Royal, the second story was extended all the way forward to the Monroe facade, adding windows along the Farmer elevation.
<br clear = "all">
104-106 Monroe Avenue.
The building at 104-106 Monroe was constructed in approximately 1900. A saloon was the first tenant, followed by a tea store. For most of the life of the building, until it was vacated in the 1970s, ground-floor tenants included a lunch room and a clothing or shoe store. The building was demolished in early 1990.
The structure is four stories tall, 20 feet wide and 60 feet deep. The building originally had modest Italianate elements. However, the front facade was reworked in 1923, with the addition of white brick facing and alteration of the windows to large plates of glass.
The front facade of the National is dominated by an enormous arch flanked with twin towers and covered with white and blue terra cotta tiles. The facade has hundreds of lightbulbs built in, which accentuate the architectural features when lit. The National Theater is an outstanding example of Modernistic design, boasting a pair of terra cotta latticework towers, arched art glass windows, and colored Pewabic tiles on the facade.

A Jolly Good Fellow (novel)

A Jolly Good Fellow (2008) is a novel by American author Stephen V. Masse.
Plot introduction.
A fake charity Santa Claus plots to kidnap the eleven-year-old son of a State Representative, but the plot goes topsy-turvy when the boy decides to run away from home by hitchhiking.
Plot summary.
Two weeks before Christmas in Boston, Duncan Wagner, a lone down-and-outer who has been 
living in self-imposed exile for several years, kidnaps Gabriel Booker, the eleven-year-old
son of State Representative Winthrop Booker. Wagner takes the child to his apartment and 
ties him to a chair in front of the television, then leaves for work as a self-employed 
charity Santa Claus. When Wagner returns to his apartment, Gabriel is no longer in the 
chair. Thinking the boy has fled, Wagner goes into his room and finds him sleeping on the 
bed.
In spite of a lingering edginess, the two grow more cordial toward each other. Wagner 
locks Gabriel’s ankle to a long chain to make sure he doesn’t run away. Gabriel hounds 
Wagner to supply him with Christmas decorations and other goodies to help pass the time. 
Wagner awkwardly complies. Gabriel turns out to be a vegetarian. And a bed wetter.
After a day, Wagner makes a ransom demand for one hundred thousand dollars from 
Representative Booker. Almost immediately the missing child case turns into an 
Amber Alert and dominates news headlines.
One night Wagner, bothered by the clinking sound of the chain, unlocks Gabriel’s ankle 
in order to have a decent sleep. In the morning, Gabriel is gone and with him, all Duncan’s 
charity money. Duncan goes to town in his Santa suit, hoping to elude hoards of police he 
is sure will swarm to his apartment. While in town, he helps a street artist, Martina, 
whose purse is being rifled by a pair of thieves. He realizes Martina has an eye for his 
Santa character, though he also realizes that by kidnapping Gabriel, he has imprisoned 
himself as well.
Back at his apartment there are no police. Later on, Gabriel shows up in disguise after spending the day exploring Boston and buying money orders with Duncan's cash. The friendship is solidified, although the ransom deal seems to be going sour...
The real story is the relationship between Duncan and Gabriel, which takes surprising but endearing turns.

Sackville School, Hildenborough

Sackville School is a small profit-making coeducational independent school located in the village of Hildenborough, in Kent, England. The school is owned and operated by the Cognita Group.
History.
Sackville, formerly Foxbush House, was built in 1866 for Charles Fitch Kemp, a London Chartered Accountant. The Charing Cross to Tonbridge railway line was in the process of construction and the purchase enabled him to combine his London career with his ambition to be a country landowner.
He and his wife, Sarah, had ten children (4 sons and 6 daughters) and a large staff of servants and gardeners to maintain the house. He kept a pack of dogs in kennels beyond the kitchen garden and employed his own cook. He played an important role in local affairs, being the first Chairman of the Hildenborough Parish Council when it was formed in 1894 and a churchwarden from 1869 until his death in 1907.
In 1912 the estate was sold to Barnett Lewis, a wealthy diamond merchant, who installed oak panelling in several of the reception rooms. On his death in 1929, the property was damaged only to been refurbished by Herbert Rae, whose wife's coat of arms is on the fireplace in the entrance hall.
During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned as the headquarters of the 59th Newfoundland Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery. From 1949 to 1970 it was the Convent of Our Lady School, which had moved from Cannon Lane, Tonbridge. In 1970, St Thomas's School moved to the site from Sevenoaks, and later became Foxbush School. This in turn was replaced by Sackville School in 1987.

Singer finds work there and rents a room in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Kelly (Biff McGuire and Laurinda Barrett), who are having financial difficulties as a result of Mr. Kelly's recent hip injury.

Following a successful attempt to win Mick's friendship by encouraging her love for classical music, Singer visits Antonapoulos, and although he takes his friend out for the day, Singer is more lonely than ever when he returns home. Meanwhile, Portia and her husband are attacked and he is jailed for defending himself, Portia gets upset at Copeland for not perjuring himself to help bring out the truth about what happened in the fight.

Mire Loch

Mire Loch is a man made freshwater loch situated on St Abb's Head in the Scottish Borders, just over a kilometre NW of the village of St. Abbs at grid reference . The loch lies on land owned by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) and is approximately 600 metres long by 50 metres at its widest point.
History.
Mire Loch was originally an area of marshy land within the St. Abbs Head Fault. The fault separated the hard volcanic rocks of St. Abbs Head from the softer sedimentary rocks of the mainland. The glacial channel which follows the fault is marked by a distinctive inland valley across the Head which was fed by rainwater from the high ground on both sides and formed a boggy area which drained into the sea.
Around the year 1900 it was decided to turn the boggy area into a recreation area. A dam was built to form a freshwater loch to be used for angling and waterfowl hunting, a nine hole golf course was also constructed nearby. The use of the golf course was discontinued many years ago although there is some visible evidence of the old greens and tees. A boat house was built on the loch and this too has fallen into disrepair with most of the roof timbers now missing.
Present day.
Today Mire Loch is a valued part of St. Abbs Head National Nature Reserve providing a home for freshwater birds such as Little Grebe, Reed Bunting, Heron, Mute Swan, Moorhen and Sedge Warbler. The fringing vegetation which is composed mostly of high reeds provides shelter and food for nesting birds as well as for migrants in Spring and Autumn. In early Summer hundreds of Herring Gulls and Kittiwakes bathe in the loch. In recent years the NTS has planted almost 1000 trees around the loch in an effort to provide extra cover for migrant birds. Most of these trees have been planted on the SW shore in a plantation dedicated to a diver who died off St. Abbs Head in 1981.
Eels, perch and stickleback all live in the loch which is also a breeding site for frogs and toads. The loch has footpaths around its shores and walkers are encouraged by the NTS to include a circuit of the loch during their visit to St. Abb's Head although there is a warning that the paths can be quite muddy after rain. The loch has a stepped outflow which only runs for only several metres before disappearing down a man made drain, finding its way underground to the North Sea which is just 500 metres to the SE.

Tuve landslide

The Tuve landslide was a large landslide in Tuve, Gothenburg, Sweden on November 30, 1977. Some 67 houses were destroyed, killing 9, injuring about 60 and making around 600 people homeless. The slide began at 16.05 and lasted 5–6 minutes. The slide affected 270 000 square meters (27 hectares). About 600 people lived in the area; of these, approximately 200 were in the area at the time of the slide. About 100 needed help by rescue workers. It was the most severe landslide in the modern history of Sweden.
Close to one kilometer of the nearby road was destroyed. It is estimated that three to four million cubic meters of soil were involved in the slide. The total economic cost of the slide has been estimated to 140 million SEK (15 million EUR, 22 million USD).
Cause.
The slide was caused by heavy rain and an unstable slope.
Aftermath.
After the slide it was concluded that many areas were built without proper prior geotechnical investigation. It was decided to chart the stability of built-up areas of municipalities.

August Wenzinger

August Wenzinger (1905–1996) was a prominent cellist, viol player, conductor, teacher, and music scholar from Basel, Switzerland. He was a pioneer of historically informed performance, both as a master of the viola da gamba and as a conductor of Baroque orchestral music and operas.
Wenzinger received his basic musical training at the Basel Conservatory, then went on to study cello with Paul Grümmer and music theory with Philipp Jarnach at the Hochschule für Musik in Cologne. He then took private cello lessons with Emanuel Feuermann in Berlin. Wenzinger served as first cellist in the Bremen City Orchestra (1929–1934) and the Basel Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft (1936–1970). 
By 1925 Wenzinger had mastered the viola da gamba, an instrument then usually considered obsolete. He joined the "Kabeler Kammermusik" (Kabel Chamber Music), a circle of musicians interested in authentic Baroque performance, sponsored by paper manufacturer Hans Eberhard Hoesch in Hagen, Germany. In 1930 he and flautist Gustav Scheck also founded the "Kammermusikkreis Scheck-Wenziger" (Scheck-Wenzinger Chamber Music Circle), considered the leading early music ensemble until the 1950s. 
In 1933 Wenzinger assumed the leadership of the "Kabeler Kammermusik", but the group was soon phased out under political pressure. Wenzinger moved to Basel the same year to accept an appointment to teach cello and viola da gamba at the newly founded Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. 
Wenzinger was one of the first musicians to make recordings with the viola da gamba. In 1968 he founded the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis viola da gamba trio. He has taught many acclaimed violists, including Jordi Savall, who succeeded him in 1974 as professor of viola da gamba at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Wenzinger also taught at Harvard and Brandeis universities in the United States. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel. 
Wenzinger was also an acclaimed conductor, and in 1949 he led a recording of the Brandenburg Concertos performed on original instruments for the Archiv record label. From 1954 to 1958 he led the Capella Coloniensis, the baroque orchestra of West German Radio in Cologne. In 1955 Wenzinger directed this orchestra in the first recording of the opera "L'Orfeo" by Claudio Monteverdi. He led performances of Baroque operas at Herrenhausen in Hanover, Germany, from 1958 to 1966.
Wenzinger’s publications include "Gambenübung", a method book in two volumes for the viola da gamba (1935, 1938), and "Gambenfibel", a primer for the viola da gamba (1943). He edited Bach’s unaccompanied cello suites and several Baroque operas.

Russian famine of 1601–03

The Russian famine of 1601–1603 was Russia's worst famine in terms of proportional effect on the population, killing perhaps two million people, a third of Russian people, during the Time of Troubles, when the country was unsettled politically and later invaded by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The many deaths contributed to social disruption and helped bring about the downfall of Boris Godunov, elected as tsar during the interregnum. The famine was part of worldwide record cold winters and crop disruption, which in 2008 geologists linked to the volcanic eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru.
Causes.
In 2008, geologists from the University of California, Davis announced the results of a study documenting worldwide famine after the eruption of a volcano in Peru in 1600. "Huaynaputina" ejected 16 million to 32 million metric tons of particulates into the atmosphere, notably sulfur dioxide, forming sulfuric acid and creating a volcanic winter; this reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, which scientists believe contributed to bitterly cold winters, loss of crops and animals, and massive famine around the world.
The famine was documented across the world: "Records from Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia record exceptionally cold winters in 1600-1602; in France, the 1601 wine harvest was late, and wine production collapsed in Germany and colonial Peru. In China, peach trees bloomed late, and Lake Suwa in Japan had one of its earliest freezing dates in 500 years."
Number of dead.
During this two and half year period, 127,000 bodies were buried in mass graves in Moscow alone. Widespread starvation killed perhaps two million in Russia, a third of the population. The suffering and social disruption were part of the political unrest called the Time of Troubles, which led to the downfall of the Tsar Boris Godunov. Having previously acted as regent for Tsar Feodor, Godunov was elected to succeed him during an interregnum.

Rodrigo Possebon

Rodrigo Pereira Possebon (born 13 February 1989) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Náutico. He signed for Santos from Manchester United on 20 August 2010. He previously played for Internacional in Brazil, and went on loan to Braga of Portugal for the first half of the 2009–10 season.
Due to his ancestry, he played one match for Italy Under-20 in 2009.
Career.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Sapucaia do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Possebon began his football career playing for Internacional in a defensive midfield role. Possebon was spotted by Manchester United's Brazil-based scout, John Calvert-Toulmin, while following up the club's interest in twin full backs, Fábio and Rafael da Silva.
Manchester United.
Manchester United signed Possebon in January 2008, and since his father is of Italian descent, Possebon qualified for an Italian passport, and so was not subject to European Union legislation regarding non-Europeans working in Europe. Possebon was allocated the number 34 shirt, which was vacated by Ryan Shawcross, for the remainder of the 2007–08 Premier League season. He made his professional debut for the club as a substitute, coming on for Ryan Giggs during the second half of the 1–1 draw with Newcastle United on 17 August.
On 23 September 2008, during a Football League Cup match, he was injured in a challenge by Middlesbrough captain Emanuel Pogatetz, for which the Austrian player received a straight red card. It was initially feared that he had broken his leg, but Manchester United later confirmed otherwise. Possebon made his return from injury on 22 October 2008, scoring in the Manchester United Reserves' 3–0 win over Manchester City.
Possebon made his FA Cup debut on 13 February 2009, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Cristiano Ronaldo in a Fifth Round fixture with Derby County. On 1 March 2009, Possebon won his first major trophy in English football after he was part of the Manchester United squad that beat Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 on penalties after the 2009 League Cup final finished goalless.
Possebon joined Braga on loan, initially for the entire duration of the 2009–10 season. However, after falling out of favour, he returned to Old Trafford in January, after making just one appearance for the club.
Santos.
On 19 August 2010, Santos announced that they had agreed terms with Possebon for his transfer from Manchester United. The two teams were still negotiating the fee for the transfer, but an announcement by Manchester United indicated that the transfer would be completed by the following day.
Possebon made his Santos debut in an away draw against Atlético Mineiro.
International career.
Although he was born in Brazil, Possebon was eligible for an Italian passport due to his father's ancestry. He applied for an Italian passport when signing for Manchester United, in order to avoid work permit legislation for non-EU citizens working in the United Kingdom. Following a relatively successful first season with Manchester United, Possebon received a call-up from Italy under-20 coach Francesco Rocca for the penultimate match of the 2008–09 Four Nations tournament against Germany on 22 April 2009.

Lumbini Park

Lumbini Park is a small public, urban park of adjacent to Hussain Sagar in Hyderabad, India. Since it is located in the center of the city and is in close proximity to other tourist attractions, such as Birla Mandir and Necklace Road, it attracts many visitors throughout the year. Constructed in 1994, the park is maintained by the Buddha Purnima Project Authority that functions under the directives of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. In 2007, it was one of the targets of the 25 August 2007 Hyderabad bombings that killed 44 people.
History.
In 1994, Lumbini Park was constructed at a cost of INR 2.35 crores on of land adjacent to Hussain Sagar. In 2000, the Buddha Purnima Project Authority (BPPA) was established to maintain specially designated development areas in Hyderabad. Among tourist attractions such as Necklace Road and NTR Gardens, Lumbini Park is being maintained by BPPA. To enhance the inflow of visitors, it constructed additional facilities for laser auditorium, boating facilities among other visually appealing features such as gardens and musical fountains. 
In 2006, the park was named as T. Anjaiah Lumbini Park in honour of the late Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
2007 terrorist attacks.
On August 25, 2007, a series of bomb blasts in Hyderabad killed 44 people and injured 60. One of the two blasts occurred during the evening hours in the laser auditorium that housed about 500 people at the time of the incident. After a few days of being cordoned off for crime scene investigation, the park was reopened to public after the installation of metal detectors.
Features.
A parcel of adjacent to the park was acquired from the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department for constructing the laser auditorium. This auditorium, believed to be the first of its kind in India, can seat up to 2000 people at a time for a show on Hyderabad's history. This was one of the initiatives for the park which was one of the key areas to support the World City strategy for Hyderabad and to broadcast Nepalese Culture Worldwide.

Hellzapoppin' (film)

Hellzapoppin' is a 1941 Universal Pictures adaptation of the musical of the same name directed by H.C. Potter. The cast includes Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson (who produced and starred in it on Broadway), Martha Raye, Mischa Auer, Shemp Howard, and The Six Hits.
The credits for the film assert that "any resemblance between "Hellzapoppin"' and a motion picture are coincidental"—a truth that is perhaps responsible for it being less successful than the stage show which engendered it. The film does have some great visual humor, however, including a number of special effects that couldn't be duplicated on stage.
Shemp Howard begins the film as the projectionist of a cinema, displaying on its screen what appears to be the start of a song-and-dance number whose classily dressed performers walk down a staircase - which collapses as in a fun-house ride, sliding them all straight to hell. Demons punish them in various ways. Ole and Chic arrive in the midst of the mayhem by taxi, and after a bit of funny business step back to reveal that it's a movie sound stage. They work for Miracle Pictures ("If it's a good picture, it's a Miracle!") A mousy screenwriter (Elisha Cook, Jr.) outlines his script for the screen adaptation of "Hellzapoppin"', and the rest of the movie depicts Cook's crazy script. Among the topical humor is Johnson picking up a sled named "Rosebud" and saying "I thought they'd burnt that" (Olsen and Johnson were friends of Orson Welles, whose film "Citizen Kane" closes with Kane's childhood sled being burnt).
At the present, "Hellzapoppin"' (like almost all Olsen and Johnson films) is hard to find on commercial DVD. Second Sight (via an arrangement with Universal) released the film commercially in England on region 2 format DVD (release date 2007). The film was scheduled for screening at the non-profit Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in September 2008.
The 1942 Academy Award nomination for Best Song for "Pig Foot Pete," (which lost to "White Christmas"), was attributed to "Hellzapoppin,"' but the song never appeared in the film - it was actually performed in another Universal production from the same year, the Abbott and Costello film "Keep 'Em Flying."

James Pringle

James Alexander Pringle KC (18 August 1874 - 7 July 1935) was a barrister and Unionist politician in Northern Ireland.
James Pringle was the son of Henry Pringle, of Clonbay House, Clones, Co. Monaghan, Irleand. He was admitted, firstly as a solicitor in 1900, and was then called to the Bar of Ireland at King's Inns, Dublin twelve years later. After just nine years, in 1921, he was called to the Inner Bar - becoming King's Counsel (K.C.); traditionally, one must be a member of the utter bar for ten years.
Pringle stood for the UK Parliament in Fermanagh and Tyrone in the 1922 and 1923 UK general elections, on each occasion being narrowly defeated by two Nationalist Party members. In 1924, the Nationalists stood aside, and Pringle was elected alongside fellow Ulster Unionist Party member Charles Falls, easily beating two Sinn Féin members. Pringle did not stand in 1929, when two Nationalist Party members gained the constituency unopposed. A Presbyterian, Pringle was a cousin of Victoria Cross winning doctor John Alexander Sinton.
At the Northern Ireland general election, 1929, Pringle stood as a Local Option candidate in Larne, but was not elected.
Pringle lived at Cranmore Park, Malone Road, Belfast. His son, Prof. John Seton Pringle, became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and married Nancy Chaloner (a descendant of John Cole, 1st Baron Mountflorence, Sir William Montgomery, 1st Baronet, John Beresford and Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone).

Our Lady's Abingdon

Our Lady's Abingdon is a Catholic, independent day school in Abingdon-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. It was founded in 1860 by the Sisters of Mercy as Our Lady's Convent School and subsequently changed to Our Lady's Abingdon in 2008. 
Although the senior school was for many years a girls' school, it is now fully co-educational, with boys and girls in every year group since September 2013. The junior school has always been co-educational.
The school was reconstituted independently of the Sisters of Mercy in 2007. It is a registered charity in England & Wales, formally titled Our Lady's Abingdon Trustees Ltd.
History.
Our Lady's Abingdon was found in 1860 by Sister Clare Moore of the Sisters of Mercy, who worked closely with Florence Nightingale. The school's main auditorium is named after her, the Clare Moore Auditorium, known as the CMA. The school began educating boys and girls from the local area, with a boarding school created in 1866. Our Lady's, the name of the school, refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
In 2009 the senior school began admitting boys.
Present school.
Pupils take nine or ten subjects at GCSE, and normally between three and four AS/A2 subjects in the Sixth Form. Exceptional students at both GCSE and A-level have been known to take extra examined subjects out of normal curriculum time, such as Classical Greek studies.
Sixth Form students also take part in an Enrichment Programme Course which is non-examined. Pupils achieve good examination results and almost all go on to Higher Education. 
Out-of-school activities complement the curriculum. Extra-curricular clubs are on offer and pupils also participate in both the Duke of Edinburgh Award and Young Enterprise Scheme. There is a strong link with Maryhill School in Uganda and students and staff from both schools have visited each other. In addition, students from Our Lady's Abingdon – more informally known as OLA – have opportunities to take part in language exchange visits abroad, annual ski trips, water sports activities in France every other year and expeditions (with a community work element) to countries such as Kenya, China, Patagonia, Peru, and more recently to Nepal and a trek to Everest Base Camp. In April 2010, the choir and musicians from both the Junior and Senior Schools also performed in France.
Each student and member of teaching staff belongs to one of four houses, named after figures key to the genesis of the school: Bowyer, Rich, More, and Challoner. There is a House Prefect from the UVI who organises house events, and two House Captains for each house from the LVI. Though a member of staff is Head of Houses, they often encourage the Sixth Form to lead activities by themselves. House activities range from sporting events to drama competitions. The 2011-2012 academic year welcomed the advent of two new inter-house competitions: the House Shout, a Glee-style group-singing competition; and House Challenge, OLA's version of University Challenge.
Building programmes over recent years have provided teaching facilities for subjects across the curriculum. A Sixth Form Centre and a second computer room equipped for subject-specific classes are recent additions and interactive whiteboards have been installed in key areas of the School. A major building programme was completed in September 2006. This includes a new auditorium, drama studio, science laboratory, exhibition and reception area, teaching space and library/resource centre. In 2008 the Sixth Form Centre was extended and a new science laboratory added to the main building.
Our Lady’s Abingdon Junior School, which takes boys and girls from the age of three, is on the same site and shares some of the Senior school's facilities. Almost all of the Junior School pupils move on to the Senior School at the age of eleven. The rest of the Senior School intake is drawn from a range of State and Preparatory Schools, some a considerable distance away.

1972–73 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1972–73 campaign saw Town get relegeated for the second season in a row, which saw them drop into the 3rd Division for the first time in their history. Despite the 17 goals of new signing Alan Gowling from Manchester United, Town were relegated by goal average from Cardiff City, who ironically were beaten by Town to the 1st Division title in 1924.
Review.
Following the relegation of Town from 1st Division at the end of the previous season, Town's three most experienced players, Trevor Cherry, Roy Ellam and Frank Worthington all left for pastures new, but the money received from their transfers was used to sign the experience of Alan Gowling from Manchester United and Graham Pugh from Sheffield Wednesday. However, a rise back up to Division 1 had a bad start, with Town drawing most of their opening matches and not making any realistic ground on any of the promotion chasing teams such as Burnley and Queens Park Rangers.
Town had only 7 wins in the league by the end of the season, with Town needing to win the last game of the season at home to Portsmouth to have any chance of Town avoiding the unthinkable drop to Division 3. Town beat Pompey 2–0 thanks to goals from Mick Fairclough and new signing Phil Summerill gave Town the needed win, but they had to wait on other results to go their way. Cardiff City got their needed result from their game in hand, which relegated Town on goal average. It was revenge on Town, who pipped Cardiff to the 1st Division title in 1924. They finished 21st with 33 points, getting relegated to Division 3 with Brighton & Hove Albion.

S.C. Adelaide

Sportiva Calcio Adelaide commonly referred to as Adelaide or the abbreviation S.C. Adelaide, is a Ghanaian professional football club based in Tema, Greater Accra, who are competing in the Ghana Division Three League. The club has spent most of their history as a youth football team, but recently converted into a senior team in second tier of the Ghana Football Leagues. Adelaide was initially started as a football club, as a club oriented to multiple sports. Adelaide has departments for athletics, basketball, football, handball, swimming, volleyball, and others. Their motto is Deo Juvante (Latin) meaning with God’s Help.
History.
The club was founded as a sporting club in 1995 as an organization to aid the youth in the community to get into sports. It was named after St Adelaide of Italy "(thus the Italian connection Sportiva Calcio Adelaide)." Adelaide means Noble kind; of the noble sort, and this was what the organization set out to do to the community. "“The opening of the club is with an aim to developing talents and to raise up a generation who will be brave enough to face the world practically and make the nation and the continent as a whole proud.”" In honor of its origins, the club has retained the Italian name as Sportiva Calcio Adelaide, instead of changing it to the Adelaide Sporting Club, it should be noted that the S.C. is in front of the Adelaide and not after, which is sometimes confused since more sporting activities are being taken.
Colours and Badge.
Throughout the entire history of the club, they have been represented by the colour blue and white. The colours have two representations, firstly psychics who claim to be able to observe the aura with their third eye report that someone with a blue aura is a person who is oriented toward spirituality. People with blue auras are said to be interested in social service work and to be in occupations such as social worker, counsellor, teacher, writer, and psychologist. due to the aim of the organization. Secondly with its Italian connection, "Azzurro" (meaning sky), a light blue, is the national colour of Italy as such Adelaide's blue jersey, they have gained the nickname Azzurri. White was chosen because White was the symbol of Catholics, white means purity. Blue jerseys are used for home matches and white jerseys for away matches. The team also wears a third jersey aqua (cyan colour) for matches on neutral grounds, when the opposition wears white or on holiday games. The bashers (bashing is a term meaning thumping) another nickname came from the team's thumping of their opposition. The nickname also comes from the municipality Tema which used to be a land of calabashes (Tema originated from ' Tor-man ' in Ga meaning calabash-town).
Stadium.
The team's current home grounds is a 10,000 capacity park - Christ Church, in the district of Ningo Prampram where it's located. There is ambiguity with the origin of the name, it was named after the many catholic cathedrals, it is also believed the name was given as a place for rejoicing for the fans where they will go and enjoy themselves from the football.
Approach and Philosophy.
S.C. Adelaide has been described as a team which has a desire to entertain and attack, their style of play has been likened to Arsenal F.C. style of playing, quick one two passes, through passes and the odd one or two long passes. Others interpret their style as Total football due to their Dutch coach nicknamed the "“Dutchmaster”". ""If you are looking to watch total football by the Netherlands national football team or looking to watch Arsenal F.C. live and not on TV look no further, just watch S.C. Adelaide, how do they do it"" - Kalusha, sports presenter on Peace FM Ghana . The club focuses on and is dedicated to developing individual and collective technical ability, ball control, possession, passing and defending.
S.C. Adelaide are very successful on the youth level at unearthing talent because their chief scout Seth Hoffmann is the under - 12 and under - 17 southern sector scout for the Ghana Football Association, most of their best players especially the under – 12’s are brought through the club before they are even scouted by other clubs. Their recruitment of the best talents and training methods has led to them producing players described as world class. Examples are Ransford Osei a striker described by FIFA.com as "an opportunistic goal machine" with superb pace and movement, young free-scoring sensation Osei was recognized by World Soccer Magazine as one of the "50 Most Exciting Teenagers on the Planet" in their November 2007 Issue. Daniel Opare also was recognized by World Soccer Magazine as one of the "50 Most Exciting Teenagers on the Planet" in their November 2007 Issue, young marauding right wingback Opare received rave reviews for using his incredible pace and precision crossing to great effect for Ghana’s U-17 Team, "The Black Starlets" at the 2007 U-17 World Cup. David Addy was voted the Young Player of the Year 2008 in Ghana. There is continuous supply of talents from the club, after the 2006-07 youth season, all the first team players were sold to top premier league club youth teams, the likes of Hearts of Oak and Kotoko. The club famously boarded up their Palisade fences at their training grounds to prevent premier league scouts from poaching their players. The hopes and expectations of S.C. Adelaide have always been very high, with their development and gradual progression into the premier league it will not be long before the players are sold directly to foreign clubs and also play for the senior national team.
Statistics and records.
Adelaide is one of the most successful youth clubs in Ghana, having produced the most number of European based players by any youth team in Ghana. A record of 6 players; highest ever representation of a single club for the Under-17 team played in 1999. A total of 17 players have been produced for the under-17 since the club's inception. Most of the players were recruited by premier league clubs into their youth teams and first teams.Eric Bekoe is the club's top goalscorer with 106 goals in all competitions between 2001 and 2004 for the under - 17's followed by Ransford Osei’s total of 79 between 2000 and 2002 for the under - 12's. Jimmy Addo is the youngest player to ever play against a senior team at 14 years 2 months. Adelaide holds the record for the most goals in a single season, this includes youth league, national youth cup and colts cup competition, with a total of 124 goals in the 2001–02 season. In the 2001–02 season, Eric Bekoe scored 42 goals in 34 appearances, setting the Ghanaian record in a single season. The most goals scored by a player in a single match is 7 by Saddick Adams, which is also a Ghanaian record, the highest number of goals in a single match was 14 both records in a home match against Hamilton Youth F.C. in the 2003-04 season. They played a total of 32 passes and had possession for about 5 minutes. The Adelaide defense set a new record after going 22 consecutive games without conceding a goal and went unbeaten the whole of the 2007/08 season. A commentator said "“they (Adelaide) are protecting their goal like they will all die if the ball hit the post let alone if they conceded a goal”".
S.C. Adelaide has qualified for the 2008/09 second division but is yet to register the club for the season. They qualified as a wild card for the Zone 1 playoffs after winning the youth (Colts Football) league, they were included in one of three playoffs groups which consisted of one of three relegated teams from the second division – Palma F.C. and two first and second placed teams from the third division – Great African United and Techiman Universal Stars respectively. The fielded the youngest team with an average age of a little over 16, including 14 year old left midfield sensation Jimmy Addo touted the new Ryan Giggs, none of the players was over 17 years.

The Sample

The Sample, also known as The Sample Dress Shop or The Sample Shop, was a family-owned, high end department store specializing in upscale ladies clothing and furnishings based in Buffalo, New York. The original store was established by Anne W. Bunis on Hertel Avenue in North Buffalo in 1928. The company started when Mrs. Bunis returned from a trip to New York City with a set of 48 "sample" dresses, which she in turn sold for $12.75 each. Expansion occurred during the early 1950s with stores at Lancaster, New York; Lockport, New York; Thruway Plaza (later Thruway Mall) in Cheektowaga, New York; South Buffalo at 2182 Seneca Street; and Downtown Buffalo at 554 Main Street, the former home of Flint & Kent. The Downtown Buffalo store closed in 1959. In 1961, a store opened in Amherst, New York and in 1969, a store opened at Seneca Mall in West Seneca, New York. In 1971, a store opened at Eastern Hills Mall and in 1985, a store opened in McKinley Mall in Hamburg, New York. The last store in the then 11-store chain opened in 1988 at Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga, New York. In 1990, following the death of company chairman Maer Bunis, the company began a rapid descent into bankruptcy. On January 13, 1991, the flagship Hertel Avenue store closed.
The Sample was famous for its "Pup Sale", the semi-annual clearance sale heralded in the newspspers by detailed very funny advertisements which blamed the excess merchandise on their buyer's whims, poor taste or their supposed temporary insanity. The "pups" referred to the excess merchandise which was sold at very low prices. The Pup Sales were quite crowded and generally thought of as the most popular clothing sale of the year in all of Buffalo by its shoppers. The buying frenzy at a Pup Sale was considerable to say the least.

Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)

The Order of St George, , was the first secular chivalric order in the world and was established by King Charles I of Hungary in 1326.
History of the Order.
The Order was founded by King Charles I of Hungary as the Fraternal Society of Knighthood of St George. The precise date of its foundation is not known, but based on the text of its Statutes, it was in existence on St George's Day, 23 April 1326. The order flourished during Charles' reign and achieved greater success under the reign of his son Louis I of Hungary. After the death of Louis, the Hungarian throne became the subject of a violent dispute between his relations, and the Hungarian kingdom dissolved into civil war, destroying the original Society. All that is known about the Order in terms of its mission, composition, obligations and activities has been obtained from the only surviving artifact which describes the Society.
Based on the Statutes, although the Society of St George was a political and honorary body, Charles infused the ideals of chivalry into the Society promoting them among the lesser nobles of his kingdom and implementing the classic symbol of chivalry, the knights' tournament, in Hungarian festivals of chivalry. Unlike the ecclesiastical Orders of the period, members of the Society wore a black, knee-length, hooded mantle, bearing not an heraldic device but an inscription: ""IN VERITATE IUSTUS SUM HUIC FRATERNALI SOCIETATE"": "In truth I am just to this fraternal society".
The Statutes were written in Latin, the language of learned writing in Hungary before the 19th century, and are about 1700 words long, in the form of letters patent. Suspended from the document was the great seal of the Society with the classic iconic representation of St George mounted on a horse slaying the dragon under the horse's hooves as shown on the right. The document is currently housed in the "Országos Levéltar" (National Archives of Hungary), DL. 40 483. There are a number of transcriptions and translations of the Statutes, facilitating study.
The Order existed only for a short period. A private association of the same name is a self-styled order, established in 2001.

Celebrity Bainisteoir

Celebrity Bainisteoir was a prime-time reality programme broadcast by RTÉ and produced by Animo Television/Kite Entertainment. Created by Fiona Looney.
During and after its eight-part original run in 2008, the "hugely popular RTÉ Television tournament" was widely mentioned in the media including such newspapers such as "An Phoblacht", "The Belfast Telegraph", the "Evening Echo", the "Irish Examiner", the "Irish Independent", the "Irish News" and "The Irish Times". During the first series, a pop culture website asked its readers "If you weren’t watching Celebrity Bainisteoir last night, then where were you?"
In the wake of the successful first series, the "Evening Herald" of Dublin reported in September 2008 that RTÉ was seeking out a new set of celebrities for a second series of "Celebrity Bainisteoir" set to air in summer 2009, and that a "Celebrity Bainisteoir" special would air during the Christmas season in 2008. The second series began on 22 March 2009.
The Series was axed in 2013 and replaced with "Ireland's Fittest Family".
Description.
In the series, eight non-sporting Irish 'celebrities' (see references) take the place of Gaelic Athletic Association "bainisteoirí" and compete against one another as the managers of intermediate-level Gaelic football teams. Each contestant managed a club from his or her home county. According to an RTÉ executive: '"Celebrity Bainisteoir" is a refreshingly Irish take on reality television. Clashing the local passions of grass-roots GAA with the very different worlds of our eight celebrity team leaders, it looks like there'll be drama both on and off the pitch.' As described by one of the producers of the programme: "Celebrity Bainisteoir is about showcasing and celebrating the passion, skill and commitment of grassroots GAA, but we're having a bit fun with it by throwing celebrities into the mix. At its heart it's a uniquely Irish family entertainment programme. For the clubs it's a rare chance to showcase club football to a national audience in an entertainment programme, while for the celebrities it's a chance to learn a brand new skill."
2008 series.
Contestants.
The eight "bainisteoirí" and the teams they managed in the 2008 series are:
The contestants were each assigned an experienced mentor to assist them in training and managing their respective teams, but were responsible for team training and tactics. Glenda Gilson recounted her experiences as being extremely difficult, making her cry on the first day. She said 'I wasn’t able for it at all and felt I was like a schoolgirl on a street corner trying to be cool in front of boys' and called the experience the most difficult of her life.
Tournament.
The games featured in "Celebrity Bainisteoir" programme were officially sanctioned by the GAA and consisted of four quarter-finals, two semi-finals and the final. The competitive athletic aspect of the programme was taken seriously by club supporters. For a semi-final encounter with the Mayo team, for example, supporters from Cork urged their fellow Corkonians to attend by rallying 'People of Cork, your city and your county need your support again...If you care about Cork, You'll be there.'
The final tournament was a 'thrilling encounter' played at Parnell Park in Donnycarney, Dublin on Friday 16 May in front of over four thousand spectators. Of this final competition, one source praised "the much-anticipated meeting marked the conclusion of a tournament that captured the public imagination by combining the raw passion of the GAA grassroots with the glamorous world of celebrity." The captain for Maryland on the day was David Martin. The Maryland GAA team from Westmeath, under the direction of their replacement "bainisteoir" Marty Whelan, triumphed over the Mayfield GAA from Cork by 8 points the team that were led by Gerald Kean. Maryland then went on to win the Westmeath Intermediate Championship in 2008.
Christmas Challenge.
Broadcast on 28 December 2008, this special edition sees Marty Whelan's winning Maryland team from the first series take on Patrick Kielty's London champions Tír Chonaill Gaels.
Tír Chonaill Gaels won this game 1-06 to Maryland's 0-07.
Series 4.
There was a fourth series in 2011. The eight celebrities were Dana, PJ Gallagher, Gillian Quinn, Tommy Fleming, Amanda Brunker, Paul Gogarty, Brenda Donoghue and Tony Cascarino. Majella O'Donnell managed Lissan after Dana left to contest the 2011 Irish presidential election. Cascarino ultimately beat Gogarty, with extra-time being needed in the final for the first time in "Celebrity Bainisteoir".

Massacre at Mountain Meadows

Massacre at Mountain Meadows is a book by Latter-day Saint historian Richard E. Turley, Jr. and two Brigham Young University professors of history, Ronald W. Walker and Glen M. Leonard. Leonard was also the director of the Museum of Church History and Art in Salt Lake City, Utah. The book concerns the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre in southern Utah, and is the latest study of the subject.
History.
Though the massacre had already been the topic of numerous books, the authors observed there was a modern feeling that the LDS Church should invite "true reconciliation" by showing "more candor about what its historians actually know about the event". The authors agreed, writing:
To this end, "Church leaders supported [the book by providing full and open disclosure." Although he wrote in his unofficial capacity, one of the authors, Turley, had been serving as an administrator over the church's historical programs since 1986. 
Beginning their work in 2001, the authors did not intend to respond to earlier treatments on the massacre, but to instead take a "fresh approach" and amass all possible primary sources. Aside from available academic and scholarly sources, they were also granted access to the LDS First Presidency's archives. There they discovered the collection of past Assistant Church Historian Andrew Jenson, including the papers from his interviews with insiders in southern Utah during 1892. This was the first modern examination of the massacre that had access to these sources.
The authors avoided portraying the perpetrators and victims as good or evil, which would overlook their human complexity and the groups' diversities. Instead, they examined the massacre as a case of American frontier violence and vigilantism.
The authors were interviewed about their research in an August 2008 airing of KUER's public forum program, Radio West. On September 17, 2008 BYU Television produced a special report entitled, "Massacre at the Meadows: A BYU Broadcasting Special Report", in which they conducted a wide-ranging, hour-long interview with the authors of the book. The special report originally aired on September 24, 2008 and has been occasionally rebroadcast on BYU Television and other BYU media outlets such as KBYU-TV.
Reception.
Demand for the book exceeded the anticipations of its publisher, Oxford University Press. The first printing sold out before the release date, and it has since gone through several more printings. It was Oxford's top sale through Amazon.com for two months and Oxford's fastest-selling book over the last few years, selling 44,000 copies in the first two months. It received positive critical reaction and picked up by the History Book Club and the Military Book Club, though most sales were limited to Utah. Oxford considered it "a big best-seller" for its "smaller press" with conservative print runs.
Awards and Praise.
Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Daniel Walker Howe, said the book was: 
In September 2009 the Journal of American History wrote: 
In June 2009 Reviews in American History wrote: 
Sequel.
"Massacre at Mountain Meadows" tells the story of the massacre, but not its aftermath, impact, media reaction, coverup, or punishment. The authors concluded "that too much information existed for a single book", and that the second half of the story would be written in a future volume. Richard E. Turley Jr. has signed a contract with Oxford University Press to publish the second volume; as of April 2010 this sequel is tentatively titled "After the Massacre".
Related Media.
Upon completion of "Massacre at Mountain Meadows" the authors expressed a desire to publish some of the materials used in their research. As a result BYU Studies published a special edition of their journal in fall 2008. This special edition, "BYU Studies Volume 47:3", contained selections from the Andrew Jenson and David H. Morris collections, along with histories, essays, and book reviews; all dealing with the Mountain Meadows massacre.
In September 2009 BYU Studies and Brigham Young University Press published the complete collections in a 352 page book, entitled "Mountain Meadows Massacre: The Andrew Jenson and David H. Morris Collections".

<doc id="18904468" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18904468" title="Demon Murder Trial">
Demon Murder Trial

The Demon Murder Trial is the first known court case in the United States where the defense sought to imply innocence because the defendant, Arne Cheyenne Johnson, claimed to be an unwilling victim of demonic possession and as such, was unable to exercise control over his unnatural murderous impulses. On November 24, 1981, in Brookfield, Connecticut, Johnson was finally convicted of the first-degree manslaughter of his landlord and friend, Alan Bono. The Glatzel family home (where Johnson was also residing) was plagued by a number of strange and supposedly unexplainable events throughout the year, culminating in Bono's infamous murder. According to testimony provided by the Glatzel family, Debbie's brother, then 11-year-old David Glatzel, had allegedly played host to the demon that forced Johnson to kill Bono. After witnessing a number of increasingly ominous occurrences involving David, the family, exhausted and terrified, decided to elicit the aid of self-described demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (noted for their investigation into the famed Amityville Haunting) in a last-ditch effort to "cure" David. The Glatzel family, along with the Warrens, then proceeded to have David exorcised by a number of Catholic priests. The process dragged on for several excruciating days, and only concluded when a demon fled the child's body, supposedly taking up residence within Johnson instead. Several months later, Johnson killed his landlord during a heated conversation. His defense lawyer argued in court that he was possessed, but the judge ruled that such a defense could never be proven and was therefore infeasible in a court of law. Johnson was subsequently convicted, though he only served five years of a ten to twenty year sentence. The trial attracted media attention from around the world, and has obtained a level of notoriety due to numerous depictions of the events that preceded it in literature and television.
Version from Discovery Channel's "A Haunting".
Arnie Johnson and Debbie Glatzel provided firsthand accounts for the version of events depicted on Discovery Channel's "A Haunting." In the interview, they claimed to be eyewitnesses to demonic possession. Both Johnson and Glatzel appeared adamant in their support of the Walker's recollection of events. They assert that paranormal activity began after they went to clean up a rental property they had just acquired, shortly after David was asked to sweep the master bedroom. David recollects that an old man in a plaid shirt and jeans appeared while he was sweeping, pushing and terrifying him. The couple initially thought he was simply using the old man as an excuse to avoid cleaning, and disregarded his fear. However, when Johnson and Debbie arrived back at her mother's home, David informed them that the old man had threatened both of them, vowing to harm the Glatzels if they continued their move into the rental home. David was continually plagued by visions of the old man, who also took the form of a demonic beast, muttered Latin and threatened to steal his soul. Although the family allegedly heard strange noises emanating from the attic, no one but David had ever witnessed the old man. As his visions grew more prominent, so too did David's night terrors, strange behavior and unexplainable scratches and bruises. The family, extremely unnerved at this point, opted to call upon the services of a Catholic priest, who attempted to bless the house. The blessing had absolutely no effect, David's visions would not relent, and deep gashes began to appear on the front door. After witnessing these increasingly macabre phenomenon, the terrified family concluded that the house was evil, and would no longer continue to rent it. 
Ridding themselves of the rental home did little to dissuade David's demons. His visions worsened, now occurring in the daytime as well. Twelve days after the original incident, the increasingly desperate family summoned the renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren to assist. The Glatzels were informed of the Warren's rather unique skill-set by their priest. The priest felt that David's affliction was demonic in nature, but was unable to perform an exorcism due to poor health. Lorraine, a self-proclaimed clairvoyant, allegedly witnessed a black mist materialize next to David, an apparent indication of a malevolent presence. Debbie and her mother told the Warrens they had seen David being beaten and choked by invisible hands, and that afterwards, awful red marks appeared on his neck. Recently, David had also started to growl, hiss, speak in otherworldly voices, and randomly recite passages from the Bible or "Paradise Lost". The Glatzels recount how each night, a family member would remain awake with David as he suffered through spasms and convulsions. Apparently, after receiving a prognosis of multiple possessions from the Warrens, David was subsequently subjected to three "lesser exorcisms". Lorraine also asserts that David levitated, ceased breathing for a time, and even demonstrated the supernatural ability of precognition, specifically in relation to the murder Johnson would later commit. In October 1980, the Warrens contacted Brookfield police to warn them that the situation was becoming dangerous.
According to eyewitness testimony, Johnson supposedly coerced one of the demons purportedly within David to possess him while participating in David's exorcisms. It is here that "A Haunting" veers away from the circumstances of Johnson's possession as described by those involved. According to the show, a few days after Johnson egged the demon on during the exorcism, he was attacked rather viciously by the demon. The demon allegedly took control of his car and forced it into a tree, although fortunately Johnson was unharmed. After this incident, Johnson returned to the rental property to examine an old well that supposedly housed the demon. In both the dramatized version and his personal account, Johnson recollects that this was his final encounter with the demon while completely lucid, as it was after encountering the demon at the well and making eye contact with it that he became truly possessed. The Warrens claim to have warned him not to do this (although their warning was not mentioned in "A Haunting"). As David's condition continued to decline, Debbie and Johnson decided it was time to move out of their mother's home. Debbie was hired by Alan Bono, a new resident in Brookfield, as a dog groomer. Debbie and Johnson began renting an apartment close to her place of employment. After moving in, Johnson started to exhibit odd behavior that was strikingly similar to David's, causing Debbie to fear that he had become possessed as well. According to Debbie, Johnson would fall into a trance-like state, wherein he would growl and hallucinate but later have no memory of it.
The murder.
On February 16, 1981, Johnson called in sick to his job at Wright Tree Service. He joined Debbie at her place of employment along with his sister and Debbie's cousin. Bono, the couple's landlord and Debbie's employer at the kennel, bought the group lunch at a local bar. Bono proceeded to drink heavily. After lunch, the group returned to the kennels. Debbie then took the girls to get pizza but insisted they return quickly, anticipating trouble. When they returned, Bono, intoxicated at this point, became agitated. Everyone left the room at Debbie's urging, except Bono, who seized Debbie's nine-year-old cousin Mary and refused to let go. Johnson headed back to the apartment and ordered Bono to release Mary. Wanda Johnson, an eyewitness and Johnson's sister, recounted the following events to the police. Mary ran for the car, as Debbie attempted to mitigate the situation by standing between the two men. Wanda tried in vain to pull Johnson away. Johnson, growling like an animal, then drew a pocket knife, stabbing Bono repeatedly and unmercifully. Bono died several hours later. According to Johnson's lawyer, Bono had suffered "four or five tremendous wounds", mostly on his chest, and one that stretched from his stomach to the base of his heart. Johnson was discovered two miles (3 km) from the site of the murder and was held at the Bridgeport Correctional Center on bail of 125,000 USD. This was the first murder in the history of Brookfield, Connecticut.
Media reaction and legal proceedings.
The day after the murder, Lorraine Warren informed Brookfield police that Johnson was possessed when the crime was committed. A "media blitz" soon surrounded the story, fueled in part by the Warrens, whose agents promised that lectures, a book and even a movie detailing the gruesome case were in the works. Martin Minnella, Johnson's lawyer, received calls from all over the world about the Demon Murder Trial. Minnella traveled to England to meet with lawyers who had been involved in two similar cases (though neither ever went to trial). He planned to fly in exorcism specialists from Europe, and threatened to subpoena the priests who oversaw David Glatzel's exorcisms if they did not cooperate with the defense.
The trial took place in Danbury, Connecticut's Superior Court, beginning on October 28, 1981. Minnella attempted to undertake the trial with a plea of not guilty by virtue of possession, but the presiding judge, Robert Callahan, promptly rejected this defense. Callahan argued that no such defense could ever exist in a court of law due to lack of evidence, and that it would be "irrelative and unscientific" to allow related testimony. This forced the defense attorney to instead imply that Johnson acted in self-defense. Because of this, the jury was not legally allowed to consider demonic possession a viable explanation for the murder. The jury deliberated for 15 hours over three days before convicting Johnson on November 24, 1981 of first-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison, though he only served five.
Aftermath.
The incident led to the creation of a made for TV movie called "The Demon Murder Case" on NBC and a major motion picture, the production of which has stalled due to internal conflicts. In 1983, Gerald Brittle, with the assistance of Lorraine Warren, published a book about the incident entitled "The Devil in Connecticut". Lorraine Warren has stated that profits from the book were shared with the family. Sources confirm that two-thousand dollars was paid to the family by the book publisher. Upon the book's republication in 2006 by iUniverse Inc., brothers Carl Glatzel Jr. and David Glatzel sued the authors and book publishers for violating their right to privacy, libel, and "intentional affliction of emotional distress." He also claims the book alleges he committed criminal and abusive acts against his family and others. Carl Glatzel Jr. believes that the possession story was a hoax concocted by Ed and Lorraine Warren to exploit the family and his brother's mental illness, and that the book presents him as the villain because he did not believe in the supernatural claims. He asserts that the Warrens told him the story would make the family millionaires, and would help get Johnson out of jail. According to Glatzel Jr., the publicity generated by the incident forced him to drop out of school and lose friends and business opportunities. He is currently writing a book, titled "Alone Through The Valley", about his version of the events surrounding his brother. Lorraine Warren defends her work with the family. She presents as evidence the fact that that the six priests who were involved in the incident agreed at the time that the boy was possessed, and that the supernatural events she described were real. Gerald Brittle, the book's author, says he only wrote the book because "the family wanted the story told," that he possesses video of over 100 hours of his interviews with the family, and that they signed off on the book as accurate before it went to print. Glatzel's father, Carl Glatzel Sr., denies telling the author that his son was possessed. Johnson and his now-wife Debbie wholeheartedly support the Walker's account of demonic possession, and are under the impression that the Glatzels in question are suing simply for monetary purposes.

Mohammad Salman Hamdani

Mohammad (or Mohammed) Salman Hamdani (December 28, 1977 – September 11, 2001) was a Muslim American who died at the World Trade Center in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, when he went there to offer rescue assistance. For this he was mentioned in the 2001 Patriot Act of the US Congress, as an example of Muslim Americans who acted heroically on 9/11.
Early life.
Hamdani was born in Karachi, Pakistan and moved to America with his parents when he was only 13 months old. He had two younger brothers, Adnaan and Zeshan, who were born in the US. His mother Talat taught English at a middle school in Queens and his father Saleem was the owner and operator of a convenience store in Brooklyn. 
He was on his high school's football team in Bayside, Queens where he lived. He majored in chemistry at Queens College and graduated in June 2001. In July he started employment as a research technician at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute of Rockefeller University in the Protein/DNA Technology Center, and additionally had a part time job driving an ambulance. He was an NYFD-certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and a New York City Police Department cadet. The night before 9/11 he was working on an application for medical school and helping his father cope with heart disease.
September 11 attacks.
It was believed that on the morning of September 11, 2001, while on the way to work at Rockefeller University, Hamdani witnessed the smoke coming from the Twin Towers and hurried to the scene to aid victims, using his police and EMT identification to get a ride through the restricted traffic. He died in the World Trade Center and his remains were found in the rubble of the North Tower. 
At first Hamdani was listed as missing and there were media reports that he was under investigation as being possibly involved in the attack. In October 2001 an unidentified body along with Hamdani's medical bag and identification were found at Ground Zero, the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. His body was not yet positively identified by DNA profiling. He was declared a hero by Congress that October, 45 days after the attacks. Specifically, he is mentioned in the USA PATRIOT Act, Title 1 in section 102 (titled "Sense of Congress condemning discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans"), which states that:
Months later in March 2002, his remains were identified and shortly afterwards on April 5, 2002 at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, he was memorialized as a hero by Mayor Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Kelly, Congressman Ackerman and 500 others. A memorial scholarship fund in his name, for outstanding Pakistani-American students, was created at Rockefeller University in 2002 by his mother Talat Hamdani.
On March 10, 2011, Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, in his testimony before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Homeland Security for its hearing on “The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and That Community’s Response”, cited Mr. Hamdani as being falsely accused of being involved in the WTC attacks only because he was a Muslim.
At the National 9/11 Memorial, Hamdani is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-66.

A High Wind in Jamaica (film)

A High Wind in Jamaica is a 1965 DeLuxe Color film, based on the novel of the same name, and directed by Alexander Mackendrick for the 20th Century-Fox studio. It starred Anthony Quinn and James Coburn as the pirates who capture five children.
Other cast members include Deborah Baxter, Nigel Davenport, Isabel Dean, Lila Kedrova, Kenneth J. Warren, and Gert Frobe. One of the child actors is the author Martin Amis.
The film is regarded highly today because of Mackendrick's direction and Quinn's lead performance as the pirate captain whose relationship with the children betokens a subtle change in his character, finally leading to his downfall and the pirates' end.
Mackendrick (1912-1993) was best known as a director of the Ealing comedies "The Man in the White Suit" (1951) and "The Ladykillers" (1955), as well as "The Sweet Smell of Success" (1957), now recognized as a masterpiece. The material in "A High Wind in Jamaica" afforded the director an opportunity to combine a light touch with serious drama. Essentially, what makes the film fascinating is the theme of children growing up and their contact with a world of adults (the pirates) who act as if they are grown-up children.
Plot.
A hurricane hits the isle of Jamaica in 1870. The Thorntons (Nigel Davenport) and (Isabel Dean), the parents of five children feel it is time to send them to England for a more civilized upbringing and education. 
During the voyage, pirates board the ship and take the children captive. The pirate captain, Chavez (Anthony Quinn) and first mate Zac (James Coburn), takes an immediate liking to young Emily (Deborah Baxter), and decides to sail to Tampico and leave the kids safely with a woman there named Rosa (Lila Kedrova), a brothel madam with a good heart.
Rosa warns the pirates that the law is after them. Since they are innocent of the crimes attributed to them by the authorities—namely, the murder of all the children—Chavez and his first mate (James Coburn) are unconcerned. But then one of the children, John (Martin Amis), slips from a window of the brothel and falls to his death. Chavez doesn't wish any more harm to come to the young ones so he refuses to attack a Dutch vessel that comes into view. But his men mutiny, seize the Dutch boat and capture its captain (Gert Fröbe).
Seeing him come toward her with a knife, which he wants her to use to cut his ropes and set him free, Emily instead stabs the Dutch captain and kills him. Not long thereafter, the pirates are captured by British sailors and brought to trial. Under questioning in court, Emily places the responsibility of killing the Dutch captain on Chavez instead of on herself. The pirates are hanged.
Cast.
The title song was produced and written by Larry Adler and sung by Mike LeRoy.

Red Leaf Resources

Red Leaf Resources, Inc, is an oil-shale company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It is a developer of the shale oil extraction technology EcoShale In-Capsule Process.
Technology.
In the Red Leaf Resources EcoShale In-Capsule Process a hot gas is generated by burning natural gas or pyrolysis gas. Generated hot gas is then circulated through oil shale rubble using sets of parallel pipes. The heat is transferred to the shale through the pipe walls rather than being injected directly into the rubble, thereby avoiding dilution of the product hydrocarbons with the heating gas. The oil shale rubble is enclosed by a low-cost earthen impoundment structure to prevent environmental contamination and to provide easier and more rapid reclamation after the extraction process is finished. Heat from the spent shale is recovered for enhancing the process's energy efficiency by passing cool gas through pipes and then using it for preheating adjacent capsules.
Operations.
Red Leaf Resources controls oil shale leases covering about on State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands in Seep Ridge, Utah. The acreage represents about of shale oil. Its 2009 pilot project produced more than of oil. In 2012, Red Leaf Resources formed a joint venture with Total S.A. to launch commercial scale production of , utilizing the EcoShale In-Capsule process on oil shale leaseholds in Utah's Uintah Basin. In December 2013, the ground water permit was issued for the oil shale mine and shale oil plant. Red Leaf plans to be producing of oil by the end of 2015.
In 2011, Red Leaf Resources signed a licence agreement with TomCo Energy allowing the latter to use the EcoShale technology for developing the Holliday block in Utah. TomCo filed an application for oil shale activities in January 2014.
Management.
The director, president and chief executive officer of the company is Adolph Lechtenberger. Todd Dana was one of the original founders of Red Leaf Resources and former chief operating officer.

Vince Eager

Youth and early career.
As a teenager, he formed the Harmonica Vagabonds, later the Vagabonds Skiffle Group, with Roy Clark, Mick Fretwell, and bassist Brian Locking. The group reached the final round of a televised "World Skiffle Championship" in 1958, and were offered a residency at the 2 I's Coffee Bar in London. There, they were signed by impresario Larry Parnes, who took Taylor into his stable of performers, and gave him one of his characteristic stage names, Vince Eager. After touring and releasing an EP as Vince Eager & The Vagabonds, Clark and Fretwell returned home. Vince Eager and Brian Locking remained in London, Locking performing with Marty Wilde before joining The Shadows.
The Parnes era.
During 1959 Vince Eager was a regular on BBC TV's "Drumbeat", often accompanied by The John Barry Seven. In 1960 he was one of the contestants on "". His song, "Teenage Tears", in the semi-final was ranked last in the total of six entries for nomination to the Eurovision Song Contest. According to Vince Eager's website, "the death of his best friend Eddie Cochran in a car crash on Easter Sunday 1960 was to prove a turning point in Vince's career. He was disgusted with the manner in which Parnes sought to gain publicity from the accident and he began the process of getting away from the "Parnes Stable" of popsters."
Later career.
In the years that followed the Parnes era, he toured on the cabaret circuit, and performed in theatre and pantomime. For five years he starred in the award-winning West End musical "Elvis". In 1986 he relocated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida where he worked as a Cruise Director on American luxury cruise ships. 
Now residing back in the UK, Eager's career has had something of a resurgence. Teaming up with producer and musician Alan Wilson, there have been many new recordings some of which have featured Vince's old friends including; Marty Wilde, Albert Lee and Chas Hodges (of Chas & Dave). The resulting album release, titled "788 years of Rock n Roll" sold well enough for Wilson's Western Star record label to invite Eager back for another session in 2013. The latest album "Rockabilly Dinosaur" will be released in early 2014. Eager now lives in Nottinghamshire.

British Columbia Wildlife Park

The British Columbia Wildlife Park is a zoo located in Kamloops, British Columbia.
The British Columbia Wildlife Park is an accredited member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA).
History.
The proposal.
In 1965, the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce felt that Kamloops was a 'one-night stop' for tourists and that more attractions would be needed to convince visitors to stay longer, which would benefit the local economy. On February 15, 1965, the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce were approached by animal enthusiast and eventual Wildlife Park founder John Moelaert, who proposed that an idea of a zoological park would be the perfect attraction to boost the local economy, because it would attract both visitors and residents.
Public meeting.
A month later a public meeting was organized by the Chamber of Commerce at the old Kamloops Library on March 17, 1965, to discuss the possibility of establishing a Wildlife Park. Other than John Moelaert, the public meeting were also attended by Kamloops City Council aldermen Tony Andrew, Gene Cavazzi and Malcolm Grant, as well as, North Kamloops Town Council alderman Albert McGowan, Head of the Kamloops branch of the B.C. Fish and Wildlife Len Smith, and architect Bud Aubrey (who would eventually provide drawings for the buildings and exhibits for the Wildlife Park). At the meeting, John Moelaert explained to the public his idea to have a zoological attraction and that to achieve this goal he needs to:
John Moelaert recalled that at the meeting, "Most of the people were underwhelmed," and that, "Not a few were clearly hostile," but hostilities were present. Opponents of Moelaert's proposal, argued that Kamloops needed a public indoor swimming pool, better facilities for its senior citizens and that they don't feel comfortable with animals being locked up in cages. Moelaert would make it clear to the public that, "The well-being of animals was as important to me as it was to my critics," and went further to explain, "That a zoological park (The name wildlife park came into use later) could be a major recreational, educational and conservation project." However, opposition to Moelaert's plan was still strong and support for his proposal was lukewarm as different questions were being asked on: How is he going to find a ? Why not he start small with a few acres? How is he going to pay for it? Moelaert would admit that he did not have all the answers and reminded the audience at the public meeting that his purpose for this meeting was to start the formation of a society so that they can gather information to answer those questions and to determine whether having a zoological park was even feasible. Moelaert then asked for donations for the proposed society and received a $10 bill from Ralph Thomas, General Manager of the Kamloops Pulp Mill and received an additional $5 from Reg Waugh. The public meeting would end after it appointed Jim Watson, Mrs S. Dow, lawyer Andrew Berna, Chamber of Commerce representative Fred Nesbitt, and John Moelaert as committee members to pursue the matter of setting up a society.
The formation of the zoological society.
After public approval, the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society was formed on April 6, 1965, after its constitution and bylaws were prepared free of charge by local lawyers, Andrew Berna (committee member) and Patrick Dohm. After the establishment of an executive committee, the society was then officially incorporated and registered under the B.C. Societies Act, a few weeks later. Soon after their establishment, the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society started its membership drive. Membership to join the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society was only two dollars a year and included four free visits to the future zoo. The membership drive quickly reached over the 100-mark, which included renowned BC citizens such as former Justice Minister Davie Fulton, Highways Minister Phil Gaglardi, Kamloops Mayor Peter Wing, Executive Director of the BC Wildlife Federation Howard Paish, and Vancouver Public Aquarium founder and director Dr. Murray Newman.
Site negotiations with Molson Breweries.
After their successful membership drive, the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society's next task was to find a suitable site and soon entered into talks with Molson Breweries who owned an unused hops farm about east from what was then the boundary of Kamloops. Molson officials showed interest in the park proposal, but wanted several reports from the Society to show the Zoo's viability. The main concern of Molson Breweries was that the Zoo's project would become an eyesore for lack of funds and would reflect poorly on their company. With the Society's bank account having only more than a few hundred dollars, convincing Molson Breweries that the Society can carry out their development plans was a formidable task, since raising the required funds for the construction of buildings and exhibits would cost more. Molson's concerns of the Park's feasibility caused negotiations between Zoo Founder, John Moelaert and Molson's Public Relations Director, Alex Jupp to be on-going. Knowing his Society's financial situation and how it is effecting the on-going negotiations with Molson Breweries to donate land, Moelaert managed to persuade local architects (see above – The Public Meeting), surveyors, engineers, contractors, carpenters, electricians, bricklayers, etc. to donate their services or building materials if Molson's land were to be transferred to the Society. After being successful to convince local businesses to donate their services, Molson Breweries became convinced of the Park's viability and donated of land to the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society on February 11, 1966, after almost a year of negotiations.
Construction and opening of the park.
Four months after receiving the land transfer from Molson and receiving donated materials and services (labour, concrete, bulldozer, flat deck, lumber, doors, toilet stalls, water mains, etc.), the Greater Kamloops Zoological Society started planning and designing their new site for construction. Majority of the donated materials and services, mostly came from Kamloops, however, much of the donated materials also came from the Lower Mainland and as far away in Peterborough, Ontario. With the donated materials and services available, founder John Moelaert would oversee the construction and became the project's first manager on June 1, 1966. On that same day, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Staff Sgt. Gordon Simons succeeded John Moelaert as President of the Society, since Moelaert was now in charge of managing construction. The first item on Moelaert's development was to drill for an abundant supply of excellent water so that the Zoo can have its own independent water supply. On their first drilling attempt, Moelaert found what he was looking for – an abundant water supply, and soon after that, development and construction began. After Moelaert discovered his independent water supply, BC Hydro crews started to provide electricity to the Zoo, by constructing underground services in order to avoid unsightly overhead lines. Soon after BC Tel started installing the phone lines and roads were soon built. Construction of the Zoo would only take two months to complete, and it was officially opened to the public on August 16, 1966. The first exhibits to be shown to the public was a enclosure that featured two moose, Demitrius and his female companion, Gerda, and other enclosures that included the White-Tailed Deer, the Fallow Deer, and the Canada Geese. After operating its business under the Kamloops Zoo, the Society would change its name to The Wildlife Park Society of B.C. and rename the site as B.C. Wildlife Park on November 1, 1966, in order to recognize the support that they have received from both the Thompson-Okanagan region and the Lower Mainland. In its first 80 days of operation, the Park drew in 7,000 people before it was closed to the public for the winter season. A year later, on May 20, 1967, the children's zoo was officially opened by Phil Gaglardi in the presence of North Kamloops mayor Jack Chilton, alderman Gene Cavazzi representing Kamloops, Society President, Gordon Simons, founder John Moeleart, and 500 spectators who attended the Victoria Day event. After the event, the BC Wildlife Park received wide media attention from the Vancouver Sun and The Province, which caused provincial tour buses to include the park on their itinerary and school buses brought students for free visits coming from as far as Victoria to visit the park. A month later on June 8, 1967, visitors to the park witnessed the birth of a white-tail deer fawn, which was the first animal to be born at BC Wildlife Park. In addition, the Minister of Northern Affairs Arthur Laing, donated to the park three buffalo calves and gave it tax exempt status. Furthermore, due to its popularity, businesses, service clubs, and individuals sponsored various exhibits at BC Wildlife Park, which helped to cover the various operating expenses. However, the park would go through tough financial difficulties for the next five years.
Financial difficulties.
Molson Breweries announced that it would provide an additional across the highway as a public park with a walkway under the highway and train track around the site of BC Wildlife Park. However, the proposal was later shelved when the BC Wildlife Park ran into financial difficulties and it would need support from the three levels of government for the proposal to go through.
In 1970, the Canadian economy had a downturn that caused both attendance and donations to drop sharply, which created a $7,000 deficit for the park. This caused Moelaert and the board to appeal for financial assistance from the city of Kamloops, the regional district, and the provincial government. However, all three levels of governance decided to support and recognize the value of the park in principle, but will not give out financial assistance.
Shortly afterwards, the board would offer the Thompson-Nicola Regional District the Wildlife Park and all its assets in exchange for an annual $15,000 grant for five years. The district agreed by holding a money referendum on December 12, 1970. Unfortunately, the referendum failed to reach the minimum 60% voter approval that would potentially force the Society to dispose all of its assets and return the land to Molson Breweries due to the stipulation that the land would only be used as a wildlife park, alone.
In desperation, the park board directors was able to receive a loan although, each member had to assume personal liability to keep the park open in 1971. When financial situations remained critical, local service clubs decided to hold a bingo event to raise money to keep the park feasible, but it fell short of its goal.
This caused founder, John Moelaert to resign as the park's manager on August 31, 1971, leaving park president, Doug Jebson as head of the board of directors and with the mandate of keeping the park alive.
After going through three failed attempts of financing and witnessing their founder's resignation, the BC Wildlife Park was saved when the city of Kamloops amalgamated with other nearby municipalities in 1972. Through the merger of boundaries, the BC Wildlife Park were within the city's boundaries and responsibilities to discuss saving the Park from closure.
Present.
Since 1972, the BC Wildlife Park has gone through continual changes and enhancements through the support of volunteers and business professionals throughout the province. In 1987, the BC Wildlife Park attained national status when it received accreditation from the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA). Today, the Kamloops Wildlife Park Society is governed by a volunteer board of 14 directors, who are elected at the Annual General Meeting from a membership of over 8,000 people.
Conservation and education projects.
TD Canada Trust Nature Exchange.
The BC Wildlife Park opened the Nature Exchange in order to teach people about biological and physical components of their environment, through observation, background research and responsible collecting. If people have a natural item they can bring it to the Nature Exchange and get experienced staff to see and discuss the item with the collector on what the object is, where it came from, why it is special and any other details. Collectors are encouraged to further their knowledge of nature through research in the adjacent resource library. Staff can award the exchange based on three criteria:
Through this process, the collector learns that the simplest object can be awarded a high point value, if the collector shows initiative. The process of trading provides the necessary motivation. In searching for things to collect and trade, individuals learn to observe, to ask questions, and to think independently. Points that are awarded based on the three criteria will be placed on the Nature Exchange computer trading data bank, which will be used for future trading for items in the constantly rotating collection of artifacts and other items that collectors can take home to enjoy. Visitors can take the item with them as part of their collection or bring it back to trade it for another item. However, due to federal and provincial regulations, the BC Wildlife Park through the Nature Exchange will raise awareness and emphasize the importance on ethical collecting, on responsible outdoor recreation, and on sustainable living practices. For example, it is unlawful to have B.C. wildlife as domestic pets or to collect cast off antlers. People will be encouraged to enjoy nature in a sustainable way, and that means that items like bird's nests, flowers or animal bones should be photographed or sketched, but left physically undisturbed for everyone to appreciate. The Nature Exchange will include an Answers & Resources Library and Trading Zone as well as five distinct zones: Animals, Insects, Plants & Trees, Rocks, Minerals & Fossils, and Skulls and Bones.
Community stewardship.
The BC Wildlife Park have a policy to be committed to promoting a sustainable and responsible environmental practices. Through this policy, all new construction at or in association with the Park will follow strict environmental standards from the types of materials being used; to the way they heat and light their facilities and how they can reuse recyclable material whenever they can.
In the near future, the BC Wildlife Park would like to showcase and set an example for others through a wide variety of sustainable projects that will include alternate energy practices, such as solar and wind power, waste water treatment in a natural marsh, and recycling projects that will include composting techniques.
The Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre.
The Kamloops Wildlife Park Society operates the only licensed Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in the Kamloops area. The Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre staff and volunteers work closely with the Ministry of Environment as well as community partners to provide rehabilitation services for injured, ill, or orphaned mammals, birds of prey, amphibians, reptiles and endangered species until they can be returned to their natural habitats.
The Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre also has a partnership with Thompson Rivers University's – Animal Health Technology Program (AHT) to teach and prepare students to become Animal Health Technicians. Students that are taking this program will learn many aspects of their course requirements while providing a very high level of veterinary care and learning their course requirements while participating in animal health and wildlife rehabilitation at the B.C. Wildlife Park.
In 2006, the Rehabilitation Centre rescued and rehabilitated 139 animals and in 2007, the Park took in five rescued rattlesnakes and rehabilitated them by the fall season when the snakes were eventually released to a den site. One of the snakes also gave birth at the Park and the surviving young were also released into the wild. In 2008, the Rehabilitation Centre took in 11 deer fawn from Kamloops and other surrounding communities such as Prince George and Kelowna. Two of the fawn did not survive after they were rescued, while one survivor will not be released since it has lost its fear of man. However, eight of the surviving deer fawn were released into the wild.
Burrowing Owl Captive Breeding Program.
Since 1991, B.C. Wildlife Park has released well over 500 juvenile Burrowing Owls back into their BC grassland habitat and is an active member of the Burrowing Owl Conservation Society of B.C. As of now, B.C. Wildlife Park has the largest Burrowing Owl Breeding Facility in North America.
Prior to 1980, British Columbia's Burrowing Owl population had almost been extirpated from the grassland areas of the Thompson-Okanagan region. To prevent the species from going extinct in the B.C. grasslands, the B.C. Wildlife Park participated in the BC Burrowing Owl Recovery Program in 1990, with the construction of its first breeding facility.
The main goal of the Breeding Program is to achieve a self-supporting Burrowing Owl population in BC's grasslands through population increase, habitat improvement, and public education. To increase the population, about 100 owls are born and raised within the breeding facility. After one year, those same owls would then be released into the grasslands of the Thompson-Okanagan area after staff carefully select a proper release site. In terms, of habitat and education, the Wildlife Park's Education Department undertakes extensive interpretive programs and field trips that involve schools and other community groups to promote local awareness about the Burrowing Owls' plight. In addition, the Park's Burrowing Owl ambassador, is very well known in the local community, and will promote the fundamental message that people of all ages can do something to preserve and protect endangered grassland species. Furthermore, the breeding program is a partnership that includes Wildlife Park staff, volunteers, local landowners, and the BC Ministry of Education, which also helps in delivering its message and objectives.
After twelve years with the program, BC Wildlife Park constructed a new Burrowing Owl Recovery Centre within its grounds in 2002. The new facility is capable of producing over 100 young owls for release each year. The design of the Burrowing Owl Recovery Centre was developed by B.C. Wildlife Park staff and is currently being copied by other North American facilities due to its success as a leader in Burrowing Owl captive breeding for release according to the National Burrowing Owl Team. In addition, B.C. Wildlife Park also received an award of excellence for its captive breeding program from the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 2004.

Change (Taylor Swift song)

"Change" is a song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift self-penned the song and co-produced it alongside Nathan Chapman. The song was released on August 8, 2008, with all proceeds being donated to the United States Olympic team. "Change" was written about Swift's hopes and aspirations in regards to succeeding, although being signed to the smallest record label in Nashville, Tennessee. The track was later chosen as one of the themes for the 2008 Summer Olympics and was included on the "AT&T Team USA Soundtrack", which was released August 7, 2008. The song was later included on Swift's second studio album "Fearless", which was released in November 2008. "Change" is musically pop rock and uses divergent string instruments. Lyrically, it speaks of overcoming obstacles and achieving victory.
It received mixed reviews from music critics and was able to peak at number ten on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming Swift's first song to reach the top ten on the chart. The music video for "Change" was directed by Shawn Robbins and features Swift performing with a band in a ballroom. An alternate version of the video features footage of the United States Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The song was performed during Swift's first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour in 2009.
Background.
When Swift was first signed to Big Machine Records, it was a new and extremely small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an "uphill climb" and said, "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When are we going to get a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me."
The song was recorded in December 2007, when she recognized it applied to more scenarios and had a "bigger meaning" than originally. American television network National Broadcasting Company (NBC) had asked Swift to perform at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. However, an appearance could not be scheduled because Swift was touring at the time. Instead, Swift's father suggested using "Change" as a theme for the event. Therefore, "Change" was used during NBC's daily video highlights in August 2008, prior to the release of "Fearless". "I wrote the song ‘Change’ as an underdog story. It’s kind of crazy to think that the Olympics chose this as one of the songs to play during the Olympic Games", Swift commented. It was included on the "AT&T Team USA Soundtrack" (2008). The song was released as a promotional single on the iTunes Store on August 8, 2008. All proceeds were donated to the United States Olympic team.
Composition.
The duration of "Change" is four minutes and forty six seconds. Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" described the song's genre as a "kind of orthodontically perfect pop rock". He said the most country part of the song were lyrics that referenced Catholicism with the word "hallelujah". It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from F3 to B♭4. They were described to have a nasal tone when using her voice above mezzo forte. It follows the chord progression F–F/E–Dm–B♭. "Change" relies on a string-swathed instrumentation.
The lyrics of "Change" speak of overcoming obstacles and achieving triumph, while instilling hope in oneself. It centers around the concept of surpassing others' expectations and the limitations they set out. The song turns the notion of fearlessness into a movement that is not specified. Dave Heaton of PopMatters noted the lyric "I believe in whatever you do" meant Swift was unconcerned with the specifics of the cause. He presumed it was a universal message or was about changing the traditions of country music sound and defying the expectations of what country artists can achieve with their careers. Jody Rosen of "Rolling Stone" believed the lyrics addressed political issues.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The song received generally mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was unimpressed by Swift's vocals, describing them as unpleasant and thin. Keefe added that her voice often cracked and, therefore, prevented the song from becoming an anthem. Jody Rosen of "Rolling Stone" magazine considered the track to be vague. Dave Heaton of PopMatters compared "Change" and Swift's "Long Live", both which ended "Fearless" and "Speak Now" (2010), respectively. He stated, "There’s something really generic about the song, but that quality becomes the cornerstone of an anthem." Heaton also commented that the song was appealing to multiple audiences, as long as they felt restrained by any scenario.
Chart performance.
On the week ending August 30, 2008, "Change" debuted at its peak position of number ten on the "Billboard" Hot 100, selling over 131,000 digital downloads, making it Swift's best-charting song at the time and first top ten appearance. In the following week, the song descended to number forty and then number one-hundred on the "Billboard" Hot 100, marking its third and last week on the chart. The song is one of thirteen songs from "Fearless" charted within the top forty of the "Billboard" Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top forty entries from a single album. "Change" also peaked at number fifty-seven on the Hot Country Songs chart on the week ending August 30, 2008. The track also peaked at number twenty-one on the now-defunct Pop 100 chart.
Music video.
The accompanying music video for "Change" was directed by Shawn Robbins. It was filmed at the ballroom in the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Indianapolis, Indiana. The video commences with a shot of a stained glass window. It then transitions to Swift, clothed by a white cocktail dress and black cowboy boots, performing alongside a backup band in an empty ballroom. The band members dressed semi-casual and played the instruments bass, drums, and various guitars. As the video progresses, Swift is seeing singing and dancing. Cut-scenes feature close-ups of Swift in another setting, clothed by another white cocktail dress and surrounded by hot pink, white, and blue twinkling lights in a black background. The video concludes with Swift turning back and walking toward the backup band. An alternate version of the video features footage from United States Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Both versions of the music video premiered on NBC.com in August 2008.
Live performances.
Swift has performed the track on the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief. Swift's first televised performance of "Change" was at the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, where she, donning a sparkly evening gown, sang on an elevator suspended from the crowd. She then came down, where she was joined by a teenage choir, and finished the performance by surfing the crowd. Swift performed "Change" on the first North American leg of the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a sparkly silver and black dress with black, leather boots. She noted, "It's been a tough year", and commenced singing throughout the stage as images of victims of economic and natural disasters were projected on the video screens. As the song approximated, its last refrain, she said, "Things turn back around." Then, scenes of triumph appeared on the video screens. Craig Rosen of "The Hollywood Reporter" attended the May 22, 2009 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, "It was overly simplistic and a bit naive, but still hard not to be moved." Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Raivaru

Raivaru is a type of Maldivian traditional singing, where letters are swapped to be sung in a certain melody without accompaniment.
In the early years of Maldivian civilization " Raivaru" was merely a time pass amongst toddy vintner's( Raiverin) thus the emergence of the name" Raivaru ". But in the subsequent years , with the development of the Maldivian culture and the introduction of the common ground rules of reading and writing ( Adhabiyaath) and the improvement of the Dhivehi language , Raivaru transformed from a simple time pass to a very much developed art and part of the Maldivian Syllabus for the learning of Dhivehi as a first language
With the newly made rules of "Raivaru" some basic rules were made in how the letters in a raivaru were arranged. Thus came into existence two main types of raivaru, firstly raivaru with six lines of words, the lines in a raivaru are called as " Bas" so a raivaru with sis lines or six sentences was called as a " Ha bahuge raivaru" and the raivaru with three lines or three sentences was called as " Thin bahuge raivaru" 
These were merely the ground rules, Raivaru is an art so fine that in a perfectly synchronized raivaru, a lot of features and conditions have to be met .

Cyril de Zoysa

Sir Cyril de Zoysa (Sinhala:ශ්‍රිමත් සිරිල් ද සොයිසා) (October 26, 1896 – January 2, 1978) was a Sri Lankan industrialist, Senator and a philanthropist. The President of the Senate of Ceylon from 1960 to 1965, he was a leader in the Buddhist revival movement in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the 20th century. He was distantly related to Sri Lankan tycoon Sir Ernest de Silva.
Early life.
He was born on October 26, 1896 to Solomon and Harriet de Zoysa in Galle, and was their second son. His brother V.T. De Zoysa also became a famous leader in his own right. He was educated at St. Thomas' College, Matara for his primary studies and then moved on to Richmond College in Galle. His father was a notary public and for this reason de Zoysa moved many times during childhood. He completed his secondary education at the prestigious Royal College, Colombo. At the young age of twenty, he began pursuing his studies at Ceylon Law College. After graduating from Sri Lanka Law College, he began practicing law in 1921. He started at the police courts of Balapitiya. In 1926 he moved to Kalutara after five successful years of practice in Balapitiya.
Kalutara activism.
The town of Kalutara was a centre of Buddhist learning and a pilgrimage site where people came to view the Kalutara Bodhi. In violation of colonial law, he began lighting lamps at the Kalutara Bodhi. The Bodhi tree was one of 32 allegedly brought to Sri Lanka by King Devanampiyatissa, as a scion of the Sri Maha Bodhi of Anuradhapura. When the colonial authorities came, they attempted to corral devotees away from the tree. They accosted De Zoysa, and De Zoysa challenged them to arrest him. He invested much of his own money into the project, and created pilgrimage facilities for worshippers.
Business ventures.
De Zoysa was a successful businessman having a diverse array of ventures. During law school he earned money by tutoring, and used his first earnings to buy a buggy cart. He later reminisced that "I gifted this to my father, who blessed me for this act of love and generosity. I perceived that this gift I gave my father brought him immense joy. Likewise this brought me too unforgettable joy.” He was the founder of the AMW group, one of the largest conglomerates of Ceylon.
Senatorial career.
De Zoysa was the President of the Senate of Ceylon for eight years, prior to that he was the vice-president of the Senate for six years. He was made a Knights Bachelor.

The Moscow-Pullman Daily News is a U.S. daily newspaper serving the Moscow, Idaho, and Pullman, Washington, metropolitan area. The two cities on the Palouse are the homes of the two states' land grant universities, the University of Idaho and Washington State University.
The newspaper has been published continuously in Moscow since September 28, 1911. It began as the "Daily Star-Mirror," which started as the "Moscow Mirror" in 1882 and the "North Idaho Star" in 1887, with a merger in 1905. A final intracity competitor was gained with the arrival of Frank B. Robinson's "Moscow News Review," which began in 1933 and went to daily publication in September 1935. The two papers merged in November 1939 and ran briefly under a lengthy combined name, then became the "Daily Idahonian."
The "Palouse Empire News" for Whitman County was added in 1984 and later became the "Daily News." Later in the 80s, the paper was acquired by Kerns-Tribune of Salt Lake City. The "Idahonian" and the "Daily News" were merged in late 1991 to become the "Moscow-Pullman Daily News." Kerns-Tribune was acquired by TCI in 1997; all the company's papers except "The Salt Lake Tribune" were acquired by Butch Alford the next year.
First editor.
The first editor of the "Moscow Mirror" was Willis Sweet (1856–1925), Idaho's first elected congressman following statehood in 1890. He had come to Moscow after learning the printer's trade in Nebraska; he was later an attorney, judge, and territorial supreme court justice. Sweet was instrumental in obtaining the University of Idaho for Moscow and was the first president of its board of regents (1889–1893).

Blue Mars (video game)

Blue Mars is a 3D massively multiplayer virtual world platform currently in open beta. 
The platform, being developed by Hawaii-based Avatar Reality, allows 3rd parties to create virtual worlds, MMOG games, simulations, shops, businesses, entertainment venues, clothing, custom avatars, furniture, virtual homes, and other items. It consists of four main parts: the client software, the Sandbox Editor SDK suite, the website, and the host servers.
It is often compared to Second Life, since both are virtual social worlds allowing user-created content.
According to Jim Sink, CEO of Avatar Reality, ""Blue Mars" was inspired by a vision of the future when the power to terraform whole worlds is within our grasp. The name "Blue Mars" represents possibility and hope."
Platform and Technology.
The editor suite is a free download after upgrading to a developer account. It currently consists of nine editors with specialized purposes (Animation, Block, Body, City, Cloth, Furniture, Interior, Item, and Shop), a developer version of the client software for testing, and reference and sample data.
Both the client software and Editor suite utilize the CryEngine 2 rendering engine originally developed by Crytek. The video game Crysis also runs on CryEngine 2. The graphics engine is being modified by Avatar Reality, and features not part of a combat game but needed for a virtual world are being added. Content can be created on many 3rd party 3D and graphics programs so long as they can output a COLLADA interchange file format 3D model or TIFF or Direct Draw Surface image formats. They are then converted to CryEngine native .cgf and .dds formats as needed via the provided development tools
The host servers deliver city data files, individual item and avatar files, and player interaction and updates when logged in. Currently in the demonstration stage is a "Fusion Render Cloud" system with remote rendering for devices without adequate graphics cards, and without the need for a client download and installation.
Gameplay.
The game takes place in 2177 on a terraformed Mars.
Avatars can freely move around in locations known as "cities" (similar to "islands" in Second Life), and interact with scripted objects and other avatars. Each location may have custom features added by the city designer for entertainment, game, shopping, business or other uses.
Internal "Blue Mars Dollars" are used for shopping and rentals. They can be bought with real money, earned within Blue Mars, and cashed out by developers via PayPal.
Development history.
June 2009 - Avatar Reality started closed beta testing
September 2, 2009 - Reached "open beta" status, with version 0.5822.
December 17, 2009 - version 0.6589 of the beta software was released.

Marilyn Okoro

Marilyn Chinwenwa Okoro (born 23 September 1984 in London) is a British athlete of Igbo Nigerian ancestry. She finished third in the 800 metres at both the 2007 and 2008 IAAF World Athletics Final. She was on the bronze winning 4 × 400 m relay at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. She represented Great Britain at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and finished sixth (1:59.53 mins) in the semifinals.
On 26 June 2007 Okoro graduated from the University of Bath with a B.A. degree in politics and French, then starting her first season as a full-time athlete. She speaks four languages (English, French, Spanish and Igbo) and sings in the jazz band The Felonius Monks.
Marilyn suffered an injury plagued 2009 outdoor season, though she battled through the pain barrier to finish a very credible 8th in the World Championships 800 m final in Berlin. Okoro was also included in the squad for the 4 × 400 m, but was not selected in the lineup to run in the final. During the 2009 winter Okoro, along with training partner Montell Douglas had major knee surgery to try to eradicate the problems that hit her '09 track season. There has been some criticism that the Lee Valley track produces more injuries than championship performances.
Marilyn has had a limited race schedule in 2010, but returned to a degree of form when taking bronze at the UK championships. Subsequently Okoro was selected to challenge for a medal in the 800 m alongside Jenny Meadows and Jemma Simpson at the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona. She finished 4th in her semi final, therefore did not progress to the final. Okoro recovered from that disappointment to run the second leg in the 4 × 400 bronze medal winning quartet alongside Nicola Sanders, Lee McConnell and Perri Shakes-Drayton, clocking 52.0 seconds for her leg. She also ran in the heat running 51.8 seconds. Vicki Barr replaced Shakes-Drayton in the heats.
Okoro has been criticised heavily for her front running tactics, most notably by UK Athletics head coach Charles Van Commenee, who described Okoro's performance in the 800 m at the 2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships as "naive and unprofessional". Following her non-selection for the 800 m event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Okoro accused Van Commenee of being "a bit of a bully."

Franca Visalta

Saint Franca Visalta (1170–1218), also known as Franca of Piacenza, was a Cistercian abbess.
Born in Piacenza, Italy, she became a Benedictine nun in St Syrus Convent at the age of seven and became abbess at a young age. However, she was removed and isolated because of the severe austerites she imposed. Only one nun, Carentia, agreed with Franca's discipline and she moved to a Cistercian convent in Rapallo. 
Franca then persuaded her parents to build a Cistercian house in Montelana where she and Carentia both entered. Franca became abbess and maintained the strict austerites on herself, even when her health was failing, and spent most nights praying for several hours in chapel. She later moved the Cistercian community to Pittoli, where she died in 1218. Saint Franca was canonised by Pope Gregory X.

Aleman (surname)

Aleman (also spelled "Alleman", "Allemand", "Aléman", "Allamont", "Allemagne", "Alemaye," "Alemán", and "Alamán") is a European surname deriving from the Latin surname, Alemannus, which refers to someone of German descent, specifically from the Alamanni tribe. It may also have been given in reference to the Norman region of Allemagne, to the south of Caen, which in turn refers to the Alamanni tribe. 
The possibly related surnames Alman and Allman have separate listings. 
Literally meaning "All Men," the name in French is "Allemand"; in Spanish, the term is "Alemán" or "Alamán"; the Catalan term is "Alemany"; the Italian term is "Allemano"; and the Portuguese term is "Alemão". The Alemannic tribe, along with the Goths, overran the part of the German Empire that lay along the Rhine river. Given that the women dressed and fought like men, the Germans said, "See there are no women among them. They are all men."

Venture debt

Venture debt or venture lending or "venture leasing" is a type of debt financing provided to venture-backed companies by specialized banks or non-bank lenders to fund working capital or capital expenses, such as purchasing equipment. Unlike traditional bank lending, venture debt is available to startups and growth companies that do not have positive cash flows or significant assets to use as collateral. Venture debt providers combine their loans with warrants, or rights to purchase equity, to compensate for the higher risk of default.
Types of venture debt.
Venture debt is typically structured as one of three types:
The venture lender effectively piggybacks on the due diligence done by the venture capital firm.
Financing terms.
Venture debt lenders expect returns of 12–25% on their capital but achieve this through a combination of loan interest and equity returns. The lender is compensated for the higher rate of perceived level of risk on these loans by earning incremental returns from its equity holding in companies that are successful and achieve a trade sale or IPO.
Equipment financing can be provided to fund 100% of the cost of the capital expenditure. Receivables financing is typically capped at 80–85% of the accounts receivable balance.
Loan terms vary widely, but differ from traditional bank loans in a number of ways:

2005 Connecticut Sun season

The 2005 WNBA season was their 7th season and their 3rd in Connecticut. The Sun attempted to return to the postseason for the third consecutive season and were successful. They also attempted to return to the WNBA Finals for the second consecutive year and were successful.
Schedule.
Playoffs.
In the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Sun had to face the Detroit Shock. Since the Sun had the better record, the series would be played with game 1 at Detroit, game 2 at Connecticut, and game 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. Even though Detroit had won three of the four regular season meetings, the Sun swept the Shock and game 3 was not needed.
In the second round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Sun had to face the Indiana Fever. Again, the Sun had the better record and the series would be played with game 1 at Indiana and games 2 and 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. The Sun swept the Fever and game 3 was not needed.
The Sun advanced to the WNBA Finals. The team would be facing off against the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sun had the better record so the series would be played with games 1, 2, and 5 at Connecticut and games 3 and 4 at Sacramento. In the regular season, the Sun had beaten the Monarchs in both meetings. It was not enough, however. The Monarchs beat the Sun 3 games to 1 to win the WNBA Finals.

<doc id="18904840" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18904840" title="Tom Nook">
Tom Nook

Tom Nook, known in Japan as , is a fictional character in the "Animal Crossing" series who operates the village store. He first appears in the Nintendo 64 game "Dōbutsu no Mori", released in Europe and North America on the Nintendo GameCube as "Animal Crossing". Nook sells a house to players at the beginning of each title in the series, giving them a set mortgage for them to pay and allowing them to upgrade it over time after the mortgage is paid off. He has made several appearances in the "Super Smash Bros." series as well. Nintendo's Treehouse localization members Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya argued that, in spite of his perceived greed, he is a nice person due to taking the risk of hiring someone who was new to the town.
Concept and characteristics.
Tom Nook is based on the Japanese Raccoon Dog (also known as a tanuki). While Tom Nook is considered to be greedy by 1UP.com, Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya, members of Nintendo's Treehouse localization team disagreed, describing him as a nice person. Amtower described him as "that first boss you ever had", adding that despite being all business and sometimes not having time for pleasantries, he is not a bad person. He adds that Nook's hiring of someone new to town involved risk, which shows generosity. Ninomiya agreed, and both felt that Nook's greed is diminished by the city's price index compared to that of his shop. Amtower jokingly alludes to an "anti-Nook bias" several times throughout the interview with 1UP.com.
Role in the series.
Tom Nook first appears in the Nintendo 64 title Dōbutsu no Mori (also available for the Nintendo GameCube as Animal Crossing) as the town's main shop owner and continues his job in the next two installments. Nook's role in the series remained virtually unchanged from 2001 until 2012 with the release of . In addition to being the main shop owner, Nook will also sell the player a house at the beginning of the game for around 19,800 bells (in game currency). Because the player will only have 1000 bells in his or her pocket, Nook will request that the player work in his shop for a bit to pay off some of the debt. The chores Nook assigns you to do are meant for the player to get used to the controls of the game. After planting flowers, writing letters, and talking to villagers the player is sent off to do whatever they want, but have to pay the remaining amount of their mortgage on their own. Each time a mortgage payment is completed Nook will upgrade or add on to the players house, each time putting the player more and more into debt to Nook, with the last addition being the most costly.
Nook's store also goes through three upgrades and changes throughout the game. The time of the upgrade depends on how many bells are spent in the store. Eventually his humble "Nook's Cranny" shack-like store with basic tools and very little objects to buy will become "Nookington's Department Store" - a large, two story building with a wide variety of items for purchase. It is in this expansion that the player meets his two nephews, Tommy and Timmy, who run the second floor of the store. In every game, no matter what upgrade the store is on, the items in the store will be changed everyday. This means that no two days will ever have the exact combination of items for sale. 
In "Animal Crossing", at the end of the month Nook will host a raffle with rare items to win. This was not continued in any sequel. 
In "Wild World", with the Nookington's expansion the player meets Harriet, a poodle who will do the players hair for 3000 bells.
In "City Folk", Harriet has moved her shop to the city. With the Nookington's expansion, Nook will randomly ask the player a series of questions. How the player answers could change the store to a former appearance. 
Nook returns in "". Instead of being the local shop owner, Nook is now in charge of "Nooks Homes" and instead sells things to upgrade the exterior of the players house. His nephews now run the town shop by themselves. 
In other media.
Tom Nook has made several minor appearances in the "Super Smash Bros." series of video games; appearing as various collectibles in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" and "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". as well as a background character on the Smashville stage, which is based on the Animal Crossing series. Tom Nook's shop music also features in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" as part of "Town Hall and Tom Nook's Store". Tom Nook has also been featured in several promotional items, including plush toys.
Reception.
Tom Nook has received mixed reception since his appearance in "Animal Crossing". IGN listed him as the ninth most-wanted character to appear in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". They describe him as devious, diabolical, and sinister, commenting that while he may not be a good fighter due to being from a video game without any fighting, they would enjoy seeing him get beaten up. Another article by IGN compares a talking baton given to the protagonist of "Major Minor's Majestic March" to Nook, calling it the second only to Nook in annoyance. GameSpy listed Tom Nook as one of their favourite bosses; editor Brian Altano specified that he passionately loves to hate Nook, stating that while he provides appreciated services to the small village, he keeps his reality grounded in that he lives in Nook's town, not his own. UGO.com ranked him the fifth best "Animal Crossing" character, stating that while Mr. Resetti was an irritant, Tom Nook was a jerk. They added that they love to hate him, jokingly suggesting that he was a "kingpin".
In spite of the negative reception, Tom Nook has received some positive reception. In author Katherine Isbister's book, "Better game characters by design: a psychological approach", she cites Tom Nook as an example of a mentor character, one who indirectly helps players. GamesRadar also listed him as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that he has earned his place amongst the hearts of gamers and people on the Internet as both a viral meme and a deceptively devious character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked Tom Nook as the 80th best villain in video games in their 2013 "Top 100", saying despite Raccoon are "stripy, furry and cute", "Tom Nook can go to Hell." That same year, "Complex" placed him as the 49th coolest video game villain of all time.
Game-studies scholar Ian Bogost described Nook as central to "Animal Crossing's" effective depiction of the economics of consumption and debt:
None of the townsfolk ever appear in Tom Nook's shop... In contrast, the player participates in a full consumer regimen; he pays off debt, buys goods, and sells goods. Tom Nook buys goods, which he converts to wealth. ... While the player spends more, Nook makes more. By condensing all of the environment's financial transactions into one flow between the player and Tom Nook, the game proceduralizes the redistribution of wealth in a manner even young children can understand. Tom Nook is a kind of condensation of the corporate bourgeoise.
Parody and analysis.
Tom Nook has been satirized in several articles, often compared to a mob boss or kingpin or otherwise a bad person. IGN listed him as the 72nd video game villain, suggesting that Tom Nook has a nice face, but the "cold, dead heart of a megalomaniac whose sole desire is to make a quick bell". Fellow IGN editor Patrick Kolan described Nook as the "Animal Crossing" equivalent of Al Swearengen, a pimp from the 1800s, due to his business sense, as well as both the character's position and disposition. Tom Nook has also been personified as a devious character, as well as a gangster, including an issue of the web comic VG Cats, which depicts him roughing up the player's character for his rent money. He has also appeared in the web comic PvP, in which Tom and Rowan threaten to destroy the players home for owing 500,000 bells. In a satirical article written by GamesRadar, they suggest that the cast of "Animal Crossing", most importantly Tom Nook, were setting the player up into a "furry cult". GameSpy listed Tom Nook as a video game character who would be disliked in real life, stating that he is annoying in the video games, and would be terrifying if he was a landlord in real life. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish, in his review of "Animal Crossing: Wild World", he makes a parody documentary of the in-game world. In it, he suggests that Tom Nook's keen business sense allows him to effectively control the village.

Otto Weiß (pilot)

Otto Albert Bernhard Weiß (25 September 1907 – 19 August 1955) was a German World War II Luftwaffe attack aircraft pilot and recipient of the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. He was the first attack aircraft pilot so honored. Weiß flew more than 500 combat missions with the Henschel Hs 123 and the Messerschmitt Bf 109.
Career.
Otto Weiß was born on 25 September 1907 in Breslau—today Wrocław in Poland—at the time a Silesian Province of the Kingdom of Prussia. He joined the police force ("Polizei") of the Weimar Republic on 15 April 1926 at police school in Frankenstein in Schlesien and was promoted to "Polizei-Leutnant" in 1931. He transferred to the "Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule" (German Air Transport School) in Braunschweig for pilot training on 1 March 1933. Weiß transferred to the Luftwaffe on 1 October 1934 holding the rank of "Oberleutnant" where he initially served as a technical officer with a reconnaissance squadron. From October 1936 to July 1938, now a "Hauptmann" (Captain), he served on the "Stab" of Jagdgeschwader 134 "Horst Wessel" (JG 134—134th Fighter Wing). In July 1938 he was appointed "Staffelkapitän" (Squadron Commander) of the "Fliegergruppe 40" (40th Flyers Group) which was later renamed to II.(S)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (II.(S)/LG 2—2nd Group (Ground Attack) of the 2nd Demonstration Wing).
Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, on 13 September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, he took command on the II.(S)/LG 2 following the death of its commander, "Major" Georg Spielvogel. For his services during the Polish Campaign he received both classes of the Iron Cross. During the Battle of France in 1940 as part of the VIII. "Fliegerkorps" (8th Air Corps), he supported the German advance of the 6th Army in its crossing of the Meuse river and successfully supported the repulse of a French armoured attack south-east of Cambrai. Weiß and his group were stationed roughly north of Cambrai at the time. A German reconnaissance aircraft, a Heinkel He 46, had spotted a French armoured column of 50 tanks supported by 150 trucks and infantry on the advance. Weiß organized the defense and led the attack from his Henschel Hs 123 ground attack aircraft. He had also informed the neighbouring fighter pilot group I./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG 21—21st Fighter Wing) under the command of "Hauptmann" Fritz Ultsch. The two groups were further supported by anti-aircraft artillery from I./Flak-Regiment 33. The combined German units under Weiß's leadership were credited with the destruction of 40 French tanks. For these achievements in the Battle of Montcornet, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 18 May 1940, the first attack aircraft pilot so honored. On 1 July 1940 Weiß was promoted to "Major".
Following the conversion to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at Braunschweig-Waggum, the "Gruppe" was tasked to attack various targets in Southern England during the Battle of Britain. The "Gruppe" was augmented again in early 1941 with a "Staffel" of Hs 123 ground attack aircraft. In the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, II.(S)/LG 2 was deployed with two squadrons Bf 109 and one squadron Hs 123. With the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the "Gruppe", consisting of three squadrons Bf 109 and one Hs 123, was again subordinated to the VIII. "Fliegerkorps" and fought in the central sector of the Eastern Front. In January 1942 the II(S)./LG 2 was re-designated and became the core of Schlachtgeschwader 1 (SG 1—1st Ground Attack Wing). Otto Weiß was appointed its first "Geschwaderkommodore" (Wing Commander).
Otto Weiß surrendered command of SG 1 to Hubertus Hitschhold on 18 June 1942. He was then tasked with experimenting with anti-tank warfare from the air. An experimental unit dubbed "Versuchskommando für Panzerbekämpfung" (experimental commando for anti-tank combat) was founded at Rechlin experimenting with the Junkers Ju 87 and Henschel Hs 129 in an anti-tank role. Weiß was promoted to "Oberst" (Colonel) on 1 November 1943 and served in the staff of Luftflotte 6 (Air Fleet 6) until the end of World War II. He died in Kiel on 19 August 1955 following a lengthy illness.

Battleship Illinois (replica)

Illinois was a detailed, full scale mockup of an , constructed as a naval exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893.
Background.
In the decade preceding the Columbian Exposition, the United States Navy initiated a fleet modernization program. Sometimes referred to as the 'New Navy', the first steel-hulled warships were constructed to replace the wooden and ironclad ships from the American Civil War period. In 1891, the first class of modern American battleships, the "Indiana"-class, was laid down. These warships included modern technologies absent in their Civil War-era predecessors, particularly electricity and electrically-driven devices.
When the Columbian Exposition was being planned, it was decided to showcase this new naval technology. However, the Rush–Bagot Treaty forbade warships to operate on the Great Lakes. Furthermore, a battleship built on the Great Lakes would have been confined there for its entire existence because, prior to opening of the Sanitary and Ship Canal in 1900, there was no way for it to leave. As a result, it was decided that a full-scale replica of a battleship would be constructed instead. This mock-up would permit the demonstration of new technologies being used in the "Indiana"-class warships. In keeping with the Navy's policy of naming battleships after states and in honor of the Exposition's location, the facsimile battleship was called "Illinois".
Construction.
"Illinois" was constructed alongside a pier and gave the appearance that she was moored to the wharf. She was designed by architect Frank W. Grogan, and built at a cost of $100,000.
A foundation of pilings and heavy timbers were built in Lake Michigan, at the north-east corner of the exposition grounds. The sides of "Illinois" were constructed of brick, plastered with cement. The hull structure was carefully constructed to match the contour of the "Indiana"-class warships.
A superstructure, redoubts, barbettes, turrets and main and secondary guns were assembled using wood framing, covered with cement and metal lathing. Fittings and details, such as anchors, torpedo nets, davits, railings, and a multitude of other details, gave the appearance of a functioning warship. Within the superstructure were berthing spaces, cabins, galley, and other living spaces all constructed to emulate realistic living conditions on American battleships. As a result of the attention to detail, "Illinois" was a faithful reproduction of a coastal battleship.
Exhibits.
One objective of the Columbian Exposition was to highlight electric generation technologies, and "Illinois" was no exception.
Because the hull was solid, no machinery or compartments were placed below the berth deck, the level just below the main deck. Instead, an electrical plant was installed on the main deck to provide power to 350 16-candlepower lamps, two 38,000 candlepower search lights, and a few electrical motors.
Two 16 kilowatt marine generators were also installed on "Illinois", and used to highlight their operation for visitors. However, the actual power for the ship came from a 500 volt, motor. The wiring on "Illinois" was done in accordance to naval regulations and was completely watertight.
"Illinois" was equipped with a complete set of navigation and running lights. Two large searchlights were also demonstrated to visitors. Additionally, "Illinois" had two Sturtevant blowers, and used in an on-board machine shop.
Crew.
A detachment of officers, sailors, and marines, were assigned to the "Illinois" by the Navy Department. The crew performed standard drills and duties as they would on a functioning warship. In addition to the crew assigned by the navy, custodial staff were attired in historic naval uniforms used between 1776 to 1848. "Illinois" was commanded by Commodore Richard Worsam Meade, and the Executive Officer was Lieutenant Commander E.D. Taussig, who would later claim Wake Island during the Spanish-American War.
Disposition.
Plans were made to move "Illinois" seven miles (11 km) north to the waterfront at the foot of Van Buren street, upon completion of the exposition. After the move, the "Illinois" was to serve as the headquarters for the newly formed Illinois Naval Militia. Despite skepticism that moving her was feasible, some foundation pilings were reportedly laid down at the new location starting 13 June 1894.
However, this plan was never fully realized, and like many of the other buildings constructed for the Columbian Exposition, "Illinois" was dismantled some time after the expo closed October 1893.
The bell of the "Illinois" is currently on display at Navy Pier in Chicago and is placed by the Richard H. Driehaus Galley of Stained Galley.

Costa Rican Department of Social Security

The Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance or "Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social" (as it is known in Spanish) is in charge of most of the nation's public health sector. Its role in public health (as the administrator of health institutions) is key in Costa Rica, playing an important part in the state's national health policy making. 
Its services are available to all citizens and permanent legal residents. This governmental entity's functions encompass both the administrative and functional aspects. It has the obligation (as a public institution) to formulate and execute health programs that are both preventive (such as: vaccination, informational, fumigation, etc.) and healing (such as: surgery, radiation therapy, pharmacy, clinical, etc.) in nature.
The Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance is also charged with the administration of the public pension system.
Internal Organization.
The Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance has a complex internal organization which administers and oversees all of the entity's actions in every aspect of its functions. It is strategically managed and administered by the Board of Directors, Executive Presidency, and six Managements. Additionally, it has a supervising body that oversees the administrative actions taken.
Executive Presidency.
The current Executive President is Dr. Ileana Balmaceda Arias. The Executive President also chairs the Board of Directors and is appointed by the government.
The Executive President is the highest office any one person can hold within the organization's hierarchy and is charged with the responsibility of executing the Board of Directors' decision. Among other functions, responsibilities, and obligations, the Executive President must coordinate with other government institutions wherever possible or needed.
Apart from having state given obligations (which are exposed in the national law) the Board of Directors can assign other corresponding responsibilities. The Executive President is obliged to provide exclusive services to the Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance; meaning that he or she may not hold any other public office or work independently while serving as Executive President.

Sidoine Benoît was a Benedictine monk of the 14th Century at the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, in the Calvados département in the Basse-Normandie region of France. Local legend credits him with inventing the dish "Tripes à la mode de Caen".
It was the use of cider and apple brandy in food that was Benoît's inspiration and contribution to French cuisine, making the insipid tripe dishes of the monks palatable. – Philéas Gilbert
"Tripes à la mode de Caen".
In its original form this dish consisted of all four chambers of a cow's stomach, part of the large intestine (this was outlawed in France in 1996), plus the hoofs and bones, cut up and placed on a bed of carrots, onions, leaks, garlic, cloves, peppercorns, a "bouquet garni", a bottle of cider and a glass of calvados in a "tripière" (a special earthenware pot for cooking tripe). Some sources include a large quantity of blanched beef fat. This was covered and hermetically sealed with dough and simmered in the oven for fifteen hours. The hoofs, bones and bouquet garni are removed before serving with a sprinkling of some more cider. 
Although this dish is prepared in Normandy throughout the year, locals believe that the dish is best in Autumn when the apple trees are bearing. Some of the fruit falls to the ground and is eaten by the cattle, along with the rich grasses of the season, imparting a distinctive flavour to the animal.
Although legend has it that William the Conqueror, Normandy's most famous notable, enjoyed this dish, he and Benoît were not even close contemporaries making this probably no more than a fable.

Puerto Rico Highway 183 is a main highway which begins in the downtown/business area of Caguas, near Puerto Rico Highway 1 and ends in Puerto Rico Highway 198 in Las Piedras. Measuring near 25 kilometers, it is real rural parallel road of Puerto Rico Highway 30, though it goes significantly south of the latter (through San Lorenzo) and the only municipality it does not go through which PR-30 does in Humacao. PR-183 can be accessed by two connectors from PR-30; PR-203 from Gurabo to San Lorenzo, and PR-204 (future) in Las Piedras, and they make their only direct intersection in Las Piedras (Exit 21). It is two-lane per direction in Caguas and becomes rural in the municipality just before entering San Lorenzo, and after its confusing intersection with PR-203 it becomes a small two-lane per direction again for about 4 kilometers, and then becomes rural for the rest of its length.

Inkognitogata 18 is the official residence of the Prime Minister of Norway. It is located in Oslo, the capital of Norway. The residence was completed in 2008 and is a complex of new and old buildings. It includes the original buildings on Parkveien 45, Inkognitogata 18, Riddervolds gate 2, which have been connected with new structures, and the gardens of Parkveien 45 to 47.
The private residence is in Inkognitogata 18 while the official residence and government representation rooms are in both Parkveien 45 and Inkognitogata 18. Riddervolds gate 2 is the official residence for visiting foreign dignitaries. The total complex has a building area of 3030 m2. Inkognitogata 18 has an area of 670 m2 with the private rooms consisting of 400 m2.
The project was led by Statsbygg and the architects for the new buildings were Riseng & Kiehl AS Arkitekter while Snøhetta designed the garden. The project had a total price of 315 million Norwegian kroner.
Parkveien 45 was the original residence but Villa Stenersen in Tuengen allé 10c has also served as the official Prime Minister's residence. The last prime minister to have lived in an official residence was Odvar Nordli, who lived in Villa Stenersen, but he moved out before his term ended and turned the residence over to Minister of Trade Hallvard Bakke. Nordli believed that Bakke, who lived in a small apartment with his wife and two children needed the living area more than Nordli and his wife did.
Individual buildings.
Parkveien 45.
Parkveien 45 used to be the official residence of the Prime Minister of Norway, but had not been used as such for many years. The Prime minister's safety has in later years become an important issue, and led to the idea of an official residence again. In the autumn of 2008 the residence was completed and the Prime Minister moved in with his family, so the country has a Prime Minister with an official residence.
The house on Parkveien 45 was originally built as a private residence for Fredrik Sundt, a businessman importing paraffin oil, hence the popular name of the house 'Villa Parafina'. The villa was purchased by the Norwegian government in 1896. From 1898 to 1908 it was used as the residence for the Prime Minister of Norway, housing Francis Hagerup, Johannes Steen, Otto Blehr, Christian Michelsen and Jørgen Løvland in succession. From 1908 the house was the residence of the Foreign minister until 1961 when it became the government representation house. The house is important in the history of Norway's independence negotiations with Sweden in 1905.

George Frederick "Peaches" Graham (March 23, 1877 – July 25, 1939) was a baseball catcher for the Cleveland Bronchos, Chicago Cubs, Boston Doves/Rustlers, and Philadelphia Phillies.
Born in Aledo, Illinois, Graham played seven seasons of Major League Baseball over the span of eleven years. He debuted in with the Bronchos as a second baseman, and came back in with the Cubs as a pitcher, but only pitched in one game, a loss. After a five-year hiatus, Graham returned in 1908 as a utility player with the Braves. He started games as a catcher, second baseman, outfielder, third baseman, and shortstop, but was predominantly a catcher. Graham was traded mid-season to the Cubs, but only played there for three months before being traded for Dick Cotter to Philadelphia, where he would finish his major league career after the season at the age of thirty-five.
He had a son, Jack, born in 1916, who would go on to play professional baseball. Graham died in Long Beach, California at the age of sixty-two.

Puerto Rico Highway 123

Puerto Rico Highway 123 is a secondary highway that connects the city Arecibo to the city of Ponce. It runs through the towns of Utuado and Adjuntas, before reaching Ponce. A parallel road is being built, PR-10, that is expected to take on most of the traffic currently using PR-123.
History.
The road dates from the late 19th century and it started as a road to link the coffee-farming mountain town of Adjuntas to the southern port city of Ponce for the export of coffee. Eventually the road was completed to the smaller northern port city of Arecibo as well, connecting the mountain town of Utuado in its way. 
PR-123 was built under the colonial government of Spain in Puerto Rico to connect the coffee-growing town of Adjuntas to the port city of Ponce as a farm-to-market road. 
The construction of the first Ponce to Adjuntas road got underway through the dedicated efforts of local political leader, attorney, and composer Olimpio Otero in the late nineteenth century. In 1903, the Puerto Rico Legislature named a bridge on the Ponce to Adjuntas section of the road to his memory for his outstanding dedication to the building of that stretch of the road. The bridge is located in the Magueyes barrio of the municipality of Ponce.
True to its farm-to-market purpose, PR-123 was designed to descend from the mountain town of Adjuntas and make its way through the Cordillera Central until it reached the city of Ponce, edging Plaza Las Delicias, located just two blocks from the Plaza del Mercado de Ponce fruits-and-vegetables central market place. The road then continued south to the port of Ponce where coffee and other farm products were shipped to the United States and Europe. 
Prior to the construction of a new road (see PR-10) that took its number, the road was signed "PR-10". This route signing for this old, winding road can still be seen in some old street maps of the city of Ponce. 
The stretch from Ponce to Adjuntas was built under the Spanish government. The remainder of the route to Arecibo was built after the Americans took over in 1898. This second stretch opened on July 1, 1904. The whole course of the road from its southern end in Ponce to its northern end in Arecibo was signed as "Road No. 6" in those days.
Navigating this first PR-10 road was very tedious as the road was engineered to run from mountainside to mountainside, following the contours of the mountains, and along the natural definitions of the course of rivers, to reach its destination. Such design, however, limited considerably the speed of travel. It was also necessary to drive through the congested downtown areas of the various towns and villages in the way to get from one terminus of the road to the other, something that proved to be very time-consuming as vehicular traffic in those towns and villages increased. Despite these drawbacks, the road was heavily used for many decades. However, as traffic on this road increased in the 1950s and 1960s, the road started to show its limits.
Characteristics.
The road is prone to landslides and closings due to frequent heavy rains.

PTW Architects

PTW Architects is an Australian architecture firm founded in Sydney in 1889.
History.
PTW Architects (formerly Peddle Thorp & Walker) was established in Sydney by James Peddle in 1889. James Peddle was notable in the domestic field, adapting the practice of architecture he learned in England and the USA to the Sydney climate and conditions. Samuel George Thorp was made a partner of the firm soon after his award-winning entry for Sydney's first planned garden suburb Daceyville in 1912. In 1924 H. Ernest Walker joined as the third partner bringing an interest in efficiency and technology developed while working for major American firms in the 1920's. Henceforth the firm was known as Peddle Thorp & Walker and the office began to diversify from a purely domestic practice to one that also excelled at commercial and industrial architecture.
During the years of the Second World War, PTW continued to practice with numerous defence projects awarded to it by the Commonwealth Department of Works. In the mid-1950's the massive growth of Australia's built environment saw PTW grow under the leadership of the late Graham Thorp to dominate the commercial building market, for which it is still renowned. The 120 metre high AMP Tower at Circular Quay built in Sydney in 1962 was the first office building to break the 50 metre-height limit imposed in 1912. It was not only a physical landmark, but reached a standard of architectural refinement rare in such buildings at that time. Since then, PTW has been responsible for more than 50 commercial office buildings in Sydney and more than 150 throughout Australia, New Zealand and South-East Asia. PTW is also responsible for the bulk of the Harbour waterfront development opportunities in Sydney; most recently with Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners on the Barangaroo project. 
Since the late 1980's PTW has become a highly diversified architectural practice. The firm has developed an established profile in masterplanning and architecture over a diversity of building types including commercial, residential and institutional developments with particular specialities in the design of sporting venues and buildings for the arts.
Contributing to the firm’s projects is the ability to create buildings where commercial objectives are balanced with cultural and public uses, leading to the enhancement of the public realm and a city’s facilities. This can be seen in projects such as the Walsh Bay Redevelopment, Angel Place and City Recital Hall, the recently completed extension of the National Gallery of Australia, the Forum Development, and East Circular Quay. 
PTW Architects has also made a point of developing techniques and relationships that allow the firm to create genuine partnerships with other architectural firms and specialist consultants, sharing specialised knowledge and awareness of local context and culture amongst a project’s designers.

Michael Cremo

Michael A. Cremo (born July 15, 1948), also known by his devotional name Drutakarmā dāsa, is an American freelance researcher who identifies himself as a Vedic creationist and argues that humans have lived on the earth for billions of years. In case of artifacts allegedly found in the Eocene auriferous gravels of Table Mountain, California and discussed in his book, "Forbidden Archeology", Cremo argues for the existence of modern man on Earth as long ago as 30 to 40 million years ago. "Forbidden Archeology", which he wrote with Richard L. Thompson, has attracted attention from mainstream scholars who have critiqued the views given on archeology and have referred to it as being pseudoscientific for a variety of reasons.
Early life and education.
Cremo was born in Schenectady, New York. Cremo's father, Salvatore Cremo, was a United States military intelligence officer. Michael Cremo lived with his family in Germany, where he went to high school. They spent several summers traveling throughout Europe. He attended George Washington University from 1966 to 1968, then served in the United States Navy.
Religious views.
Cremo is a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and the Bhaktivedanta Institute. He has written several books and articles about Hindu spirituality under the name "Drutakarmā dāsa". He has also been a contributing editor to the magazine "Back to Godhead" and a bhakti yoga teacher. Cremo told "Contemporary Authors" that he decided to devote his life to Krishna in the early 1970s, after receiving a copy of the "Bhagavad Gita" at a Grateful Dead concert. In the end of 1990s he authored a paper on the official ISKCON statement on capital punishment. His work on "Puranic Time and the Archaeological Record" was published in "ISKCON Communications Journal" and "Time and Archaeology".
Forbidden Archeology.
The book's central claim is that humans have lived on the earth for tens to hundreds of millions of years, and that the scientific establishment has suppressed the fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. In case of "grooved spheres" from pyrophyllite mines of Ottosdal, South Africa, this book proposes that they might be manmade artifacts as much as 2.8 billion years old. Forbidden Archeology has been critiqued by mainstream scholars from a variety of disciplines.
Recent years.
In recent years, Cremo has organized a number of conferences where ISKCON-associated academics exchanged views and experiences. In March 2009, Cremo appeared in a History Channel television series called "Ancient Aliens", and in 2010 a mini series of the same name.

PONCHO

The Patrons of Northwest Civic, Cultural and Charitable Organizations (PONCHO) is a non-profit corporation in Seattle, Washington, whose annual fund-raising auction has long played a significant role in funding the arts in Seattle. However, over the years, the gala auction slowly ceased to be profitable and will not occur after 2008, being replaced by smaller art and wine auctions. Janet True, president of the PONCHO board, has indicated that the gala auction will probably be replaced by something parallel to New York City's Tony Awards.
The group was founded in 1963 to hold an auction to retire the US$35,000 debt accumulated by the Seattle Symphony's critically successful performance of Verdi's "Aida" at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, the Century 21 Exposition. They exceeded their goal, raising enough additional money to give $50,000 to the Symphony to help establish the Seattle Opera, as well as $15,000 to the Council on Aging and $1,000 to the Seattle Chorale. In the subsequent 45 years, PONCHO has raised over $33 million for more than 200 Seattle-area arts organizations. Significant beneficiaries other than the Symphony and Opera have included the Pacific Northwest Ballet, Seattle Art Museum, Seattle Repertory Theatre, and ACT.
Brendan Kiley of Seattle alternative weekly "The Stranger", writing on the occasion of PONCHO executive director Gordon Hamilton's forced departure in July 2008, sees PONCHO as gradually shifting from being a "deep donor" to large arts institutions into a "broad donor" whose beneficiaries have come to include smaller groups.

Anthony Ross (priest)

Fr Ian Anthony Ross (14 June 1917 – 24 May 1993) was a Scottish born Catholic priest and member of The Order of Preachers (Dominican). He was also a noted broadcaster, writer, community activist, educator and antiquarian who served as Rector of the University of Edinburgh (1979–1982).
Early life.
Born near Beauly, Inverness-shire, Scotland, Anthony Ross was brought up Free Presbyterian, attending school in Beauly and then Inverness Royal Academy. He won an award to Edinburgh University, where he edited his first book at the age of twenty-two. On converting to Catholicism while an undergraduate, he was cut off financially by his family. He entered the Order of Preachers (Dominican Order, Blackfriars, Ordo Praedicatorum) as a novice in 1939 at Woodchester, Gloucestershire in 1939, made his profession on 19 October 1940, and was ordained priest on 29 September 1945. An autobiography, "The Root of The Matter:Boyhood,Manhood & God", (Mainstream 1989), deals with his early life prior to joining the Order of Preachers.
Career.
After obtaining his lectorate he returned to Edinburgh in 1947 to begin postgraduate studies on the Order in Scotland after the Reformation. However in 1950 he was assigned to teach at Hawkesyard. He was elected Prior of Woodchester a year later and then in 1954 went to Laxton Hall where he was a popular teacher. Returning to Edinburgh in 1959, he exerted wide influence throughout Scotland. Fr Ross was a pivotal figure in setting up a number of important and radical initiatives in Edinburgh to deal with the problem of homelessness in the late 1960s and 1970s, notably The Skippers Cafe in the Cowgate and The Edinburgh Cyrenians. He was the founder of "The Innes Review" and of the Scottish Catholic Historical Association and vice-chairman of the Parole Board for Scotland. In this latter role he was a key figure in the establishment and development of the Special Unit at HM Prison Barlinnie in Glasgow. In 1979 he was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh.
Later life.
In 1982 he was elected Provincial but six months later suffered a stroke. He bore the limitations on his activities with patience, re-learning to speak and to write. In 1988 he published an autobiography. He died peacefully at Blairgowrie, near Perth, aged 78 with 52 years of profession and 47 years of priesthood.
Quotes.
"We will attempt to make truth known without suppression or distortion,believing this to be not only a scientific but also a religious duty."("The Position of The Innes Review",Vol. 2, Innes Review, 1950.)
"After what we have known recently of totalitarian ruthlessness, of gas chambers, the atom bomb, napalm, brain-washing and "double-think", the actions of sixteenth-century statesmen and soldiers can hardly shock us as they shocked our grandparents. We understand better now, perhaps, the recurrent perversions in human behaviour and the difficulties men have in dealing justly and humanely with swiftly moving events; the difficulty of knowing what should be tolerated when the safety of the commonweal is threatened; of distinguishing between sin and crime; of remembering the fundamental rights of another person when we are outraged in our own being by his deeds." ("Reformation and Repression", Vol. 10, Innes Review,1958).
"Christianity if taken seriously is revolutionary in its effects on individuals and on societies. For most of our history it has been too often a tool of political interests, in return for support of its own institutional structures and property, acquiescing in the misery and injustice which it should have made impossible".

<doc id="18905366" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18905366" title="Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field">
Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field

The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, also called the Clearwater Cone Group, is a potentially active monogenetic volcanic field in east-central British Columbia, Canada, located approximately north of Kamloops. It is situated in the Cariboo Mountains of the Columbia Mountains and on the Quesnel and Shuswap Highlands. As a monogenetic volcanic field, it is a place with numerous small basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows.
Most of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is encompassed within a large wilderness park called Wells Gray Provincial Park. This park was established in 1939 to protect Helmcken Falls and the unique features of the Clearwater River drainage basin, including this volcanic field. Five roads enter the park and provide views of some of the field's volcanic features. Short hikes lead to several other volcanic features, but some areas are accessible only by aircraft.
Geology.
Pleistocene epoch.
Based on radiocarbon and potassium-argon dating, volcanic activity in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field began in the early Pleistocene epoch, creating valley-filling and plateau-capping lava flows that have a total volume of approximately . The emplacement of these lava flows spanned at least three periods of glaciation, evidence for which is preserved in the form of tuyas, ice-ponded valley deposits, and subglacial mounds. The few tuyas in the region, such as Gage Hill, Hyalo Ridge, McLeod Hill and Mosquito Mound, were formed when magma intruded into and melted a vertical pipe in the overlying glacial ice. The partially molten mass cooled as a large block, with gravity flattening its upper surface. The glacial erosion of the tuyas suggests they erupted during the early Pleistocene epoch.
At least one explosive subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous volcano, known as White Horse Bluff, is thought to have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The volcano heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments. Once the steam explosions had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water, creating the unvolcano-like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite. The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water.
Other volcanic events elsewhere interacted with groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters have been filled with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluval sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form the volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over nearly all of the volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.
Holocene epoch.
At the end of the last ice age approximately 10,000 years ago, massive floods from the melting glacial ice carved deep canyons into the underlying plateau-capping lava flows. Most of these canyons contain rivers such as the Murtle and Clearwater, and waterfalls such as Canim Falls, Moul Falls, Spahats Falls and the high Helmcken Falls. The faces of the basaltic lava flows and waterfalls remain vertical due to the nature of the basaltic lava flows. Basaltic lava shrinks as it cools and forms vertical columns of rock called columnar basalt. More recently, the southern end of the volcanic field has experienced continuous volcanic activity since the end of the last ice age. This volcanic activity occurred in three areas; Spanish Creek, Ray Lake and Kostal Lake which were followed by lava fountain eruptions creating cinder cones and lava flows. 
Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake areas were synglacial but continued after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, were created in the Spanish Creek area. Lava flows from the two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age. 
Eruptions near Ray Lake built a cinder cone known as Dragon Cone and concluded with an approximately long aā lava flow that has been radiocarbon dated at about 7,600 years old. This lava flow, known as "Dragon's Tongue", is at least thick at the proximal end, but thins to at the distal end, damming the southern end of Clearwater Lake. Tree molds are maintained within the lava flow at the lower end.
The latest volcanic eruption created a small tree-covered basaltic cinder cone at the east end of Kostal Lake called Kostal Cone perhaps as recently as 400 years ago, making it one of the youngest volcanoes in Canada based on tree-growth data.
Origins.
The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field began forming approximately 3,500,000 years ago and has grown steadily since then. The tectonic causes of the volcanism that have produced the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field are not yet clear and are therefore a matter of ongoing research. It is approximately inland from the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is along-strike from the Nootka Fault on the British Columbia Coast, which has been subducting under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. The Wells Gray volcanics are mostly alkali olivine basalt, with some lava flows comprising mantle xenoliths. Basalts of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field have been considered to be the easternmost expression of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. However, its relationship is unknown because the age-location trend does not reach into the Wells Gray-Clearwater area, and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is not along trend with the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The Wells Gray volcanics were thought to have formed by crustal thinning and the existence of crustal penetrating structures.
More recent studies by volcanologists associated with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be the primary cause of the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.
Lava composition.
The composition of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals that come from the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain are similar to those erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.
Holocene lava flows are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and comprise several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths do not exist in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.
Current activity.
The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity; the others are Castle Rock, Mount Edziza, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. Beneath areas of monogenetic cinder cone activity, such as the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, the seismicity appears to be more dispersed. In a few cases earthquakes are clustered in time and space, suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms.
Volcanic hazards.
Lava eruptions.
Because the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is in a remote location, danger from lava eruptions would be low to moderate. Magma with low levels of silica (as in basalt) commonly extend tens of kilometers from the volcano's vent. The leading edges of basalt flows can travel as fast as on steep slopes but they typically advance less than on gentle slopes. But when basalt lava flows are confined within a channel or lava tube on a steep slope, the main body of the flow can reach velocities more than . Based on past volcanic activity, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field has a long history of producing quiet lava fountaining-style eruptions. Such eruptions consist of ejection of incandescent cinder, lapilli and lava bombs to altitudes of tens to hundreds of metres. They are small to medium in volume, with sporadic violence. Since the region is mostly forested and lava flows are likely to travel long distances, it is possible lava eruptions could start large forest fires and some river valleys might be dammed.
Explosive eruptions.
More violent eruptions are possible only in unique circumstances, such as an eruption into a lake. Any future eruption is most likely to affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.
Monitoring.
Currently the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcanic field's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the volcanic field. It may sense an increase in activity if the volcanic field becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only after the volcanic field has started erupting.
A possible way to detect an eruption is studying the volcanic field's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behaviour, in terms of its eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned in part because of the volcanic field's remoteness.
While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required. Benefit-cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards. However, a benefit-cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types, magnitudes and occurrences. These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required.
Other volcanic techniques, such as hazard mapping, displays a volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. At present no hazard maps have been created for the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and other volcanic areas in British Columbia is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley. An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.
The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975, although it remained small in population until 1985. Apart from a few short-term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada, no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes. Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately , and frequently within , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors, particularly for earthquake depth. Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption, offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk. Currently the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field does not have a seismograph closer than . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity, the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases, and the network becomes not as accurate. However, at least one possible volcanic earthquake swarm has been noticed east of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field are a few kilometers, and in more isolated northern regions they are up to . The location magnitude level in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is about magnitude 1 to 1.5, and elsewhere it is magnitude 1.5 to 2. At carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption. Undetected events are not recorded or surveyed in British Columbia immediately, nor in an easy-to-access process.
In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, particularly if no events were observed; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice.

Salut d'Amour

Salut d’Amour, Op. 12, is a musical work composed by Edward Elgar in 1888, originally written for violin and piano.
History.
Elgar finished the piece in July 1888, when he was engaged to be married to Caroline Alice Roberts, and he called it ""Liebesgruss"" ('Love’s Greeting') because of Miss Roberts’ fluency in German. When he returned home to London on 22 September from a holiday at the house of his friend Dr. Charles Buck, in Settle, he presented it to her as an engagement present. Alice, for her part, offered him a poem called ""The Wind at Dawn"" which she had written years before and which he soon set to music.
The dedication was in French: ""à Carice"". ""Carice"" was a combination of his wife's names "Car"oline Al"ice", and was the name to be given to their daughter born two years later.
It was not published by Schott & Co. until a year later, and the first editions were for violin and piano, piano solo, cello and piano, and for small orchestra. Few copies were sold until Schott changed the title to ""Salut d’Amour"" with "Liebesgruss" as a sub-title, and the composer’s name as 'Ed. Elgar'. The French title, Elgar realised, would help the work to be sold not only in France but in other European countries: Schott was a German publisher, with offices in Mainz, London, Paris and Brussels.
The first public performance was of the orchestral version, at a Crystal Palace concert on 11 November 1889, conducted by August Manns.
The work's first recording was made in 1915 for The Gramophone Company with an orchestra conducted by the composer.
""Salut d'amour"" is one of Elgar's best-known works and has inspired numerous arrangements for widely varying instrumental combinations. It was even arranged as a song ""Woo thou, Sweet Music"" with words by A. C. Bunten.

James II, Count of Urgell

James II (in Catalan "Jaume II d'Urgell" or "Jaume el Dissortat" "James the Unfortunate", in Spanish "Jayme II de Urgel") (1380 – 1 June 1433) was the Count of Urgell (1408–1413), Viscount of Àger, and lord of Antillón, Alcolea de Cinca, and Fraga. Scion of a younger branch of the House of Barcelona and its last male member, he was the centre of opposition to the House of Trastámara after its succeeded to the Crown of Aragon in 1412.
Born at Balaguer to Peter II of Urgell and Margaret of Montferrat, he inherited the county of Urgell from his father in 1408. In Valencia on 29 June 1407, he had married Isabella, daughter of Peter IV of Aragon and sister of Martin the Humane, who appointed him lieutenant of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1408.
Following the death in 1409 of Martin the Younger, heir to the Aragonese Crown, the king appointed James governor-general, an act interpreted by James as implying his heirdom. Following the death of the king in 1410, however, James was one of the six candidates who claimed the throne. Succession through the male line, as ordained in the will of James I of Aragon, would have given him the crown, but through the Compromise of Caspe, Ferdinand of Antequera was elected instead.
Influenced by his mother, Margaret of Montferrat, and by Antón de Luna, James II of Urgell refused to recognise Ferdinand as king and took up arms against him. Defeated at Castefrorite and Montearagón, James took refuge in the castle of Balaguer which was under siege by the royal troops. He surrendered on the 31 October 1413 and was imprisoned in Teruel and then Játiva where he died twenty years later.
James had four daughters and one son:

Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)

William Erasmus "Bill" Compton is a fictional character from the "The Southern Vampire Mysteries/Sookie Stackhouse" series by author Charlaine Harris. He is a vampire and is introduced in the first novel in the series, "Dead Until Dark," and has appeared in all of the novels since.
Human life.
In the book series, Bill was born on April 9, 1840. He lived in Bon Temps, Louisiana, and fought for the South during the Civil War. He was a married farmer with three children (there is inconsistency in the storyline, with Bill telling Sookie that he had five living children with his wife in "Dead Until Dark"). On November 20, 1868, some years after the war, he was made a vampire by Lorena, with whom he had a long and stormy relationship. Later in the book series, Bill discovers that he is related to the Bellefleur family in Bon Temps and secretly provides them with funds to aid in the repair of their ancestral home. The Bellefleurs, who do not know he is the source of the income, dislike him, though he briefly assisted Portia Bellefleur during her murder investigation in "Living Dead in Dallas".
In "Living Dead in Dallas" Bill's middle name is given as Thomas, rather than Erasmus.
Work and position within vampire hierarchy.
At the end of the first novel, "Dead Until Dark", Bill is concerned about the power of Area Five sheriff Eric over him and Sookie. He decides to apply for that area's investigator position and he gets it. It was revealed that Bill works for Queen Sophie-Anne and she has sent him to Bon Temps to seduce Sookie Stackhouse and investigate her telepathic abilities.
Bill is also the creator of a valuable database in which all the vampires in North America are listed along with their significant information. Vampires from other areas of the world, such as Peru, have also provided information for this database. The database itself has been controversial because of potential security issues and is only available for purchase to other vampires. While most older vampires have good memories, Bill's ability to recall precise details, faces and conversations is reputed to be exceptional, even among other long-lived supernaturals.
Romantic relationships.
In the first book, "Dead Until Dark," Bill has returned to his ancestral home in Bon Temps, which is separated from the Stackhouse home by the Bon Temps cemetery. After briefly meeting Sookie at her place of work, Merlotte's bar, Sookie saves Bill from being "drained" by the Rattrays, a husband and wife who sell vampire blood for profit. Bill later saves Sookie by giving her his blood when the Rattrays seek revenge. They subsequently embark on Sookie's first serious romantic relationship. Sookie has to endure a fair amount of dislike from the Bon Temps locals, who dislike Bill because he is a vampire. 
Sookie and Bill's relationship falls apart when Bill is called back to his maker, Lorena, who entraps him in Mississippi to gain control of a project on which Bill is working for Sophie-Anne. After being rescued by Sookie and Eric, an injured Bill drains and rapes Sookie in the trunk of the getaway vehicle. Their relationship ends, and is dealt a further and final blow in Definitely Dead when Eric discovers and immediately discloses to Sookie that Bill came to Bon Temps on a mission to secure her telepathic abilities for use by Louisiana's vampire Queen. 
Bill continues to appear in the novels however his relationship with Sookie is not romantic in nature, and by the events of Dead Reckoning he has become a trusted friend. 
In the third book, "Club Dead," Lorena is introduced as Bill's maker and sire. They were lovers since Bill became a vampire and they had an intense relationship. They broke up eighty years ago. In this novel, Bill tells Sookie that he had gone to Jackson because Lorena had called him and he was obeying her summons. Before leaving, he tells Sookie that if he has not returned or been heard from in eight weeks, she should go to Eric and place herself under his protection. According to Bill, Lorena ordered him to leave Sookie and threatened to kill her. While Bill is with Lorena, it is revealed by Eric and Pam that he had contacted them and told them he was leaving Sookie and he wanted to make financial arrangements for her care.
Salome is mentioned in the book Dead as a Doornail She owns a Casino called "Siete Velos" and is the maker of a vampire called Mickey.
Following his broken relationship with Sookie, Bill briefly dated a real estate agent named Selah Pumfrey. Bill makes it obvious that he still carries a torch for Sookie and continues to try to be involved in her life, he uses Selah to try and make Sookie jealous, therefore objectifying both Sookie and Selah.
Bill's "sister" who looks like his former human wife, was turned by Lorena Ball in an attempt to placate Bill after he was caught staring fondly at Judith. Reunited only recently by Sookie's interference in "Dead In The Family" in order to save him from silver-poisoning, Judith and Bill's affair only lasted one book, as she has recently left Bon Temps in "Dead Reckoning." Not knowing Judith was standing within earshot in the treeline behind Sookie's house, Bill tells Sookie that Judith is obsessed with him and although he had hoped to return her love he does not. A dignified Judith reacts and vampires out of his life, for now. Bill then confesses he felt obligated to have sex with Judith after his healing but he yet again expresses his feelings for Sookie, continuing the cycle of obsessive love in the Ball family.
Bill's wife and mother of his two children.
Television portrayal.
In "True Blood", an HBO series based on the books, this character is played by British actor Stephen Moyer. The storyline of Bill differs significantly from that in the novels. In season one, as a punishment for staking a vampire, Bill is forced to turn a teenage girl named Jessica Hamby into a vampire, thus creating his first and only progeny in the series. In season 3, Bill has his maker, Lorena, staked by Sookie. In desperate need of blood, Sookie slits her arm to feed him. However, he quickly overpowers her and nearly drains her to death before realizing his actions. After being kicked out into the sunlight by an enraged Tara, he learns that faery blood temporarily makes vampires immune to the sun. In season 4, Bill is named the vampire king of Louisiana after staging a coup d'état against Queen Sophie Anne with the help of the Authority. In season 5, he and Eric Northman are arrested for the murder of Nan Flanigan. The two are brought to the Authority's underground base, where he eventually accepts the Book of Lilith. Bill is left competing with Salome for the vial of Lilith's blood, which he eventually wins by killing her. After drinking Lilith's blood, despite Eric and Sookie trying to convince him not to, Bill begins to bleed out and dies. Moments later, however, he is resurrected as a more powerful vampire, now having the strength of Lilith as well. While the extent of his new powers are not fully understood, it has been revealed in season 6 that he is impervious to staking, he no longer needs an invitation to enter a human home, and that he involuntarily has visions of the future. He is also able to command Warlow, Lilith's only known progeny and Sookie's love interest. After drinking Warlow's blood, Bill is able to walk in the sun. Using this power, he is able to kill Governor Truman Burrell and his guards in an effort to save Jessica.

2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final

The 2008 All-Ireland Hurling Final was a hurling match played on 7 September 2008 in Croke Park, Dublin, between Kilkenny and Waterford. The match was the 121st All-Ireland Hurling Final and the culmination of the 2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. It was the fourth time that the teams will have played each other in the final, having played each other previously in 1957, 1959 and 1963. Kilkenny won their 31st All-Ireland Championship and in doing so overtook Cork on the roll of honour. The Kilkenny win witnessed the county doing 3 in a row for the first time since 1913. The match represented Waterford's sixth appearance in the All-Ireland Final and their first for 45 years since 1963. Waterford have not won the All-Ireland Championship since 1959.
Previous championship encounters.
This particular fixture has been infrequent in the history of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship due to the provincial structure of the championship from 1888 to 1996. Kilkenny have played Waterford a total of six times in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Kilkenny have 4 victories, Waterford have one and the remaining fixture ended as a draw. The last encounter between the two teams occurred in 2004 where a Henry Shefflin-inspired Kilkenny side ran out semi-final winners on a scoreline of Kilkenny 3–12, Waterford 0–18.
Paths to final.
Kilkenny.
Kilkenny's path to the All-Ireland Hurling Final turned out to be a more straight forward affair in comparison to Waterford. Kilkenny's Leinster Championship campaign started off in O'Moore Park, Portlaoise on 15 June 2008 against Offaly. The match turned out to be a very one-sided affair with Henry Shefflin scoring 11 points on his return from a long term injury. Kilkenny eventually ran out easy winners on a scoreline of Kilkenny 2–24 Offaly 0–12. Kilkenny moved onto the Leinster Hurling Final where they would face a Wexford side who took a replay to defeat Dublin in the other semi-final. As in previous year, the Leinster Final also turned out to be a one sided affair. Wexford stuck with Kilkenny for the first half but the cats pulled away in the second half, essentially killing off Wexford's challenge with 4 goals in the second half. Kilkenny became Leinster Champions for the ninth time in ten years on a scoreline of Kilkenny 5–21 Wexford 0–17.
After the completion of the All-Ireland Qualifier Series, Cork revealed themselves to be Kilkenny's All-Ireland Semi-final opponents. The fixture was much hyped by the Irish media, in light of both teams' respective records over the past 5 years. A large crowd at Croke Park viewed an entertaining match which pitted the 2006 finalists against each other. The sides stuck with each other, point for point at the start, resulting in a score of 6 points each after 20 minutes. However, Cork went without a score for a long period of the first half resulting in Kilkenny leading by 8 points at half time. Cork opened the second half with a barrage of points, but Kilkenny held strong and ran out 9-point winners – Kilkenny 1–23 Cork 0–17. Kilkenny qualified for their eighth final in ten years.
Waterford.
Waterford started off the year with a Munster Championship first round clash with Clare at the Gaelic Grounds, Limerick on 1 June 2008. Waterford, missing a number of first team regulars such as Ken McGrath, Eoin Kelly and Eoin Murphy succumbed to a youthful Clare team on a scoreline of Waterford 0–23 Clare 2–26. Soon after the game, manager, Justin McCarthy was fired from his position by the Waterford County Board. It has been rumoured at the time that player unrest had a lot to do with the decision. The Waterford County Board acted quickly and appointed former Clare goalkeeper Davy Fitzgerald as new Waterford manager on 10 June 2008. The loss to Clare sent Waterford into the All-Ireland Qualifier Series. The first round match against Antrim saw the return of both Ken McGrath and Eoin Kelly. Davy Fitzgerald started his Waterford managerial career with the unusual decision of placing Ken McGrath at full back in order to strengthen the full back line. The decision paid off and the match turned out to be a complete mismatch, with Waterford running out winners on a scoreline of Waterford 6–18 Antrim 0–15.
Waterford were then pitted against Offaly in their Phase 4 Qualifier on 19 July 2008 at Semple Stadium, Thurles. After a stern test in the first 60 minutes, Waterford eventually pulled away towards the end winning on a scoreline of Waterford 2–18 Offaly 0–18. This resulted in Waterford reaching the All-Ireland Quarter Finals and a match-up against Leinster runners-up Wexford. This was a competitive match which toed and froed from one side to the other. However, a late barrage of points saw Waterford over the endline on a scoreline of Waterford 2–19 Wexford 3–15. The win against Wexford lead Waterford to their sixth All-Ireland Semi-Final since 1998. The opponents would be a highly fancied Tipperary, who were reigning National Hurling League and Munster champions. Waterford started a blistering page, going 0–6 to 0–0 up after 8 minutes. However Tipperary were level going in at half time. Both teams scored goals in rapid succession in the 2nd half. Waterford's nerve held, and they managed to win by two points on a scoreline of Waterford 1–20 Tipperary 1–18. It was Waterford's first semi-final win since 1963 and brought to an end a run of 5 consecutive semi-final defeats.
Television and Radio Coverage.
As with previous years, the Irish state broadcaster, Radio Telefís Éireann will provide both television and radio coverage for the event. As well as showing the senior game, RTÉ will also provide coverage of the All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship Final on the day along with a suitable build up to the game in the preceding days. Irish satellite sports channel, Setanta Sports will provide coverage on the day for Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States of America. The British Broadcasting Corporation provides coverage in Northern Ireland, although viewers may also be able to watch the RTÉ coverage through different mediums. Ger Canning will commentate on RTÉ's television coverage. It was Canning's twenty third time doing the live match commentary for RTÉ.
Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh provide commentary for RTÉ radio with the match being broadcast on both FM and LW. Radio coverage was also provided by numerous Irish local radio stations, most notably, WLR FM and KCLR 96FM.

La Guerra Gaucha (novel)

La Guerra Gaucha is the first book, outside of his published poems of the Argentine writer Leopoldo Lugones (1874–1938) which he wrote in 1905. It is a book of stories about the gaucho guerrilla war they fought, commanded by Martín Miguel de Güemes, against the Spanish royalist during the Argentine War of Independence, between 1815 and 1825. It is written in the fictional gaucho slang of the time and it is difficult to understand for anyone not versed in it. The strengtth of the epic nature of the stories made it a very successful book. Based on this book, years later in 1941, it was adapted to the screen for the film "La Guerra Gaucha", directed by Lucas Demare, with a screenplay by Ulyses Petit de Murat and Homero Manzi and with starring Enrique Muiño, Francisco Petrone, Ángel Magaña, Sebastián Chiola and Amelia Bence, among others.
Characteristics.
To write the book, Lugones travelled to Salta Province to see the actual places where the battles took place and to record the oral traditions of the locals. The book is therefore very descriptive, spending a lot of time in the descriptions of the nature and landscape of the area.
Stories.
Some of the stories from "La Guerra Gaucha" are: 
In Lugones' stories (different than later in the film), all the heroes are anonymous, trying to fortify the idea of a "people in arms".
Author's rights.
Leopoldo Lugones died in 1938, thus his work is public domain since January 1, 2009 (Article 5 of Argentine Law #11,723).

La Valsainte Charterhouse

La Valsainte Charterhouse or La Valsainte (Latin: "Vallis sanctorum omnium", later "Vallis Sancta") situated in Cerniat in the district of Gruyère, Canton of Fribourg, is the only remaining extant Carthusian monastery in Switzerland.
History.
The charterhouse, in the heart of the valleys of the Javroz and the Jogne, was founded in 1295 by Girard I, lord of Corbières. In the Middle Ages it was the owner of a vast territory covering the greater part of the present communes of Cerniat and Charmey, over which by right of its lordship it exercised the high and the low justice.
It was destroyed by fire in 1381.
In 1454 it passed into the lordship of the County of Greyerz, with which it passed again in 1535 to the city of Fribourg.
The government of Fribourg were not kindly disposed toward the monastery, but their efforts to suppress it and absorb its revenues were for many years opposed by the French, who supported it. However, in 1778 the Pope agreed to its suppression, and the government of Fribourg used its revenues to cover the costs of the Diocese of Lausanne, for which they had become responsible. The monks moved to La Part-Dieu Charterhouse at Bulle.
In 1791, during the French Revolution, the empty charterhouse at La Valsainte gave shelter to refugee French Trappists under Dom Augustin de Lestrange, and in 1794 the premises were declared by Pope Pius VI a Cistercian abbey, which became the birthplace of the Cistercian Reform movement. The Trappists were expelled by Napoleon in 1798, but returned to it from 1802 to 1812 and again from 1814 to 1815. From 1818 to 1824 the monastery provided shelter for a group of Redemptorists. It was then sold, and demolished apart from the principal block, built in 1729.
In 1863, the local political climate had changed sufficiently to permit the return of the Carthusian community from La Part-Dieu Charterhouse, which had been suppressed in 1848, and the ruined site was in part restored but mostly rebuilt. The present buildings thus consist of the main block of 1729 surrounded by late 19th century additions and extensions (monks' cells, converts' building, chapel and various buildings outside the monastery itself).
Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the anti-clerical laws passed in France resulted in the expulsion of Carthusian monks, and two additional ranges of cells were built at La Valsainte to accommodate some of them, in 1886 and 1901. In 1903 and 1904 the Chapter General of the Carthusian order met here. The impossibility of pursuing monastic vocations in France at this period meant an increase of vocations at La Valsainte.
Buildings.
Restoration of the church.
In the 1970s the church was thoroughly restored. All 19th century interior work was swept away (except for the stalls), including the flooring. The partition between the choir of the Fathers and that of the lay monks was removed, and the sanctuary was gutted. Work on the roof revealed, in the extreme west, two bays of 14th century vaulting in Tuffière stone, which had somehow survived the destruction of the 19th century. These are the oldest surviving part of the monastery premises.
Warmth and vitality is given to the bare walls by the non-figurative stained glass windows by the painter Chorderet. The tabernacle and the processional cross are both in enamel by the French artist Mirande. A Gothic Madonna of the 14th century, a gift, stands to the left of the main altar.
Several other Carthusian monasteries have taken inspiration from the restoration of La Valsainte for work on their own churches, notably the Montalegre Charterhouse near Barcelona.
Novices' cloister.
The range of buildings latterly known as the novices' cloister, one of those constructed in haste around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries for the accommodation of exiled French monks, was discovered in the 1990s to be in danger of collapse, undermined by groundwater, and was demolished.
Community.
The revived community at La Valsainte has included some distinguished members, and the inclusion of numbers of French religious has added to the vigour of Roman Catholic spiritual life in Switzerland.
Priors.
Two priors are of particular note for the charterhouse:
Monks.
The 20th century monks of Valsainte include some who are distinguished as spiritual writers, such as Dom Augustin Guillerand (author of "Silence cartusien") and Dom Jean-Baptiste Porion (author of "Amour et Silence"). Dom Porion in particular, who entered the monastery in 1921, caused many French artists and intellectuals to visit Valsainte, which resulted in numerous conversions. Jacques Loew, for example, was converted to Catholicism while attending a mass celebrated at Valsainte in the silence of dawn.
Membership.
The community, in 2007, comprised around 20 (including 12 Fathers and 8 Brothers), whose average age is over 60. Numbers of vocations have declined since the 1970s. In the last twenty years the community has lost over half its members, but has received only 4-5 new ones.

Wie die Karnickel

Wie die Karnickel ("Like Rabbits") is a comedy by Sven Unterwaldt from 2002, based on a script by Ralf König.
Storyline.
Horst Bömmelburg's relationship to his girlfriend Vera is stressful and unsatisfactory in every aspect. When Vera finds a pornographic film in the trash, she leaves him and moves in with her mother. 
Horst makes friends with his new gay neighbour, Siggi, who introduces him to a new and much more relaxed perspective on his sex drive. At the same time he starts an affair with the famous soprano singer Kriemhild Nastrowa, who is guesting with the orchestra that Horst plays double bass in.
Vera does not know any of this and, on her friend Gilla's advice, attempts to seduce Horst over dinner with sexy underwear. However, the attempt fails miserably. Gilla then introduces Vera to Gudrun and Britta, editors of a lesbian/feminist magazine called "Xanthippe". They interpret Vera's story in their own way and publish an article in which Horst is presented as an inconsiderate "offender".
Soon after, Vera turns up at Horst and Siggi's flat party. When Horst makes a crude attempt at lessening Vera's feelings of humiliation from the disastrous dinner, she kicks him in the groin and walks out of the party. On the same evening, Kriemhild ends her affair with Horst, who is feeling rather relieved, as her insatiable sexual appetite was beginning to exhaust him. Kriemhild marries the geriatric conductor of the orchestra, who arranges a job for her at the Scala.
Siggi has just split up with his longtime partner Hubert, and lives his life between one-night stands and the desire to return to him. When his mother announces a visit, he plans to finally come out to her and present Hubert as his steady partner. However, he declines, and so Benny, a one night stand, is asked instead. When Siggi's mother visits, Hubert unexpectedly does appear, thereby blowing Siggi's cover, and on top of this starting an affair with Benno. 
Horst admits his passion for porn star Kelly Trump to Siggi. Without Horst knowing, Siggi signs him up to be a guest on the trash talk show "Catch your Dreams", where Kelly Trump and another actress, as well as the "Xanthippe" editors are also invited. Horst arrives with Siggi as a supposed audience member, and when he is asked on stage, he is publicly exposed as addicted to pornography. The talk-show host introduces the other guests and does his best to play everyone off against each other.
Siggi had only wanted to help Horst meet Kelly, and so tries to leave the live show with him. Vera suddenly turns up, having watched the show at home. She has become so enraged when the skewed presentation of her relationship in "Xanthippe" was read out on TV, that she rushed into the studio to set things right. While angry discussions are raging on stage, Vera starts to make friends with Kelly Trump, and Horst returns to the show. He demands to know what all the fuss has been about and asks everyone in the audience who has seen a porn movie to stand up. After some hesitation the entire room ends up standing.
After the show Vera and Horst make peace and agree that their relationship had no real basis. Vera goes to the pub with Kelly, and Horst and Siggi go home contemplating.
Background.
Ralf König wanted to put heterosexual relationships to the forefront for the first time with this film, after his preceding works always centered on homosexuality in German society. His own perspective on heterosexual relationships, as a homosexual, is shown through the character of Siggi. 
This story, as opposed to all other films by König, was first written as a script, and then published as a comic. 
As the film managed to cast one of the most famous German porn stars of the 90’s in Kelly Trump, her name was used instead of the name in the script. For the comic the original name was kept.

Barton upon Irwell Rural District

Barton upon Irwell was, from 1894 to 1933, a rural district in the administrative county of Lancashire, England.
History.
The rural district was created by the Local Government Act 1894 as successor to Barton upon Irwell Rural Sanitary District, formed in 1875. In 1920 the boundary of the district was adjusted to reflect a change in county boundaries, and it exchanged areas with Bucklow Rural District, Cheshire.
Civil parishes and boundaries.
The rural district consisted of four civil parishes: 
The district formed two distinct areas: to the south the parishes of Barton Moss, Davyhulme and Flixton were surrounded to the north by Worsley Urban District and the Borough of Eccles; to the east by the County Borough of Salford; to the south by Urmston Urban District and by the boundary with Cheshire and to the west by Irlam Urban District. The parish of Clifton was a detached exclave to the north adjacent to the urban districts of Kearsley and Swinton and Pendlebury.
Abolition.
The rural district was abolished on 1 April 1933. Two county review orders: the "Lancashire (Manchester and district) Review Order" and the "Lancashire (Southern Areas) Review Order" transferred the district's area to four neighbouring towns: Barton Moss passed to the Borough of Eccles, Clifton to Kearsley Urban District, Davyhulme to Urmston Urban District and Flixton to Urmston Urban District.

Joaquín Ascaso Budria

Joaquín Ascaso Budria (Zaragoza, c. 1906/1907 – Caracas, March 1977) was an anarcho syndicalist and President of the Regional Council for Aragon’s Defense between 1936 and 1937. Francisco Ascaso was his cousin.
He worked as a building worker, and, in his youth, he entered CNT, taking part in the anarchist association known as "Los Indomables" (“The Indomitable Ones”), and helping as well another one known as "Los Solidarios" (“Solidarity”).
He was arrested in Zaragoza because of his anarchist activities in 1924. According to the police report, he was seventeen then. After that, he fled to France until the advent of the Second Spanish Republic, having been influenced by the Jaca Uprising.
When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he was in Barcelona, and during the 1936 Spanish Revolution he set out to the Aragons’s Front, first in the Durruti Column, and afterwards in the Ortiz's Column.
He was appointed a Government’s delegate in 19 January 1937, by the Regional Council for Aragon's Defense.
When the Council was dissolved, he was arrested, following Second Republic Government's instructions, in 19 August 1937, and he was kept in the San Miguel de los Reyes prison (near Valencia) for 38 days. Finally, he set out to France, through Andorra, with Antonio Ortiz. From there, he set out to Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and finally settled down in Venezuela, where, in the 1960s, he founded, together with Antonio Ortiz and other libertarian exiles, an anarchist group called Fuerza Única (“Unique Force”). 
Historian Alejandro Díez Torre recovered and published in 2006 a book written by Ascaso himself, “Memorias, 1936-1938: Hacia un nuevo Aragón” (“Memoirs, 1936-1938: Towards a new Aragon”), which was edited by the University of Zaragoza. Writer Francisco Carrasquer published that same year “Ascaso y Zaragoza, dos pérdidas: la pérdida” (“Ascaso and Zaragoza. Two losses: one loss”), a research paper about Ascaso and the Council.

Segundo Blanco

Segundo Blanco González (Gijón 1899 – Mexico 1957) was a Spanish anarchist.
He worked as a teacher, but, in his youth, he was persecuted, so he had to work in many different jobs, such as foreman builder. He was studying in night shifts at the same time. During Prime Minister Primo de Rivera's leadership of Spain he was responsible for the structure of the Asturias CNT section, and in 1926 he became the General Secretary of the CNT union. That year, he was imprisoned; he was imprisoned again in 1931 and 1934. 
When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he presided over the Gijón's War Committee. Later, he became responsible for the Asturias and León Interprovincial Council, inside the Industry Ministry, and he was part of the War Committee, after its transformation into the Asturias and León Sovereign Council.
After the North Front was defeated, he fled to France and arrived to Catalonia. He was the Secretary of the Defense Council inside the CNT's National Committee. In April 1938 he participated in Juan Negrín's government, holding the Education and Public Health portfolio. When the war ended, he went into exile, first to the French city of Orléans, and then to Mexico, where he died in 1957.

William Conyngham

William Burton Conyngham (1733 – 31 May 1796), politician and improver, was born William Burton, the second son of Francis Burton and Mary Conyngham, sister of Henry Conyngham, 1st Earl Conyngham. In 1781, his name was changed by Royal Licence to inherit the estates of his uncle. 
Conyngham was a longtime Member of Parliament. From 1761 to 1777 he represented Newtown Limavady, from 1776 to 1777 as well as from 1783 to 1790 Killybegs. Between 1776 and 1783 and again between 1790 and 1796, he sat in the Irish House of Commons for Ennis.
Conyngham planned a settlement on the previously unpopulated island of Rutland, Ireland, having installed, from 1784, a street of residences and business premises, post office, school house and a fish landing and processing facility. The island remained inhabited into the 1960s.
From 1793 Conyngham was one of the Commissioners of the Treasury for Ireland. 
Conyngham is most famous today for having presented the Trinity College Harp to Trinity College Dublin; from 1922 the harp was used as the model for the insignia of the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland. An image was also registered as a Guinness trade mark in 1876.

"Cash Crop" was named the winner of the Juno Award for Best Rap Recording at the Juno Awards of 1998. However, the award was presented during the non-televised portion of the ceremony along with the technical awards, rather than at the televised main ceremony. Alleging that racism was a factor in the award's scheduling, the band refused to accept the award. Speaking to the press afterward, the group and their co-manager said that

James Francis Hoyt (May 16, 1925 – August 11, 2008) was one of the four American soldiers who discovered the Buchenwald concentration camp. According to military records, Hoyt, then a private first class, was part of a group of four members of the 6th Armored Division, who were the first Americans to discover Buchenwald on April 11, 1945.
The four original liberators were Capt. Frederic Keffer, Tech. Sgt. Herbert Gottschalk, Sgt. Harry Ward and Hoyt, a private first class.
His son, John, said the family has been touched by it all. He said he's even followed blogs of Holocaust deniers after his father's death.
"Some of the dissent was most interesting", he said.
"I'm not saying my dad was a hero to every person in the world, but I'm saying he certainly had a heroic approach and outlook, and definitely went above and beyond a person's call of duty to understand the atrocities of war", James son explained after his father's death.
"They say all's fair in love and war. Well, some of these things weren't so fair, especially if you were a member of an ethnic group or cultural group that didn't suit the people of power. You were scheduled to be obliterated. And that's not OK. That's not what democracy and freedom is all about."
His father suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder up until the day he died; he only began getting help in the 1990s.
"His whole life, he had fitful dreams", John Hoyt said.
As a warrior who had seen the horrors of war, he opposed the invasion of Iraq, his son said.[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/22/btsc.buchenwald/index.html]

Stanka Zlateva

Stanka Zlateva Hristova (; born 1 March 1983 in Krushare, Sliven Province) is a female Bulgarian freestyle wrestler. She competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, winning silver medals in the latter two events. She was named World Female Wrestler of the Year in 2006 and 2007 and Bulgarian Sportsperson of the Year in 2007, 2010 and 2011.
Biography.
Stanka Zlateva grew up in an athletic family. Her original mentor was her older brother by 8 years who also was a wrestling champ and had earned medals in high school tournaments. He trained the young Stanka in different sports from age of 10. He admits that his sister's progress in sports surprised him to the extent that shortly wrestling with his younger sister became a difficult challenge and served as a great training for him. By the time she was 12, she was able to pin her brother in a matter of seconds in wrestling matches. Despite his brothers wish for his own training goals, she was no longer interested in westling her 20 year old brother. In an informal wrestling match, when she was 13she competed against the local 17 year old male wrestling champion in the province of Sliven in Bulgaria. She pinned him two minutes after the start of the match. This event resulted public's attention for young Zlateva wrestling skills. Subsequently in 1997 at age 14, she formally got engaged in wrestling training by a professional coach, Demir Demirev and subsequently she was trained by Valeri Raychev in the Kyustendil sports club and in the national team, as well as with Ognyan Raychev in the national team. Since 2006, she has been competing for Levski Sofia, where her coach is former world champion and triple European champion Simeon Shterev.
In late 2010, it was revealed that Zlateva had been offered to compete for Azerbaijan at the 2012 Olympics, but had steadfastly refused to discuss any such possibility with the Azeris, as she would only be willing to represent Bulgaria. She had previously turned down similar attempts by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to encourage a nationality switch.
Medals and awards.
Zlateva came first in her category at the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 World Championships (in Baku, Guangzhou, Tokyo, Moscow and Istanbul respectively), third in 2009 (Herning), fourth in 2004 (New York), fifth in 2005 (Budapest), seventh in 2001 (Sofia) and eight in 2002 (Chalcis).
She also has 5 European championships, winning the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 titles (Moscow, Sofia, Tampere, Vilnius and Baku respectively), as well as coming third in 2005 and 2011 (Varna and Dortmund), fourth in 2003 and fifth in 2004.
She was the first Bulgarian female wrestler at the Olympics as women's wrestling debuted at the 2004 Games in Athens, and Zlateva represented Bulgaria there, coming twelfth. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, she was aspiring to win gold, but lost to the surprise champion Wang Jiao of the People's Republic of China in the final. She has qualified for the 2012 Olympics automatically as the Gold medalist in the 2011 World Wrestling Championships.
On 19 December 2011, Zlateva was honoured with the title of Bulgarian Sportsperson of the Year for the third time since the start of her wrestling career, becoming joint equal with Boyan Radev regarding the number of times a Bulgarian wrestler had won the distinction.
On 9 August 2012, she reached the final of the Women's freestyle 72 kg wrestling competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was defeated by Russian Natalia Vorobieva. Zlateva won the first period by a score of 1:0, but her opponent managed to pin her during the second one, which secured Vorobieva's title. Zlateva was her country's flagbearer during the closing ceremony of the games.

Vippetangen Line

The Vippetangen Line or the Grain Tram () is an abandoned line of the Oslo Tramway, Norway, that ran from Tollbugata in the city center to Vippetangen between 1900 and 1967. It was built by Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie (KKS).
History.
The line was built as the third and final by the municipal Kristiania Kommunale Sporvei, opening on 28 August 1900. The service went through the city center to Anetheum to St. Hanshaugen. The track was transferred to Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) when it bought KKS in 1905, and again to Oslo Sporveier in 1924 when it took over KSS. Just after the KSS takeover the line was extended from Festningsbryggen to Vippetangen on 8 November 1905. The Vippetangen area is an important ferry quay and port that grew up, and both domestic and international ships provided the basis for passengers. Passenger transport was terminated in August 1964 as part of the plan to abandon the tramway network in Oslo.
From 1918 KSS started operating freight trams transporting grain from the silos at Vippetangen to the mills in Grünerløkka and Sandaker. Four passenger cars were rebuilt to carry the cargo, but in 1932 two specially built freight cars were built; the service was very profitable, and the mill company Bjølsen Valsemølle wanted to continue the service after, but road construction forced the tram line to be pulled up after the last service ran on 15 February 1967.
Future plans.
Though the old tracks have been razed, plans exist to build a new tramway to serve Vippetangen. The new line, that would be part of the Fjord Line would follow around the edge of the peninsula, instead of running through it. There are no specific dates for this expansion that is to become the main transport corridor through the urban renewal project named the Fjord City.

Alberto O. Mendelzon

Alberto O. Mendelzon was an Argentine-Canadian computer scientist who died on June 16, 2005.
Alberto Mendelzon was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1979, where his advisor was Jeffrey Ullman. After that he was a post-doctoral fellow at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center for a year before joining the faculty of the University of Toronto in 1980.
He was one of the pioneers who helped to lay the foundations of relational databases. His early work on database dependencies has been influential in both the theory and practice of data management. He has made fundamental contributions in the areas of graphical query languages, knowledge-base systems, and on-line analytic processing. His work has provided the foundation for languages used to query the structure of the web.
Mendelzon established some of the earliest results on using the relational data model. Together with his thesis advisor, Jeffrey Ullman, and fellow Princeton students, including David Maier and Yeshoshua Sagiv, he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the chase, a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the database theory literature. This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered.
In the 1980s, Mendelzon began an important line of work on graphical query languages. His work has been called prescient as it began before the World Wide Web, and nonetheless established many of the scientific principles required for designing languages to query the Web.
More recently, Mendelzon was a central figure in the work on view-based querying. Starting with the innovative LMSS95 paper (Levy, Mendelzon, Sagiv, and Srivastava, PODS 1995) that introduced the problem of answering queries using views, Alberto Mendelzon made several important contributions to the emerging area of view-based modeling and processing.
His research was central to the development of many areas of database research such as database design, semantic query optimization, graphical query languages, and querying web data. In addition, he also made important contributions to recursive query languages, on-line analytic processing, similarity-based queries, data warehouses and view maintenance, algorithms for computing web page reputations, and indexing of XML data.
Mendelzon was an active member of both the database theory and database systems research communities. He served as the PC Chair for ACM PODS in 1991 and as General Chair in both 1997 and
1998. He served as PC Chair for VLDB in 1992, and as a member of the SIGMOD Executive Committee from 1998 to 2001. He was a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
ACM PODS Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award.
The ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award was established in 2007 and was awarded for the first time in 2008. It is awarded every year to a paper or a small number of papers published in the PODS proceedings ten years prior that had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, or transfer to practice over the intervening decade.

Potez 39

The Potez 39 was a French two-seat single-engined parasol wing monoplane reconnaissance and observation aircraft of the 1930s.
Development.
The Potez 39 was designed to a 1928 requirement for an aircraft to replace the Potez 25 and Breguet 19 machines then in service with the French Air Force in the A2 ("Artillerie Biplace" - two seat observation aircraft) role. The aircraft was a parasol monoplane of all-metal construction, the first all metal Potez aircraft, with a tailwheel undercarriage. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12H engine of 580 bhp (433 kW) as required by the specification. The crew of two sat in open, tandem cockpits, with the observer being armed with two Lewis guns on a ring mounting, and the pilot being armed with a single synchronised Darne machine gun, while light bombs could be carried in a small internal bomb-bay and on external racks. A fixed camera was fitted, operating through a hatch in the fuselage floor.
The prototype flew in January 1930. Although the Breguet 27 was selected as the winner of the competition, both it and the Potez, which was runner-up, were chosen for production. Compared to the Potez 25, of which over 2000 were ordered, production of the Potez 39 series was on a small scale, 100 Potez 390 aircraft being built for France and 12 Potez 391 variants, powered by a Lorraine-Dietrich 12H engine of 700 bhp, for the Peruvian Air Force. A number of prototype and development aircraft, including a floatplane, were tested but no further orders were received.
Service.
First production aircraft were delivered in 1934 and the Potez 39 began to be replaced by ANF Les Mureaux 117, Amiot 143 and Potez 540 aircraft began in 1936. At the outbreak of World War II, the Potez 39 remained in service with seven observation squadrons of the French Air Force, but these, along with the Breguet 27-equipped units, were withdrawn from the front in October 1939. The Potez 39 continued to serve in training units until the armistice of June 1940, at which time 41 remained in Metropolitan France. These aircraft were scrapped soon afterward.

Furcacauda

According to the Systema Naturae 2000 Taxonomic classification, Furcacauda is a genus within the family 
of Furcacaudidae, within the order Thelodonti, the Class Agnatha, and the Subphylum Vertebrata.
Canadian fossils give rise to the Furcacaudiformes during the Devonian and Silurian time periods. Furcacaudiformes were deep water jawless vertebrates with symmetrical fork and lobed-finned tails and smaller than typical 
loganellid and nikoliviid thelodonti scales. Furcacaudiformes are noted to having a laterally 
compressed body, large anterior eyes, slightly posterior, lateral, and vertical to a small mouth, and a condensed curved row of branchial openings (gills) directly posterior to the eyes. Many but not all had laterally paired fins. Wilson and Caldwell also note the presence of a caudal peduncle and a long caudal fin made of two large lobes, one dorsal and one ventral separated by 8 to 14 smaller intermediate lobes, giving the appearance of a striated half-moon shaped tail resembling the tail of a heterostracan. A large square cavity within the gut connecting a small intestine to an anal opening lead many to believe that it is this genus that exhibits the first vertebrate stomach. According 
to Wilson and Caldwell their discovery, based on sediment infillings of fossils of the "Furcacauda heintze", gives credence to the evolutionary development of stomach before jaws.

"Big Notebook for Easy Piano" was the debut release by Murfreesboro, Tennessee band Fluid Ounces. It was recorded in Memphis, Tennessee with producer Ross Rice. Rice had formerly been with the band Human Radio.
The album featured two of the most popular and definitive Fluid Ounces songs, "Shamrock" and "Record Stack." The track "Big Empty" is often cited as one of the band's masterpieces.
While several of the songs were opaque lyrically, "Spill Your Brains" was a not-so-subtle lampooning of Alanis Morissette, and "Liquorish Vampires" was written about Timbs' experiences working in a coffee shop in Murfreesboro.
The album was received very well critically, and was distributed by Caroline Distribution.

Ayers v. Watson

Ayers v. Watson, , was an action of trespass to try title of certain land in Bell County, Texas, originally brought in the district court of that county by Watson, the defendant in error, against the plaintiffs in error and one Anderson. 
The land was described in the petition as a tract lying in the County of Bell, about northeast by north from the three forks of the Little River. The defendants excepted to the petition for insufficiency of law, and pleaded not guilty. One of them, Frank Ayers, pleaded specially that he was owner in fee simple of a tract of eleven leagues granted by the government of Coahuila and Texas to Maximo Moreno in the year 1833, describing its metes and bounds, and he alleged that the land described in the plaintiff's petition, and claimed by him under some pretended patent from the State of Texas to the heirs of one W. W. Daws, deceased, was embraced within the boundaries of said eleven-league grant, which was an elder and superior title.
Anderson also pleaded that he was occupying the Moreno grant as tenant of Ayers, and especially that , including improvements, where he resided (describing its situation) was held by him under said Moreno title; that he had been in possession of said land for more than twelve months before the institution of this suit, adversely and in good faith, and he claimed the value of his improvements if the court should hold the plaintiff entitled to recover.
The plaintiff's original petition was filed in August 1877, and the amended petition and pleas were filed in April 1879. The cause was first tried in April 1879, and again in April 1880, and on both occasions the juries disagreed. Ayers then presented a petition for the removal of the cause to the circuit court of the United States, alleging that he was a citizen of the State of Mississippi and that the plaintiff was a citizen of Texas, and that there could be a final determination of the controversy, so far as he was concerned, without the presence of the other defendants as parties in the cause. The court granted the petition, and the cause was removed, no objection to the removal being made either then or in the circuit court afterwards. But after the issuing of the present writ of error from this Court, the plaintiffs in error, at the instance of one of whom (Frank Ayers) the cause was removed, assigned for error, among other things, that the circuit court erred in taking jurisdiction of the cause. 
The court thought there was error in not putting it to the jury with sufficient distinctness that the course and distance of the first two lines of the survey must govern if the evidence was not sufficient to fix the location of the northern line by identifying the two hackberries with those called for in the field notes for the northeast corner of the survey or by some other marks or monuments.
The judgment was reversed, with directions to grant a new trial.

Soma Records (U.S. label)

Soma Records was an American record label, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and owned by wholesale record distributor Amos Heilicher. The Soma name was "Amos" spelled backwards. Heilicher, along with his brother Danny, was also in the jukebox and wholesale record distribution businesses, and owned the Musicland chain of retail music stores.
History.
Started in 1954, Soma began mainly recording polka music, old-time country and western and jazz groups. Its first hit was Bobby Vee's 1959 "Suzie Baby", which was a regional smash before Liberty Records bought up the master and issued it nationally.
Among hits released by Soma were "Mule Skinner Blues" by The Fendermen, "Liar, Liar" by The Castaways, "Run, Run, Run" by The Gestures and "Surfin' Bird" by The Trashmen. The last record was distributed by Soma, but recorded on the Garrett Records label - George Garrett was an engineer who ran the board on many Soma recordings. Soma recorded many local and regional rock groups during the 1960s, including The Accents, Gregory Dee and The Avanties, The Underbeats, and The Del Counts, as well as distributing other smaller labels (such as Garrett, Bangar, Golden Ring and Studio City). Country singer Dave Dudley's first album, containing his biggest hit "Six Days on the Road", was released on Golden Ring Records in 1963, and distributed by Soma until Mercury Records bought the rights.
Heilicher had some ownership in the local recording studio, Kay Bank, where most of Soma's recordings were made.
Soma continued releasing recordings until 1967, when the co-owned record distributing company was merged into Pickwick Records. The Heilicher brothers exited the recorded music business in 1977.
Amos Heilicher died of pneumonia in August 2011, aged 90.

Homrighausen

Homrighausen is a family name that originated in the area of Berleburg in what is now the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein in Germany.
The village of Homrighausen was never more than a small hamlet north and slightly west of the town of Berleburg. Its first documented mention was in 1502 as "Homerchusen". However, the settlement is probably much older than that. Scholarly opinion is that place names ending in -hausen in Wittgenstein originated in the period 950-1150.
"-hausen" simply meant a settlement of houses, and it is believed that "Homrig" emerged from the words for a high hill--"hohen Berg" in German.
In 1606, Graf Georg relocated the peasant families living at Homrighausen to other villages to have full use of the land. An impressive forest house was erected there around 1770. It is now part of the city of Bad Berleburg
The family name of Homrighausen is found in several nearby villages by the 16th century, but no one has been able to link these early branches back to a common ancestor. Besides the town of Berleburg itself, the Homrighausen name was and is common in the villages of Wunderthausen, Diedenshausen, Wemlighausen and Girkhausen, among others. At present, around 300 families by this name live in Germany, and more than half are in Siegen-Wittgenstein. A similar number live in the United States.
Homrighausens from Wittgenstein – as well as some a generation or two removed – came to America at various times beginning as early as 1748 Important points of settlement during the 19th century included Wheatland, Iowa, and Paola, Kansas. In the case of the earlier settlers, the name was often modified. "Hummerickhouse" is an example.
One prominent American with this name was the Rev. Dr. Elmer G. Homrighausen (1900–1982), a theologian and professor at the Princeton seminary.
Genealogy.
More than 50 Homrighausens are known to have emigrated directly from Wunderthausen or Diedenshausen to the United States. There were certainly others.

Liechtenstein wine

The Principality of Liechtenstein is a producer of wine. The country has a climate ideally suited for the cultivation of vine with mountain slopes facing southwest, calcareous soils and an average of 1,500 hours of sunshine a year. The hot dry wind during the summer months, known as the foehn aids cultivators by having a sweetening effect.
There are over 100 winegrowers in Liechtenstein which produce red and white wines in which despite the small size of the country can produce a significant variety. Liechtenstein is part of the European wine quality system and the international AOC classification.
History.
Viniculture in Liechtenstein dates back to just over two thousand years. Growing began before Christ by a Celtic tribe that had settled in the area, and during Roman times production increased. After the Romans had been driven out of the area by the Alamanni, production virtually ceased, until the growth of Christianity in the 4th century, when monks encouraged the establishment of new vineyards. During the rule of Charlemagne (742–814), many of the municipalities and monasteries possessed their own vineyards. 
The grape, Blauburgunder or Pinot noir, was introduced by Henri, duc de Rohan (1579–1638) who strongly encouraged the farmers of the Bündner Herrschaft to cultivate it.
During the latter half of the 19th century, wine was Liechtenstein's main export alongside cattle. The wine industry in Liechenstein reached an all time peak in 1871 when were designated for wine production. After this point however, the opening of the Arlberg railway saw an increase in foreign competition and in the first half of the 20th century bad harvests and parasites caused the wine industry collapse. Attempts by the government to sustain the industry by introducing compulsory crop spraying after 1890 failed. However, although the industry had declined significantly, viniculture was still important enough in Vaduz that its coat of arms, established on 31 July 1932, pictured bunches of grapes. Since the 1970s there has been a regrowth of viniculture, but as of 2008 only is under cultivation.
Today, the most popular white wines are Chardonnay, Riesling x Sylvaner, and Gewürztraminer, while red wines most produced are Blauburgunder, Zweigelt, and Blaufränkisch. The highest vineyard in the country is the Walser village of Triesenberg at 850 meters (2800 ft), which has seen some successful experimental growth of the French Léon Millot grape variety. Other notable brands are the Zweigelt Selektion Karlsberg Profundo and the FL Premier Brut 1996, a vintage sparkling wine, pressed from Rhine Riesling grapes.
Several places in the country have wine tasting venues. Most notable is the "Hofkellerei des regierenden Fürsten von Liechtenstein", the wine cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein.

Affine focal set

In mathematics, and especially affine differential geometry, the affine focal set of a smooth submanifold "M" embedded in a smooth manifold "N" is the caustic generated by the affine normal lines. It can be realised as the bifurcation set of a certain family of functions. The bifurcation set is the set of parameter values of the family which yield functions with degenerate singularities. This is not the same as the bifurcation diagram in dynamical systems.
Let us assume that "M" is an "n"-dimensional smooth hypersurface in real ("n"+1)-space. We assume that "M" has no points where the second fundamental form is degenerate. We recall from the article affine differential geometry that there is a unique transverse vector field over "M". This is the affine normal vector field, or the Blaschke normal field. A special (i.e. det = 1) affine transformation of real ("n" + 1)-space will carry the affine normal vector field of "M" onto the affine normal vector field of the image of "M" under the transformation.
Geometric interpretation.
Let us consider a local parametrisation of "M". Let formula_1 be an open neighbourhood of 0 with coordinates formula_2, and let formula_3 be a smooth parametrisation of "M" in a neighbourhood of one of its points.
The affine normal vector field will be denoted by formula_4. At each point of "M" it is transverse to the tangent space of "M", i.e. 
For a fixed formula_6 the affine normal line to "M" at formula_7 may be parametrised by "t" where
The affine focal set is given geometrically as the infinitesimal intersections of the "n"-parameter family of affine normal lines. To calculate this we choose an affine normal line, say at point "p"; then we look at the affine normal lines at points infinitesimally close to "p" an see if any intersect the one at "p". If we choose a point infinitesimally close to formula_9, then it may be expressed as formula_10 where formula_11 represents the infinitesimal difference. Thus formula_12 and formula_13 will be our "p" and its neighbour.
For "t" and formula_11 we try to solve
This can be done by using power series expansions, and is not too difficult; it is lengthy and has thus been omitted.
We recall from the article affine differential geometry that the affine shape operator "S" is a type (1,1)-tensor field on "M", and is given by formula_16, where "D" is the covariant derivative on real ("n" + 1)-space (for those well read: it is the usual flat and torsion free connexion).
We find that the solutions to formula_17 are when 1/"t" is an eigenvalue of "S" and that formula_11 is a corresponding eigenvector. The eigenvalues of "S" are not always distinct: there may be repeated roots, there may be complex roots, and "S" may not always be diagonalisable. For formula_19 denotes the greatest integer function, there will generically be ("n" − 2"k")-pieces of the affine focal set above each point "p". The −2"k" corresponds to pairs of eigenvalues becoming complex (like the solution to formula_20 as "a" changes from negative to positive).
The affine focal set need not be made up of smooth hypersurfaces. In fact, for a generic hypersurface "M", the affine focal set will have singularities. The singularities could be found by calculation, but that may be difficult, and we still have no idea of what the singularity looks like up to diffeomorphism. If we use some singularity theory then we get much more information.
Singularity theory approach.
The idea here is to define a family of functions over "M". The family will have the ambient real ("n" + 1)-space as its parameter space, i.e. for each choice of ambient point we will get a function defined over "M". This family is the family of affine distance functions:
Given an ambient point formula_22 and a surface point "p", we can decompose the chord joining "p" to formula_22 as a tangential component and a transverse component parallel to formula_4. The value of Δ is given implicitly in the equation 
where "Z" is a tangent vector. We now seek the bifurcation set of the family Δ, i.e. the ambient points for which the restricted function
has degenertate singularity at some "p". A function has degenerate singularity if both the Jacobian matrix of first order partial derivatives and the Hessian matrix of second order partial derivatives have zero determinant.
To discover if the Jacobian matrix has zero determinant we differentiate the equation "x - p = Z + ΔA". Let "X" be a tangent vector to "M", and differentiate in that direction:
where "I" is the identity. This tells us that formula_30 and formula_31. The last equality says that we have the following equation of differential one-forms formula_32. The Jacobian matrix will have zero determinant if, and only if, formula_33 is degenerate as a one-form, i.e. formula_34 for all tangent vectors "X".
Since formula_32 it follows that formula_33 is degenerate if, and only if, formula_37 is degenerate. Since "h" is a non-degenerate two-form it follows that "Z = 0". Notice that since "M" has a non-degenerate second fundamental form it follows that "h" is a non-degenerate two-form. Since "Z = 0" the set of ambient points "x" for which the restricted function formula_26 has a singularity at some "p" is the affine normal line to "M" at "p".
To compute the Hessian matrix we consider the differential two-form formula_39. This is the two-form whose matrix representation is the Hessian matrix. We have already seen that formula_31 we see that formula_41 We have
Now assume that Δ has a singularity at "p", i.e. Z = 0, then we have the two-form
We have also seen that formula_30, and so the two-form becomes
This is degenerate as a two-form if, and only if, there exists non-zero "X" for which it is zero for all "Y". Since "h" is non-degenerate it must be that formula_46 and formula_47. So the singularity is degenerate if, and only if, the ambient point "x" lies on the affine normal line to "p" and the reciprocal of its distance from "p" is an eigenvalue of "S", i.e. points formula_48 where 1/"t" is an eigenvalue of "S". The affine focal set!
Singular points.
The affine focal set can be the following:
To find the singular points we simply differentiate "p + tA" in some tangent direction "X":
The affine focal set is singular if, and only if, there exists non-zero "X" such that formula_51, i.e. if, and only if, "X" is an eigenvector of "S" and the derivative of "t" in that direction is zero. This means that the derivative of an affine principal curvature in its own affine principal direction is zero.
Local structure.
We can use the standard ideas in singularity theory to classify, up to local diffeomorphism, the affine focal set. If the family of affine distance functions can be shown to be a certain kind of family then the local structure is known. We want the family of affine distance functions to be a versal unfolding of the singularities which arrise. 
The affine focal set of a plane curve will generically consist of smooth pieces of curve and ordinary cusp points (semi-cubical palabara|semi-cubical parabolae).
The affine focal set of a surface in three-space will generically consist of smooth pieces of surface, cuspidal cylinder points (formula_52), swallowtail points (formula_53), purse points (formula_54), and pyramid points (formula_55).
The formula_56 and formula_57 series are as in Arnold's list.
The question of the local structure in much higher dimension is of great interest. For example, we were able to construct a discrete list of singularity types (up to local diffeomprhism). In much higher dimensions no such discrete list can be constructed, there are functional modulii.

Peel state by-election, 2007

A by-election for the Western Australian Legislative Assembly district of Peel was held on 3 February 2007.
The by-election was triggered by the resignation of Labor MP Norm Marlborough. Labor candidate Paul Papalia was elected to fill the vacancy.
Background.
Norm Marlborough was appointed to cabinet in 2006 as Minister for Small Business, Minister for the Peel and the South West, and Minister Assisting the Minister for Education and Training. This followed the replacement of Geoff Gallop by Alan Carpenter as Premier and Labor leader. Carpenter relaxed the previously existing ban on ministerial contact with disgraced former Premier turned lobbyist Brian Burke. Marlborough, a friend of Burke's, would prove an embarrassment to the government when it was revealed by the Corruption and Crime Commission that he had deliberately passed on confidential cabinet information to Burke.
Marlborough resigned from parliament on 10 November 2006, following his sacking from the ministry. On 21 November 2006, the Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly issued a writ directing the Electoral Commissioner to proceed with an election in the district.
Results.
Despite the controversy surrounding Marlborough's resignation, the government went unpunished at the ballot box. Instead, the by-election produced an increased two-party preferred majority for Labor.

Kalanga people

The Kalanga, also known as the Bakalanga, 'Bakalaka', are one of the first Bantu speaking tribes to migrate to present day Botswana, followed by the Bakgalagadi and then the Batswana (Bakwena who then split). The Kalanga had first settled in Mapungubwe in South Africa, the first Kalanga state. They later moved to the Great Zimbabwe ruins site in Masvingo Zimbabwe. After sometime they moved to Khami and finally ending in Botswana. However wherever they went they left relics of their masonry and at every site a group of the Kalanga remained. The Khami state occupied south-western Zimbabwe (now Matabeleland) and adjacent parts of present day Botswana.
History.
The Kalanga, or western Shona are closely related to the Mashona. They mainly inhabit Zimbabwe and Botswana. When they arrived in north eastern Botswana and south western Zimbabwe they had already split with the Shona. They are estimated to number around 600000.
The Kalangas are one of the largest minority groups in Botswana. The 1946 census indicated that there were 22,777 (40% of the numerically largest district) Kalangas in the Bamangwato (Central) District. 
The Kalanga are linked to some early African states such as Mapungubwe, Khami and the Rozvi empire. 
By 1690 the Portuguese had been forced off the plateau and much of the land formerly under Mwenemutapa was controlled by the Rozwi. The Kalanga dynasties fractured into autonomous states, many of which later formed the Rozwi empire. Peace and prosperity reigned over the next two centuries and the centres of Dhlo-Dhlo, Khami, and Great Zimbabwe reached their peaks. The Mwenemutapa citadel and palace were taken over by the Rozwi, whose Changamila extended his control over the mining area.
The fall of the Kingdom of Butua came as a result of a series of invasions, beginning with the Bangwato Kgosi Kgari's ill-fated c. 1828 incursion and culminated in the onslaught of Mzilakazi's Amandebele.

Nina Andreyeva

Nina Aleksandrovna Andreyeva (, born 12 October 1938) is a Russian chemist, teacher, author, political activist, and social critic. A supporter of classical Soviet principles, she wrote an essay that defended many aspects of the traditional Soviet system, and criticized General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and his closest supporters for not being real communists.
Career in chemistry.
She was born in Leningrad, and was a chemistry lecturer at the Leningrad Technological Institute. She joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1966.
"I Cannot Forsake My Principles".
Her essay "I Cannot Forsake My Principles" (I Cannot Waive Principles) was published in the newspaper "Sovetskaya Rossiya" on March 13, 1988, at a time when Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev were abroad, and cited an anti-Gorbachev report by the secretary of the Party's Central Committee, Yegor Ligachev.
Anti-perestroika party officials welcomed the essay, whereas supporters of Gorbachev and Yeltsin feared that it represented a major defeat for them. Gorbachev subsequently revealed that many members of the Politburo seemed to share Andreyeva's views, and that he had to coerce them into approving the publication of an official rejoinder. The published response appeared in Pravda on 5 April 1988, and was not nearly as forceful as its authors have claimed. In the aftermath of this discussion, the General Secretary at least temporarily tightened his own control over the Secretariat of the Central Committee. The entire episode may have contributed to his decision to reform the Secretariat in the autumn of 1988.
Subsequent career.
Andreyeva subsequently played a leadership role in the formation of communist organisations. She headed the organising committee of the Bolshevik Platform of the CPSU that "expelled" Gorbachev from the party in September 1991. In November 1991, she became the general secretary of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks. In October 1993, the party was temporarily suspended along with fifteen other organisations after President Yeltsin's repression of the attempted coup against his regime. In May 1995 she was stripped of her post as the head of the St. Petersburg Central Committee of the party for "lack of revolutionary activity."

XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)

"XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)" is a song written by Matraca Berg and Alice Randall, and recorded by American country music singer Trisha Yearwood. It was released in June 1994 as the lead single from her album "Thinkin' About You." The song became her second number-one hit on the US country charts. In addition, the single also peaked at number 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and number-one on the Canadian Country singles chart.
Content.
The song is narrated by Yearwood and it tells the story of a young woman who has dreams and ambitions, but also discusses how she works hard and is a simple American girl who "signs her letters with XXX's and OOO's". She dreams of becoming successful in a man's world, citing her father as an example. The chorus verifies how the woman is a simple American girl.
In the song, there are pop culture references to R&B singer Aretha Franklin and country singer Patsy Cline.
Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song unfavorably, saying that the song is obviously supposed to mean something, "with its rapid-fire scheme and assertive-woman references." She goes on to say that the song ends up "sounding like exactly what it is - the theme to a bad television show."
Chart performance.
"XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)" debuted at number 73 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of July 9, 1994.

Migration history.
Before 1985, Moroccans did not require visas to enter Spain. Many young came for seasonal or short-term work in agriculture and industry, coming and going from Spain without settling there. A new visa law implemented that year, "La Ley de Extranjeria", was quite restrictive, and did not provide for permanent residence permits. As late as 1992, official statistics showed only 16,665 Moroccans residing in Spain (of whom 14,998 lived in peninsular Spain). In the following years, many Moroccans came to take jobs in the agricultural, hospitality, construction, and service sectors. By 2000, their population had increased to 201,182 individuals. Along with the growing numbers of migrants, their composition also shifted, with a higher proportion of women among them.
2000 also marked a significant shift in Spanish immigration laws; Law 4/2000 passed that year created mechanisms for family reunification, regularisation of illegal migrants, and acquisition of permanent residency. By 2008, official statistics showed 752,695 legal Moroccan residents of Spain. Beginning in September that year, Spanish authorities began offering payments to unemployed immigrants if they agreed to cancel their residency and leave the country. With official statistics showing 82,262 unemployed Moroccans in Spain, there were expected to be many who would take advantage of the payments. However, according to provisional figures, the Moroccan population of Spain continued to grow during the year, and had reached 858,00 by the beginning of 2011, 8.8% higher than the 2008 total.

Preseason.
The Florida Atlantic Owls entered the 2009 college football season hoping to rebound on what was considered a disappointing 2008 campaign. The 2008 team ended the season 7-6 (4-3 SBC), despite returning an overwhelming majority of starters from the 2007 conference champion team. Quarterback Rusty Smith entered his senior season. The 2009 team looked to rebuild on defense, losing defensive star, Frantz Joseph, and a number of other key starters.
The Owls looked to shoot for their third-consecutive bowl appearance, as the 2008 squad defeated the Central Michigan Chippewas in the 2008 Motor City Bowl.

Guillaume Fouquet de la Varenne

Guillaume Fouquet de la Varenne (born La Flèche, 1560 – 7 December 1616) was a French chef who became an important statesman in the service of Henry IV.
Biography.
Guillaume Fouquet was born into a bourgeois family in La Flèche, the son of Martin Fouquet, kitchen squire to Françoise d'Alençon, Duchess of Vendome. Martin Fouquet served three generations of the family; following the duchess' death, he served her son, Antoine de Bourbon (1518–1562), husband of Jeanne III of Navarre (Jeanne d'Albret), and later their young son Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV of France.
Due to his father's position, in 1578, at the age of 18, Guillaume became a cook in the service of Catherine de Bourbon (1559–1604), sister of the future king. In 1580, noting his personality and his skill, Catherine recommended him to her brother, and he subsequently became "portmanteau" to Henry IV.
For thirty years, until the assassination of the King in 1610, Fouquet lived in the shadow of Henry IV, taking an active part in important events of the reign. Confirming his reputation for skill and bravery and running a near-certain personal risk, he devoted himself 'body and soul' to the causes of the king.
At the age of twenty, he took part in the assault against the stronghold of Angoulême held by the League and captured the lieutenant of the city. In 1587, he distinguished himself at the Coutras (1587). He fought against the Leaguers of Duke of Mayenne at the Arques (1589) and the Ivry (1590), scoring victories that opened access to Paris for the future monarch of France. Henri, who abjured his Protestant faith in 1593 and was crowned in Chartres in 1594, entrusted Fouquet with public diplomatic missions as well as confidential matters.
In early June 1595, Fouquet saved Henri's life at the Battle of Fontaine-Française. He was appointed as Commissary of War, then Comptroller General of Posts, replacing Hugues Du Mas, a member of the House of Guise. He re-organized the postal network and in 1598 contributed to the creation of the French public post by opening up the royal postal service to the public, in commemoration of which a stamp bearing his likeness was issued by the Postal Service in 1946.
Catherine de Bourbon, the King's sister, Duchess of Bar and wife of Henry II, Duke of Lorraine, once said to Fouquet, whom she had known as a cook: "Il paraît, la Varenne, que tu as plus gagné à porter les poulets de mon frère messages, qu'à piquer les miens.
A close friendship united the king and his favourite since the first battle against the Leaguers on the battlefields of Ivry and Fontaine-Française. "Mon cœur, La Varenne m'a trouvé encore au lit", wrote Henry IV to Marie de Medici in 1606. On the other hand, Henri's relations with Sully were not as trusting. Sully disliked the king and denounced his vain ambition. Fouquet's influence, however, increased up until the final years of his reign.
During his career, Fouquet also served as an advisor to the parliament of Paris, master of the requests of the King (State Councillor), governor of the town and castle of La Flèche (1592), Governor of the town and castle of Angers (28 August 1604), then Lieutenant General of the province of Anjou (1613). Fouquet was equipped also benefit ecclesiastical abbeys Ainay (near Lyon), Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire, Saint-Nicolas d'Angers, Saint-Loup de Troyes, the Esvière priory near Angers.
His marriage to Catherine Foust brought him the lands of La Varenne. Guillaume Fouquet had several sons. He was knighted in 1598 and carried the title of Baron of Sainte-Suzanne. Then in 1616, he was made Marquis de Sainte-Suzanne and La Flèche.
The land of Saint-Romans in Poitou had previously been elevated into a barony for Fouquet and his second wife, Jeanne de Poix, citing "services rendered by them in acts wars, or in several other ways".

Ivan Deubner

Ivan Deubner (1873–1936) was a Russian Orthodox of German ethnicity who converted to the Russian Catholic Church of Byzantine rite. In 1903 Deubner was ordained a Russian Catholic priest and celebrated Divine Liturgy underground until 1917 in Saint Petersburg when the Russian Byzantine Rite Catholic Church was legalized temporarily. The Russian Catholic Church had been illegal under the Tsar's Orthodox rule of Russia, but was temporarily legalized under the Mensheviks. The first synod of this church took place and Deubner took part with seven other Ukrainian and Russian Catholic priests of Byzantine roots under the leadership of Ukrainian Metropolitan Andrew Sheptytsky. After legalization, he had a real participation inside of his church until his arrest by the Soviet government in 1923. Father Deubner was killed by a criminal in exile on November 12, 1936.

USNS Private Joe E. Mann (T-AK-253)

USNS "Private Joe E. Mann" (T-AK-253) was a United States Navy miscellaneous auxiliary ship acquired in 1950 from the U.S. Army where it was known as the USAT "Private Joe E. Mann". 
In 1960, the Navy converted the ship to a "Longview"-class missile range instrumentation ship and renamed her USNS "Richfield" (T-AGM-4). Richfield served on the Pacific Missile Range, based out of California, and was placed out of service in 1968.
Victory ship constructed in California.
"Private Joe E. Mann" (AK–253) was laid down, under U.S. Maritime Commission contract, as "Owensboro Victory" (MCV hull 719) by the Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard #2, Richmond, California, 12 June 1945; launched 21 July 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Robert A. Nieman; and delivered to the Maritime Commission, thence to Coastwise Lines for operation, 27 August 1945.
Post-World War II commercial service.
A month and a half after delivery, "Owensboro Victory" departed San Francisco, California, carrying cargo and passengers to occupied Japan. In December, she sailed for the United States, via the Suez Canal, and arrived Boston, Massachusetts, 7 February 1946. 
Shifting to New York City the following month, she made cargo runs to European ports until returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission in September for transfer to the Army Transportation Service.
U.S. Army service.
Renamed USAT "Private Joe E. Mann", 31 October 1947, she served the Army until she was again returned to the Maritime Commission and simultaneously transferred to the Navy, 7 August 1950.
U.S. Navy service.
Designated "AK–253", the Victory ship was manned by a civil service crew and operated under Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as a cargo ship until October 1958.
Conversion to a missile tracking ship.
Then fitted out as a missile range instrumentation ship, she was reassigned by MSTS to the Pacific Missile Range. Renamed and reclassified USNS "Richfield" (AGM–4) on 27 November 1960, she operated off the California coast, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force.
Final inactivation.
"Richfield" continued her missile tracking until transferred to the Maritime Administration, 21 November 1968 when she was berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California.
"Richfield’s" subsequent fate is not known.

Make Mine a Million

Make Mine a Million is a 1959 British comedy film starring Arthur Askey, Sid James, and Bernard Cribbins. It was directed by Lance Comfort. The film parodies the stuffiness of the 1950s BBC and the effect of television advertising in the era.
Plot.
Arthur Ashton is a makeup man working for National Television (a parody of the BBC). During a visit to the local laundry, he meets Sid Gibson a shady salesmen who is trying to flog "Bonko," a brand of washing powder, but who can't afford to advertise on TV. The fairly clueless Arthur agrees to help him, and they manage to plug an advert for Bonko on National Television by interrupting the live feed. This causes quite a stir amongst the National heads, who have Arthur fired. Despite this, the advert proves extremely popular and demand for the product soars. 
After repeating the stunt at Ascot Races, Sid, realising that this is potentially a huge moneymaker, does a deal with an advertising executive and, with Arthur's help, they plug cake mix at the Edinburgh Festival. After a narrow escape, Arthur wants to quit, but Sid persuades him to do one final job - interrupting a press conference between the British Prime Minister and the American President. On the way, the Post Office van they are using is hijacked by criminals. Arthur, who is in the back of the van, contacts the police to thwart the robbery, leading to the final barnyard showdown. In the end, Arthur, now a hero and celebrity, gets his own TV show, brokered by Sid, of course.
Reception.
The "Radio Times Guide to Films" gives the film three stars out of five, describing it as a "pacey romp".

Allsport GPS

Allsport GPS is a fitness tracking phone application combined with a website. It uses GPS to provide performance statistics and is run on a GPS-enabled cell phone. The GPS gives Allsport GPS a precise way of measuring statistics such as pace, speed, time and distance. It also allows the users to view their route overlaid on a map. This application is used for fitness training regimes and goal tracking. The application is run on a GPS-enabled cell phone. The workout information uploads to the Allsport GPS website wirelessly. In 2006 Allsport GPS introduced the ability to view workouts in the Trimble Outdoors Google Earth layer.
History.
Allsport GPS is a part of the Trimble Outdoors product family. It is owned by Trimble Navigation which was founded in 1978. The Allsport GPS application was bought by Trimble in April 2006. The software continues to be updated periodically. Allsport GPS started out as only available on limited phone models and carriers, but this list has steadily been expanding since then. In 2007 Allsport GPS was released on Blackberry phones. Allsport GPS was released on AT&T phones in 2008.
Functions.
The purpose of Allsport GPS is to support fitness and performance tracking. It is part of a trio of cell phone applications called Trimble Outdoors. It can be used for any type of workout, including running, jogging, mountain biking, road biking, and walking. The application is downloaded onto a GPS cell phone. The user then straps the phone onto themselves or onto their bike, or holds the phone for the duration of their workout. During the workout Allsport GPS supplies real time statistics such as calories burned, time, speed and distance. These statistics are updated every ten seconds. After the workout finishes, the data is automatically uploaded wirelessly to the website. The totals of the data can then be viewed, as well as a trip calendar showing all workouts over time, and elevation and speed profiles. Allsport GPS also has a map function. The workout can be viewed on a map both on the phone and on the website. The route can also be made public and shared with others. The user can do a trip search on the website and view other user’s shared workouts as well as workouts from "Bicycling Magazine". These routes can be downloaded from the website and used. The phone application also has a race-against-yourself feature. This enables the user to compare their times and distances multiple times over the same track.
Criticisms.
One criticism of this type of product is that carrying a mobile phone can be somewhat unwieldy for workout purposes. This can be solved by purchasing a carrier that can attach to a bike, or purchasing an armband, although some still do not fasten the phone very securely. Additionally, depending on what phone model is used, it can be heavier than other fitness devices such as Garmin Forerunner. Also with a clamshell phone design, the display data during the workout is quite small and can be hard to read. The interface on the phone can seem a bit rough as well. The application can also drain the battery quickly, depending on what phone model is used. This can be tempered by “turning off the application’s need to ping the network”. The phone application does experience some software bugs, but Allsport GPS says these are in the process of being fixed.
Reviews.
Allsport GPS has been received well in a variety of print and internet publications such as "Men’s Health Magazine" and "The New York Times Online". In 2007 it was named GPS Gadget of the Week by GeoCarta. Both Fred Zahradnik from About.com GPS and "Laptop Magazine" gave Allsport GPS 4/5 stars in 2007.

Dry Rot (film)

Dry Rot is a 1956 British comedy film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Ronald Shiner, Brian Rix, Peggy Mount and Sid James.
The story is an adaptation of a 1954 farce by John Chapman who also wrote the screenplay, in which the sketchy story plays second fiddle to the quick-paced action and unlikely situations. The plot concerns the practice of illicit gambling which was illegal in the United Kingdom at the time.
Three dodgy bookies, Alf Tubbe (Ronald Shiner), Flash Harry (Sidney James) and Fred Phipps (Brian Rix), plan to rig a horse race by kidnapping the fancied horse and its French jockey. They stay at a country house hotel near the racecourse, run by Colonel and Mrs Wagstaff, where they conceal the horse (and later the jockey) in a hidden cellar.
A subplot sees the dimwitted Fred fall in love with the hotel chambermaid Beth (Joan Sims).
The title "Dry Rot" refers to the rotten wood on the hotel stairs, which regularly catches every character unawares.

<doc id="18906517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906517" title="Pneuma">
Pneuma

Pneuma () is an ancient Greek word for "breath," and in a religious context for "spirit" or "soul." It has various technical meanings for medical writers and philosophers of classical antiquity, particularly in regard to physiology, and is also used in Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible and in the Greek New Testament. In classical philosophy, it is distinguishable from "psyche" (), which originally meant "breath of life", but is regularly translated as "spirit" or most often "soul".
Classical antiquity.
Presocratics.
"Pneuma", "air in motion, breath, wind," is equivalent in the material monism of Anaximenes to "aer" (ἀήρ, "air") as the element from which all else originated. This usage is the earliest extant occurrence of the term in philosophy. A quotation from Anaximenes observes that "just as our soul "(psyche)", being air "(aer)", holds us together, so do breath "(pneuma)" and air "(aer)" encompass the whole world." In this early usage, "aer" and "pneuma" are synonymous.
Ancient Greek medical theory.
In ancient Greek medicine, "pneuma" is the form of circulating air necessary for the systemic functioning of vital organs. It is the material that sustains consciousness in a body. According to Diocles and Praxagoras, the psychic pneuma mediates between the heart, regarded as the seat of Mind in some physiological theories of ancient medicine, and the brain.
The disciples of Hippocrates explained the maintenance of vital heat to be the function of the breath within the organism. Around 300 BC, Praxagoras discovered the distinction between the arteries and the veins. In the corpse arteries are empty; hence, in the light of these preconceptions they were declared to be vessels for conveying "pneuma" to the different parts of the body. A generation afterwards, Erasistratus made this the basis of a new theory of diseases and their treatment. The "pneuma", inhaled from the outside air, rushes through the arteries till it reaches the various centres, especially the brain and the heart, and there causes thought and organic movement.
Aristotle.
The "connate pneuma" of Aristotle is the warm mobile "air" that in the sperm transmits the capacity for locomotion and certain sensations to the offspring. These movements derive from the soul of the parent and are embodied by the "pneuma" as a material substance in semen. "Pneuma" is necessary for life, and as in medical theory is involved with the "vital heat," but the Aristotelian "pneuma" is less precisely and thoroughly defined than that of the Stoics.
Stoic "pneuma".
In Stoic philosophy, "pneuma" is the concept of the "breath of life," a mixture of the elements air (in motion) and fire (as warmth). For the Stoics, "pneuma" is the active, generative principle that organizes both the individual and the cosmos. In its highest form, "pneuma" constitutes the human soul ("psychê"), which is a fragment of the "pneuma" that is the soul of God (Zeus). As a force that structures matter, it exists even in inanimate objects.
Judaism and Christianity.
In Judaic and Christian usage, "pneuma" is a common word for "spirit" in the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament. At John 3:5, for example, "pneuma" is the Greek word translated into English as "spirit": "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit (pneuma), he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."

<doc id="18906524" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906524" title="Climate of New Zealand">
Climate of New Zealand

The climate of New Zealand is mostly cool temperate to warm temperate with a strong maritime influence. However, due to its highly varied topography, microclimates can be found across the country. The main factors are similar to those found in the British Isles owing to the Pacific Ocean and latitude, although the mountain ranges can cause significant climate variations in locations barely tens of kilometres from each other.
Weather.
The Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited (MetService), established as a State-Owned Enterprise in 1992, issues weather forecasts and official weather warnings.
Rainfall.
Rainfall is generally plentiful in New Zealand, with most cities receiving between 620 mm (as in Christchurch) and 1317 mm (Whangarei) of precipitation annually. Rainfall is normally distributed evenly throughout the year in most parts of the country, especially in the South Island. Northern and eastern parts of the country, including Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington see a slight winter maximum in line of places with Mediterranean climates, though the difference between the wettest and driest months is too small to justify the designation. Summer and autumn maxima can be found in places closer to the southwest, such as Invercargill and Milford Sound.
How much a place receives is highly dependent on topography. The Southern Alps, the North Island Volcanic Plateau and surrounding ranges can produce large variation in rainfalls in places barely tens of kilometres apart. Milford Sound receives over 6,700 mm of the rainfall a year on average while barely 100 km away Alexandra in Central Otago receives only slightly greater than 300 mm annually, giving it a borderline oceanic/semi-arid climate.
Snowfall.
Snow is common in New Zealand's South Island and southern parts of the North Island, and extremely rare in the northern parts of the North Island, with one snowfall in Auckland in 2011 after a period of 80 years where none occurred.
Temperature.
As with many islands in the world, the influence of the ocean curtails any extremes in temperature. The greatest temperature ranges are found in the interior of the Canterbury and Southland regions, as well as Central Otago. 
It should also be noted that many parts of the country have high humidity all year round, which can have the effect of it feeling warmer in summer and cooler in winter than the thermometer indicates.
Annual mean temperature.
Mean annual temperatures range from 10°C in the south to 16°C in the north of New Zealand. The coldest month is usually July and the warmest month is usually January or February. Generally there are relatively small variations between summer and winter temperatures. An example of this is Auckland which has a variation of just 9°C between the average mid-winter high temperature (14.7°C) and average mid-summer high temperature (23.7°C). Temperature variation throughout the day is also relatively small. The exception to this is inland areas and to the east of the ranges with daily variations that can be over 25°C and differences of up to 14°C between the average summer and winter high temperatures. Temperatures also drop about 0.7°C for every 100 m of altitude.
Northern cities such as Auckland, Whangarei, and Tauranga experience mean yearly maxima of between 19–20°C and mean yearly minima of around 11–12°C. Eastern cities on the North Island such as Gisborne, Napier and Hastings also have mean yearly maxima of between 19–20°C but have slightly lower yearly mean minima of around 9–10°C. The two largest cities on the South Island, Christchurch and Dunedin have mean yearly maxima of 17.3°C & 14.6°C and yearly mean minima of 7.3°C & 7.6°C respectively.
The annual daily mean temperature of the four main cities of New Zealand are 15.1°C for Auckland, 12.9°C for Wellington, 12.2°C for Christchurch and 11.1°C for Dunedin.
The nation-wide annual average temperature for the period 1971–2000 was 12.6°C. During the years 2000–2012, the nation-wide annual average temperature saw a slight increase to 12.7°C, with 5 of those years been cooler than average and the other years being average or above average.
Summer.
Daily maximum temperatures are normally in the mid to low 20s (°C) over most of the country. They are higher in northern, eastern and interior part of the country; Hastings is the warmest city on average followed by Napier and Gisborne. Eastern parts of the South Island are highly susceptible to the norwester, a Fohn wind which can result in temperatures going into the high 30s and even the low 40s. Rangiora in Canterbury holds the record maximum of 42.4°C recorded in 1973, with Christchurch recording 41.6°C in that same year. More recently, Timaru reached 41.3°C on Waitangi Day in 2011. Due to these winds, the cooler southern cities of Dunedin and Invercargill have higher all-time record temperatures than places further north such as Wellington, Auckland and Whangarei.
Winter.
Winter temperatures are much milder in New Zealand compared to other areas of similar latitude. Maxima are generally between 10°C and 15°C in the North Island, decreasing as one goes further south or inland. The South Island is a bit cooler, with maximum temperatures around 7°C–12°C, though sometimes lower. Eastern areas are generally cooler than the west. The lowest temperature ever recorded was –25.6°C at Ranfurly in Otago in 1903, with a more recent temperature of –21.6°C recorded in 1995 in nearby Ophir.
Severe weather events.
February 2, 1936: Worst storm of the 20th century in New Zealand.
April 10, 1968: Cyclone Giselle caused peak gusts of 145 knots (270 km/h) near Wellington, after colliding with an Antarctic storm moving north. Giselle led to the sinking of the interisland ferry TEV Wahine, and the loss of 53 lives. Total damage caused by the storm was estimated at $14 million.
December 20, 1976: Heavy rain caused widespread flooding and landslides in Wellington City and Hutt Valley. Hutt River burst its stopbanks and workers in Petone took refuge on factory roofs while rail links between Wellington city and the Hutt were suspended stranding thousands of commuters. Landslides destroyed houses and a boy was killed by a collapsing wall when a slip struck a hall in Crofton Downs. More than 350 mm of rain fell in 24 hours.
March 6–10, 1988: New Zealand is hit by a tropical cyclone once every eight to nine years. Cyclone Bola was one of the costliest cyclones in the history of New Zealand, causing severe damage as an extratropical cyclone when it passed near the country.
October 4, 1997: More than 60 homes were flooded and residents in Lower Hutt riverside areas were evacuated during downpours. Two people died, and isolated landslips closed some Wellington roads and parts of State Highway 1.
June 26, 1998: A severe thunderstorm affected Karori and Kelburn, with rain breaking all previous records and falling at a rate with a return period of well over 200 years. Rainfall at Kelburn totalled 69.5 mm between 7.35pm and 9.10pm.
October 13–27, 1998: Gale force northwesterlies blew throughout the lower North Island. On October 18, gusts of 183 km/h were recorded at Castlepoint. Winds were most severe on the following two days, when a gust of 215 km/h was recorded on a Wairarapa farm. A truck was overturned, ships ripped from their moorings in Wellington, and some houses lost their roofs.
January 10, 2002: Thunderstorms over Wellington resulted in torrential rainfall, about 40 mm in 30 minutes, and flash floods in the city centre. Similar storms, some with hail and surface flooding also happened in Whanganui, Manawatu, the central and eastern North Island, Buller and Nelson. The average recurrence interval of this rainfall event was estimated at more than 100 years.
February 14–16, 2004: The Valentines Day storms left hundreds of people homeless, and silt and floodwaters inundated considerable areas of farmland. Many rivers breached their banks, bridges were damaged and stock was swept away by floodwaters. A civil state of emergency was declared in Whanganui, Manawatu and Rangitikei. About 500 Lower Hutt residents were evacuated because of floodwaters, and many commuters were unable to enter Wellington. The event produced galeforce southerlies, with gusts of 230 km/h in the Tararua Range, and swells of 11m in Cook Strait.
July 25 and August 14, 2011 New Zealand snowstorms: The first severe winter storm brought the coldest winter snap in fifteen years. During August snow fell consistently down to sea level in Wellington for the first time since 1976, and snow even fell for a brief time in Auckland for the first time in 80 years.

<doc id="18906582" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906582" title="Mazzatello">
Mazzatello

Mazzatello (abbreviated mazza) was a method of capital punishment used by the Papal States from the late 18th century to 1870. The method was named after the implement used in the execution: a large, long-handled mallet or pole-ax. According to Abbott, "mazzatello" constituted "one of the most brutal methods of execution ever devised, requiring minimal skill on the part of the executioner and superhuman acquiescence by the victim". Megivern cites "mazzatello" as one example of an execution method devised by the Papal States that "competed with and in some instances surpassed those of other regimes for cruelty".
The condemned would be led to a scaffold in a public square of Rome, accompanied by a priest (the confessor of the condemned); the platform also contained a coffin and the masked executioner, dressed in black. A prayer would first be said for the condemned's soul. Then, the mallet would be raised, swung through the air to gain momentum, and then brought down on the head of the prisoner, similar to a contemporary method of slaughtering cattle in stockyards. The condemned was usually knocked unconscious rather than being killed instantly, so the throat of the prisoner would then be slit with a knife. Along with drawing and quartering (sometimes, but not always, after a hanging), "mazzatello" was reserved for crimes that were considered "especially loathsome".
A variation of this method appears in Alexandre Dumas's novel, "The Count of Monte Cristo", as "la mazzolata" and "mazzolato", when a prisoner sentenced to execution is bludgeoned on the side of his head with a mace.

<doc id="18906636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906636" title="Timberline Trail">
Timberline Trail

Timberline Trail is a hiking trail around Mount Hood in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is in mostly wilderness but also goes near Timberline Lodge, Cloud Cap Inn (the oldest building on Mt. Hood), and Mount Hood Meadows ski area.
History.
The Timberline Trail was constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the majority of their work taking place in the summer of 1934 at a cost of $10,000. Sections of the trail have changed due to damage caused by landslides and washouts since then.
In September 1938 a group of hikers completed the entire trail (36 miles at the time) in 47 hours, making local news and increasing awareness of the trail.
Hiking the trail.
The trail, Forest Service trail #600, shares eleven miles (18 km) with the Pacific Crest Trail and alternates above and below the timberline. The trail is rerouted periodically due to washouts and to avoid sensitive high altitude and alpine meadows. It has a handful of informal campsites for backpackers, although camping is permitted anywhere outside the meadows and at least from water bodies. There are several hazardous stream crossings, especially on the west side and at landslide-prone Eliot Branch near Cloud Cap which closed the trail there in 2007. The trail has several significant vertical ascents and descents totaling , mostly at canyon crossings. The trail is accessible from Timberline Lodge, which has Forest Service permitted parking (which you can purchase at Timberline Lodge) for backpackers, and numerous connecting trails.
The hike is typically completed in three to five days, but some ambitious hikers complete it in one or two days.
Hazards.
Several dangers to hikers are present: hypothermia, falling, and drowning. Areas of special concern are the Sandy River crossing, which caused a hiker death in 2004,
the Eliot Creek, which washed out and closed a section of the trail in 2007,
and the Muddy Fork section, which washed out in 2007 and has deteriorated in the past year to a point where it is "barely passable" according to a US Forest Service sign. The Sandy River can be crossed on a log bridges, which are erected seasonally.
A storm in November 2006 washed out The Eliot Creek section of the trail. Since then hikers have either had to scramble down the loose and hazardous slopes or climb higher (onto the Eliot Glacier). As of July 2007 there was talk of a re-routing of the trail below the washout with the possibility of building a suspension bridge, according to a member of the Mount Hood National Forest.
The Muddy Fork section can be avoided by taking the Pacific Crest Trail (trail 2000) from Bald Mountain to trail 797 to Ramona Falls. This not only makes the hike much safer, but also shortens the total hike by . A common problem with this shortcut is that the signs at the Bald Mountain crossroads mislabel the PCT due to a re-routing of the PCT several years ago.
The August and September 2011 Dollar Lake fire temporarily closed the Timberline Trail. It is open through the burned sections as of 2012.

Nils Collett Vogt

Nils Collett Vogt (24 September 1864 – 23 December 1937) was a Norwegian poet.
He was born in Christiania (now Oslo) as the son of tramway director Jens Theodor Paludan Vogt (1830–1892) and writer Johanne Collett (1833–1906). He was great-nephew of Jonas Collett and second cousin of Johan Vogt (1858–1932), Nils Vogt (1859–1927), Paul Benjamin Vogt (1863–1947) and Ragnar Vogt (1870–1943). His family first lived at St. Hanshaugen, Vestre Aker, before they in 1877 moved into a newly constructed villa in Josefines gate, Homansbyen. According to his biographer in "Norsk biografisk leksikon", Hans H. Skei, he grew up in a conservative upper-class environment, but opposed "authorities and conservative attitudes". At a young age he joined the Liberal Party and penned radical articles to newspapers at the age of seventeen. After a failed matric course, his family sent him to Hamar where he took examen artium in 1884.
For a short period of time, Vogt taught at a manor house in Värmland, before he started studying law. He discarded the law studies in favor of poetry writing for the periodical "Nyt Tidsskrift". Vogt thereupon travelled to Copenhagen, where he met Christian Krogh and made his debut with the poetry collection "Digte" (lit. "Poems"). He published the novel "Familiens sorg" in 1889, which was based on his own childhood and conflicts with his father. He had planned to write a resume of the novel, but he soon realised that the intellectual conditions in the 1890s were better for poetry than for fiction.
Following his father's 1892 death, Vogt travelled to the Italian island Capri. In 1894, he published the poetry collection "Fra Vaar til Høst" ("From Spring to Autumn"), which according to Skei represented his "final breakthrough". In the same year, he married Siri Maria Thyselius (1854–1936), with whom he lived at her homeplace. In the following decades, Vogt wrote many poems and plays, and also a few novels. His autobiography "Fra gutt til mann" ("From Boy to Man") was published in 1932, and is amongst his best known works. His wife died in 1936, and he moved to Lillehammer, where he died on 23 December 1937.

<doc id="18906674" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906674" title="Climate of Paraguay">
Climate of Paraguay

The climate of Paraguay consists of a subtropical climate in the Paraneña region and a tropical climate in the Chaco. The Paraneña region has a humid climate, with abundant precipitation throughout the year and only moderate seasonal changes in temperature.
During the Southern Hemisphere's summer, which corresponds to the northern winter, the dominant influence on the climate is the warm sirocco winds blowing out of the northeast.
During the winter, the dominant wind is the cold "pampero" from the South Atlantic, which blows across Argentina and is deflected northeastward by the Andes in the southern part of that country. Because of the lack of topographic barriers within Paraguay, these opposite prevailing winds bring about abrupt and irregular changes in the usually moderate weather. Winds are generally brisk. Velocities of have been reported in southern locations, and the town of Encarnación was once leveled by a tornado.
Paraneña region.
The Paraneña region has only two distinct seasons: summer from October to March and winter from May to August. April and September are transitional months in which temperatures are below the midsummer averages and minimums may dip below freezing. Climatically, autumn and spring do not really exist.
Winter.
During the mild winters, July is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of about in Asunción and on the Paraná Plateau. There is no significant north-south variation. The number of days with temperatures falling below freezing ranges from as few as three to as many as sixteen yearly, and with even wider variations deep in the interior. Some winters are very mild, with winds blowing constantly from the north, and little frost.
During a cold winter, however, tongues of Antarctic air bring subfreezing temperatures to all areas. No part of the Paraneña region is entirely free from the possibility of frost and consequent damage to crops, and snow flurries have been reported in various locations.
Moist tropical air keeps the weather warm in the Paraneña region from October through March. In Asunción the seasonal average is about 24 °C (75.2 °F), with January—the warmest month—averaging 29 °C (84.2 °F). Villarrica has a seasonal mean temperature of 21 °C (69.8 °F) and a January mean of 27 °C (80.6 °F).
Summer.
During the summer, daytime temperatures reaching 38 °C (100.4 °F) are fairly common. Frequent waves of cool air from the south, however, cause weather that alternates between clear, humid conditions and storms. Skies will be almost cloudless for a week to ten days as temperature and humidity rise continually. As the soggy heat nears intolerable limits, thunderstorms preceding a cold front will blow in from the south, and temperatures will drop as much as 15 °C (27.0 °F) in a few minutes.
Rainfall in the Paraneña region is fairly evenly distributed. Although local meteorological conditions play a contributing role, rain usually falls when tropical air masses are dominant. The least rain falls in August, when averages in various parts of the region range from 200 to 100 millimeters (7.9 to 3.9 in). The two periods of maximum precipitation are March through May and October to November.
For the region as a whole, the difference between the driest and the wettest months ranges from 100 to 180 millimeters (3.9 to 7.1 in). The annual average rainfall is 1,270 millimeters (50 in), although the average on the Paraná Plateau is 250 to 380 millimeters (9.8 to 15.0 in) greater. All subregions may experience considerable variations from year to year. Asunción has recorded as much as 208 millimeters (8.2 in) and as little as 560 millimeters (22 in) of annual rainfall; Puerto Bertoni on the Paraná Plateau has recorded as much as 3,300 millimeters (129.9 in) and as little as 790 millimeters (31.1 in).
Chaco.
In contrast to the Paraneña region, the Chaco has a tropical wet-and-dry climate bordering on semi-arid. The Chaco experiences seasons that alternately flood and parch the land, yet seasonal variations in temperature are modest. Chaco temperatures are usually high, the averages dropping only slightly in winter. Even at night the air is stifling despite the usually present breezes. Rainfall is light, varying from 500 to 1,000 millimeters (19.7 to 39.4 in) per year, except in the higher land to the northwest where it is somewhat greater. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months, and extensive areas that are deserts in winter become summer swamps.

Climate of the Philippines

The Climate of the Philippines is either tropical rainforest, tropical savanna or tropical monsoon, or humid subtropical (in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall. There are two seasons in the country, the wet season and the dry season, based upon the amount of rainfall. This is dependent as well on your location in the country as some areas experience rain all throughout the year (see Climate Types). Based on temperature, the seven warmest months of the year are from March to October; the winter monsoon brings cooler air from November to February. May is the warmest month, and January, the coolest.
Weather in the Philippines is monitored and managed by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (known locally by its acronym, PAGASA).
Rainfall.
The summer monsoon brings heavy rains to most of the archipelago from May to October. Annual average rainfall ranges from as much as in the mountainous east coast section of the country, to less than in some of the sheltered valleys. Monsoon rains, although hard and drenching, are not normally associated with high winds and waves. 
Rainfall usually happen mostly from the month of March to October. 
At least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines can be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receiving less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 1911 cyclone, which dropped over of rainfall within a 24-hour period in Baguio City.
Temperature.
The average year-round temperature measured from all the weather stations in the Philippines, 
except Baguio City, is 
Cooler days are usually felt in the month of January with temperature averaging at and the warmest days, in the month of May with a mean of .
Elevation factors significantly in the variation of temperature in the Philippines. In
Baguio City, with an elevation of 1,500 m (5,000 ft) above sea level, the mean average is or cooler
by about 4.3 °C (15 °F). In 1915, a one-year study was conducted by William H. Brown of the Philippine Journal of Science on top of Mount Banahaw at 2,100 m. (6,900 ft) elevation. The mean temperature measured was , a difference of 10 °C (21.6 °F) from the lowland mean temperature.
Typhoons.
The Philippines sit astride the typhoon belt, and the country suffers an annual onslaught of dangerous storms from July through October. These are especially hazardous for northern and eastern Luzon and the Bicol and Eastern Visayas regions, but Manila gets devastated periodically as well.
Bagyó is the local term to any tropical cyclone in the Philippine Islands. From the statistics gathered by PAGASA from 1948 to 2004, around an average of 20 storms and/or typhoons per year enter the PAR (Philippine Area of Responsibility) - the designated area assigned to PAGASA to monitor during weather disturbances. Those that made landfall or crossed the Philippines, the average was nine per year. In 1993, a record 19 typhoons made landfall in the country making it the most in one year. The least amount per year were 4 during the years 1955, 1958, 1992 and 1997.
PAGASA categorises typhoons into four types according to wind speed. Once a tropical cyclone enters the Philippine Area of Responsibility, regardless of strength, PAGASA gives it a local name for identification purposes by the media, government, and the general public. 
Deadliest storm.
The deadliest typhoon to impact the Philippines was Typhoon Yolanda) in November 8, 2013, in which 6, 800 lives were lost from its storm surges and powerful winds. Over 1,000 went missing and nearly 20,000 got injured.
Strongest typhoons.
The strongest storm that hit the Philippines was Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Yolanda. Winds reached 315 km/h in 1-min sustained and may have been the strongest storm in history in terms of wind speeds as wind speeds before the 1970s were too high.
In terms of central pressure, Typhoon Megi (2010) measured 885 mb. With this, this is the strongest storm ever to make landfall in terms of pressure.
Climate types.
There are four recognized climate types in the Philippines, and they are based on the distribution of rainfall "(See the Philippine Climate Map)". They are described as follows:
Representative cities.
Type I: Poblacion Hinatuan,surigao del sur.
<noinclude>
Humidity.
Relative humidity is high in the Philippines. A high amount of moisture or vapor in the air makes hot temperatures feel hotter. This quantity of moisture is due to different factors - the extraordinary evaporation from the seas that surrounds the country on all sides, to the different prevailing winds in the different seasons of the year, and finally, to the abundant rains so common in a tropical country. The first may be considered as general causes of the great humidity, which is generally observed in all the islands throughout the year. The last two may influence the different degree of humidity for the different months of the year and for the different regions of the Archipelago.
Seasons.
PAGASA divides the climate of the country into two main seasons—rainy and dry—with the dry season further subdivided into two:
Graphically the seasons can be represented this way:
The months of April and May, the hot and dry months when schools are on their long, between-years break, is referred to as summer while in most of the Northern Hemisphere those months are part of spring.

In these games the player has to follow the main character, Jake, around and help him on his mission to have sex with various women he sees. Usually the aim is to get him to have sex with one woman; however, a few episodes require more than one to complete. The material contains strong language, drug usage, promiscuity, graphic sexual activity and irresponsible behaviour.
Web Series.
Play.
Each episode takes place in different surroundings, and some are easier to complete than others. In the first few episodes, the setting of the game did not change; however, as the series progressed, games gave Jake the ability to choose which setting to go to.
The character of Jake is a Gary Stu for Julian Max Metter (also the producer, writer, director and artist, and voice of Jake). The player controls Jake by using a mouse to click on various buttons to choose actions (such as choosing whether or not to take ecstasy) or dialogue (such as to pretend to be local or a tourist). Jake responds accordingly. If, throughout the course of the game, the player chooses the right responses each time, Jake will win and have sex with a girl. The player will be rewarded with a sex scene and the text "You get laid, you big pimp!". In some cases, Jake has sex with more than one girl - in a few episodes, this happens throughout the plot and is referred to as a Bonus Bang; some episodes, notably "Hat Trick" and "It's Your Birthday", require Jake to have sex with more than one girl in order to win. On many occasions the girls were voiced by whomever Julian had met in bars while making the games.
Heterosexual and lesbian sex are the only sexual acts portrayed in the games, although allegedly an animation loop involving Jake being sodomized by his "wingman" was produced and nearly made it into one episode as an Easter egg. If the player makes a mistake, Jake will say something scathing, such as "you have no game", and the player will either be taken back to the previous decision and choose a different path, or in some cases restart the episode. Some paths lead you to the same place and many of the games have a safe point, whence the player can make any decision and end up winning.
The episodes were originally available via the official Romp website (romp.com); however, since it went defunct, a number of websites have started to host the episodes. Due to the company Nebulous Films taking on animation following Episode 9, players may notice a large difference in animation quality between the very early episodes and the more recent ones. After their work on "Booty Call", some of the Nebulous went on to work for Warner Brothers on their first Flash show, "Mucha Lucha".
Characters.
Jake Koeokd.
Jake himself is presented as a brash, boorish, egotistical young man somewhere in his late 20s and loosely based on creator Julian Max Metter. Despite his character, he is also rather charming, especially when it comes to chatting up ladies. He has very low moral standards, indulging heavily in drugs and drinking large amounts of alcohol - his favourite drink is a Jack Daniel's and Coke. He appears to have the ability to pull drinks and drugs from anywhere in any given situation.
Jake's surname is never mentioned, he usually gives his name as "Just Jake" or "Jake, Baby" but in the school reunion episode an envelope can be seen with his name on it as "Jake L Koeokd", with a nonsensical postal address in California. Strangely enough the same name and address appears in the top left hand corner of the envelope implying that he posted his reunion invite to himself. 
Others.
There are few other recurring characters in the game, due to the fact that most of its characters are girls, and Jake picks a different one every time; however, Jake is sometimes seen with his best friends acting as "wingmen". In many episodes, Calvin accompanies Jake; he is an easy-going young man with blonde hair and sun-glasses. In the last few episodes, Dre replaces Calvin; he is slightly younger (he graduates in his first appearance, "Graduation Part 1"), and smoother than Calvin. He has black hair and a light brown complexion. All main characters appear in the final episode.
Extra webisodes.
The three extra webisodes are not games. One is a music video spoof entitled "Booty Call"; the other two are news reports, reporting on the death of Jake and his subsequent funeral. These appear to happen out of continuity with the games themselves, as Jake does not publicly die in any episode.
Jake "was" stabbed to death at the end of the first "Mardi Gras" episode, but was brought back to life in the second. As "Mardi Gras 2" is set immediately afterwards, this happens almost instantly, so there would have been no report on his killing and certainly no funeral.
Film.
A feature film, this time fully named "Jake's Booty Call", was released, based on the Flash series. The screenplay was written by director Eric Eisner (who co-directed the film with J. Chad Hammes), and voice-acting was provided by Jay Lerner and Julian Max Metter. The film was developed by "Romp Studios", taking the name of the website, and has the curious accolade of being the first film ever to be created entirely in Macromedia Flash. The quality of the animation and design is superior to that of the games, due to the cutting edge Flash animation techniques first pioneered by the film's Production Design team of Jason Raines and Michael Montaine. Some of the animators were later moved to Six Point Harness, an animation studio.
The film features Jake befriending Siton Manaba, who is revealed to be a prince looking for love, and trouble ensues as they go travelling together. It is in continuity with the series, and the making of the movie is mentioned at some points through the episodes, although its events never are. At the end of the movie, Jake moves back to his home, so it could feasibly take place at any point in "Booty Call"'s canon, the only indication of its point being the appearance of Calvin.
The film was released independently in 2003; however, it was released in the USA only and through selected media, therefore it never went mainstream. National Lampoon picked up the film and took it on tour, showing it mostly at universities around the world. Despite the same themes from the series - drug abuse, alcohol and graphic sexuality (although full-frontal nudity is never seen) - it was rated R by the MPAA, marked as suitable for over 17s. It does not have an international rating.
It was released for DVD in February 2008, five years after its independent release. Interested parties in Europe and further afield can order the movie by export.
Reception.
Adweek described "Booty Call" as employing "Animal House" humour and suggested that the 16-to-25-year-old male target demographic got a rise from the sexual references. The episodes were also met with amusement by the producer's father, Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who crafted the website's "detailed and legalese 'Terms of Use'".

<doc id="18906734" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18906734" title="Supreme Court of Christmas Island">
Supreme Court of Christmas Island

The Supreme Court of Christmas Island was the highest court for Christmas Island, an external territory of Australia. The court was originally established in 1958 after sovereignty over the island was transferred from the United Kingdom to Australia. The court had jurisdiction to deal with all serious crimes and major civil claims for damages occurring on the island. The court was abolished on 10 May 2002.
Judges from Australian courts were appointed to be judges of the court. Those judges would travel to the island to hear, consider and determine cases. In 1992, courts in Western Australia were given concurrent authority to deal with cases on the island, and those courts became the main venue in which litigation was conducted. Since the court’s abolition, its functions have been replaced by the Supreme Court of Western Australia, which now has sole jurisdiction on the island.
First courts on the island.
Europeans first discovered the island of Christmas Island on Christmas Day, 25 December 1643. Captain William Mynors gave the island its name because of the day it was found.
The British Crown annexed the uninhabited island on 6 June 1888 following the discovery of phosphate on the island. The island was annexed to the Straits Settlements colony on 10 June 1900. Japanese Imperial Forces occupied the island during the Second World War. After the end of the Second World War, a military court was set up in Singapore to prosecute seven people for mutiny during the war. With the dissolution of the Straits Settlements in 1946, the island was included within the new Singapore colony. On 1 October 1958, sovereignty over the island was transferred to the Australian Government following a payment to the Government of Singapore, after a brief period as a separate British colony.
Until 1992, Singapore laws continued to apply to the island, although this changed when legislation was passed bringing the laws of the country into line with Australian law.
Establishment of the court.
The court was established by section 11 of the Christmas Island Act 1958 (Cth). That same law signified the acceptance by Australia of Christmas Island as a territory. The court was in all respects a superior court and had all the same powers that other supreme courts in Australia had. The court was to be constituted according to local ordinances made by the Governor-General of Australia on the advice of the Australian Government.
The court was a superior court and a court of record. Judges appointed by the Governor-General constituted it as required. The court was permitted to sit anywhere in Australia as the interests of justice required, and was confined to hearing a case on the island. When hearing criminal cases, the court sat with a jury to determine an accused person’s guilt. If the court sat outside the island, the court could use jurors from the State or Territory that the court was actually sitting at.
Notable cases.
In April 1988 the court tried two defendants concerning the murder of Tan Soo Cher (Tan). Tan had been murdered during the early hours of 12 May 1987 by the infliction of multiple stab wounds to the front and back of his torso and his arms. The defendants were alleged to have approached Tan in the hope of borrowing money. On the defendants’ version of events, Tan refused and brandished a knife. The defendants claimed to have disarmed Tan, stabbed him, and then left with the money found on Tan. The defendants argued self-defence at their trial.
The trial was held in Western Australia rather than Christmas Island and led to the conviction of the defendants. On appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, Justices Jenkinson, Spender and French ordered new trials because the jury was not properly directed as to provocation. The case was unusual in that the defendants were tried on the basis of a murder charge under the Singapore Criminal Code, which continued to apply on Christmas Island, rather than Australian law. Justice French remarked that the case highlighted “the legal twilight” in which Australians on Christmas Island lived. French said that criminal laws were established under the Singapore Code, unchanged since 1958, which in turn had been based on the Indian Penal Code drafted in 1837 and introduced in India in 1862. This all led to the unsatisfactory situation of prosecuting Australians under Singaporean law.
Abolition of the court.
Since 1992, courts in Western Australia have undertaken the work of the court under a service delivery arrangement with the Commonwealth Government. This was introduced at the same time as the introduction of Western Australian law to the island. The Western Australian Magistrates Court, District Court, Supreme Court, Family Court, Children's Court and Coroner's Court all provide services to the island as required. As a result, a separate superior court in the territory was no longer necessary. A proclamation issued by the Governor-General under section 14G of the Christmas Island Act formally abolished the Court on 10 May 2002.

Teen Patti (film)

Teen Patti () is a 2010 Bollywood film directed by Leena Yadav. It stars Amitabh Bachchan, Ben Kingsley, R. Madhavan, Raima Sen, Shraddha Kapoor and is produced by Ambika Hinduja under the banners Hinduja Ventures and Serendipity Films. The film is about a mathematics professor, played by Bachchan, who is trying to write a thesis on probability and relates it to the Indian card game of Teen Patti.
Plot.
The story begins with Venkat Subhramaniam (Amitabh Bachchan), an Indian professor of mathematics, software engineering, and a genius, teaching mathematics in his village to kids when a postman comes with a letter. The letter is from British mathematician Perci Trachtenberg (Ben Kingsley), widely regarded as the world's greatest living mathematician, who invites Venkat to a high rolling casino in London. Venkat tells Perci about an equation that could not only change the dialogue on mathematics forever, but one that has already left an indelible impression of guilt — for many painful reasons — on Venkat's life. It is shown in the past that the reclusive genius Venkat has cracked a theory that could redefine the principles of probability and randomness. Venkat tries to use this experiment in a game called Teen Patti, (a poker game) which he plays on the Internet. According to this experiment if a person playing Teen Patti knows the three cards with one of the players (except him) he/she can guess the other cards with the rest of the players and therefore can guess who is going to win with the theory of probability.
Venkat succeeds on his theory and submits his report to the institute where he teaches, but they reject his report. Venkat is sure about his theory and wants to try out in reality with live players. So he talks with younger professor Shantanu (R. Madhavan) about his theory and tells him to get three students to try out this experiment. Shantanu arranges three students — Sid (Siddharth Kher), the college rockstar; Aparna or Apu Shraddha Kapoor, the studious geek who has a crush on Sid' and Vikram or Vikku (Dhruv Ganesh), the boy next door. They come together and start playing the game. Venkat's theory, like the last time, proves to be successful. Venkat says that after a few more games he'll be sure to crack his equation and even be able to study it better. Shantanu tells him that he should try using his theory in the real world, where there are people who actually gamble and play Teen Patti, i.e., in underground dens or 'addas'.
Although Venkat has no interest in the money that could come from practicing his equation to crack Teen Patti, he eventually succumbs to Shantanu's charismatic persuasion. Soon, with the help of his new students, they explore the addas of wild Bombay. Later another student from the institute, Abbas (Vaibhav Talwar), the rich spoiled brat joins the gang and arranges for them parties in casinos, private clubs, etc. But what starts out as an experiment between a charismatic young professor and an eccentric older one soon descends into a game neither of them can control. The money they earn gets stolen; someone is blackmailing them; they get greedy about money and, in the course of time, they change into different people and even start betraying each other.
Production.
The film was shot in India and England. Production designer Ayesha Punvani created gambling dens in places like abandoned train yards, dockyards, abandoned factories, mills that have been shut down and an ice factory.
Reception.
Film critic and author Anupama Chopra called it "a train wreck of a movie".
Influences.
"Teen Patti" is inspired by the English film "21" (without any mention). The end of the film when Amitabh Bachchan refuses to accept Isaac Newton Award for Applied Mathematics is inspired by the refusal of the Fields Medal by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman.

He is best known for his tenure in Combat Zone Wrestling, where he was a one time Junior Heavyweight Champion and a one time World Tag Team Champion with Nick Mondo. Blade has wrestled in such companies such as Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling, Big Japan Pro Wrestling and Jersey All Pro Wrestling. Blade was one of the original CZW Wrestling Academy graduates alongside Lobo, Nick Gage, Justice Pain and T.C.K.
Career.

In addition to a background martial arts, Blade was trained by CZW owner John Zandig.

Ric Blade and Reckless Youth went on a three way against Mike Quackenbush in a 3 way dance, which he lost. Ric captured his first championship - the CZW World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Justice Pain at "Street Fight 99" on July 19, 1999 in Mantua, NJ. At "Pyramid Of Hell" on August 21, 1999 in a brutal "Pyramid Of Hell" match, Nick Gage and Zandig defeated Lobo and Ric Blade, Ric turned on Lobo and jumped off an open roof to Lobo into the stack of tables.

At "They Said It Couldn't Been Done", Blade fought Trent Acid for the CZW Junior Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Blade went for a swan dive off the top of a rental truck, but he misjudged his jump and only the top of his head made connection with his opponent. However, Blade won the match as well as the title.

He landed straight on his leg, and his shin bone actually protruded through his ankle, letting out a blood curdling scream, as paramedics worked on him on the floor, fans in attendance wondered if they would ever see Blade in a wrestling ring again. The story however didn't end there as Ric Blade displayed some anger towards the man who had trained him John Zandig. He felt there was no support from the CZW owner, and took his anger out in a way that wouldn't help his case; on the internet. Ric Blade blasted Zandig, the man he had helped build CZW with, but Blade felt when he needed help there was none.

Giancarlo Siani

Giancarlo Siani (Naples, September 19, 1959, - Naples, September 23, 1985) was an Italian crime reporter from Naples, who was killed by the Camorra, the Neapolitan crime organization.
He started to write in the magazine "Osservatorio sulla camorra", and later as a stringer for "Il Mattino", the principal newspaper of Naples. He was assigned to the local area editor of Castellammare di Stabia. He wrote articles about the links between organized crime, politicians and construction contracts.
Siani was killed on September 23, 1985, in Naples by the Camorra, while approaching his apartment. At the time he was conducting an investigation of one of their leaders, Valentino Gionta. Gionta was the boss of the Gionta clan, a Camorra clan that was based in Torre Annunziata and controlled cigarette smuggling.
On June 10, 1985, three months before he was killed, Siani had revealed that the arrest of Valentino Gionta had been decided by Lorenzo Nuvoletta, head of the Nuvoletta clan, a rival Camorra clan. Siani was preparing a dossier on the Torre Annunziata massacre in August 1984, which left eight people killed and 24 wounded among the Gionta clan, allied with the Nuvolettas at the time. After the massacre tensions between the two clans had increased.
In 2000, Angelo Nuvoletta, Valentino Gionta and Luigi Baccante were sentenced in absentia to life in prison for ordering the murder, as well as the material killers Gaetano Iacolare, Ferdinando Cataldo, Armando Del Core and Ciro Cappuccio.
In 2009, the movie "Fortapàsc" based on his life story was released, directed by Marco Risi. The title (pronounced "Fort-apash" in dialect) is a reference to John Ford's classic western, "Fort Apache," and the lawlessness of Camorra-ruled Naples.

The song was written by Kim Richey, Angelo Petraglia, and Larry Gottlieb and was the first single from her album, "Everybody Knows." The song was a number 1 country hit for Yearwood and the title track of the album reached the Top 5 later in 1997. The song was done in an Adult Contemporary-like style according to Allmusic.com. 
Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying that the song's "strong and sure melody and its well-crafted lyrics are buoyed by Yearwood's expressive voice."
Music video.
A music video was also made after the song's release, showcasing Yearwood and friends in retro outfits, vintage glasses and vivid colors and backdrops. As revealed in an interview on CMT's Video bio, some of the clothing Yearwood wore in the video was raided from the closet of her then-husband Robert Reynolds. The video debuted on CMT Wednesday, June 26, 1996, on a since-cancelled weekly show, "CMT Delivery Room".

Cherryfield Historic District

The Cherryfield Historic District is a historic area in Cherryfield, Maine. The district was entered in the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1990 by recommendation of the Maine Historic Preservation Commission and was approved by the Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C.
Overview.
The Cherryfield Historic District is an area of approximately lying on both sides of the Narraguagus River. The historic district comprises a collection of substantially intact residential and commercial buildings that clearly depict the nineteenth century development of a riverside community. There are 52 contributing and 10 non contributing buildings in the district. Two historic buildings outside the district but also in the National Register are included in this guide.
Cherryfield was approved as a historic district because of its depiction of community development and association with commerce, through its association with significant persons, and for architectural history.
Although the 52 contributing buildings in the district and those outside the district are framed with wood, the district architecturally holds representative examples of the most popular nineteenth century residential styles with an especially impressive concentration of Second Empire dwellings. Included in the styles are:  Second Empire; Federal; Greek Revival; Italianate; Queen Anne; Colonial Revival. 
The Second Empire Style houses are Cherryfield's unique contribution to the inventory of Maine's historic patterns of building. While the design of these houses may be equalled and surpassed in urban areas such as Bangor and Portland; given their small town context, integrity and relative number they are truly remarkable.

Moroccan-Dutch

The terms Moroccan-Dutch or Dutch-Moroccans refer to immigrants from Morocco to the Netherlands and their descendants. They are one of the larger "allochtoon" groups, making up 10.4% of the country's total population of foreign background.
Migration history.
Moroccans were not much represented in the first major wave of migration to the Netherlands from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, which consisted mostly of people from the Netherlands' former colonies. However, they began to show up in large numbers during the second wave; between 1965 and 1973, one hundred thousand Turks and Moroccans came to the Netherlands, and a further 170,000 from 1974 to 1986. Earlier arrivals consisted of guest workers, whose recruitment and admission was governed by a bilateral treaty signed in 1969. However, the guests did not return home. From the 1970s, the number arriving under family reunification schemes became more significant. Around half originated from the mountainous Rif region.
Demographic characteristics.
, statistics of the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek with regards to people of Moroccan origin showed:
For a total of 353,987 persons (176,647 men, 164,881). This represented roughly 51% growth over the 1996 total of 225,088 persons. The population has shown a year-on-year increase every year since then.
As of 2011, 16% of male youth under 25 years of age in Amsterdam is Dutch-Moroccan.
Culture.
"I know my friends from the street," a 2002 Verweij-Jonker Institute report on leisure time of Dutch Turks and Dutch Moroccans, stated that Dutch Moroccans tend to make few new contacts from the street, tend to spend leisure time with members of the same ethnicity and sex, and have leisure activities heavily influenced by "Moroccan culture". Frank Buijs did a 1993 study of young Moroccan men in the Netherlands. He found that young men prefer attending "Moroccan parties" over other types of parties since they are able to meet other Moroccans and consider the parties to be "fun".
Trees Pels' 1982 literature study of Dutch-Turks and Dutch-Moroccans concluded that, of both groups, due to socio-cultural factors, girls "infrequently" participated in leisure activities.
In the 1990s several organizations were established to encourage and promote Dutch Moroccan cultural productions. In 1996 Hassan Housetta concluded that the Dutch Moroccan community received little support from the Dutch government in some of its artistic and cultural expressions. Bousetta concluded that, in the words of Miriam Gazzah, author of "Rhythms and Rhymes of Life: Music and Identification Processes of Dutch-Moroccan Youth," "the state's policy aimed at political emancipation of Moroccans obstructed rather than promoted the production of new or innovative cultural and artistic developments."
LGBT-related attitudes.
Laurens Buijs, Gert Hekma, and Jan Willem Duyvendak, authors of the 2011 article "‘As long as they keep away from me’: The paradox of antigay violence in a gay-friendly country," explained that members of three ethnic groups, Dutch-Moroccans, Dutch-Antilleans, and Dutch-Turks, "are less accepting towards homosexuality, also when controlled for gender, age, level of education and religiosity." Police files state that perpetrators of anti-gay violence in Amsterdam are as often Dutch as they are Dutch-Moroccan, and Buijs et. al said Dutch-Moroccans "are over-represented as suspects" because 16% of male youth under 25 are Dutch-Moroccan compared to 39% of male youth under 25 being native Dutch. The Party for Freedom (PVV) had stated that "The perpetrators of antigay violence in the big cities are almost always Muslims, almost always Moroccans." Buijs et al say that overrepresentation of Dutch-Moroccans in statistics of antigay violence recorded by Dutch police is "more likely the result of their low social-economic position, combined with the fact that their family networks are less tight, and their upbringing less strict, than for example those of Dutch-Turks." Buijs et al say that the lack of tight family networks and the more lax upbringing "draws the Dutch-Moroccans, more often than youngsters from other groups, away from their homes and schools to public spaces, where they learn to live according to the tough and hyper-masculine codes of the culture of the street."
In their survey Buijs et al. found that Dutch-Moroccans have more severe problems with the deviation of gender roles than with homosexual practices in and of themselves. Of the ethnic groups in the survey, Dutch Moroccans were the only ones who preferred masculine lesbians and feminine gay boys over feminine lesbians and masculine gay boys. In addition Dutch-Moroccans indicated an aversion to anal sex in the survey. Buijs et al said "The resentment expressed by the Moroccan participants towards anal sex might be explained by the fact that they find it hard to deal with sexual ideas in western societies, in which men who take the active sexual role are generally considered as homo- or bisexuals as well."

Japanese Consulate-General, Honolulu

As of August 31, 2009, the consul general is Yoshihiko Kamo (加茂 佳彦 "Kamo Yoshihiko").
History.
In 1885 Japan's first consular facility, Consular Office of Japan, opened within the Royal Hawaiian Hotel; as of 2008 the facility now houses the Hawaii State Art Museum. The Japanese government upgraded the facility to a consulate-general on November 17 of that year. On February 14, 1886, Taro Ando, the first consul general, purchased land from Judge M.A. Austin; Ando opened the Japanese consulate on the parcel at the intersection of Nuuanu Street and Kuakini Street; the facility included the residence and the business office.
In 1908 the consulate purchased a building at the intersection of Beretania Street and Fort Street. The three-story stone office building became the consulate-general facility while the original building at the intersection of Nuuanu Street and Kuakini Street became the residence of the consul general. The consulate sold the building in 1913, and as of 2008 the building houses classrooms for Hawaii Pacific University. The consulate bought a property neighboring the Beretania and Fort building from Mrs. Judd. The grounds included a new consul general residence and office space. Around 1920 the two-story wood main building, located in a well-to-do neighborhood, had a gold imperial chrysanthemum crest in the front.
When the United States joined World War II, the government placed the consulate staff under house arrest; the Swedish Vice Consul, Gustaf Olsen, occupied the Japanese consulate and provided services for Japanese residents in March 1942; many of the Japanese served by the Honolulu consulate found their primary income members placed under internment. The normal operation of the consulate was re-established after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty became effective on April 28, 1952. Since then the consulate served business and tourist traffic from its home country.
