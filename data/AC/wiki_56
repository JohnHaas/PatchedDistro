Health in Bhutan

Health in Bhutan is one of the government's highest priorities in its scheme of development and modernization. Health and related issues are overseen by the Ministry of Health, itself represented on the executive Lhengye Zhungtshog (cabinet) by the Minister of Health. As a component of Gross National Happiness, affordable and accessible health care is central to the public policy of Bhutan. The Constitution of Bhutan charges the Royal Government with ensuring a "safe and healthy environment," and with providing "free access to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines."
Health care system.
The Ministry of Health has provided universal health care in Bhutan since the 1970s. Health care infrastructure and services are planned and developed through Five Year Plans (FYP) of the Ministry of Health. The first democratically appointed Health Minister, Lyonpo Zangley Dukpa, is the head of the Ministry of Health. He is a member of the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) party from Khar-Yurung constituency in Pemagatshel District.
Two major pieces of Bhutanese legislation establish a framework for personnel and medicines. The Medical and Health Council Act of 2002 incorporates the Medical and Health Council as a legal entity to regulate medical schools, courses, and professional credentials. The Medicines Act of 2003 establishes the Bhutan Medicines Board and Drugs Technical Advisory Committee. The Act authorizes several subsidiary organizations, including the Bhutanese Drug Regulatory Authority, Drug Testing Laboratory, and teams of Drug Inspectors. These agencies have rulemaking and law enforcement authority on drugs, medicines, and even price controls, but must operate within the laws of Bhutan. Both pieces of legislation contain offenses germane to their subject matter, supplementing the Penal Code.
Health care facilities.
As of 2009, there were 31 hospitals across Bhutan. Most dzongkhags had at least one hospital, with the exception of Gasa. Thimphu had 5 hospitals, while Chukha, Samtse, and Trashigang Districts each had 3. Every dzongkhag had a number of smaller medical facilities, and Thimphu had an indigenous hospital facility available.
These hospitals and smaller facilities were supported by 3,756 Ministry of Health employees in thirteen categories: 176 doctors; 556 nurses; 92 nurse's assistants; 505 "health workers;" 35 Dzongkhag Health Officers and Assistants; 41 "drungtshos" (traditional physicians); 52 "smenpas" (traditional physicians); 12 pharmacists; 79 pharmacy assistants and technicians; 13 lab technologists; 549 other technicians and assistants; and 1,601 administrative and support staff.
Emergency and health hotline.
On May 2, 2011, Bhutan launched its telephonic Health Help Centre (HHC), which had proved successful over the prior two months. The HHC number is 112. The HHC provides two services: Emergency Response and the Healthcare Helpline, both accessible through landed and mobile phones. Emergency responses are served by 61 ambulances in 37 locations with 59 emergency medical technicians around the kingdom, equipped with GPS and GIS technology. The Healthcare Helpline dispenses medical advice.
Funding.
The cost and availability of health care facilities – some of which operate on a 24-hour basis – is a subject of discussion in Bhutan. Issues of affordability and sustainability have called into question Bhutan's proposed funding schemes.
Health issues.
As of 2009, most Bhutanese had access to potable drinking water (83%) and basic sanitation (91%). Widespread health concerns included diarrhea (2,892 per 10,000 people) and pneumonia (1,031) among children under age 5; skin infections (1,322); conjunctivitis (542); hypertension (310); and intestinal worms (170). Less widespread were diabetes (38 per 10,000 people); alcohol-related liver disease (23); and cancer (17). Incidence of malaria and tuberculosis was generally low, at 10 and 15 cases per 10,000 people, respectively.
Influenza, including H1N1 ("swine flu") and H5N1 ("bird flu") strains, are present in Bhutan. As of 2009, there were 6 confirmed cases of H1N1, none of which were fatal. Bird flu, however, has resulted in at least one outbreak in Phuntsholing and remains a "serious concern" of the Ministry of Health.
HIV/AIDS.
In 2011, there were 246 reported cases of HIV, representing just over 0.3% of the population. Through 2010, infection rates remained modest though increasing, totaling 185 reported cases, or 0.1% of the population. The Ministry of Health attributed climbing numbers to promiscuity, drug use, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in neighboring countries.
Maternal and child healthcare.
As of 2008, 90% of the population were covered by the government's immunization regimen. In 2010, the Ministry of Health noted a growing trend of unsafe abortions among Bhutanese women (466 in 2003; 1,057 in 2009), apparently performed in neighboring India, contributing to Bhutan's high maternal mortality rate.
In 2011, Bhutan had a maternal mortality rate of 200 per 100,000. This is compared with 254.9 in 2008 and 1145.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births was 81 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of mortality under 5 years was 43. In Bhutan the number of midwives per 1,000 live births was 15 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women was 1 in 170.
Food safety.
Bhutan regulates public health and safety in regards to food under the Food Act of 2005. The Food Act establishes the National Food Quality and Safety Commission and the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority ("BAFRA"), both of which are overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. While the Ministry of Agriculture is singularly authorized to author regulations under the Food Act, the Minister of Agriculture may delegate authority to ministries responsible for health, trade, and customs. 
The National Food Quality and Safety Commission chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and comprises ten additional members from various relevant government ministries and agencies regulating agriculture, health, commerce, home affairs, legal affairs, and the environment. The Commission formulates the government's food policy, while the BAFRA is responsible for advising and implementing the Commission's policies, including health and safety inspections. BAFRA inspectors have broad authority to search, document, test, and seize food wherever it is transported, stored, prepared, or served; inspectors may also destroy unsafe food when it poses a "clear and present danger for human health or the environment." The Act further establishes health guidelines for businesses that serve or trade in food, including provisions allowing for food testing, and defines government authority in regulating food imports and exports. The Food Act, like other Bhutanese legislation, defines relevant offenses and penalties for failing to conform to proscribed laws and regulations.
Tobacco.
Tobacco sale and consumption is actively discouraged by the government of Bhutan through education, economic, and penal incentives. The Tobacco Control Act bans the sale of tobacco, taxes imports, and places restrictions on quantities individuals may possess. The Act also authorizes the Tobacco Control Board, through the Tobacco Control Office, to provide cessation programs in health facilities and to work with rehabilitation centers in diagnosing and counseling tobacco dependence. The Tobacco Control Office is occupied by the Bhutan Narcotic Control Agency and headed by its executive director. The Office acts as the agent of the Board responsible for coordinating most of the actual implementation of Bhutan's tobacco policy. The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs are all responsible for implementing the laws in the Act and the policies of the Board in specified arenas.
Alcohol.
Bhutan also seeks to discourage alcohol consumption because of its effects on health and happiness. In 2011, the government passed its Alcohol Control Regulation, which imposed up to three times the previous taxes on alcohol. As a result, alcohol sales have dropped and prices have risen. Alcohol consumption among students has risen in the recent past, resulting in several expulsions from Bhutan's elite Sherubtse College.
Ara, the traditional alcohol of Bhutan, is most often home made from rice or maize, either fermented or distilled, and may only be legally produced and consumed privately. Ara production is unregulated in both method and quality, and its sale has been prohibited in Bhutan since a severe crackdown. However, because Ara returns far more profit than other forms of maize, many Bhutanese farmers have pressed for legal reform. The Bhutanese government, meanwhile, is intent on discouraging excessive alcohol consumption, abuse, and associated diseases through taxation and regulation.
Through government efforts to reduce ara production and consumption in Lhuntse District, eastern Bhutan, locals conceded something should be done to curb the distinctly eastern Bhutanese tradition of heavy drinking. The government's strategy is to reduce ara production and consumption gradually until it is eliminated. Alcoholism and ara production have been notable topics of political discussion Bhutan, especially at the local level. Ara, however, is also culturally relevant for its religious and medicinal uses.
Narcotics and treatment.
Bhutan regulates drugs – from pharmaceuticals to narcotics – through the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Substance Abuse Act 2005 ("Narcotics Act"). Its stated legislative purpose is "to ensure that drugs are available exclusively for medical, veterinary and scientific purposes." To this end, the Narcotics Act emphasizes education and treatment as means of combatting illegal drug use. The Act sets forth a fivefold schedule for substances under which Schedule I includes the most restricted substances and Schedule V includes substances "liable for abuse but falling under International control." 
To address drug-related issues, the Narcotics Act creates the Narcotics Control Board and the Narcotics Control Agency. The Narcotics Control Board, made up entirely of government appointees and chaired by "a relevant Cabinet Minister," is responsible for formulating drug policy, while its ancillary Narcotics Control Agency is chiefly responsible for implementing the Board's policy and advising the Board. The Narcotics Act provides enforcement and investigation powers to drug enforcement agencies, including the Royal Bhutan Police and Narcotics Control Agency. Under the Narcotics Act, every person and entity is subject to inspection by competent authorities.
The Narcotics Act mandates drug treatment under the auspices of the Narcotics Control Board and punishes repeat offenders and those who otherwise fail to abide by the terms of treatment. The Board is bound to ensure treatment, rehabilitation, and social reintegration of drug-dependent persons, through interventions, counseling, and detoxification; it is thus required by law to maintain adequate personnel and institutions to provide such services. Records of treatment must be kept confidential. Persons dependent on drugs are subject to compulsory treatment and rehabilitation; those who refuse to submit voluntarily must be confined in criminal custody. The Act authorizes courts to impose treatment as part of sentencing in cases related to drugs, and provides for probation-like "periodic attendance before a panel for review and evaluation of treatment and progress." Successful compliance with such a regimen allows courts to discharge other penalties related to narcotics, such as prison terms and fines. The Narcotics Act further sets forth about a dozen offenses and penalties regarding compliance with the Act, further supplementing the Penal Code.
The Bhutanese media, for its part, have recognized dire societal problems resulting from and associated with substance and alcohol abuse. In response, the Bhutan Observer has encouraged religious and community support for those seeking recovery.
History.
Bhutanese health care development accelerated in the early 1960s with the establishment of the Department of Public Health and the opening of new hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. By the early 1990s, health care was provided through twenty-nine general hospitals (including five leprosy hospitals, three army hospitals, and one mobile hospital), forty-six dispensaries, sixty-seven basic health units, four indigenous-medicine dispensaries, and fifteen malaria eradication centers. The major hospitals were in Thimphu, Geylegphug, and Tashigang. Hospital beds in 1988 totaled 932. There was a severe shortage of health-care personnel with official statistics reporting only 142 physicians and 678 paramedics, about one health-care professional for every 2,000 people, or only one physician for almost 10,000 people.
Training for health-care assistants, nurses' aides, midwives, and primary health-care workers was provided at the Royal Institute of Health Sciences associated with the National Referral Hospital, which was established in 1974. Graduates of the school were the core of the national public health system and helped staff the primary care basic health units throughout the country. Additional health-care workers were recruited from among volunteers in villages to supplement primary health care.
The government has maintained a system of universal health care for all of its citizens. However, the number of Hospitals in Bhutan has been limited, and some diseases, such as cancer cannot be treated in Bhutan. Patients that cannot be treated in Bhutan are taken to hospitals in India, and their treatment is paid for by the government of Bhutan.
The most common diseases in the 1980s were gastrointestinal infections caused by waterborne parasites, mostly attributable to the lack of clean drinking water. The most frequently treated diseases were respiratory tract infections, diarrhea and dysentery, worms, skin infections, malaria, nutritional deficiencies, and conjunctivitis. In 1977 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Bhutan a smallpox-free zone. In 1979 a nationwide immunization program was established. In 1987, with WHO support, the government envisioned plans to immunize all children against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis, and measles by 1990. The government's major medical objective by 2000 was to eliminate waterborne parasites, diarrhea and dysentery, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and goiter. Progress in leprosy eradication was made in the 1970s and 1980s, during which time the number of patients had decreased by more than half, and by 1988 the government was optimistic that the disease could be eliminated by 2000.
It was estimated in 1988 that only 8 persons per 1,000 had access to potable water. Despite improved amenities provided to the people through government economic development programs, Bhutan still faced basic health problems. Factors in the country's high morbidity and death rates included the severe climate, less than hygienic living conditions, for example long-closed-up living quarters during the winter, a situation that contributes to the high incidence of leprosy, and smoke inhalation from inadequately ventilated cooking equipment. Nevertheless, in 1980 it was estimated that 90 percent of Bhutanese received an adequate daily caloric intake.
Although there were no reported cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) through the early 1990s, the Department of Public Health set up a public awareness program in 1987. With the encouragement of the WHO, a "reference laboratory" was established at the Thimphu General Hospital to test for AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a precautionary measure. To further enhance awareness, representatives of the National Institute of Family Health were sent to Bangladesh in 1990 for training in AIDS awareness and treatment measures.

KidZui

KidZui is a web browser designed for children developed by KidZui, Inc. The KidZui browser uses a Zooming User Interface paradigm to make browsing easier for children. Search results appear as scaled down images of websites, videos, and pictures that children click on to zoom in and see content. Children can also browse by category without typing search terms. The KidZui browser does not access the open Internet. KidZui uses teachers and parents to screen content and maintains a database of approved URLs. The KidZui browser can only access URLs in the approved database. KidZui claims to have over 800,000 approved websites, pictures, and videos available. Children build avatars called Zuis to represent themselves online. They earn points for web browsing and use points to gain levels and buy clothes and accessories for their Zuis. Children can share KidZui content with friends online. To add a friend online, children need to know the friends Zui name. There is no online directory of Zui names, so children need to get their friends Zui names offline in order to add them. Friends also need to be approved by parents before they become available in the browser. KidZui also tracks children’s Internet usage and sends reports to their parents on what their children looked at online.
KidZui began development on the product in the summer of 2006. After beta testing, KidZui was offered to the general public on March 19, 2008. The KidZui browser and basic reports for parents are free. KidZui makes revenue through a paid membership program. Membership gives kids additional features like more available clothing and accessories for Zuis, more background and themes, and the ability to get to higher levels with points. Membership gives parents more reporting capabilities to track their children’s online activity, and more ways to customize the KidZui browser for their children.
KidZui is designed from children between the ages of 3 and 12 years old. KidZui has a focus on children’s online safety, but they also try to expand the content available to children online. Rather than solely using filters, KidZui trains and enlists parents and teachers to search out content that is appropriate for children even if it was not designed expressly for children. Websites that have been reviewed and approved by KidZui can carry a KidZui seal of approval that indicate the site’s content is appropriate for children. Websites that carry the seal agree to abide by KidZui’s content guidelines. Kid Zui is also a prize on the 3rd round on the "Nickelodeon" game show "BrainSurge".
History and development.
KidZui was started in 2006 when Vidar Vignisson was frustrated because he couldn’t find a safe and easy way for his own children to use the Internet. Vignisson joined with Cliff Boro and Thomas Broadhead to found KidZui. Vignisson was frustrated by the approach of existing technologies that were available at the time; online filters helped keep out dangerous content, but could only be used in conjunction with adult browsers, which are hard for children to use. Existing children’s browsers were easier to use, but had access to very small amounts of content. Vignisson, Boro, and Broadhead set out to build an easy-to-use children’s browser with access to a large and diverse set of online content and activities.
KidZui is a venture backed startup. Investors include Maveron, Emergence Capital, and First Round Capital.
Prior to founding KidZui, Vignisson, Boro, and Broadhead had been partners on other Internet startups including Infogate, which they sold to AOL Time Warner in March 2003. 
KidZui began beta testing with children in 2006. KidZui was released to the general public on March 19, 2008 to generally favorable reviews. The original release of KidZui required a paid subscription. KidZui experienced some early criticism for not offering a free version of the product. The company released a free version on June 4, 2008. The free version of the product offers the same features as the original subscription-based product. KidZui introduced a membership program that same month. The membership program unlocks additional features in the kids’ browser and comes with more advanced reporting features for parents.
Business model.
The basic version of KidZui with access to all content is free. Revenue comes exclusively from paid memberships. It is not clear what percentage of families use the free version versus paying for membership. KidZui includes advertisements to children in their browser, mostly based on sponsored partnerships with UnderArmour, Mattel, and Comcast.
Content guidelines.
KidZui uses filters to pre-screen content. After screening by filters, content is reviewed by paid teachers and parents using a set of content guidelines.
In 2007, KidZui hired Deanne Kells, a former Vice President and Editor in Chief from Leapfrog, to establish the content guidelines and a process for reviewing and approving content. Kells used childhood developmental principles to form a content screening protocol where content is first determined to be appropriate for children, and then classified by age for developmental level and reading ability.
Browser features.
KidZui uses a Zooming User Interface paradigm where search results are displayed visually at smaller scale. Children click on images to enlarge them. The visual interface makes it easier for children to browse without advanced reading skills. KidZui also has category browsing that allows children to explore the Internet using categories based on popularity or similarity. KidZui has an auto search complete feature that returns results after only typing one or two letters. KidZui offers to complete search terms using the most popular searches by other children and it shows search results as children type.

Wolbórz

Wolbórz is a town in Piotrków County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wolbórz. It lies along National road 8, approximately north-east of Piotrków Trybunalski and south-east of the regional capital Łódź.
The town has a population of 2,381. It was granted town charter in 1273, and lost it in 1870, when Russian authorities punished its residents for their support of the January Uprising. Wolbórz remained a until 1 January 2011. The name of the town was not established until the 1920s. Before, it was known as Woybor, Voibor, Woibor, Wojbor, Olborz and Woyborz. 
According to archaeologists, first human settlements appeared in today Wolborz in c. 4000 BC. In early times of the Kingdom of Poland, Wolborz emerged as a center of local administrative unit called opole, which was later turned into a castellany. In the 1120s, Wolborz became one of seats of Bishops of Kujawy. By that time, it already was an important trade center, which was confirmed in 1273, when Wolborz was granted Sroda Slaska town charter, by Duke Leszek II the Black. 
In 1357, the charter of Wolborz was modeled after more modern Magdeburg rights, and the town was so important, that it had a branch of the Cracow Academy, with a rector, six professors and permission to grant academic titles. On September 9, 1409, King Wladyslaw Jagiello issued here an appeal to Polish clergy and nobility, urging them to fight the Teutonic Knights. Also, knights from Lesser Poland, Podolia and Red Ruthenia concentrated here before the Battle of Grunwald. King Jagiello visited Wolborz as many as 15 times, other Polish rulers also came to the town, especially when Crown Tribunal was held in nearby Piotrkow Trybunalski.
In the 15th and 16th centuries Wolborz prospered. The town was a large trade and artisan center, with a number of workshops, breweries and mills. In 1521, Wolborz had the population of 3000, with five churches, three hospitals, 400 houses, a town hall, bishop’s castle with Italian garden, and 259 artisans. In 1536 and 1548, the town was burned in fires. In 1544, St. Nicholas church was turned into a collegiate, and in 1553, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski was named the local wojt (Modrzewski was born here in 1503).
The period of prosperity ended in the 17th century. In 1618, Wolborz burned in a fire; in 1655, the town was ransacked by Swedish soldiers; and in 1671, the town burned again. After these calamities, Wolborz never recovered. 
Following the Partitions of Poland and the Congress of Vienna, Wolborz since 1815 belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1870, following the January Uprising, it lost its town charter. In 1892, its population was 3000, including 700 Jews.
Among main sights are: complex of park and palace of Bishops of Kujawy, St. Nicholas collegiate, 19th-century synagogue, cemeteries, 19th-century tenement houses, and remains of bishophoric castle (14th century).

"Surviving the Times" is a 2007 hip hop song by Nas from his "Greatest Hits" album. The song's lyrics focus on Nas career before and just after Illmatic. The song makes reference to Nas' signing with Columbia Records, being turned down by Russell Simmons for Def Jam and him meeting Large Professor and Kool G Rap for the first time. The song also samples Nipsey Russell's song "What Would I Do If I Could Feel" from the musical The Wiz in the intro and chorus. A different version of this song appeared on Nas and DJ Green Lantern's "Nigger Tape". It contains the same lyrics but is produced by Cool & Dre.

Alphons Bellesheim

Christian Peter "Alphons" Maria Joseph Bellesheim (December 16, 1839 Monschau, Germany - February 5, 1912 Aachen, Germany) was a church historian. He also reviewed and collected books.
Family.
Alphons was the son of Heinrich "Wilhelm" Ludwig Joseph Bellesheim (December 26, 1801 Essen, Germany - 1867 Aachen, Germany) and Maria Anna "Margaretha" Dumesnil (March 15, 1797 Aachen, Germany - 1866 Aachen, Germany). His parents were married June 27, 1838 in Monschau, Germany. Alphons' paternal grandparents were Carl Anton Bellesheim and Maria Josepha Helena Hennekes. His maternal grandparents were Carl Dumesnil and Christina Windhagen.
Alphons had one known brother, Hugo Franz Julius Bellesheim. Hugo was born February 03, 1841 in Monschau and married to Hulda Caecilia Kelsch October 4, 1866 in Aachen. A Hugo Bellesheim, aged 27 years, arrived at the Port of New York August 30, 1867 having departed from Hamburg, Germany on the ship "Germanic". It is unknown, but assumed that the two are the same.
Further research is being done into the family of Alphons Bellesheim. Please see the external link below for contact to the researcher.
Life.
The son of the pharmacist s Wilhelm Bellesheim (1801-1867) studied Roman Catholic theology at the universities of Bonn and Tübingen and attended thereafter the theological college of Cologne. After his ordination of priest s in the year 1862 he was assumed as chaplain at the Santa Maria dell'Anima, where he was active 1862 and where he obtained his doctorate in the last month of his time in Rome.
After his return to Germany he became vicar at the Cologne Cathedral and also secretary of the general vicariate. As a result of the Kulturkampf in the 1870th he had to quit his tasks. Subsequently in the following more than 25 years he was active in the scientific-theological research and published a lot of publications, including 10 books, 4 brochures, 148 essays and 77 inscriptions in dictionaries. One of his focus areas was the history of Christianity of the British Isles.
Finally in 1902 Bellesheim was appointed as provost at the Aachen Cathedral and he practised this ministry until his dead in 1912 and was in the meantime honoured with the title as a Protonotary apostolic.

Mohave Union High School Gymnasium

The Mohave Union High School Gymnasium is the original gymnasium of Mohave County Union High School, now the site of Lee Williams High School, at 301 First Street in Kingman, Arizona. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its lamella roof, which gives the building "exceptional merit".
History.
The gym was built in 1936, in the Moderne design, by the Works Progress Administration, and is one of three Moderne buildings in Kingman. P. W. Womack was the contractor from Phoenix and J. Harve Kester was the WPA inspector. It cost $50,000 to build.
In 1986, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1994, after the high school moved onto a new campus, the gym became the home of the Boys and Girls Club of Kingman and was also used by the new middle school using the high school site, White Cliffs Middle School.
In 2012, the gymnasium regained a high school when the new Lee Williams High School opened. A new auxiliary gymnasium has since been built alongside the old one.
Architecture.
The gymnasium measures 200x90 feet. It is made of concrete brick with a concrete foundation and stucco walls. Later additions to the site included replaced entry windows and doors and an addition to the rear.
There are two architectural oddities about the gymnasium. It uses buttresses, the only structure in Kingman to do so, and also has Kingman's only lamella roof, which is described as "an unusual method of construction in Arizona". Only one other gymnasium in the state used a lamella roof, the gymnasium at Phoenix Union High School, built circa 1940 and demolished in the late 1980s.
The building additionally has Art Deco-style detailing. It is one of three Moderne style buildings in Kingman.

Medieval Serbian army

The medieval Serbian army was well known for its strength and was among the top Balkan armies before the Ottoman expansion.
Prior to the 14th century the army consisted of Byzantine-style noble cavalry ("Vlastela") armed with bows and lances (replaced with crossbows in the 14th century) and infantry armed with spears, javelins and bows. With the economic growth from mining, mercenary knights from other countries were recruited to finalize and increase the effectiveness of the army. The army fought predominantly from the Balkan mountains.
History.
Early.
Between 839 and 842 the Bulgarian Khan Presian invaded Serbian territory (Bulgarian–Serbian Wars) although prior to this both peoples lived peacefully as neighbours and shared a common frontier. The cause for that decision was the growing Byzantine influence over the Serbs which was against the interests of Bulgaria. The invasion led to a 3-year war but Presian was unable to make territorial gains. He was heavily defeated and lost many of his men, he was driven out by Vlastimir.
In the mid 850s the Bulgarians under Boris I made another unsuccessful attempt to subdue the Serbs. In the beginning of the 10th century Simeon I launched several campaigns against the Serbs who were acting as Byzantine allies and by 925 he managed to conquer Serbia completely but the Bulgarian rule was short-lived. Samuel of Bulgaria subjected the Serbs for a second time in 1009 or 1010 after he defeated their ruler Jovan Vladimir.
12th century.
The writings of John Kinnamos and other contemporary Byzantine sources (Anna Komnene, Niketas Choniates, Eustathios of Thessalonica, Michael of Thessalonica) of the twelfth century, gives substantial data concerning Serbian armament and tactics.
14th century.
Serbia defeated the Bulgarian Empire in the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330. Serbia became a military superpower during the middle part of the 14th century under the dynamic Stephen Uroš IV Dušan (1331–55), who created the Serbian Empire. It included Macedonia, Albania, Epirus and Thessaly, reaching from the Drina and Danube rivers as far south and east as the Gulf of Patras and the Rhodope Mountains by 1350. A large part of this expansion was at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. Dušan set his sights on the Byzantine capital of Constantinople itself, dividing his lands into 'Serbia' and 'Romania'. Dušan was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of Serbs and Romans in 1345. He modeled his court on that of Constantinople, calling his officials by Byzantine titles such as caesar, despot, sebastokrator and logotet (logothete). However, following his death, the Serbian Empire gradually disintegrated under his successor Stephen Uroš V (1355–71). One Byzantine chronicler noted with evident satisfaction that the Serbian nobility were soon divided into '10,000 factions', while John VI Kantakouzenos wrote that Dušan’s empire fell 'into a thousand pieces'.
After 1363, Vukašin Mrnjavčević became the most powerful noble in the Serbian Empire; he controlled lands in the south of the empire, primarily in Macedonia. He was defeated and killed by the Ottoman Turks in 1371 in the Battle of Marica. In 1373, Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović emerged as the most powerful Serbian lord. He created the largest state on the territory of the disintegrated Serbian Empire; his state is known in historiography as Moravian Serbia. Its government and army were better organized than those of the domains of the other Serbian lords. In 1386, Prince Lazar rebuffed the Ottoman Sultan Murad I at Pločnik, a site southwest of the city of Niš.
An Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad, estimated at between 27000 to 30000 men, arrived in June of 1389 on the Kosovo Field near Priština. The Ottomans were met by the forces commanded by Prince Lazar, estimated at between 12000 to 20000 men, which consisted of the prince's own troops, Vuk Branković's troops, and a contingent sent by the Bosnian King Tvrtko Kotromanić. In the Battle of Kosovo, both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives. The battle was tactically inconclusive, but the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs, who had brought to Kosovo almost all of their fighting strength. Lazar was succeeded by his eldest son Stefan Lazarević, who became an Ottoman vassal in the summer of 1390. Vuk Branković accepted Ottoman suzerainty in 1392. Stefan Lazarević participated on the Ottoman side in the Battle of Rovine in 1395, the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, and the Battle of Ankara in 1402.
15th century.
Stefan Lazarević was granted the title of Despot by the Byzantine Emperor, and he ceased to be an Ottoman vassal in 1402. He introduced modern western style knight warfare and knight tournaments. And there were fireweapons already in use, especially in armored cavalry. 
He ruled Serbia as Despot from 1402 to 1427. He was fighting against the Ottomans, and later he supported Mehmet I rise to power in the Battle of Çamurlu.
After him the Branković dynasty came to power. They continued developing modern military battle tactics. Despot Đurađ Branković who ruled Serbia from 1427 to 1456, constructed the Smederevo Fortress, which was the largest medieval lowland type of fortress in Europe. This fortress had 24 towers and a citadel with 50m tall towers. Most of the fortress remains intact until nowadays.
Organization.
The Serbian army was feudal in nature, though its system of military landholding was inherited from the Byzantine pronoia rather than the Western European fief. The pronoia itself - hereditary by some accounts, non-hereditary by others - is only first recorded in Serbia under that name in 1299 (the Serbs spelt it pronija, or pronya, and called its holder a promjar), but even from as early as Stefan Nemanja reign (1186–96) every able-bodied man possessing a bashtina (a grant of hereditary freehold land, the holder being called a bashtinik or voynici) had been obliged to attend the army whenever required, only monastic tenants being exempted in exchange for performing part-time garrison duties in local fortresses and fortified monasteries. The building and maintenance (gradozadanje) of such fortresses, and equally the maintenance of their permanent garrisons (gradobljudenlje) was an additional aspect of the feudal responsibilities of the population of each Župa (district), who were also responsible for guarding their own frontier. The holders of both bashtinas and pronijas constituted the nobility (though many of the former were only upper-class peasants), and these were the principal native element of every Serbian army, serving as heavy cavalry (the proniiars) and infantry (the voynici), In fact most armies included only the nobility (the vlastelini, or 'holders of power') and their retinues, maintained at their own expense, but in times of emergency the arriere-ban, called the Zamanitchka Voyska ('All Together'), would be summoned. As elsewhere, this comprised all the nobility and every able-bodied freeman.
In border regions all land-grants appear to have been called krayina and their holders vlastele krayishnik ('border lords'), whose duty it was to guard the frontier. Dušan's Code of 1349 (the Zakonik, extended and completed in 1354) actually states that any damage inflicted by an invading army had to be compensated for by the border-lord through whose lands the enemy had entered, another article stating that similar pillaging committed by brigands had to be repaid seven-fold. The Byzantine chronicler Gregoras, as ambassador for Andronikos III to Emperor Dusan, encountered some krayishnici (men of a border- lord) on crossing the frontier. He wrote: 'When we passed the Struma River ... and came into thick woods, we were suddenly surrounded by men clad in black woolen garments, who darted forth from behind trees and rocks like devils out of the earth. They wore no heavy armor, being armed only with spears, battle-axes, and bows and arrows.
From the 11th century on the commander-in-chief of the army was the king (kral), a veliki vojevoda or 'high military chief, equivalent to the Byzantine Grand Domestic, being appointed in his absence. However, since any call to arms had to be approved by the Sabor (the National Assembly) the king actually had limited military power, in effect being no more than a glorified Grand Župan, or elected tribal leader. Although Dušan stripped the Sabor of much of its power, the crown's dependence on a permanent nucleus of mercenaries that was not subject to the assembly's whims had by then already evolved, constituting the core of all Serbian armies throughout this period. Under Stephen Uroš II Milutin (1282-1321) these mercenaries included such diverse elements as Cumans; Anatolian Turks (some 1,500 were employed in 1311 from amongst those who had been allied to the Catalans in Thrace and Macedonia); Tartars from South Russia; and Christian Ossetians (Jasi in Serbian and Russian sources) from the Caucasus. However, it was Western European style heavy cavalry which soon came to predominate. As early as 1304 a certain Francisco de Salomone is mentioned in an inscription in Trevise as having distinguished himself in the service of 'Orosius, rex Rascie' (i. e. Uroš, king of Serbia). Mercenaries in Stephen Uroš III's army that defeated the Bulgarians at Battle of Velbazhd in 1330 were 1,500 Aragonese, Spaniards, and Germans, and it was the latter who seem to have predominated during Dušan reign. The papal legate to his court reported seeing 300 German mercenaries there under the knight Palman Bracht, who held the rank of capitaneus. In addition we know that the Serbian troops supplied to the Byzantine Emperor, John VI Kantakouzenos, in 1342-43 were Germans, and that the troops garrisoning Beroia in Macedonia in 1341-50 were German mercenaries too. Even at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 it is significant that many of Lazar men were German and Hungarian mercenaries according to a Florentine account, while a mid-15th century Ottoman source reports that his army included Wallachians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Albanians, Bulgarians and Franks, doubtless chiefly mercenaries. Another says he employed many mercenaries from among the Serbians themselves as well as the Hungarians, Bosnians and Albanians. Serbian documents indicate that as well as Germans the other predominant European mercenary elements comprised Spaniards (possibly as many as 1,300-strong at one point) plus Hungarians, Frenchmen, Italians and Swiss. One prominent name to appear in their ranks was that of Philippe de Mézières, in later life Chancellor of Cyprus and one of the last protagonists of the Crusade. Inevitably, in the 15th century Ottoman auxiliaries were also used, for example by Vuk Lazarević against Stephen, 1409-13. In addition to the king or despot, the larger cities also employed some mercenaries of their own to back up their militia.
When the Ottoman hold on Serbia weakened after the Battle of Ankara, Stefan Lazarević took advantage of the situation to establish his independence from the Turks. Recognizing the king of Hungary as his overlord he built up a small regular army, on the basis of a newly imposed levy known as the vojstatik, which was stationed in the country's 11 major fortresses as well as several of its small walled towns. This army included many Hungarians and was well-equipped with cannon and handguns; for example, there were 2 cannons in the fort guarding the large silver mine at Srebrnica in 1425, and in Belgrade, Lazarević capital, there was a large bombard (called Humka, meaning 'Knoll') captured from the Bosnians the same year. In 1455 there were as many as 3 large cannon, 5 other guns and 55 handguns in the fort guarding the great silver mine at Novo Brdo.
Field-armies.
Serbian armies were composed of lance-armed light and heavy cavalry, plus infantry (armed with spears, axes, and above all bows and, later, crossbows) and a baggage-train (komora) manned by shepherds and cattlemen referred to as Vlachs, probably indicating that they were Pindus Vlachs and Albanians, and perhaps Wallachians too. Most of their armies tended to be small because of the difficulties involved in supplying them in the field, and on the whole they could probably raise only about 12,000 men in the late-Lath century, the army at Serbian Kosovo probably numbering at most 20-25,000 men even including allied contingents. The majority were heavy cavalry. Emperor Dusan was said to have raised around 80,000 men for the Invasion of Bosnia in 1350 although the largest Serbian army on record in this period was that raised by Dušan in 1355 for his proposed attack on Constantinople, which numbered 85,000 men according to later Ragusan chronicles. Modern authorities, however, give this figure little credence.
After the Battle of Maritca in 1371, Ottoman suzerainty was accepted by the Serbian rulers in Macedonia: King Marko (Vukašin Mrnjavčević's son), Konstantin Dragaš, and Radoslav Hlapen. By 1388, Djuradj Stracimirović Balšić, the lord of Zeta, also became an Ottoman vassal. Stefan Lazarević and Vuk Branković accepted Ottoman suzerainty in 1390 and 1392, respectively. Stefan Lazarević ceased to be an Ottoman vassal and ally in 1402, when he became a despot and created the Serbian Despotate. According to most authorities it was from 1390 on that the despot of Serbia was obliged to pay an annual tribute of 1,000 lbs of gold and to provide the sultan with a contingent of 1,000 cavalry when called upon. Finlay and Creasy, however, maintained that it was 'the treaty of 1376' that first imposed this obligation, while Gibbons says 1386; certainly there were Serbs as well as Bulgarians and Byzantines in the Ottoman army that fought against the Karamanli Turks in Anatolia in 1387 (the Serbs being promised booty in return for their services). Finlay says in one of his books that Sultan Beyazid actually demanded the service of the same number of Serbians as the Byzantines had called for after Manuel's subjugation of Serbia in 1150, i.e. 2,000 to armies serving in Europe and 500 to armies serving in Asia; but in another book he says that the figure was only 'subsequently increased to 2,000 men' when Beyazid was gathering his forces to confront Tamerlane in 1402. Bertrandon de la Brocquière, in his 'Travels' of 1432-33, recorded of the despot of Serbia that 'every time the sultan sends him his orders, he is obliged to furnish him with 800 or 1,000 horse, under the command of his second son.' Elsewhere he adds how he had heard that 'in the most recent army to the sultan from Greece, there were 3,000 Serbian horse, which the despot of the province had sent under the command of one of his sons. It was with great regret that these people came to serve him, but they dared not refuse.' (This army was probably that which campaigned against Albania in 1430-31, in which Serbs are known to have been present.) Konstantin Mihailović reports that when the treaty with Serbia was renewed under Mehmed II the obligatory tribute was set at 1,500 lbs of gold and a contingent of 1,500 cavalry.
Amongst the battles in which Serbs fought for their Ottoman masters were Battle of Rovine, against the Wallachians and Bulgarians, in 1395; Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, where apparently their contingent comprised 5,000 heavy cavalry; and Battle of Ankara in 1402, where Doukas says there were 5,000 'encased in black armor' and Chalkokondyles that there were an unlikely 10,000 (though the Ottoman chronicler al-Anwari says that there were 10,000 Serbs and Wallachians altogether). George Branković even supplied an unwilling contingent (of 1,500 horses under the voivode Jaksa Brezicic according to Mihailović) for the final siege of Constantinople in 1453, plus some silver-miners from Novo Brdo whom Sultan Mehmed employed as sappers. In 1473 on Aug. 11 the army that marched against Uzun Hasan which resulted in an Ottoman victory in The battle of Otlukbeli included 'many Christians - Greeks, Albanians and Serbians - in their number.'
Artillery.
Serbia had adopted gunpowder artillery from Dubrovnik (Ragusa), where a centre for the manufacture of wrought-iron cannon existed by 1363. (The first gun foundry in the Balkans, casting bronze cannons, was also established at Dubrovnik, in 1410.) Neighboring Bosnia had cannon by 1380, and they were in use in Serbia by 1382-86 at the very latest, probably served and certainly made by Ragusan engineers. In fact Mavro Orbin claims that Despot Lazar used guns against Nikola Altomanović even as early as 1373. Guns were apparently employed in the field by the Serbians as early as 1389 at the Battle of Kosovo, being clearly mentioned in one later Ottoman chronicle (Mehmed Neşrî) and alluded to in a contemporary Serbian source which says that 'fiery explosions thundered, the earth roared greatly, and the air echoed and blew around like dark smoke'; we know too that King Tvrtko of Bosnia (1353–91) brought one gun, a gift of the Italians, with him to the battle. The Serbian contingent in the Ottoman army defeated at Ankara in 1402 also had artillery, but as at Kosovo it failed to affect the outcome, probably for the same reasons on both occasions - i.e. the guns were too small to be effective in order that they might be maneuverable on the battlefield. In siege work trebuchets and ballistae remained in service alongside gunpowder artillery for a long time.
Navy.
In addition to her land forces, Serbia occasionally also had a very small fleet, provided by the communes of Dulcigno (modern Ulcinj), Budua (Budva) and Cattaro (Kotor), sometimes by Ragusa (in exchange for a year's tax-exemption), and briefly by Venice (which provided 4 new galleys, the galee domini imperatoris, in 1350, the subsequent fate of which is unknown). King Tvrtko of Bosnia too later constructed his own small fleet, with a Venetian as its admiral, and was similarly given a galley by Venice, this time fitted with a cannon.
Cavalry.
Gusars, Hussars.
Gusar light cavalry forces were part of the medieval Serbian military. Armed with spears and pentagonal wood shields padded with metal, they supported the noble knights as their second line on the battlefield. In the middle of each wooden shield, there was a round metal knob that held the shield together.
Gusar light cavalries were a traditional Serbian force, which meant that they usually were not hired as mercenaries from Spain or Germany. Their style of fighting was similar to the noble knights. They used the eastern style of fighting: they would charge into the enemy ferociously, and try to cause mass havoc. As for their role with the foot soldiers, they were more like support cavalry. When the foot soldiers were losing the battle, the Gusars would charge into the enemy's flank, hoping to cause them to rout. They would repeat this charge from different angles while the infantry kept the enemy from chasing the Gusars.
Later on, after the fall of the Serbian Empire, these troops were used as "Krajišniks" meaning frontiersman in the Habsburg Monarchy (today Croatia, Slavonia, Vojvodina) which southern parts became the military frontier, defending and liberating as they believed Christendom from the Ottoman invasion. Their military tactics of engaging combat, as well as pillaging and looting of Ottoman ruled territories, were similar to the ones of the Ukrainian Cossacks.
According to Webster's the word "hussar" stems from the Hungarian "huszár," which in turn originates from the Serbian "хусар" ("Husar", or "гусар", "Gusar") meaning pirate, from the Medieval Latin "cursarius" (cf. the English word "corsair"). A variant of this theory is offered by Byzantinist scholars, who argue the term originated in Roman military practice, and the "cursarii" (singular "cursarius"). Through Byzantine Army operations in the Balkans in the 10th and 11th centuries when Chosarioi/"Chonsarioi" were recruited with especially Serbs, the word was subsequently reintroduced to Western European military practice after its original usage had been lost with the collapse of Rome in the west.
The hussars reportedly originated in bands of mostly Serbian warriors crossing into Kingdom of Hungary after the Ottoman invasion of medieval Serbian state at the end of the 14th century. The Governor of Hungary, Hunyadi János – John Hunyadi, created mounted units inspired by his enemy the Ottoman Turks. His son, Hunyadi Mátyás Matthias Corvinus, later king of Hungary, is unanimously accepted as the creator of these troops. Initially they fought in small bands, but were reorganised into larger, trained, formations during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. Initially the first units of Polish hussars in the Kingdom of Poland were formed in 1500, which consisted of Serbian mercenaries.

Spycimierz is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Uniejów, within Poddębice County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately south-west of Uniejów, west of Poddębice, and west of the regional capital Łódź.
The village has a population of 380. It is famous for a beautiful celebration of the Corpus Domini feast when the inhabitants create flower carpets along the 2 km long route of the procession.
The name of the village comes from a Slavic given name Spycimir, also spelled Spycimierz. The village was first mentioned as Spicimir in the chronicle of Gallus Anonymus, written in 1112–1116. Gallus wrote that it was attacked in a Pomeranian raid in 1108. 
In the Middle Ages, a fortified Slavic gord existed in the location of the present village. Spycimierz was located at the junction of two important trails, from Pomerania to Rus, and from Leczyca to Kalisz. The gord was ring-shaped, with wood and earth fortification, topped by a wooden palisade. Here, Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty imprisoned Archbishop Martin in ca. 1106. Spycimierz was regarded as a ducal property, mentioned in 1136 in a bull of Pope Innocent II.
The gord was the seat of a castellan, and remained one until early 14th century. The Spicymierz Castellany belonged to the Duchy of Sieradz, and was located along right bank of the Warta river. Some time before 1331, in unknown circumstances, the gord became private property of a local nobleman, Pawel Ogonczyk. 
Spycimierz was burned to the ground in 1331, when a unit of Teutonic Knights crossed the Warta, and set the gord on fire. A wooden castle was built in the location of the former gord, but Spycimierz lost its importance to the adjacent town of Uniejow. The gord is still visible. It lies on a meadow, near the Warta river Oxbow lake.

Altitude compensating nozzle

An altitude compensating nozzle is a class of rocket engine nozzles that are designed to operate efficiently across a wide range of altitudes.
Conventional designs.
The basic concept of any engine bell is to efficiently direct the flow of exhaust gases from the rocket engine into one direction. The exhaust, a high-temperature mix of gases, has an effectively random momentum distribution, and if it is allowed to escape in that form, only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction to contribute to forward thrust.
An engine bell works by confining the sideways flow of the gases, creating a local area of increased pressure with a region of lower pressure "below it". This causes the gases to preferentially flow in the direction of decreasing pressure. By careful design the engine bell grows wider so that the pressure decreases in such a way that by the time the exhaust flow has reached the exit of the bell, it is traveling almost completely rearward, maximizing thrust.
The problem with the conventional approach is that the outside air pressure also contributes to confining the flow of the exhaust gases. At any one altitude, and thus ambient air pressure, the bell can be designed to be nearly "perfect," but that same bell will not be perfect at other pressures, or altitudes. Thus, as a rocket climbs through the atmosphere its efficiency, and thus thrust, changes fairly dramatically, often as much as 30%.

Kimelman Report

The Kimelman Report had a substantial and lasting impact on aboriginal child protection in Canada that was part of a fundamental shift in international child protection paradigms for aboriginal peoples.
In the early 1980s, following the notorious Sixties Scoop, in which many children were removed from aboriginal families for adoption by non-aboriginal parents, the Manitoba government established a Review Committee on Indian and Métis Adoptions and Placements. Judge Edwin C. Kimelman chaired the Committee. In 1984, "After reviewing the file of every Native child who had been adopted by an out-of-province family in 1981, Judge Kimelman stated: 'having now completed the review of the files... the Chairman now states unequivocally that cultural genocide has been taking place in a systematic, routine manner'."
In 1985, the Review Committee issued a final report, entitled "No Quiet Place" and known in child welfare circles as the Kimelman Report, that had profound impact on aboriginal child protection in Canada and perhaps elsewhere.

Junkers K 47

The Junkers K 47 was a fighter developed in Sweden by the Swedish subsidiary of the German firm Junkers during the late 1920s, a civil development of which was designated the A 48.
Design and development.
Designed to meet a requirement of the Turkish government for a new fighter, the K 47 was a strut-braced, low-wing monoplane of conventional design. Two open cockpits accommodated the pilot and tail-gunner, and the empennage was designed with twin vertical surfaces to maximise the rearward field of fire. The main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage shared part of the truss structure that braced the wings. The design was originally undertaken by Karl Plauth, but completed after his death by Hermann Pohlmann. The aircraft had to be built at first in Sweden, because it was patently a military-type aircraft and therefore banned in Germany according to the terms of the Versailles Treaty.
Operational history.
By the time the K 47 prototype was complete, Turkey had already lost interest in the type, but with the Soviet Union indicating interest, work continued. Eventually, however, the Soviet government only purchased two or three examples, and the only operational use of the type was China, which bought ten or twelve aircraft, naming the type the "Tien Chu". Demonstrations were also carried out in Romania, Portugal, and Latvia without any resulting orders, although one aircraft may have been purchased by Japan. Three aircraft were used by the "Reichswehr" clandestine training facility at Lipetsk and a small number of the unarmed civil version were purchased by the DVS.
K 47s were also used in trials to investigate dive bombing, experiments that would be formative of Pohlmann's thinking in designing the Ju 87. Indeed, the second Ju 87 prototype was fitted with a K 47 tail.

Sigismund I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau

Sigismund I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (d. Coswig, 19 January 1405), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst until 1396, when he became the first ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau.
He was the eldest son of John II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of John I, Count of Henneberg-Schleusingen.
Life.
In 1382, after the death of his father, Sigismund inherited the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst jointly with his brothers Albert IV and Waldemar III. After the death of Waldemar in 1391, Sigismund and Albert became the sole co-rulers.
Five years later, in 1396, both brothers decided to settle upon a formal division of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. Sigismund assumed the title "Lord of Zerbst," but established the town of Dessau as his main residence and capital of his newly created principality of Anhalt-Dessau.
Marriage and issue.
In 1386, Sigismund married Judith (d. aft. 1411), daughter of Gebhard XI, Count of Querfurt. They had eleven children:

The Secret Life of Zoey

The Secret Life of Zoey is a 2002 Lifetime TV drama starring Mia Farrow, Julia Whelan, and Cliff De Young. The movie follows the struggles of divorced parents, played by Farrow and De Young, as they attempt to save their seemingly perfect daughter (Whelan) from a secret addiction to prescription drugs.
Plot.
Following the divorce of her parents, Marcia and Larry Carter (Farrow and De Young), sixteen year old Zoey Carter (Whelan) begins to experiment with drugs. From her parents' perspective, Zoey appears to be well-adjusted and mature. She, however, obtains drugs from local dealers and uses this is as a coping mechanism. At first, her parents appear to be clueless as to the fact that Zoey has a problem with drugs, and she is able to deceive her parents. For example, when her parents find her passed out in the backseat of her car, she defends herself by claiming that she just crawled into the backseat and fell asleep. Her secret behavior goes unnoticed at first, as her good grades and volunteer work make her appear to be a model teenager. However, Zoey escalates to stealing cash in order to buy pills and marijuana. Her drug dealer, older student Ron Morris (Michael Coristine) gives her drugs to increase her addiction and encourages her to shoplift to buy more.
Zoey's addiction is discovered when her mother finds a stash of pills in her backpack after a drug-induced fainting episode. Zoey is sent to drug rehab. Her first stint there gives only the appearance of success, as Zoey continues her secret behavior. After an overdose, Zoey returns to rehab, where her counselor Mike Harper (Andrew McCarthy) works with her parents to help Zoey break free of her addiction.
Reception.
Originally titled "On The Edge", "The Secret Life of Zoey" was released in the United States on August 19, 2002 to mixed reviews. The script was viewed alternately as a fresh take on a clichéd premise, or another entrant in the mediocre teen anti-drug genre. The two female leads, Farrow and Whelan, were cited as the movie's bright spots. Whelan in particular was noted for the emotional depth and naturalness of her performance; the Orlando Sentinel's Hal Boedeker went so far as to describe her as "The sole reason to watch 'The Secret Life of Zoey'". Mia Farrow's reviews were not so universally positive, but she was nominated for Best Performance in a TV movie or Miniseries at the 2003 PRISM Awards, which honor outstandingly realistic depictions of drug use, drug addiction and other dependence in film and television.

Zadzim

Zadzim is a village in Poddębice County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Zadzim. It lies approximately south-west of Poddębice and west of the regional capital Łódź.
History.
The first written mention of Zadzim comes from 1386. It was the home of Zadzimski family, who erected a church in the village somewhere around the early 15th century. Later, the settlement belonged also to Zaleski family from Otok, and the families of Radomicki, Sapieha, and Lubomirski. In the 16th century it was divided in three smaller and separate settlements called Wola Zaleska, Wola Sypińska and Wola Zadzimska (currently Wola Flaszczyna). In the 18th century, the estates were purchased by Dąmbski family from Lubraniec. Count Józef Kazimierz from Lubraniec was a voivode of Sieradz in 1756–1766. For the last time before the dissolution of the Polish state, the village was bought by the Jarociński family. In the centre of Zadzim stands the late Renaissance Church of St Margaret (pw. św. Małgorzaty) built of brick in 1640–1642 in place of the original wooden church from 1416. The founder and main benefactor of the present structure was Count Aleksander Zaleski from Otok, Dołęga coat of arms. 
Notable people.
Zadzim is a birthplace of the world-renown Jewish painter Leopold Pilichowski (1869–1934), student of Jan Matejko, who was active during the final years of the foreign partitions of Poland.

Brian O'Connell (born 1982) is an Irish sportsman. He plays hurling with his local club Wolfe Tones na Sionna and represented the Clare senior hurling team from 2003 to 2010. O'Connell captained this team for three years including a Munster final appearance against Tipperary in 2008. O'Connell is better known as 'BOC'. He was a valuable part of the Wolfe Tones team which defeated Newmarket on Fergus to claim its second senior county hurling title in 2006.
He was named "Hurler of the Month" for June 2008 and was shortlisted for the hurling All-Stars at the end of the 2008 season.
Brian has now emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, citing a lack of work in Ireland and become one of the 1st high profile hurlers to leave due to work commitments. Brian also struggled with a number of back and hand injuries during 2010 which hampered his participation during the campaign. Brian has recently started to train with his personal trainer Derek Byrne to improve his core stability and alleviate ongoing back pain. He is also working very closely with Derek on improving his acceleration and speed which he feels will add a new dynamic to his all-round game.

Msasani is an administrative ward in the Kinondoni district of the Dar es Salaam Region of Tanzania. According to the 2002 census, the ward has a total population of 43,457.
The ward is geographically a peninsula; both the ward and the peninsula are named after the Msasani village, which used to be the only settlement in the area. The intense urbanization of the area in recent times notwithstanding, it is still essentially a Swahili fishermen's village.
Msasani includes some of the wealthiest areas in the Dar es Salaam Region, Peninsula, Oysterbay and Masaki. These areas contain shops, restaurants, beauty salons, pubs, and other entertainment facilities, as well as a large bazaar selling local crafts at Slipway hotel/mall. It is also a luxury residential area, with several large villas owned by members of the Tanzanian political and economic elite. Most of these structures were built in an era of building liberalization initiated by former Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. 
Public transportation in the area is mainly provided by daladalas, their main end stations being Msasani on Kimweri Avenue and Masaki near the Sea Cliff Hotel. From Slipway, motored dhows provide connection to the island of Bongoyo.
Coco Beach in Msasani is a popular holiday and weekend destination for Dar es Salaam inhabitants, although shark attacks were reported several years ago.

In 2006, the Centre began an initiative to provide greater support for HIV and AIDS patients through the use of testing, counseling, and antiretroviral drugs. Other high-priority problems targeted by the Centre include malaria and food- and water-borne diseases.
Economics.
In 1985, Dar es Salaam passed a law requiring small business owners to register for one of fifty-six different types of business licenses. By 1987, however, only 325 entrepreneurs out of an estimated 30,000 had applied for these licenses. City Council members attributed this non-compliance to an overwhelming majority of small business owners providing illegal goods and services. Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, commonly viewed the law as "unjust" on the grounds that impoverished peddlers and other "business owners" could not afford the license on their limited and unstable incomes.

2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment

The 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment is a United States Army infantry battalion. Originally formed during World War II, the battalion took part in the Aleutian and Italian campaigns before being deactivated after the war. Later, however, it was reactivated and in recent times has served in the Sinai Peninsula and in Afghanistan.
Unit history.
World War II.
Formation.
The battalion was formed in May 1942 as the 87th Infantry, Mountain, 2nd Battalion, Reinforced at Fort Lewis, Washington. It along with 1–87 Mountain Infantry, comprised the 87th Mountain Infantry. The battalion was made up of world famous skiers, mountaineers, forest rangers, trappers, lumberman, guides, cowboys, muleskinners, horseman, and Regular Army cadre.
As the battalion was conducting maneuvers in Jolan, California in November 1942, the army was preparing a brand new camp to house the 87th on the Continental Divide at Camp Hale, Colorado, at above sea level. 2–87 moved to Camp Hale in late December 1942. During the winter of 1942–43, the battalion conducted extreme cold weather and high altitude training and tested over one hundred types of equipment and vehicles.
Aleutian campaign.
On 11 June 1943, the battalion deployed to Fort Ord, California for amphibious training in preparation of combat operations. Within weeks after this training, the battalion sailed to the Aleutian Island as part of Amphibious Technical Force Nine. The 2–87 Mountain Infantry took part in regimental amphibious assault of Kiska on 1–16 August 1943 and occupied the island until withdrawal to Camp Carson, Colorado in December 1943.
In February 1944, the battalion joined the 10th Light Division and moved again to Camp Hale. In the winter of 1944, the battalion took part in a maneuver in sub-zero weather. In one night alone, over 100 cases of frostbite were evacuated. All men who completed the maneuver were commended.
Italian campaign.
In late June 1944, the battalion moved with the newly designated 87th Infantry Regiment, Light as a part of the 10th Mountain Division to Camp Swift, Texas. On 20 December 1944, 2–87 entrained from Camp Swift to Newport News, Virginia and embarked on the USS "West Point". The battalion sailed for Naples, Italy on 4 January 1945.
The battalion entered combat on 28 January 1945 as part of the Fifth U.S. Army. On the night of 19 February after 17 days of patrolling in the mountains on snowshoes and skis, the battalion was instrumental in the capture on Mount Belvedere and other key mountain peaks in a night attack.
On 4–5 March, 2–87 participated in their second offensive by capturing Mad Na Di Brasa and Castel d'Alano. Whereas the Battle of Belvedere was a night attack, the Battle of Castel d' Alano was a deadly struggle in the sunlight, from bunker to bunker, hill to hill, objective to objective.
During the first two weeks of April 1945, the battalion planned and prepared for their part in the final spring offensive of the Fifth Army in Italy. The intent was to break through the northern Apennines, drive the Germans out of the mountains, and secure the wide Po Valley. The battalion fought continuously from 4 April to 2 May over mountainous terrain covering .
The battalion learned of the surrender of all German forces at suppertime on 2 May 1945. The Germans had been impressed by the 10th Mountain Infantry soldiers. Using the words from captured enemy documents, the Germans knew they had been up against mountain troops. They believed them to be a hand picked elite corps, made up of physically superior soldiers, sports personalities and young men from politically significant American families. It was no accident that Lieutenant General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin insisted on surrendering in person only to Major General George Price Hays, the Commanding General of what the general called the best American formation in Italy—the 10th Mountain Division.
From May–July 1945, the battalion conducted occupation duties. In July, the battalion was ordered to duty in the Pacific. 2–87 sailed from Italy on 2 August and arrived in the United States on 11 August. On 14 August, the battalion learned that the Japanese had surrendered and that the war was over.
Postwar.
The 2nd Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry was inactivated in November 1945 at Camp Carson, Colorado. On June 18, 1948, the battalion was designated the 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry and again assigned to the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Riley Kansas. In June 1958, the battalion was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division in Germany, and in 1963 reassigned to the 8th Infantry Division. 2–87 Infantry was inactivated in June 1986, only to be reactivated two years later as the sixth battalion of the 10th Mountain Division, Light Infantry, at Fort Drum, New York.
In August 1992 the battalion deployed to Homestead, Florida to provide humanitarian disaster relief during JTF Operation Hurricane Andrew.
2–87 was deployed again in December 1992, to Somalia as part of a Joint Task Force (JTF) in support of Operation Restore Hope.
In August 1994 the battalion deployed to Haiti on a four-month rotation in August 1994 as part of Operation Uphold Democracy.
In January 1997, 2–87 deployed with 529 soldiers as a Task Force to Sinai in Egypt for a six-month rotation for the Multinational Force Observers mission. The Task Force was part of a 14-country peace keeping force sent to the Sinai to enforce the Camp David Peace Accord signed in 1981. During this deployment soldiers from 2-87 participated in the "Force Skills" competition with the team from HHC 2-87 scouts winning "First Place Team" competing against teams from 14 different countries.
In September 1998, elements of the battalion deployed to Central Asia to participate in CENTRAZBAT '98, a multi-national peacekeeping exercise involving soldiers from six former Eastern Bloc nations. During this exercise, 2–87 forged ties with other nations through shared hardships and training, while setting the stage for the multinational operations and peacekeeping missions that would soon follow.
In late August 1999, the soldiers of 2–87 deployed overseas to the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the former Yugoslavia. The battalion would serve as one unit in the Multinational Division (North) component of the Stabilization Force 6, in support of Operation Joint Forge. Task Force CATAMOUNT was charged with the northern portion of the MND (N) sector, including the towns of Brcko, Srebenik, and Modirchia. During the Task Force's seven month deployment, it participated in several missions designed to bring stability to the Balkans and a lasting peace to the People of Bosnia. Most notably, Operation Harvest which resulted in the destruction of over 5,000 weapons, and the implementation of the Brcko Demilitarization process that disbanded and relocated over 5,000 members of the Entity Armed Forces as well as destroyed 9,000 weapons required by the Brcko Arbitration Decision.
Sinai 2001.
From July 2001 to January 2002, 2–87 Infantry was again ordered overseas. This time it was a six-month deployment in support of the Multi-National Force and Observers in the Sinai desert. During those six months, the battalion took part in pre-deployment and sustainment training and certification, 24 hour operation of all remote sites and the battalion tactical operations center, training and deployment of the quick reaction force (QRF) and were responsible for security and force protection of South Camp. The battalion also prepared and participated in Force Skills Competition, operational readiness checks and SNAP inspections, EIB, EFMB, marksmanship and live-fire training and testing, joint and combined training with other contingents, and many other tasks, duties and responsibilities.
Afghanistan 2003.
In August 2003 the battalion deployed with 700 soldiers as a task force to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom IV, for a nine month rotation. Task Force 2–87 was part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, working as the northern combat task force. In Afghanistan, the Catamounts took part in combat operations to defeat anti-coalition forces operating in Asadabad, Barikowt, Khowst, Nangalam, and Ghazni provinces.
After their return from Afghanistan, 2–87 was swept up in the army's transformation initiative, where it added a weapons company, received in direct support a forward support company, and was assigned to the newly activated 3rd BCT (Spartans) of the 10th Mountain Division at Ft. Drum, NY.
Afghanistan 2006.
During the period 29 January 2006 to 28 January 2007, Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Toner 2d Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment and its subordinate units deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) VII and VIII. The regiment facilitated the disruption of Taliban operations alongside multinational forces to oversee transfer of authority, successfully captured one of the most significant weapons caches in OEF and detained or eradicated several key insurgent commanders.
Catamount Task Force was active in the region of Khowst as late as May 2007.
A Co. 2-87 was deployed to the Paktika Province of Afghanistan, along the Pakistan border, in January 2006. Operating out of FOB Tillman, they spent 16 months conducting patrols and combat operations as part of Operation Enduring Freedom VII and VIII.
B Co. 2-87 (Featured in "Outlaw Platoon") was deployed throughout RC East with its main body at FOB Bermel, located on the rugged terrain of the Pakistan border. 1st Platoon "Fightin' First" was detached from B Co. and conducted numerous dismounted and air assault operations throughout all of RC East and South from Ghazni to the Korengal.
C Co. 2-87 was based out of FOB Waza Khwa on in the rugged boarder region of Paktika Province. The company participated in all of the battalions named operation. Most famously the "Comanche" company was selected as the main effort in Operation Medusa. Details of the acts of heroism while being outmanned in the initial clearance of Pajiway can be read in "LIONS of KANDAHAR".
In August 2004 the battalion was transferred to the newly formed 3rd Brigade Combat Team "Spartans"
as the Army transformed to meet the needs of the Global War On Terror. Task Force Catamount deployed to Afghanistan again in February 2006 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom VII to defend the Afghan people and thwart enemy attempts to regain influence in Regional Command East and Regional Command South. With an initial area of operations 200 km in length and 200 km in width, and over 750 km of shared border with Pakistan,the battalion effectively deterred enemy infiltration from Pakistan and isolated the interior population of Paktika Province from terrorist attacks and influence.

Headquarters and Fox Support Company operated from Forward Operating Base (FOB) Pasab, with elements also stationed at COP Zhari Dasht (Za-ree-Da’sh-t).
The battalion’s counter-insurgency mission was conducted primarily through dismounted, light-infantry patrols; partnered with Afghan National Army soldiers, or Afghan national, or local police. Task Force Catamount executed offensive operations in the Arghandab River Valley, focused in the birthplace of the Taliban. During the year-long deployment, the early spring and summer saw intense combat, centralized in the jungle-like terrain of the “Green Zone,” or vegetated portion of the Arghandab River Valley. The battalion conducted over 10 joint air insertion operations, supported a unilateral Afghan Army air assault operation, and deliberate clearance operations of volatile Taliban strongholds throughout the Green Zone.
As the year progressed, successful offensive operations pressured the Taliban to regress south of the Arghandab River, effectively separating them from the local population. This allowed the battalion to train newly recruited Afghan local police, build six new schools and many other new pieces of tactical infrastructure. This facilitated the security of the local population and permitted a new government to take control of their district.
In March 2012, the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division replaced 2-87 Infantry.
MED 1 the workhorse of the Battalion was retired in April '13

Green PR

Green PR is a sub-field of public relations that communicates an organization's corporate social responsibility or environmentally friendly practices to the public. The goal is to produce increased brand awareness and improve the organization's reputation. Tactics include placing news articles, winning awards, communicating with environmental groups and distributing publications.
The term is derived from the "green movement", an ideology which seeks to minimize the effect of human activity on the environment.
Importance.
Environmentalism has become increasingly popular among consumers and media. A nine-country survey found 85% of consumers around the world are willing to change their consumption habits to make tomorrow’s world a better place, and over half (55%) would help a brand “promote” a product if a good cause were behind it. The study also found when choosing between two brands of same quality and price, social purpose affected consumers’ decision the most (41%), ahead of design and innovation (32%) and the loyalty to the brand (26%).
According to PR Week:
The significance of corporate America embracing the green movement cannot be denied. Some still think it's a fad, but all signs point to the contrary - a sustained commitment to sustainability, either for economic efficiencies or reach out to a public whose goals and values are changing.

Fisch-Ton-Kan

Fisch-Ton-Kan is an opéra bouffe in one act by Emmanuel Chabrier of which only some numbers survive. The French libretto was by Paul Verlaine, and probably Lucien Viotti, after the 'parade chinoise' "Fich-Tong-Khan ou L'orphelin de le Tartarie" of 1835 by Thomas Sauvage (1794-1877) and Gabriel de Lurieu (1792-1869).
The title is tongue-in-cheek, as "Fisch-Ton-Kan" is a phonetic rendition of French "fiche ton camp", which may be translated as "clear off!".
Background.
Composed around 1864, when Verlaine and Chabrier, working as a civil servant, had become good friends, only five complete numbers survive from this early comic work. Many of the situations recur in Chabrier's opéra bouffe of 1877, "L'étoile": Goulgouly becomes Laoula, Fisch-Ton-Kan turns into Lazuli and Kakao is a precursor of Ouf Ier. The 'Air de Poussah' was re-used by Chabrier in his "Ronde Champêtre", a piano work of 1880. Manuscripts of "Fisch-Ton-Kan" in the Bibliothèque Nationale include an early version of the 'Couplets du Pal' from "L'étoile".
"Le Sire de Fisch-Ton-Kan" was a satirical 'chanson' (music by Antonin Louis, words by Paul Burani) which became very popular in Paris after the fall of Napoleon III and mocked the ex-emperor, his family and court.
Performance history.
"Fisch-Ton-Kan" (with the title "Peh-Li-Khan") was first performed with Chabrier at the piano on 31 March 1875 at the 'Cercle de l'Union artistique' in Paris, where an earlier operétte bouffe to which Chabrier contributed, "Le service obligatoire" (now lost), had been mounted in December 1872. The next performance was on 22 April 1941 at the Salle du Conservatoire, Paris with Francis Poulenc accompanying at the piano. An orchestration for strings and wind quartet (1974) was made by Roger Delage, and broadcast that year on French radio.
Synopsis.
"from the original play"
From a balcony of the palace, Goulgouly takes a fancy to a young man below: Fisch-Ton-Kan. When each declares their love, he reveals to her that he is a Tartar prince exiled when he was 17 months old for having insulted Kakao, his father's enemy. Kakao orders all foreigners to cut off their right ear and leave it at the customs. When Kakao arrives on his palanquin he asks that boiling water be poured into a giant tea-pot in which Fisch-Ton-Kan is hiding, but Goulgouly manages to stop him. Kakao wants Goulgouly for himself. When Fisch-Ton-Kan intervenes, Kakao condemns him to be impaled but the young man escapes this fate by proving capable of removing the beetle Kakao is convinced he has on his nose. Offering Fisch-Ton-Kan anything to do this, he naturally chooses the hand of Goulgouly.

Toni Amboaje

Toni Amboaje is a Spanish singer who currently works for metal band Sauze, which formed on early 2008.
History.
Amboaje discovered his passion for music when he was only four years old, during the 1980s while listening to his parents' favorite singer Bruce Springsteen and band Dire Straits, this marked his influences to be a musician. It was not until 1992 that he discovered Bryan Adams's "Waking Up the Neighbours" that changed the way he thought of music leading him to play the guitar, write and sing his own songs.
Amboaje was self-taught and bought his own electric guitar in 1998, forming a band along with a friend of his, Gus Velasco. After some years improving themselves, learning how to play in a more professional way, decide the style and recruit the correct members, it's formed on mid 2002 the metal band Hard Spirit.
Already on Hard Spirit he lived processes of creation and evolution of a band, after more than 50 concerts in Spain, winning the award for best vocalist on Villa de Bilbao, Hard Spirit released their debut album "Walk the Wild" with good critics reception. That same year Amboaje participated in an AOR project from Jaén Hardleywood's band, where he co-wrote and sang on 3 songs. On late 2007 he accepted Ardines, Mon and Ramil's invitation to join them as lead vocalist for alternative metal band Sauze, where he participed on debut album "Nada Tiene Sentido", released on June 1, 2008.

Family Tradition (Senses Fail song)

"Family Tradition" is the first single and fourth song on Senses Fail's third studio album "Life Is Not a Waiting Room". Family Tradition is the seventh single released from Senses Fail. It was released on iTunes on August 26, 2008.
This song and others off the same album will be featured in Senses Fail's upcoming greatest hits album entitled ""Follow Your Bliss: The Best of Senses Fail"".
Lead singer Buddy Nielsen discusses the story behind the song:
A music video was recently filmed for the song displaying a rather scrawny young boy who does not seem to add up to his father's expectations. Constantly harassed by his older brother throughout the video, he enters a chest in his room only to come out in the form of a large gremlin-looking character. The video ends with the transformed son frightening his parents in their sleep. Scenes of the band playing the song in front of an audience in a tent are intercut with the storyline of the video.

Kolmogorov's criterion

In probability theory, Kolmogorov's criterion, named after Andrey Kolmogorov, is a theorem in a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain or continuous-time Markov chain to be stochastically identical to its time-reversed version.
Discrete-time Markov chains.
The theorem states that a Markov chain with transition matrix "P" is reversible if and only if its transition probabilities satisfy
for all finite sequences of states
Here "pij" are elements of the transition matrix "P" and "S" is the state space of the chain.
Example.
Consider this figure depicting a section of a Markov chain with states "i", "j", "k" and "l" and the corresponding transition probabilities. Here Kolmogorov's criterion implies that the product of probabilities when traversing through any closed loop must be equal, so the product around the loop "i" to "j" to "l" to "k" returning to "i" must be equal to the loop the other way round,
Continuous-time Markov chains.
The theorem states that a continuous-time Markov chain with transition rate matrix "Q" is reversible if and only if its transition probabilities satisfy
for all finite sequences of states

Keko

Keko (born Jocelyne Tracey Keko) is a Ugandan rapper who has taken over the music scene in Africa during 2011. Her rise to fame began in 2010 with the release of 'fallen heroes' which she appeared alongside other established Ugandan artists like Don MC,SP,DAVIS and also the mwanba children choir. After spitting arguably the best verse on the track Keko began to turn heads with her lyrics, delivery and presence on tracks. Her break through single 'How we do it' took the Ugandan charts and MTV Africa by storm making her an instant household name in East Africa. The success of the track has even led to an endorsement deal with Pepsi and saw her lead Mountain Dew's advertising campaign in E. Africa.
Musical career.
Keko was born to Japadhola parents from Tororo, the self-proclaimed queen of rap has collaborated with Uganda's elite such as Juliana, Joanita Kawalya and Radio & weasal and Chicago based Kerry Lee. The release of much acclaimed track 'Go Green' with Angela Katatumba further cemented her place as the most talented new artist from Africa because it showed her ability and versatility to tackle important subject matter such as climate awareness.
She has performed at the annual Selam Festival in Ethiopia alongside hand picked international artists from around the world and is well known for bringing the house down. Her buzz and success in a short period of time also led to an invitation to join the cream of the crop of African artists to perform at the Big Brother Africa 6 Amplified show in South Africa, which she was described by the host's as the stand out performer.
Her follow-up to 'How we do it' entitled 'Alwoo (cry for help) caused massive waves because it addressed issues of domestic violence, struggle, success and triumph which are common talking points all over Africa. Throughout all of Africa the Ugandan native has been a revelation to hip hop with her lyrical prowess, attitude and consistency on tracks, so much so every media publication has dubbed her 'the next big thing' and sky is the limit for the rising star that is Keko. She is currently in the studio finishing her debut album, which is due for release later in 2011.

Johannes Vahlen

Johannes Vahlen (27 September 1830, Bonn – 30 November 1911, Berlin) was a German classical philologist. He was the father of mathematician Theodor Vahlen (1869-1945).
In 1852 he graduated at the University of Bonn, where he studied classical philology. In 1856 he became an associate professor at the University of Breslau, and in 1858 a full professor at the University of Freiburg. Shortly afterwards he relocated to Vienna, where in 1862 he became a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. Beginning in 1874 he was a professor of classical philology at the University of Berlin, where he was also a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
Vahlen was a specialist of Greek and Latin literature, publishing works on a wide array of ancient authors that included Aristotle, Ennius, Horace, Plautus and Gnaeus Naevius. He is particularly known for his interpretive work involving the "Poetics" of Aristotle and the fragmentary relics of the poet Ennius; "Ennianae poesis reliquiae".
In 1913 Vahlen's library of over 10,000 volumes of ancient and classical works were acquired by the University of Illinois.

Froduald Karamira (14 August 1947 – 24 April 1998) was a Rwandan politician who was found guilty of crimes in organising the implementation of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. He was sentenced to death by a Rwandan court and was one of the last 24 individuals executed by Rwanda.
Political career.
Karamira was born in Mushubati, Rwanda into a Tutsi family. As an adult, Karamira was accepted as a Hutu by following certain Rwandan traditions that allow "conversions" from one group to the other.
Karamira became vice president of the MDR party and was a leader in the extremist wing of the party, nicknamed "Hutu Power".
On 23 October 1993, Karamira gave a public speech during which he coined the concept of "Hutu Power". He called on Hutus “to rise take the necessary measures”, and to “look within ourselves for the enemy which is amongst us”.
Rwandan Genocide.
On 8 April 1994, after the death of Hutu President Juvénal Habyarimana when his plane was shot down, Karamira participated in the creation of the interim government. During the genocide, Karamira gave daily speeches that were broadcast on the Mille Collines radio station. After the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front defeated the government in July 1994 and the genocide ended, Karamira disappeared from Rwanda. He was indicted by the government of Rwanda for genocide, murder, conspiracy, and non-assistance to people in danger.
Arrest, trial, and execution.
In June 1996, Karamira was arrested by Indian officials in Mumbai and was extradited to Rwanda. His trial began on 13 January 1997 in Kigali. In addition to his daily speeches that incited genocide, it was claimed that he was instrumental in creating and arming the Interahamwe militias; he was also accused of being personally responsible for the killing of hundreds of Tutsis, including 13 members of his own family.
On 14 February 1997, Karamira was convicted on all counts and was sentenced to death. He appealed to the Kigali Appeals Court, but the appeal was rejected and his sentence confirmed on 12 September 1997. On 24 April 1998, in a public event at the Nyamirambo Stadium in Kigali, Karamira was executed by firing squad along with 21 other people convicted of involvement in the Rwandan Genocide. The same day, at least two other individuals were also executed at other locations in Rwanda.
Rwanda abolished the death penalty in 2007. The 24 people executed in 1997, including Karamira, were the last to have been executed in Rwanda.

William T. Davis

William Thompson Davis (1862 – 1945) was an American naturalist, entomologist, and historian especially associated with Staten Island in New York City. He was prominent in the borough's affairs throughout his life.
Biography.
Davis was born in New Brighton, Staten Island in 1862. His family history on Staten Island dates back to the 17th century. He was largely self-taught, but nonetheless made huge contributions to the study of Staten Island’s community and natural history. Davis wrote a number of books about the history and natural geography of Staten Island. In 1892 he wrote "Days Afield on Staten Island" which catalogues the island’s plants and animals, while "Staten Island and Its People", which he coauthored with Charles W. Leng (1859-1941) in 1930, is one of the greatest accounts of Staten Island history. He was also an entomologist enjoying an international reputation as an expert on cicadas.
Civic affairs.
In 1881, Davis and Nathaniel Britton, Arthur Hollick, Edward Delevan, and Charles W. Leng founded the Natural Science Association of Staten Island. That organization would later become the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences. 
In the 1930s, Davis and Loring McMillen led volunteer preservationists from the Staten Island Historical Society in transforming the former County Clerk's Office and Surrogate's Office at the former county seat of Richmondtown into a museum. That was the beginning of Historic Richmond Town.
The Staten Island Historical Society's collections include material relating to William T. Davis, including a straw hat that belonged to him.
Wildlife refuge.
A bird sanctuary was created in a marshy area of New Springville, Staten Island, in 1933 at the urging of Davis. It was maintained by the National Audubon Society and the New York City Parks Department. Enlarged to in 1956, it was renamed the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge in his honor.

Ivo Urbančič

Ivo Urbančič (born 12 November 1930) is a Slovenian philosopher. He is considered to be one of the fathers of the phenomenological school in Slovenia. His role in the development of the philosophical thought is comparable to the one of Mihailo Đurić in Serbia or Vanja Sutlić in Croatia.
Biography.
He was born as Ivan Urbančič in the village of Robič near Kobarid, in what was then the Italian administrative region of Julian March to a peasant Slovene family. When he was still a child, his family left the region in order to escape Fascist persecution and moved to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. They spent six years in the village of Bistrica in south-west Macedonia, where a colony of Slovene immigrants from the Julian March was established. In 1937, they moved to Slovenia, in the village of Črešnjevec near Slovenska Bistrica. There, the young Ivo met with Jože Pučnik, with whom he established a lifelong friendship. 
After finishing the technical high school in Kranj, he attended a one-year course in communication technology in Belgrade. In 1960, the friend Jože Pučnik convinced him to enroll to the University of Ljubljana, where he studied philosophy. In his student years, he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the Critical generation. In 1970, he obtained his PhD at the University of Zagreb. Between 1969-1970, he studied at the University of Vienna, and between 1971-1972 in Cologne where he worked with the philosopher Karl-Heinz Volkmann-Schluck. In 1964, he became a researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana. He developed a critical stance towards the Titoist regime which prevented him from getting a job in the pedagogic process at the University. Nevertheless, Urbančič managed to turn the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy into some sort of refuge for critical intellectuals (among the people brought by Urbančič to the Institute was also the philosopher Slavoj Žižek).
In the late 1980s, he worked as an editor in the prestigious publishing house "Slovenska matica", where he supervised the translation and first edition of many major Western thinkers in Slovene language. Among others, he was instrumental in the publishing of the complete works of Nietzsche.
In the early 1980s, he was one of the co-founders of the alternative review "Nova revija". In 1987, he was among the authors of the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, an intellectual manifesto demanding a democratic, pluralistic and independent Slovenia. In 1989. he was among the co-founders of the Slovenian Democratic Union, one of the first democratic political parties opposing the Communist regime in Slovenia. Although he hasn't participated in active politics since the end of the Slovenian Spring in the early 1990s, he has been known as a supporter of the Slovenian Democratic Party and its president Janez Janša. In 2004, Urbančič was among the co-founders of the liberal conservative civic platform Rally for the Republic ().
He currently lives in Ljubljana.
Work.
Urbančič was one of the first who introduced the thought of Martin Heidegger to Slovenia. He also wrote several monographies on Friedrich Nietzsche. He has been interested in questions regarding the issue of political power, the individual existence in the modern and post-modern technological world. He developed an interest in the system theory, namely in the functioning of large social systems in the intersection of culture, politics and technology. He has been preoccupied and fascinated by the issue of modern nihilism which he sees, following Nietzsche, as the essence of modern society.
Urbančič has also written several works on the history of philosophy in the Slovene Lands.

Polish Downtown (Chicago)

Polish Downtown was Chicago’s oldest and most prominent Polish settlement. Polish Downtown was the political, cultural and social capital of not only Poles in Chicago but Polish Americans throughout North America as well. Centered around Polonia Triangle at the intersection of Division, Ashland and Milwaukee Avenue, the headquarters for almost every major Polish organization in the United States was clustered within its vicinity, beginning with the Polish National Alliance to the "Polish Daily News".
Description.
Located on the city's near northwest side, the area of Polish Downtown shifted and expanded over time as Polish immigration to Chicago exploded along with other Eastern Europeans amid Chicago's population boom in the late nineteenth century. 
Historian Edward R. Kantowicz gave the following boundaries for Polish Downtown: Racine Avenue to the east, Fullerton Avenue to the North, Kedzie Avenue to the West and Grand Avenue to the South. The historian Dominic Pacyga notes that this district was not exclusively Polish, and that Italians, Ukrainians, and Jews each possessed their own enclaves within the area. The Polish character of the neighborhood visibly predominated over others in the area, as there was an extensive network of Polish churches, businesses, cultural institutions and fraternal organizations.
The following neighborhoods of Chicago were once a part of Polish Downtown:
History.
The beginnings of the "Polish Patch" that eventually became Polish Downtown are traced back to Anthony Smarzewski-Schermann, who settled in the area in 1851. John Joseph Parot described the area at the time in his book "Polish Catholics in Chicago": 
This rustic idyll would change dramatically as Chicago's population would grow exponentially following the American Civil War, with increased immigration from Europe. Fueled by the dramatic expansion of industry as well as the city's central role as a transportation hub, immigrants, predominately from Eastern and Southern Europe flooded into Chicago. By 1890, half of all of Chicago's Poles lived in Polish Downtown. The centrality of this area as the site of initial settlement for the large numbers of newly arriving Polish immigrants was reinforced after the first Polish parish, St. Stanislaus Kostka, was founded in 1867 and Holy Trinity Polish Mission a few years later in 1872. Together the churches made the largest parish in the world, with a combined membership of over 60,000 in the early 1900s. Polish Downtown was in every way "a classic ghetto"; in 1898, eleven contiguous precincts, which contained the heart of the neighborhood at Polonia Triangle, were 86.3% Polish, with one of these precincts reported as 99.9% Polish with only one non-Pole among 2,500 inhabitants.
Along with Holy Trinity Polish Mission, St. Stanislaus Kostka was the center of Chicago's Polish community. The neighborhood became called "Kostkaville". Much of this was due to Saint Stanislaus Kostka's first pastor, Reverend Vincent Michael Barzynski, who is described as “one of the greatest organizers of Polish immigrants in Chicago and America”. Barzynski was responsible for founding 23 Polish parishes in Chicago, along with six elementary schools, two high schools, a college, orphanages, newspapers, and St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital, as well as the national headquarters of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America. 
Polish immigration into the area accelerated during and after World War II; as many as 150,000 Poles are estimated to have arrived between 1939 and 1959 as displaced persons. Poles clustered in established ethnic enclaves such as this one, which offered shops, restaurants, and banks where people spoke their language. Division Street was referred to as "Polish Broadway", "teeming with flophouses and gambling dens and polka clubs and workingman’s bars like the Gold Star and Phyllis’ Musical Inn".
Cultural significance.
The historian Edward R. Kantowicz wrote in his essay, "Polish Chicago: Survival through Solidarity", that "Polish Downtown was to Chicago Poles what the Lower East Side was to New York's Jews." Victoria Granacki in "Polish Downtown" wrote, "Nearly all Polish undertakings of any consequence in the U.S. during that time either started or were directed from this part of Chicago's near northwest side". 
Polish Downtown, and particularly Pulaski Park served as Chicago Congressman Dan Rostenkowski's base of operations. The family still owns the building opposite St. Stanislaus Kostka church at 1372 Evergreen from which he ran his operations. 
Polish Downtown was also significant in the literary output of Nelson Algren who lived in the area. Polish bars that Algren frequented for his notorious gambling, such as the Bit of Poland on Milwaukee Avenue figured in such stories such as "Never Come Morning" and "The Man With the Golden Arm". Algren, who famously compared Ashland Avenue to "a bridge between Warsaw and Chicago" had a complex if not troubled relationship with Chicago Polonia. His second wife Amanda Kontowicz was Polish, and would listen to old Polish love songs sung by an elderly waitress while gambling. His writing about the area's Polish American underclass, against the background of prevalent anti-immigrant xenophobia, was taken by Poles as blatant Anti-Polonism. His book "Never Come Morning" was banned for decades from the Chicago Public Library system because of the massive outcry against it by Chicago Polonia. Later efforts to commemorate Algren brought up old controversies: for example, when the city proposed renaming a portion of Evergreen Street, where Algren lived, as Algren Street, and, more recently, when the Polonia Triangle was to be renamed in Algren's honor.
Polish Downtown also figures in John Guzlowski's poetry. His book "Lightning and Ashes" chronicles the author's experiences growing up among the immigrants and DP living there. He heard and saw Jewish hardware store clerks who had Auschwitz tattoos on their wrists, Polish Cavalry officers who mourned for their dead horses, and Polish women who had walked from Siberia to Iran to escape the Russians.
Religion.
Polish Downtown is perhaps most noted for its opulent "Polish Cathedrals", magnificently ornate structures that dazzle many of those driving through the area along the Kennedy Expressway. The buildings express the religious zeal and faith of the large immigrant Polish congregations. The combined membership of the exclusively Polish Roman Catholic parishes of Polish Downtown together had over 100,000 parishioners in 1918, all located within a one-mile radius.
Although most of these are Roman Catholic churches, a schism that escalated into violence by parishioners of St. Hedwig's Church led to the founding of an independent Polish Catholic parish. This parish eventually joined the Polish National Catholic Church. Raised to the status of a cathedral, the parish erected a new building designed by famed architect J.G Steinbach in 1930. The Cathedral of All Saints still stands today, now owned and occupied by the Presbyterian Church in America, which bought the building in 1993.
Decline.
In the 1960s Polish Downtown began to change radically. Completion of the Kennedy Expressway in 1960, whose construction had displaced many residents, disrupted the sustaining network of Polish-American churches, settlement houses, and neighborhood groups. Additionally Puerto Ricans and other Latinos displaced by urban renewal in Old Town and Lincoln Park began moving in. In 1960 Latinos comprised less than 1 percent of West Town’s population, but by 1970 that proportion had increased to 39 percent. At the same time, more established ethnic Poles moved out to newer housing in the suburbs, following World War II and the housing boom.
Downtown banks redlined West Town for much of the mid-20th century. Real estate values plummeted as landlords neglected their buildings and speculators sat on vacant land and abandoned property. Small businesses along Chicago Avenue closed. The arson rate in the vicinity was so high that in 1976 Mayor Richard J. Daley convened a task force to address the crisis. The Polish exodus out of the neighborhood followed the Kennedy Expressway into the suburbs. The Northwest Community Organization was founded in 1962 to stem white flight by promoting home ownership and integration between longtime ethnic Eastern European residents and the newcomers. The institutional infrastructure that held Ukrainian Village together during the 1970s and 1980s was lacking in East Village. Much of the Polish population had moved northwestward to Avondale, Jefferson Park and beyond. The Latino community, which had begun to organize around issues of affordable housing and other redevelopment strategies designed to stave off displacement, increasingly came into conflict with the mostly European-American artists and other urban-pioneer types. By the early 1980s, the latter were a minor but significant presence in the area.
Polish Downtown today.
For the most part, the neighborhoods that comprise the old Polish Downtown have been gentrified and now present a cosmopolitan mix of people of diverse backgrounds. While Polish Downtown is no longer the center of Chicago's Polish Community, its legacy is present in the businesses, restaurants, and historic buildings. Numerous prominent Polish-American cultural and civic institutions continue, from the Polish Museum of America to the Chopin Theatre and the Society for Arts.

El Regreso

"El Regreso" (English: "The Return") is the third track from WarCry's "¿Dónde Está La Luz?". "El Regreso" is a well-known song among the band's fans and one of their most controversial ones due to the lyrics referring to revenge from a son to his alcoholic father who abused of him and his mother. "El Regreso" is featured on live album "Directo A La Luz" on both DVD and CD versions.
Meaning.
Víctor García explained the song meaning on the albums's "Song by Song" in their website:
One of the album's most controversial songs. The news about abuse both physical and psychological are on the agenda for television, radio, press, in fact... all media. There are thousands of ways of mistreatment and have existed since long before being given publicity. There are cultural abuse (in many countries women are almost considered an animal), religious (the ability to be a representative of God is only masculine). But there's a big difference when one see something like this: "Husband kills wife after years of abuse with the presence of major children." 
We always talk about trying to avoid the tragedy but... imagine you grow up in that environment, which will certainly create a rejection frm yo toward your father, since it's quite possible that in addition to the abuse with your mother has been also on you. This is not correct ("Politically") but in this case, wouldn't you fight with "everything", legal ways, relatives and even force to stop the aggressor? Thanks God I haven't experienced such situation before, but I accept that just by thinking about it, makes my blood boil. 
We have technologically advanced, but still dragging the old stigmas of the human being as ignorance, incompetence, indifference... and many more, but these three are enough to ask me the famous phrase "cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am) . Today is almost proved that many of the existing people are losing the ability to think and act to solve this and other very similar problems.

Journey to Saturn

Journey to Saturn () is a 2008 Danish animated comedy-science-fiction film produced by A. Film A/S, loosely based on Claus Deleuran's comic from 1977 of the same name. The film revolves around a group of Danish astronauts who journey to Saturn on a quest for natural resources.
The film also depicts and mocks several Danish stereotypes and characters characters, like the royal family, the (at the time) Danish prime minister Anders Fogh, Muslim immigrants, American yeehaw's, Jesus and Danish lack of style and presentability in general.
The film humor is very slapstick with a lot of adolescent or adult jokes.
Plot.
In the film a corporate backed rocket takes off from Denmark, supposedly to explore Saturn for natural resources. The crew consists of wannabe astronaut Per Jensen, military instructor and hardliner sgt. Arne Skrydsbøl, Fisse-Ole ("pussy-Ole"), tour chef and caterer Jamil Ahmadinejad and two pilots.
Upon arrival the crew make contact with aliens but it becomes apparent that the chief of the corporation wishes to conspire with the aliens to sell off all the water on earth, and he has no hope of ever returning the astronauts to Earth. The aliens head to Earth and on the way learn what they think is a friendly earth greeting from what is in fact a German pornographic film involving large sausages.
The astronauts are left for dead in space but they fall through a black hole and land in heaven. Leaving heaven guided by the holy spirit in the form of a dove, they refuel and make it back to the moon where they encounter some US astronauts. They then use a US space based surveillance system to find the centre of the water theft conspiracy on earth. The crew return to earth and rescue a hostage scientist (Per Jensen's girlfriend) at the installation. They defeat an alien monster with a keg of beer in a manner similar to that in Jaws and escape the installation just in time as it is destroyed by a nuclear bomb, sent from the moon.
Release.
The film was released on September 26, 2008.

The GrooveGrass Boyz

The GrooveGrass Boyz was an American musical group that played a mix of bluegrass, funk, and freestyle music. The group was founded as a side project by record producer and session musician Scott Rouse in 1987, after he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass and country songs, eventually applying the term groovegrass to his mix of music. He then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and joined several other country musicians and funk bass guitarist Bootsy Collins, releasing a country version of Los del Río's "Macarena" and two albums. The country cover of "Macarena" charted on both the Hot Country Songs charts and the Bubbling Under Hot 100, and was the group's first chart entry.
History.
Rouse, a session musician from Boston, Massachusetts, first came up with the idea of GrooveGrass in the mid-1980s when he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass songs such as Alton Delmore's "Deep River Blues". His mixes became popular at local clubs, eventually leading to one disc jockey terming the blend of music "groovegrass".
Rouse then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the request of his friend, musician Doc Watson. Rouse's first country remix was for Warner Bros. It was a remix of John Anderson's 1983 Number One single "Swingin'." At Anderson's request, Warner never released the cut, although it became a popular bootleg recording. It was followed by an EP remix of "Rocky Top", which was released and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in the United States. Rouse also produced comedian Jeff Foxworthy's trademark "You might be a redneck if…" single he named called the "Redneck Stomp", one of several similar musical tracks included on Foxworthy's "".
Soon afterward, Rouse recruited several other musicians, including members of Del McCoury's band, funk bass guitarist Bootsy Collins, and bluegrass multi-instrumentalist Jerry Douglas, to perform as the GrooveGrass Boyz. They saw their most successful release in late 1996, when they put out a country version of the "Macarena", a song made popular earlier that year by Spanish duo Los del Río. The GrooveGrass Boyz' version, released on Imprint Records, peaked at No. 70 on the Hot Country Songs charts and No. 7 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. The single sold over 100,000 copies. It was followed in 1997 by a self-released album, and in 1998 by another album on Reprise Records. These included Doc Watson, Mac Wiseman, Bernie Leadon, and other notable artists. Neither album produced any chart single.

He also served as General Counsel and Head of Business Development for The Falconwood Corporation, an investment/venture capital fund in New York City. O'Neill is currently Counsel at White & Case.
Assistant District Attorney.
In April 2001, O’Neill joined the New York County District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney in the Special Prosecutions Bureau. He investigated and prosecuted numerous cases of white-collar and organized crime, frauds and scams. His most widely reported case involved a ring of women who would, for money, repeatedly marry foreign-born men to facilitate immigration fraud. One woman married 27 times in this way. 
Another important case resulted in the take-down of an organized crime ring whose bankruptcy and auctioneering fraud resulted in at least $27.7 million in thefts from distressed businesses that were being restructured or liquidated., O’Neill also investigated an explosion in a Chelsea manufacturing plant that injured dozens of people and closed West 21st Street. This case led to enhanced safety compliance in the industry.
Louis O’Neill specialized in tracking down elusive white-collar criminals on the lam, and brought number of them back to the United States to face prosecution, including a German man who defrauded hundreds of hotel patrons and a Russian man who ran a fraudulent immigration law firm.
Following the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the Special Prosecutions Bureau investigated and prosecuted nearly 200 cases of "electronic looting" against New York's Municipal Credit Union. Each defendant stole at least $7,500 from the bank in the chaos following the attacks. O’Neill handled two dozen of these cases.
He also handled smaller, highly emotional cases where vulnerable, elderly or mentally incapacitated victims were preyed upon for their money.
White House Fellow.
In 2004, Louis O’Neill was selected to the 2004–2005 class of White House Fellows. 
He was assigned to the State Department as Secretary of State Colin Powell's Special Assistant on Russian Affairs. He covered issues of counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics cooperation and also was tasked with special projects, including as the U.S. Expert for the OSCE Fact-Finding Mission to the Occupied Territories Surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, whose report he co-authored.

OSCE Ambassador and Head of Mission to Moldova.
In 2006, Louis O’Neill was confirmed by the Belgian Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe as OSCE Ambassador and Head of Mission to Moldova.
The OSCE Mission to Moldova's Mandate calls for facilitating the achievement of a lasting, comprehensive political settlement of the Transnistrian conflict in all its aspects, as well as advancing human and minority rights, democratic transformation, freedom of the press and fighting the scourge of human trafficking. It also requires ensuring transparency of the removal and destruction of Russian ammunition and armaments from Moldova.
Ambassador O’Neill pushed hard for fulfillment of this Mandate – which was approved by all OSCE participating States – and for reconciliation of the Moldovan and Transnistrian sides. He brought them together in a seminar on Confidence and Security Building measures in October 2007, on the margins of which the 5+2 negotiating format (OSCE, Russia, Ukraine, EU, US, Moldova and Transnistria) met for the first time in some 18 months. O’Neill did much to encourage the sides to disarm, including providing financial aid for the destruction of surplus weapons, and organizing seminars on proper storage and stockpile management.
His efforts to improve Moldova's human rights landscape and make it more attractive to the Transnistrian separatists included enhancing press freedoms, defending the rights of opposition parties, improving anti-torture legislation, strengthening the rule of law and judiciary, protecting freedom of assembly, and guarding the linguistic rights of schoolchildren in Transnistria.
Ambassador O’Neill devoted significant attention to improving elections throughout Moldova. This included marshaling the Chişinău diplomatic core to actively monitor the Gagauz Bashkan election in December 2006 and running an observation mission there, . He also played an active role in covering the Moldovan national local elections in June 2007, helping de-escalate a violent situation at a Moldovan polling place on the left bank of the Nistru.
Ambassador O’Neill also placed a priority on battling gender violence and human trafficking, very serious problems in Moldova.
O'Neill used creative approaches to bring the Moldovan and Transnistrian sides together. These included a very popular rock festival on the Nistru river with bands from both sides, and a photo contest.
Work for the Obama campaign.
From January 2008 Ambassador O’Neill worked for the Obama campaign, serving in five states during the primaries – New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Montana in a variety of capacities. During the general election he assisted the state leadership in Virginia and was involved in all aspects of that race. As well, Ambassador O’Neill was one of the Obama Campaign's foreign policy advisors as part of the Russia/Eurasia team.
Other information.
Louis O’Neill is a native English speaker and speaks fluent Russian and Romanian.
