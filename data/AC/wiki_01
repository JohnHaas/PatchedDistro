Phil Costa

Phillip John "Phil" Costa (born 24 July 1949) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2007 until 2011, representing the electorate of Wollondilly. He served as Minister for Water and Minister for Corrective Services.
Early life.
Costa was born on 24 July 1949 at Guildford, New South Wales. Prior to his election he was a primary school teacher and principal of public schools in the Oaks and Buxton. He was named the Citizen of the Year in Wollondilly Shire in 1984.
Politics.
Costa was first elected to Wollondilly Shire Council in 1985; he continued serving on the Council until 2008. He served as Deputy Mayor from 1999 to 2005 before being elected as Mayor from 2006 to 2007, immediately prior to the 2007 state election. 
Costa initially planned to stand as an independent candidate in the 2007 state election but was persuaded by Premier Morris Iemma to stand instead for the Australian Labor Party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly on 24 March 2007 with 53% of the vote. From June 2007 to September 2008, he was a member of the State Parliament's Standing Committee on Parliamentary Privilege and Ethics and Chair of the Standing Committee on Broadband in Rural and Regional Communities.
From 8 September 2008 to 4 December 2009, he was appointed Minister for Water, Minister for Rural Affairs and Minister for Regional Development in the Cabinet of incoming Premier Nathan Rees.
Controversies.
After being voted in as Mayor in 2007, Costa was announced as the Labor candidate for seat of Wollondilly. Deputy Mayor of the time Judith Hannan and councillors Michael Banasik, Denise Appel, Helen Kuiper, Simon Landow and Shane Read passed a vote of no confidence in Costa that limited Costa’s powers as Mayor. Costa refused to step down and went on to win election in the 2007 state election. 
During 2009, Costa came under heavy criticism from Wollondilly Councillor Benn Banasik, Mayor of Camden Council Chris Patterson and Campbelltown Councillor Jai Rowell for the Labor Government's approval of the AGL Power Station at Appin. Wollondilly Council passed a resolution from Councillor Benn Banasik requesting Costa to resign but this was later withdrawn. Costa hit back at the Council, complaining in the "Macarthur Chronicle" that he had received 12 letters from Wollondilly Council. Despite being the Minister for Regional Development at the time, in 2008 Costa disavowed knowledge or responsibility for a Labor government project that would have seen a new commuter car park in his electorate built next to existing family homes as a replacement for a car park facing the Macarthur train station. It was proposed that the former car park be converted into a tavern by commercial developers.
Personal life.
Costa is married with two adult children. He is not related to Parliamentary colleague and former Treasurer Michael Costa.

Ste. Agathe, Manitoba

Ste. Agathe is a primarily francophone community in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It is located along the Red River in the Rural Municipality of Ritchot.
The village was founded in the mid-19th century on one of the Red River Trails by settlers from Quebec named Grouette, who built a homestead on the west bank of the Red River and farmed grain in the rich soil of the valley. A dock allowed other settlers to reach the east side of the river via ferry with their grain-laden Red River carts; a community, originally called Pointe-à-Grouette, formed around the docking point at some time before 1871. 
The first mention of the name "Ste. Agathe" was some decades earlier, when the Roman Catholic Church organized the Red River colonies between St. Norbert and the United States border into the Parish of Sainte-Agathe. As that parish grew and split into numerous more manageable parishes, the parish containing Pointe-à-Grouette was renamed the Parish of Sainte-Agathe by Archbishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché in 1873; the town adopted the name at some time after that date. A church, a school, and eventually a convent were built at the townsite.
Ste. Agathe is located in the flood plain of the Red River and as such has always been prone to flood damage, but none was so severe or as notable as that experienced during the 1997 Red River Flood. The ring dike surrounding the town gave out in late April, causing the town to be inundated with over two metres of water. The village has recovered; a new dike has been built and an interpretive centre has been created on the west side of the community.
Ste. Agathe is in the provincial riding of Morris and the federal riding of Provencher.

Jehan Erart

Jehan Erart (or Erars) ("c".1200/10–1258/9) was a trouvère from Arras, particularly noted for his favouring the "pastourelle" genre. He has left behind eleven "pastourelles", ten "grand chants", and one "serventois". 
Erart's presence at Arras can be deduced from his own writings. He was patronised by the wealthy middle and upper classes. In his "serventois", a "complainte" on the death his patron Gherart Aniel, he asked Pierre and Wagon Wion to help him obtain the patronage of the bankers Henri and Robert Crespin. His relationship with two Arras trouvères is apparent in his lyrics, Guillaume le Vinier and Jehan Bretel. He is also mentioned in a work of Guibert Kaukesel, a canon of Arras. 
The chief characteristic of Erart's poetry is his preference for short lines, mostly penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octosyllabic, as opposed to the traditional decasyllable, which does occur in his "chansons" "Pré ne vergier ne boscaige foillu" and "Encoire sui cil ki a merchi s'atent" and his "serventois" "Nus chanters". Musically, Erart is syllabic, with a preference for major modes and refrains. His "chansons" are composed mainly in isometre, but his "pastourelles" are predominantly heterometric. His music is conservative and rarely exceeds a ninth in range. 
There are two death notices for Erart in the necrology of the Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras. One records a Jehans Erardi dying in 1258 while another records Jehan Erart dying in 1259. It is possible, when considering that his works are preserved in two different sections of the "Chansonnier du Roi", that there were two Jehan Erarts, but this is not likely. Three songs attributed to Jehan Erart in one manuscript probably belong to Raoul de Beauvais.

Dughlats

The Dughlat clan (Dulğat and Дулат in Kazakh language) was a Mongol ("Dolood/sevens, Doloo/seven; Middle Mongolian: Doluga, Dolugad") (later Turko-Mongol) clan that served the Chagatai khans as hereditary vassal rulers of the several cities of the western Tarim Basin from the 14th century until the 16th century. The most famous member of the clan, Mirza Muhammad Haidar, was a military adventurer, historian, and the ruler of Kashmir (1541–1551). His historical work, the "Tarikh-i Rashidi", provides much of the information known about the family.
History.
Early History.
The Dughlat tribe is mentioned as having supported Genghis Khan during his creation of the Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Rashid al-Din Hamadani identifies the Dughlad (Dughlat) as a minor tribe of the Mongols. At an early date the entire tribe moved out of Mongolia and eventually settled in the area comprising the "ulus" of Chagatai Khan.
In the mid-14th century the authority of the Chagatai khans underwent a sudden decline. In the western part of the khanate (specifically Transoxiana and the bordering provinces), the khans had become rulers in name only, with real power in the hands of the local Turko-Mongol amirs after 1346. In the eastern provinces (spec. the Tarim Basin and the area that was to become Moghulistan) the authority of the khans in Transoxiana was virtually nonexistent. As a result power there was in the hands of the local lords and tribal chiefs.
By this time the Dughlats had become one of the most eminent clans in the eastern regions. Chief among their holdings were the towns Aksu, Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan Their influence allowed them to select a Genghisid khan of their own choosing. In 1347, according to the "Tarikh-i Rashidi", the Dughlat Amir Bulaji raised a certain Tughlugh Timur to the khanship and recognized his authority. The new khan, despite owing his throne to the Dughlats, was a man of strong character and maintained effective control of Moghulistan. He also converted to Islam, an act that was copied by the Dughlats (one of whom, Amir Tulik, had been secretly converted even before the khan's adoption of the faith).
Qamar ud-Din.
Under Tughlugh Timur, both amirs Tuluk and Bulaji had held the office of "ulus beg". After the death of Bulaji the office was given to his son Khudaidad. This was contested by Bulaji's brother, Qamar ud-Din, who desired to be "ulus beg" himself. His request for the office to be transferred to him was refused by Tughlugh Timur; consequently after the latter's death Qamar ud-Din revolted against Tughlugh Timur's son Ilyas Khoja Khan. He was likely responsible for the death of Ilyas Khoja; most of the family members of Tughlugh Timur were also killed. Qamar ud-Din proclaimed himself khan (the only Dughlat ever to do so) and, although he did not gain the support of many of the amirs, managed to maintain his position in Moghulistan.
Qamar ud-Din's reign consisted of a series of wars with Timur, the amir of Transoxiana. Qamar ud-Din's forces unable to defeat Timur, but at the same time Timur was incapable of decisively defeating the Moghuls, who were able to retreat into the barren steppe country of Moghulistan. During a fresh invasion by Timur and his army in 1390, however, Qamar ud-Din disappeared. His disappearance enabled a Chagatayid, Khizr Khoja, to gain control of Moghulistan.
The Dughlats in the 15th century.
Qamar ud-Din's disappearance had left his nephew Khudaidad the senior member of the Dughlat family. According to the "Tarikh-i Rashidi", Khudaidad had been an early supporter of Khizr Khoja and had hid him from Qamar ud-Din during the latter's purge of members of the house of Chagatai. Khudaidad's power rapidly increased and he became a king-maker in the years after Khizr Khoja's death. He also divided Aksu, Khotan, and Kashgar and Yarkand amongst his family members; this division of territory lasted until the time of Mirza Aba Bakr.
Khudaidad eventually left the service of the Moghul khans; this did not preclude the other Dughlats from maintaining good relations with them. During the 15th century, Kashgar was recovered after it was temporarily seized by Timur's grandson Ulugh Beg; on the other hand, Aksu was given over to the Moghul khans.
Dughlat clan of Kazakhs.
Now, the Dughlat (Dulat or Дулат in Kazakh language) is one of the major tribe of modern Kazakh people, they belong to Senior-Juz of Kazakhs, mainly inhabited in the east and southern parts of Kazakhstan such as Almaty Oblysy and Jetysu region of Kazakhstan, with a population of approximately 700,000 among Kazakhs (see the Dughlat tribe of Kazakh people - from Wikipedia Dughlat introduction in Kazakh language). The Duglats sub-clans are Botpay, Shymyr, Sikymy, Zhanys and Eskeldy (see the brief introduction of Dulats).
The most recently Y-DNA tests which investigated by KZ DNA Project in Kazakhstan shows that the Y-DNA haplogroup of Dughlat tribe of Kazakhs carries C3 haplogroups see KZ DNA Project.
The international ports of Dulat (Dulata Kouan - 都拉塔口岸 in Chinese) in the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of China was named after with the Dughlats, because of the historical inhabitant of Dughlats clans in this area in the past, the ports of Dulat was opened in 2003 with the agreement of governments of both Kazakhstan and China.
Mirza Aba Bakr.
Mirza Aba Bakr, the great-great-grandson of Khudaidad, built up an independent kingdom for himself in the last decades of the 15th century. Beginning with the seizure of Yarkand, which was henceforth his capital, he conquered Khotan and Kashgar from other members of his family and defied numerous attempts by the Moghul khans to force him into submission. By the beginning of the 16th century he was also conducting raids into Ferghana, Badakshan and Ladakh. Near the end of his reign he even managed to plunder Aksu, which was still held by the Moghuls. In 1514 his forces were defeated by the Moghul Sultan Said Khan, compelling him to flee. This marked the end of Dughlat control over the western Tarim Basin cities, which were in the hands of the Moghul khans until they were conquered by the Dzungars in the late 17th century.
Mirza Muhammad Haidar.
Mirza Muhammad Haidar was the nephew of Mirza Aba Bakr. He was the son of Muhammad Husain Kurkan, who had married into the family of the Moghul khans and had spent his life alternating between serving the Moghuls, the Timurid Babur and the Shaybanid Uzbeks. Mirza Haidar himself entered the service of Sultan Said Khan just before the latter's conquest of Mirza Aba Bakr's kingdom. During the khan's lifetime he conducted a holy war in Ladakh on his behalf. After Sultan Said Khan's death in 1533 his son Abdur Rashid Khan executed Mirza Haidar's uncle; fearing the same fate, Mirza Haidar fled to the Mughal Emperor Humayun in northern India. It was in the service of the emperor that he undertook the conquest of Kashmir in 1541. Mirza Haidar was more or less able to retain his position as ruler of Kashmir for ten years, during which he wrote the "Tarikh-i Rashidi". His reign in Kashmir ended in 1551 when he was killed while fighting against a revolt.

History.
Bijo is one of the ancient village of Azerbaijan. Although its history has not yet been investigated properly, the obvious evidence inform us the ancient and rich culture of Bijo.
Etimology of the name "Bijo".
Some sources indicates the name of village as "Bijoy" or "Bija". During the Tsar Russian and most part of the Soviet empires periods it has been mainly called as "Bijov" or "Bidzov".
Though it would not be realistic to strict upon one of the versions about the etimology of "Bojo", the two of them are grounded on more reliable sources as well as reasonable explanation methods:

Quality of service experience

Quality of Service Experience (QoSE), used mainly in the field of telecommunications, is the actual measure of user’s experience with an operator in terms of delivered quality with or without reference to what is being promised. This is measured technically and not subjective. So it is different from Quality of Experience, sometimes also known as "Quality of User Experience," which is a subjective measure of a user's experiences with an operator.
QoSE also differs from Quality of Service (QoS) which, in the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, refers to resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.
The term Quality of Service Experience (QoSE) was first used by LIRNEasia. The project involved benchmarking the ten most widely used broadband packages in India and Sri Lanka.
LIRNEasia's project on Broadband QoSE Benchmarking.
In the absence of an efficient pro-market regulatory environment, it has become common for some operators to offer lower bandwidth than stipulated. This practice is often justified by the partially true claim that the bottleneck can happen anywhere between the user and the destination site, so may not necessarily within the control of the local operator. Ordinary user, possessing neither the equipment nor the technical knowledge to ascertain or deny that usually has no alternative than taking the word of the operator.
Broadband performance can be evaluated by conducting speed tests. Test sites provide a variety of information about the speed of a link. A meticulous design of tests can illustrate not just the performance in each case but the exact segment where the bottleneck happens. The tests can also be the basis for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the operators and users. SLAs ensure the users receiving promised bandwidth or compensation in case of a failure from the operator’s part.
The following were the QoSE parameters measured from the user end:
Download speed (kbit/s): One of the key advertised metrics in broadband services in the download speed, how much traffic a subscriber can receive to the maximum.
Upload Speed (kbit/s): This metrics define the speed in which the subscriber can send traffic to Internet. Plays a significant role in responsiveness and real-time applications like VOIP.
Round Trip Time (milli-sec): Time taken for the traffic to reach a particular destination and return. This is significant in systems that require two-way interactive communication, such as voice telephony, or online games.
Jitter (milli-sec): Jitter is the variation of end-to-end delay from one packet to the next within the same packet stream/connection/flow. Jitter experienced by the packets, more relevant for Real-time traffic like VOIP.
Packet-Loss (in percentage terms): Number of packets (in percentage terms) which doesn’t reach the destination. This can result in highly noticeable performance issues with Streaming Technologies, VOIP and Video conferencing.
Availability (in percentage terms): This measures the number of times we are able to access the Broadband services. If T attempts are made to connect to the Internet, and if F times the attempt failed, then Availability = (1–F/T) x 100
Online Testing Efforts.
Researchers at the University of New South Wales have created a Java-based online Quality of Service Experience test which attempts to measure the performance of QoSE parameters measured from the user connection perspective. 
The test measures several of the QoSE parameters above, in addition to real-world services such as HTTP performance to a diverse set of locations. 
By utilizing user feedback on each test, they are investigating co-relations between each QoSE parameter and the user's rated Quality of Service Experience.

Agsu (city)

Agsu (also, Ağsu, Aghsu, Akhsu and Aksu) is a city in and capital of the Agsu Rayon of Azerbaijan.
History.
A. A. Bakikhanov noted that Nadir Shah issued an order for resettlement of the inhabitants of Shamakhi to new laid down city on the bank of Agsu River, in 1735.
At present, the name of Agsu city (which is the centre of Agsu district) is shown as New Shamakhi in some sources. It is related with resettlement of the inhabitants of Shamakhi to Agsu city. Since that time, historic Shamakhi has been called Old Shamakhi, Agsu – New Shamakhi.
The name of the city existing in 18th century was frequently shown as Agsu deriving from "Agsuchay".
"Ruined city" – ruins of the Agsu city of the memory of 18th century is located in the north of Agsu city.
S. Bronevski noted that the city was fenced with fortress walls. Castle had quadrangle and round towers. There was dug a trench in front of fortress walls. Lower part of dwelling building consisted of basements. Upper part of dwelling building tumbled down onto the basements. These holes are the remainders of the basements. Dwelling buildings were erected very close to each others. Streets were narrow, transport with wagons were not possible. Undoubtedly, central streets comparatively were wide.
Earthenware of the Middle Ages and a coin minted named after Surkhay Khan were found in Agsu city. The coin had been minted before Nadir Shah's order about laying out the city. But it raises the probability of creation of Agsu city on base of Agsu village.
At the same time, materials and ceramic goods belonging to 100–150 years before occupation of Shamakhi by Nadir Shah were found during initial researches in "Ruined city". Perhaps, Nadir Shah had issued an order for realization of additional works after resettlement of the inhabitants in the village.
Agsu city had durable fortress walls, defensive towers in 18th century. The city had gradually developed and it had become one of the largest cities of Azerbaijan in the end of 18th century. V. Leviatov noted that when population of New Shamakhi (Agsu) had reached nearly 10 thousand, population of Gandja, Ardabil, Shusha, Nukha, Baku and other cities had not been over 3-8 thousand.
Agsu city is the one of the important cities leading in social-political and military life of Azerbaijan in the end of Middle Ages.
In 1734, Nadir Shah attacked Shamakhi with his troop. The inhabitants of Shamakhi resisted against the attack, notwithstanding Surkhay khan had left the city. In August 1734, Nadir Shah's troop overcame the resistance and the city was burnt. In 1735, Nadir Shah issued an order about laying out the new city on the bank of Agsuchay River. After construction of the new city, the inhabitants of Shamakhi were resettled here; residences of rulers of Shamakhi also were removed here.
In 1743, inhabitants rebelled against the Nadir Shah's yoke. Liar princes of Safaviler – I, II, III Sam Mirzas came out. Two of them operated in Shirvan.
I Sam Mirza occupied New Shamakhi (Agsu) to the accompaniment of Surkhay Khan's troop of fifty thousand. He revoked taxes imposed by Nadir Shah. But, I Sam Mirza was killed in the war by the son of Nadir Shah Nasrullah Mirza.
II Sam Mirza made a great rebellion in Shirvan together with Mohammad (the son of Surkhay), in 1743. People of Agsu banished Iranian officials from the city. But, despite of three defeats, Nasrullah occupied Agsu castle. Based on source, Persians encircled the city. The city was occupied after some days later and people were killed. Nadir Shah had called this day "Allah dad" (God, help me).
There were organized independent khanates after the death of Nadir Shah (1747). The one of the khanates was Shirvan (1747–1763) which its supremacy was diarchy.
At this time, feudal lords struggled against each other in Azerbaijan, in 1755, Khan of Shaki Hazhi Chalabi Khan encircled Agsu city under existing conditions. Hazhi Chalabi Khan retreated after grievous loss in the war around Agsu. Hussein Ali Khan went back to his khanate, notwithstanding Hazhi Mohammad Ali Khan had given the key of the city to him.
In 1762, Transcaucasia was shrouded in plague.
In 1763, Agsu and Shamakhi were amalgamated. Mohammad Said Khan and Agasi Khan occupied Agsu, and then killed Hazhi Mohammad Ali Khan. The capital was moved from Agsu to Shamakhi.
In 1767, Fatali Khan (Khan of khanate Guba) and Hussein Khan (Khan of khanate Shaki) joined and encircled together to Shamakhi from two sides. But Mohammad Said Khan and Agasi Khan were not able to resist. Consequently, the capital was removed to Agsu. Sardar and Hassan estates of Shirvan were amalgamated to khanate Shaki, remained estates were amalgamated to khanate Guba.
In 1769, Agsu city was ruined by the troop of Fatali khan (khan of khanate Guba), the inhabitants were removed to Shamakhi. Based on sources, all inhabitants were settled down in Shamakhi in a brief time. S. Gmelin noted that when he was in Agsu he could not find anything except destroyed buildings.
Based on written information of travelers M. Biberstein, S. Bronevski and others, some streets remained deserted when Fatali Khan forced the inhabitants to deportation.
Agsu city was exposed to attacks the next years. Especially, when Aga Mohammad Shah Gajar's marched to Azerbaijan, the survived inhabitants immigrated to Guba and other regions, non-survived were annihilated. So, Agsu city which was founded by Nadir Shah, was decayed by Aga Mohammad Shah Gajar.
Agsu city was repeatedly exposed to feudal attacks in 18th century. Frequent deportation, destructions made the inhabitants disappointed in living in the city. Therefore, the inhabitants did not prepare to construct glamorous buildings, tombs, mosques, bathrooms, social and official buildings.
In 1967, Agsu was entitled with city-type settlement status, in the same year it was entitled with city status.
Agsu has been operated as administrative-territorial district since October 8, 1943.

Madame Sans-Gêne (opera)

Madame Sans-Gêne is an opera in three acts by Umberto Giordano. The libretto was taken from Victorien Sardou and Emile Moreau's play, adapted for the opera by Renato Simoni.
Performance history.
Its première took place at the Metropolitan Opera on 25 January 1915, conducted by Arturo Toscanini with Geraldine Farrar in the title role, Giovanni Martinelli, and Pasquale Amato. This was followed by a performance in Turin under Ettore Panizza with Farneti, Grassi and Riccardo Stracciari on 28 February 1915.
Synopsis.
Act 1.
"Paris. 10 August 1792, the day of the capture of the Tuileries during the French Revolution"
There is a squabble in the laundry of Caterina Hubscher, a beautiful Alsacian girl, a very free and easy mannered woman whom everyone calls "Madame Sans-Gêne" (Madame Carefree). One of her customers is Fouché (later Minister of Police under Napoleon), whom Caterina dislikes; another, a quiet young officer who lives nearby, is Napoleon himself. As Caterina is about to close her laundry, a wounded Austrian officer arrives and asks for her help, Caterina hides him in her room. The officer turns out to be the Count of Neipperg. Sergeant Lefebvre, Caterina's fiancé, arrives with more soldiers and is suspicious when he sees the doors closed. He discovers Neipperg but tells his men that there is no one in the room, and to leave. Once alone with Caterina, he helps her to assist the Count.
Act 2.
"The castle of Compiègne. September 1811"
Napoléon is at the height of his career. Lefebvre has distinguished himself in many battles, and has become a Marshal of France. For his success in the siege of Danzig, Napoléon has made him Duke of Danzig. Caterina, the former laundress, is his wife of many years, and now a duchess, but her demeanor has not changed and causes scandals in court. The Emperor orders Lefebvre to divorce Caterina and find a more suitable wife. Lefebvre and Caterina are desperate and also worried about their friend Neipperg, who is suspected by the Emperor of an affair with the Empress Marie-Louise. During a reception, Caterina makes a series of gaffes and gets into a fight with the Emperor's sisters, and the butler announces that the Emperor wishes to see her.
Act 3.
Napoléon orders Caterina to divorce her husband and to retire from a life that is not suitable for her. Caterina, however, reminisces about the days when she was a laundress, and he only a young officer, and he is moved even though she also reminds him that he still owes her 60 francs for washing. Then Count Neipperg is caught entering the Empress's chambers. Napoléon is furious. He degrades Neipperg from an officer to a common soldier, and orders his immediate execution. Caterina intervenes: she reveals that Neipperg is innocent and he is forgiven. To the astonishment of everyone, the Duchess of Danzig appears in the salon on the arm of the Emperor, to engage in a hunt.

Job guarantee

A job guarantee (JG) is an economic policy proposal aimed at providing a sustainable solution to the dual problems of inflation and unemployment. Its aim is to create full employment and price stability. It is related to the concept of employer of last resort (ELR).
The economic policy stance currently dominant around the world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy carried out by the monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of "employed" people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation "without" the social costs of unemployment, hence (it is argued) fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.
Conception.
The job guarantee proposal is particularly associated with certain post-Keynesian economists, particularly at the Centre of Full Employment and Equity (CofFEE) at the University of Newcastle, Australia and at the Kansas City School of economists and the Center for Full Employment and Price Stability, both of the University of Missouri – Kansas City.
JG draws from a social justice tradition of right to work, such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the US Employment Act of 1946, and an early form was proposed by Hyman Minsky.
The JG proposal was conceived independently by Mitchell (1998) and Mosler (1997–98). It has since been developed further by authors, including Wray (1998) and a comprehensive treatment of it appears in Mitchell and Muysken (2008).
Overview.
The JG is based on a buffer stock principle whereby the public sector offers a fixed wage job to anyone willing and able to work thereby establishing and maintaining a buffer stock of employed workers. This buffer stock expands when private sector activity declines, and declines when private sector activity expands, much like today's unemployed buffer stocks.
The JG thus fulfils an absorption function to minimise the real costs associated with the flux of the private sector. When private sector employment declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So in a recession, the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate aggregate demand and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an automatic stabilizer controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national minimum wage. To avoid disturbing the private sector wage structure and to ensure the JG is consistent with price stability, the JG wage rate should probably be set at (or slightly below) the current legal minimum wage.
Under the JG, people of working age who are not in full-time education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and underemployment with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer the indignity and insecurity of underemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.
Income support.
A range of income support arrangements, including a generic work-tested benefit payment, would also be available to unemployed people, depending on their circumstances, as an initial subsistence income while arrangements are made to employ them. This would rarely be necessary once the system was well established, because in most circumstances JG jobs would be immediately available and offered instead of income support.
Inflation control.
The fixed JG wage provides an in-built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called the ratio of JG employment to total employment the "buffer employment ratio" (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. The BER that results in stable inflation is called the "non-accelerating-inflation-buffer employment ratio" (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent on a range of factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reigning in any private wage-price pressures.
No relative wage effects.
The JG introduces no relative wage effects and the rising demand "per se" does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire of the private sector (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today’s demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase capacity utilisation to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any demand-pull inflation it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand will stimulate private sector employment growth while reducing JG employment and spending. However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.
Wage bargaining.
While the JG policy frees wage bargaining from the general threat of unemployment, several factors offset this:
Comparison with other policies.
Keynesianism.
A crucial point is that the JG does not rely on the government spending at market prices and then exploiting multipliers to achieve full employment which characterizes traditional Keynesian aggregate demand management. The JG program differs in that it "would be targeted directly to households. It is a genuine bottom-up approach to economic recovery. It is a program that stabilizes the incomes and purchasing power of individuals at the bottom of the income distribution that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity. Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations. A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flows and earnings. Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability".
Full employability.
The JG seeks to reorient labour market policy away from the current OECD emphasis on full employability whereby governments engage in programs to prepare the unemployed for work without guaranteeing that work will be available towards a focus on creating enough work. The full employability agenda has come under fire from a number of sources in recent years (see, for example ILO, 2004).
Workfare.
In countries with a minimum wage, the Job Guarantee would provide a regular job with a minimum wage, which is not the case in some workfare schemes. Workfare schemes tend not to cover all of the unemployed.
Implementation.
There are now several countries which have implemented direct job creation schemes to counter the major problems associated with persistent unemployment. For example, the Argentine government introduced the "Jefes de Hogar" (Heads of Households) program in 2001 to combat the social malaise that followed the financial crisis in that year.
Similarly, the Indian Government introduced in 2005 a five-year plan called the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) to bridge the vast rural-urban income disparities inequality that have emerged as India’s information technology and service sector has boomed. Hard-labour jobs that produce almost no outcomes are given to desperate rural citizens for $1.50/day.
Finally, the South African government has introduced the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) to overcome the extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country. The programs run against the full employability tide because they recognise that the solution to joblessness and the poverty that this brings is in the provision of employment opportunities rather than a focus on the victims. They also recognise that the state (whether at the level of federal or local government) has a major role to play in providing for employment guarantees.
Programs enacted but not implemented.
In the United States, the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 allows the government to create a "reservoir of public employment" in case private enterprise does not provide sufficient jobs. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector. However, the act did not establish such a reservoir (it only "authorized" it), and no such program has been implemented in the United States, though the unemployment rate has generally been above the rate (3%) targeted by the act.
Unrelated programs.
In 2011, the Institute for Public Policy Research, a UK think tank associated with the Labour Party, advocated a job creation program - with compulsory takeup, on pain of loss of benefits - for the long-term unemployed only. The related Community Action Programme has been sharply criticized by one of the developers of the Job Guarantee.

Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras

The Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras was a fraternity of "jongleurs" founded in Arras in or around 1175. As its name implies, it was intended for "jongleurs" (not just trouvères) and the bourgeoisie, not just the knightly class. It also did not hold poetic contests. In these ways it was distinct from the Puy d'Arras.
The foundation of the Confrérie is enshrined in legend, according to which two debating "jongleurs", unable to settle their differences, were approached by the Virgin Mary, who sent them to Arras, which was under the curse of the plague. There they were to adjudicate their dispute before the bishop in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. Once there, the Virgin again appeared and handed them a candle, the "sainte chandelle" of tradition, the melted wax from which, mingled with water, was found to heal the wounds of those afflicted with the plague, 144 that first night. In gratitude and out of praise, the "jongleurs" founded a "confrérie" to safeguard the candle and celebrate the religious feasts. Shortly thereafter, and quite historically, a tower was built to house the candle, which generated a sizeable profit from pilgrims.
The Confrérie was, at the beginning, a lay religious institute. Its statutes provided for last rites, funeral services for deceased members, and a common supply of food for poorer members. Open to both men and women, it functioned through membership fees and annual dues. Members had also to swear an oath, after which they could participate in the election of the head "confrére" and his officers, who monitored members' activities to ensure compliance with the statutes.
The most important document for the history of the Confrérie is the necrology that records the deaths of members from 1194 to 1361. Adam de la Halle and Jehan Erart were members.

Soldier Boys

Soldier Boys is a 2001 novel by writer Dean Hughes. The story is set during World War II and tells the story of two teenagers, one American, the other German, who join their respective armies and fight at the Battle of the Bulge to show their parents that they can do it. Both the boy's families are saddened by their leaving, and have many things in common. Both have a playful little brother and some sisters, as well as concerned parents.
Main characters.
Spencer Morgan, 16 years old, drops out of his Utah high school to begin training as a paratrooper. He's seen how boys who weren't much in high school can come home heroes, and Spence wants to prove to his friends and family that he really can be something.
Fifteen-year-old Dieter Hedrick's blind devotion sees him promoted from the Hitler Youth into the German Army. Dieter is determined to prove his bravery and patriotism at all costs.
Setting.
The story takes place in two totally different areas of the world, A Hitler youth training camp, and a U.S. paratrooper training camp.
Plot summary.
Dieter Hedrick, once a small and timid person, over time becomes a member of an anti-aircraft gun battery that scores at least one kill during Allied bombing raids. Moving steadily higher in rank in the Hitler Youth, Dieter is promoted to lead a group of 180 boys, who are part of the enormous project to build the "Westwall" (Siegfried Line) before the Allies arrive. Two fellow HJ's are less fortunate: Ernst Gessel is killed when a British Spitfire strafes the site, and Willi Hoffmann is shot for attempting to desert. Dieter proves himself to be a capable leader, and he, along with a few other HJ leaders meet Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer and are decorated for their contributions to the German war effort. 
Dieter is anxious to fight and, following other senior HJ's, goes into the Wehrmacht. Assigned to a unit that is demoralized and badly understrength, Dieter meets Schaefer, a weary soldier whose cynical attitude contrasts sharply with Dieter's blind, fiery patriotism. Schaefer had a son, an HJ, who was killed while manning an AA gun in an Allied bombing raid and has seen far more of the war than Dieter, being a veteran of Stalingrad. He constantly criticizes Dieter's blind devotion to Hitler, truthfully saying that the war is lost for Germany and that surrendering is the best thing any German soldier can hope for. Despite their constant arguing, Dieter gradually begins to form a father-son relationship with Schaefer.
Spence and Dieter are both sent into Battle of the Bulge. When both boys kill their first enemy, they react differently. Dieter is proud to have killed an enemy of Germany, while Spence is far less enthusiastic.
As fighting continues, both sides' suffer losses. Ted and half of Spence's company are killed after being ambushed by German tanks and infantry. Later, Dieter boasts of having shot several of the American infantry, while Schaefer reveals having deliberately aimed beneath them. Overnight, the Americans bring up reinforcements, with the result that when the Germans attack them again the next day, they are going up against a force much stronger than they expected. Dieter charges up the hill, making it farther than anyone else, but is shot several times and is left by the surviving men of his unit as they retreat. Schaefer is killed but Dieter, unaware of this, begins to call for him with increasing desperation as the night goes on. A group of German medics attempt to retrieve Dieter, but retreat after one of their number is shot by a young GI. Spence, against orders from his squad leader, decides to crawl out onto the open ground where the Germans lost in the charge had fallen. Dieter, realizing an American has reached him, initially tries to push Spence away and cannot understand Spence asking him where he is wounded, or telling Dieter he is there to help. Spence persists, however, and uses equipment carried by the dead German medic to bandage Dieter's wounds. Dieter gradually calms down, and having become somewhat delusional, is partially convinced Schaefer has at last returned to save him.
As Spence tries to get Dieter back to his own lines so he can reach medics, he is shot by German medics, who have returned for Dieter once more and this time are taking no chances. Fatally wounded, Spence soon dies on the hill. Taken to a field hospital, Dieter learns what happened to him, the American who helped him, and Schaefer. As Dieter and a sergeant from his unit await transfer from the front lines to undergo surgery, Dieter's blind patriotism begins to fade. Unable to ignore the significance of what Spence, an enemy, did for him, Dieter realizes he will think about Spence for the rest of his life.
Back in the United States, a funeral is held for Spence, and a letter arrives for his parents from Sergeant Pappas, Spence's squad leader. Learning that their son gave up his life to save a German, the Morgans decide against revealing this to friends and relatives, since hatred for Germans is running high. But they remember, Spence's promise that he would not take any chances in the war - a promise he ultimately kept.

Bayil

Bayil (; also known as Bayilov, Bailovo, and Bayilovo) is a settlement in Baku, Azerbaijan.
Geography.
In March 2000, a major landslide in the Bayil slope destroyed dozens of shops, apartments and gas stations. The slope in later years also experienced few minor landslides which led Baku City Administration to examine the area and make a final decision on razing houses in this territory. 
The most neighborhoods are largely composed of block after block of picturesque rowhouses and a few mansions.
History.
Foundation.
In 1235, Shirvanshah Fariburzom III on one of the Bayil Bay has been constructed building, later named Sabayil Castle. The area also called "Shahri Saba", "Shahri nau", underwater city, a caravanserai and "Bayil stones". 
In 1858, Marine Administration of Russian Empire began construction of municipality on local admiralty's drafts. On 6 May 1868 in Cape Bayil, in the presence of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, was founded five-domed church. 
The first residential areas in the Bayil formed along the pilgrimage road passes on Bayil cape and leading to the Bibi-Heybat Mosque. Development of the Black City and the discovery of oilfields in the Bibiheybət stimulated the expansion of Bayil in the direction of Baku.
By the late 19th century, residential part of the occupied steep slopes and developed in the direction of the city, which went beyond the boundaries of their land and merged with the surrounding areas, with the center Bayil was kept in the Baku International Sea Trade Port area. 
Despite the extensive construction in the direction of Baku and economic relationship with the capital, Bayil until 1912 remained legally independent maritime province.
In 1900, Leonid Krasin arrived to the Bayil at the invitation of the Robert Classon. He became deputy head of the construction of the Bayil Thermal power station and controlled it after completion of construction until 1904.
Modern period.
In 2010, restoration works are held at the Bayil stadium with 3000 attendance after Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan's proposal to increase popularity in Baku.
In 2011, government unveiled restored Gafur Mammadov park on Victory Day.
Landmarks.
Most visitors get their first glimpse of the neighborhood when visiting the area's best known cultural attraction, National Flag Square. Confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records, the flag flies on a pole 162 meters high and measures 70 by 35 meters which makes it the world's highest flag. Baku Crystal Hall, which hosted Eurovision Song Contest 2012, is located next to it.
The development of the area replaced, another famous landmark, Bayil prison - one of USSR's strictest prisons and the same prison in which Joseph Stalin was kept in the early years of the 20th century because of his criminal activities in Baku, organizing oil worker strikes. 
The area also contains main naval base of Azerbaijani Navy.

Fort Umpqua

Fort Umpqua was a trading post built by the Hudson's Bay Company in the company's Columbia District (or Oregon Country), in what is now the U.S. state of Oregon. It was first established in 1832 and moved and rebuilt in 1836.
Fort Umpqua was first established in 1832 at the confluence of Calapooya Creek and the Umpqua River. In 1836 it was moved and rebuilt on the south bank of the Umpqua River near the mouth of Elk Creek, at present-day Elkton, Oregon. The fort was intended to serve company's fur trade operations along the Umpqua River, Rogue River, and Klamath River.
The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Fort Umpqua in 1841.
On November 15, 1851, a fire destroyed Fort Umpqua. In 1854 the post was closed for good.
Second Fort Umpqua.
Another Fort Umpqua was established later, in 1856 at the end of the 1855–1856 Rogue River War. It was located on the north bank of the Umpqua River about two miles from its mouth, near Gardiner, Oregon. Its structures including a blockhouse and barracks was built from salvaged material from Fort Orford. Troops from the District of California continued to be stationed here until conflict with Native American tribes subsided. The fort was abandoned in 1862. The old blockhouse and soldiers' barracks were later moved into town as a memorial.

It is an unofficial township built up in the 1980s by rural migrants and refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh. There is oil there, and oil wells, on the land occupied by residents, ownership being claimed by "Binagadi Oil", which is, in turn, owned by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) and the Company "Global Energy Azerbaijan" which is registered in the Virgin Islands. Attempts by the oil company to evict squatters and demolish illegal construction have been controversial with residents strongly contesting the oil companies claims. It was reported that on April 17, 2012 a mob of local residents attacked oil company employees demolishing houses and that the employees, in turn, severely beat a local Azeri reporter, Idrak Abbasov, while he was filming the incident.

Barbara Erni

Barbara Erni (15 February 1743 – 26 February 1785) was a Liechtenstein woman known for stealing from inns throughout western Europe using a confidence trick. Known in Liechtenstein legend as Golden Boos, Erni was the last person to be executed by Liechtenstein.
Erni was born in Feldkirch to a homeless couple. In 1779, she married Tiroler Franz, a man with a reputation for criminal behaviour.
According to the legend, the Golden Boos was a woman with red-blond hair and great strength who travelled throughout the European countryside with a large treasure chest or backpack. Wherever she rested for the night, she would demand that her chest be locked in the best and most secure room available, since she claimed it contained a fabulous treasure. Once the treasure was locked away and night fell, a small man would emerge from the chest or backpack and would gather the valuables from the best room, after which Erni and the man would flee during the night. The scheme worked well for Erni for a number of years, and she became wealthy. The identity of the male assistant is unknown.
Erni and her male accomplice were arrested at Eschen and imprisoned at Vaduz on 27 May 1784. She was tried by Liechtenstein, and she admitted to seventeen thefts using the confidence trick. On 7 December 1784, the court found Erni guilty of being the Golden Boos and sentenced her to death by beheading. She was beheaded in Vaduz before a public audience of approximately 1000 spectators. The fate of the male assistant is unknown.
No one was executed again by Liechtenstein before it abolished the death penalty in 1987.

Near the end of the 2012 season, Pennington had started playing second base after the Athletics acquired Stephen Drew from the Arizona Diamondbacks to play every day shortstop, also due to the demotion of second baseman Jemile Weeks.

Lou Sleater

Louis Mortimer Sleater (September 8, 1926 – March 25, 2013) was a left-handed Major League Baseball pitcher who played from 1950 to 1952 and from 1955 to 1958 for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, Kansas City Athletics, Milwaukee Braves, Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles. He was 5’10” and he weighed 185 pounds. He attended the University of Maryland.
A knuckleball specialist, Sleater was signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Braves in 1946. Before the 1947 season, the Braves released him and he was signed by the Chicago Cubs. Before the 1949 season, the New York Giants purchased him from the Cubs. On April 1, 1950, the Browns selected him off waivers from the Giants. Even before reaching the big leagues, Sleater was a well-traveled player.
He made his big league debut with the Browns on April 25, 1950, at the age of 23. In his first game, he pitched one inning, striking out a batter and allowing no hits, no walks, and no runs. That would be his only major league game in 1950.
Pitching for the 52-102 Browns in 1951, Sleater went 1-9 with a 5.11 ERA. In 81 innings, he walked 53 batters and struck out only 33, while allowing 88 hits. His five hit batsmen were ninth most in the league. On July 31 of that year, he was either purchased by the New York Yankees or traded to them. One source (lists him as being purchased, while another source ([http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Lou_Sleater_1926&page=chronology) says he was traded with Bobby Hogue, Kermit Wahl and Tom Upton for Cliff Mapes. Either way, he never pitched for the Yankees, as he was returned to the Browns on September 16.
He began the 1952 season with the Browns, but lasted only four games, going 0-1 with a 7.27 ERA. On May 12, he was traded with Fred Marsh to the Senators for Cass Michaels. He finished the season with the Senators, going 4-2 with a 3.63 ERA in 57 innings. Overall, Sleater went 4-3 with a 4.11 ERA in 1952. 1952 is notable for Sleater because he halted Walt Dropo’s big league record streak of reaching base via hit in 12 straight at-bats that season (he had allowed his 12th hit earlier in the game).
Sleater did not play in the big leagues from 1953 to 1954. In May 1954, Sleater was purchased by the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He was purchased by the Yankees from Toronto on October 16, 1954. Once again, he would be in the Yankees organization, but would not play for the major league team, because he was purchased by the Athletics from the Yankees on April 28, 1955. He found his way back to the major leagues in 1955, going 1-1 with a 7.71 ERA in 16 games (one start). In 25 innings, he walked 21 batters and struck out only 11.
On November 27, 1955, Sleater was drafted by the Braves from the Athletics in the Rule 5 draft. He played 25 games for the Braves in 1956, 2-2 with a 3.15 ERA in 45 innings of work. He was released by the Braves on April 11, 1957. Later that month, he was signed by the Tigers. He made 41 relief appearances for the Tigers in 1957, going 3-3 with a 3.76 ERA. On May 30 of that year, he hit a game ending home run, to become one of ten pitchers to accomplish that feat since the 1957 season. Baseball Reference – Walk-off win: pitchers who hit a walk-off homer</ref>
Sleater played his final season in 1958. He started the year with the Tigers, but after posting a 6.75 ERA in four games with them he was purchased by the Orioles on June 2. He appeared in six games with the Orioles, going 1-0 with a 12.86 ERA. Overall, Sleater went 1-0 with a 10.22 ERA in 10 relief appearances. He played his final major league game on September 28, and was released by the Orioles on October 16, 1959.
Sleater played for a total of six major league teams in his seven year career. Overall, Sleater went 12-18 with a 4.70 ERA. Of the 131 games he pitched, he started 21 of them. In 300 innings, he allowed 306 hits, 172 walks and he struck out only 152 batters. He was a solid batter, hitting .204 in 103 career at-bats. He hit four career home runs – including three in 1957 – and he struck out only 11 times. He was a lackluster fielding, with a fielding percentage of only .906.
He also played for 12 different minor league teams, winning 12 or more games three times in a season [http://books.google.com/books?id=kp7tXc3X0WAC&pg=PA206&dq=%22Lou+SleateR%22&sig=ACfU3U1exOVbd5cyeJPrQnG9O9Ji4UGBzw#PPA205,M1]).

Fanjunkare

Fanjunkare (previously "Styckjunkare" in the Artillery), is a Swedish military rank above Förste Sergeant and below Förvaltare.
The word 'Fanjunkare' is derived from German 'Fahnenjunker', and denotes a standard-bearer, hence 'Colour Sergeant'. 'Styckjunkare' comes from German 'Stückjunker', and denotes a gentleman of ordnance, hence 'Master Gunner'.
History.
1806.
Established as a brevet rank for non-commissioned officers.
1833.
Became the highest non-commissioned rank in the Swedish allotment army.
1837.
Became the highest non-commissioned rank in the Swedish enlisted army.
1925.
"Fanjunkare" was given relative rank above "Fänrik" (Second Lieutenant) and below "Löjtnant" (Lieutenant) but remained in the NCO Corps.
1960.
The rise of the status of the professional rank:
Holders of the rank served as platoon and company leaders in the war-time organization and as deputy leaders or leaders of conscript training platoons during peace time, thus having the same positions as company grade officers. However other non-professional holders of the rank kept their much lower positions as company sergeant majors, etc. This major discrepancy caused a great deal of confusion.
Change of personnel structure 1972.
Prior to 1972, military personnel were divided into three categories "Underbefäl" (non-commissioned officers), "Underofficerare" (warrant officers) and "Officerare" (commissioned officers).
The "Underbefäl" category was split into two categories 
The "Underofficer" category was renamed kompaniofficerare:
The "Officer" category was renamed regementsofficerare: 
Change of personnel structure 1983.
All three corps were merged into one professional officer corps with the lowest rank set to fänrik. Furir, överfurir, sergeant and fanjunkare were removed as a professional ranks. Fanjunkare were given the rank of löjtnant, and sergeant fänrik.
New two-career-path system 2009.
After the implementation of two-career-paths systems for officers 2008, this rank may again become a professional rank within the newly created “specialist officer” category. The intention of the new system is to better align Swedish military forces with that of Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Britain as well as increasing the skills of leaders of team, squad, platoon level units. It is a partly rollback to the system that existed prior the implementation of the one career path system 1983.

<doc id="18838943" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18838943" title="Catch the Hare">
Catch the Hare

Catch the Hare is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Europe, and perhaps specifically from Spain. It is a hunt game, and since it uses an Alquerque board, it is specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). In some variants, some or all of the diagonal lines are missing which makes it difficult to classify as a tiger game in general. In all variants, one hare is going up against twelve hunters or hounds. The hare is the "tiger" in this hunt game. The hare is taking the ironic role as the predator and not the prey in this game. The hare can capture the hunters or hounds by leaping over them (short leap method). The hunters or hounds attempt to surround and trap the hare. 
The game is the earliest recorded hunt game in Europe, and perhaps even the first hunt game from Europe (other than Bear games and Hare games). The earliest record of the game is in Alfonso X's book of games in 1283. The record shows a game called cercar la liebre, a game played in Spain from the 13th. century until today. Cercar la liebre means "Catch the Hare". The Moors may have brought the game to Spain since it uses an Alquerque board, however, there is no record of the game or any similar game in Arabic literature. The game has spread to Central and North America thanks to the Spanish who brought it with them during their conquest. The game was transformed in name and structure by the American natives. The new names given were coyote and chickens, and Indian and jackrabbits which are things found in the Americas. Some of the diagonal lines of the Alquerque board were omitted, and in some cases completely removed which technically makes the game a non-tiger game. In one very interesting case, there was no piece to represent the hare on the board, and the hare was merely pointed at with a stick to indicate its position. Today, the game is still popular in Spain under the name juego de la liebre. 
Goal.
The hunters or hounds win if they surround and immobilize the hare.
The hare wins if it captures enough of the hunters or hounds such that they can not immobilize the hare. 
Equipment.
An Alquerque board is used. In one variant, the small diagonals are removed, but the long diagonals that cross the span of the Alquerque board remain. In yet another variant, all the diagonals are removed. In all cases, there is one hare which can be represented as a black piece, and twelve hunters or hounds represented as white pieces. Pieces are played on the intersection points of the board. 
Here-in-forth, the white pieces will simply be called the hunters.
Game Play and Rules.
1. Players decide what colors to play. Players alternate their turns. 
2. The hare is placed at the center of the board. The twelve hunters are place on the first two ranks of one side of the board, and two pieces are placed on the third rank specifically at the edge of the board. 
3. The hunters move first. 
4. Hare and hunters move alike. They move one space onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. Only one piece may be moved by each player per turn.
5. The hare can also capture by leaping over an adjacent hunter, and landing on a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. The hare can continue to leap over more hunters provided there exist exactly one vacant point in between the hunters, and a vacant point beyond the last hunter. The hare can stop leaping even when there are more hunters to capture. Captured pieces are removed from the board. Captures are not compulsory. Unlike the hare, the hunters can not capture.

History of Basilan

Basilan is an island province of the Philippines. It is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago and is located just off the southern coast of Zamboanga Peninsula. Its capital is Isabela City. Basilan is home to three main ethnic groups, the indigenous Yakans, and the later-arriving Tausugs and Chavacanos. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacanos are mainly Christian. There are also a number of smaller groups.
Etymology.
Oral traditions of the local Yakan people include several names for pre-historic Basilan: "Uleyan", which is derived from the present-named Basilan Peak (Puno Mahaji), and later changed to "Matangal" after a mountain farther to the east of the island. These names were presumably used by the Maguindanao traders from mainland Mindanao, utilizing these mountains as navigational landmarks when sailing the Celebes Sea. Other names romantically given were "Puh Gulangan" or "island of forests", "Umus Tambun" or "fertile land", "Kumalarang" after the westward flowing river on the island's western half which is also otherwise called Baunuh Peggesan.
Taguima.
Pre-Hispanic texts from the royal archives of the Sulu Sultanate referred to the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago as Taguima, from the Yakan who were called "Tagihamas" (people of the interior or hinterlands) by the Tausug and Samal peoples who came and settled in numerous but scattered communities along Basilan's western and southwestern shores and outlying islets and island groups.
Later references mentioned "Bantilan", probably referring to Maluso, which was established as a major Tausug base by Sulu Sultan Muizz ud-Din (whose princely name was Datu Bantilan).
Imperial Chinese texts mention a "Kingdom of Kumalarang" (from the Yakan ""kumalang"" or "to sing", owing to the location being a place for celebrations and gatherings) during the Ming Dynasty, believed to be the island which now has a "barangay" of the same name on its northwestern shores.
The earliest map of the Philippines which made reference to an island labeled "Taguima" was produced by Giacomo Gastaldi, through woodblock prints in 1548 and subsequently included in the influential travel book of Giovanni Battista Ramusio, the "Della Navigatione e Viaggi", which was published between 1556 and 1583 in three volumes. This was followed by Abraham Ortelius's work "Indiae Orientalis Insularumque Adiacientium Typus", published in 1573 in a German text edition of the atlas "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum" by Christophe Plantin in Antwerp. As late as 1719, a map titled "Die philippinische Inseln - Isle Brneo" by Allain Manesson Mallet of Frankfurt, Germany featured an island still labeled "Tagyma I."
Basilan.
The process by which all these names became "Basilan" is almost certainly due to miscommunication between the natives and the Spanish, as well as the penchant to engage in editorial license by European map-makers of the era.
Basilan's name may also derive from its iron ore deposits. Tausug warriors and slave-traders from Sulu came to Taguima to purchase high-quality magnetic iron ores, which they used for swords, knives and other blades. This profitable trade, helped in large measure by the establishment of Maluso as a major military-naval base of the Sulu Sultanate, eventually gave the island the distinction of being the source of "basih-balan", the Tausug word for magnetic iron. Roughly translated and abbreviated, however, "basih-lan" means "the iron (magnet) trail" or "the iron way".
When several Tausug warriors were caught by the Spanish in one of their numerous raids on the Zamboanga settlement, Spanish officials supposedly admired the artistry and skill that went into making the warriors' elaborately decorated swords, knives and blades, and asked where these weapons could be bought. From atop the ramparts of the Spanish commandery at the Fuerza del Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Fort Pilar), the warriors supposedly pointed to the island visible across today's Basilan Strait, and said, simply, "ha basih-lan".
Reports from the Jesuit "reducciones" in Zamboanga and Pasangen (Isabela) were relayed to Manila, where Spanish cartographer Pedro Murillo de Velarde published "Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compañia de Jesvs. Segvnda parte" using the Jesuit printing press at Manila in 1749. It featured a map of the Philippines with the as yet unofficial "I. Basilan". The map was re-published by Leipzig map-maker Nicolaus Bellinn for general European circulation in 1752.
Finally, to represent a clear break from the Habsburg Dynasty (which had ruled Spain for 184 years from 1516 to 1700), the first officially sanctioned Spanish maps of its colonies, including "Las Islas de Mindanao", were commissioned by the Bourbons (1700–present). This particular map of Mindanao, apparently copied from the Nicolaus Bellinn map of 1752, was published by Nicolas Norton Nicols in 1757, featuring "Basilan" and bearing the royal stamp of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VI. It has been called "Isla de Basilan" (Basilan Island) ever since.
Treasure Islands of the Southern Seas.
Basilan Island's reputation as a staging-ground for Moro raids on Zamboanga, the Visayas and even Luzon, and as a temporary repository of the plunder from these raids. gave the island a notoriety not unlike the "Treasure Islands" of the West Indies or the buccaneers' havens and pirate coves of the Caribbean.
Spanish and Tausug fleets engaged each other in sea battles and skirmishes not far from the western shores of the islands. Many of their ships were scuttled or sunk, sometimes with precious cargoes of traded goods and Mexican silver pieces meant for the fort in Zamboanga and the naval squadron at Isabela, as well as goods en route to Jolo from the Mindanao mainland.
The Spanish Pigafetta expedition landed on a group of islets west of the main island of Basilan, where they found precious pearls; subsequent Spanish cartographers aptly named these the "Isletas de Perlas" (Pearl Islets). Native Samal and Bajao folk called this group of islets and reefs "Pilas" (Perlas), a name still used to this day. More recently, there have been local rumors about gold bars and other trinkets hidden among the many islets by retreating Japanese troops at the end of World War II. To date, treasure hunters of various nationalities, among them Japanese and Europeans, have scoured the area.
All these tales of treasures hidden in Basilan's many remote, unpopulated islets gave it the nickname "Treasure Islands of the Southern Seas", immortalized in the official anthem of the Province of Basilan, "Fair Basilan", composed by Basilan lyricist and composer Tranquilino Gregorio.
Pre-Hispanic Taguima.
Basilan's earliest settlers was traditionally believed to be the Orang Dampuans originating from the islands of Eastern Indonesia, who are supposed to be the ancestors of the native Yakans. They are variously called the Orang Dyaks or the Tagihamas.
The Yakans, an inland pagan tribe, inhabited the Sulu Archipelago together with the indigenous Sama and Bajau before the Malayan Tausug from Sumatra and Borneo gained control of the area starting 300BCE-200BCE.
Historians have scant knowledge of the pre-Spanish history of the indigenous Yakans simply because they have had little contact with other ethnic groups. Basilan's nearness to Borneo led to the theory that the Yakan originated from the Dyak. Although it is fairly safe to say that Basilan's history is related to that of the Sulu archipelago, it is by no means right to suppose that Basilan's first inhabitants came from Indonesia.
Recent anthropological and archaeological findings actually point to a reverse pattern of human migration and subsequent habitation. Originating from the region we know now as Southern China, some of the earliest human communities constituting the northernmost dark-skinned branches of the first or "southern" wave of human migrations from Africa, ancestors of modern-day Aetas and Negritos, were forced to leave the area in the wake of the arrival of the second wave of human migrants out of Africa, the "northern" wave or the ancestors of present-day Chinese aboriginal tribes. These short, dark-skinned and kinky-haired humans first found a home in the relatively isolated island of Taiwan.
At about 5,000BCE, just as Earth was about to exit its most recent ice age, a virtual explosion of human migration again ensued, this time from Taiwan, traveling via land-bridges to Luzon in the Philippines, and farther south. The first wave of these Austronesian migrants proceeded to populate the greater and lesser Sunda islands of Borneo, Sulawesi, the Moluccas, Java and Sumatra in Maritime Southeast Asia and make up the Malayo-Austronesian branch of this population grouping. A more recent sub-branch traveled across the Indian Ocean and populated the previously uninhabited island of Madagascar off the southeast coast of Africa. The second wave of Austronesians traveled eastwards from the Philippines, populating the Western Pacific islands of New Guinea (Papua), Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.
Most of these negrito populations were eventually assimilated through inter-racial mingling with Thai-Khmer populations moving southwards from the Thai-Indochinese peninsula, the result being the Malayan race that now inhabit Malaysia, Indonesia (Nusantara), and the Philippines. The negrito populations of the western Pacific however, far removed from racial inter-mingling from the Asian mainland, eventually evolved into the present populations of New Guinea, Fiji, Hawai'i and other Pacific island groups.
If Basilan itself was previously inhabited by these ancient Negrito peoples, they were eventually driven farther south by the arrival at around 1500BCE-500BCE of the same ancient Chinese-Annamese aboriginals who drove away the Negritos from Southern China in the first place. Philippine historians from the Spanish-era mistakenly called these new arrivals "Indones" (Indian islanders) exhibiting physical features closer to the ancient Chinese and Annamese. The lighter-skinned and relatively slimmer and taller "Indones" communities eventually became the ancestors of modern-day indigenous Philippine tribes populating nearly the entire Philippine archipelago, the modern-day Lumads of the Philippines, and it is likewise believed that the Yakans were descended from this same population grouping.
The general migratory pattern therefore of the original inhabitants of the Philippine Archipelago follows a north-south path, contrary to widely held beliefs based primarily on the more recent cultural counter-migration which started from 300BCE-200BCE.
This third and final wave of human migration came from the general direction of Maritime Southeast Asia, albeit this time by full-fledged Malays (from Borneo) who then promptly displaced indigenous tribes from their coastal communities, driving the Indones or the Lumads farther inland, or south and east into the eastern Indonesian islands. This particular migratory pattern is seen in the pre-Hispanic legends of the 10 Datus from Borneo colonizing the island of Panay, where a much older "Ati" (Aeta or Negrito) kingdom graciously met them at their arrival. The migration of Malays into the Philippines was accelerated by the development of the ancient thalassocratic empires of the Malayo-Indian Sri Vijaya (from whom the name of the Visayas islands are derived) and the Javanese Majapahit in the 12th-14th centuries.
Two main branches of this Malay invasion entered the Philippine Archipelago via two separate routes. One, believed to have originated from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, passed via the northern coast of Borneo, and through Palawan and eventually settled by the banks of the river Pasig in Luzon. These settlers soon branched into two tribes, the first became known as the "people of the river" (or 'taga-ilog'/ Tagalog), which developed a more sedentary, agricultural society built on the fertile plains fed by the Pasig and around the area of Laguna Lake; while the second hugged the shores of Manila Bay and therefore called the "people of the coast" ('ka-pampang-an'/ Pampanga), primarily engaged in fishing. Kapampangans eventually moved northwards into the interior of Luzon, and, inter-marrying with indigenous 'highlanders' and visiting Chinese traders, eventually produced the Iloko tribe. Tagalogs on the other hand, moved further into the southeastern peninsula of Luzon, meeting up with the indigenous communities there, as well as the "sea peoples of Visayas and Mindanao". This produced the Bikol tribe.
The second and more recent main branch of Malays, believed to come from Java and the Banjarmasin kingdom of southern Borneo, came by way of the Sulu Archipelago, into Mindanao and up into the Visayas. These "sea peoples" (so-called because they arrived to colonize the islands in their various sea crafts, i.e. balotos, tilibaos, balasias, balangais, vireys, paraos and caracoas), eventually branched further into two tribes: the Tau-Sug, which settled in the Sulu Archipelago; and the Sug-bu-hanon which proceeded to colonize Cebu (Sug-bo). A variety of intermingling between these two main tribes, as well as indigenous tribes and aetas (as in the case of Iloilo and the 10 Datus of Borneo), produced a plethora of other smaller tribes, i.e. Hiligaynon, Waray in the Visayas, and the Maguindanao, Maranaw in Mindanao.
The Ifugao (of the Mountain provinces) and the Cuyunon (Palawan), Mangyan (Mindoro) tribes are indigenous survivors of the northern branch invasion. On the other hand, the Subanen (Zamboanga), Caraga (Agusan/Surigao), Manobo (Cotabato), Higaonon (Lanao/Misamis), Sama/Bajau (Sulu/Tawi-Tawi), and Yakan (Basilan) survived the southern branch invasion.
This pattern of initial habitation and subsequent displacement by newer arrivals is clearly seen in the case of Basilan, where the slim, tall, aquiline-nosed, and slit-eyed Lumad (Yakan) communities were driven far inland and towards the eastern and northeastern coasts of the island by the shorter, stockier and darker-skinned Malays (Tausugs) who proceeded to occupy the island's western and northwestern coasts. (The same pattern was repeated at the arrival of the Spanish and the Christian Malay "Indios" from the Visayas and Luzon who were considerably taller and lighter-skinned than the Muslim Malay "Moros", removing the latter to the island's southeast enclave that they now dominate.)
Because the Philippine archipelago was successively populated by two waves of negrito and ancient Chinese peoples before the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia and the western Pacific were, it is widely presumed that instead of the Yakans having descended from eastern Indonesian Dyaks, the more logical conclusion would be that these eastern Indonesian Dyaks were remnants of the "Indones" tribes fleeing from the Malays, some of whom may even have been descended from the Yakan themselves.
Yakan Karajaan of Kumalarang.
Records of pre-Hispanic Philippines gleaned from the extensive archives of China's Imperial courts mentions a "Kingdom of Kumalarang" located in one of the southern islands of Ma-yi (the Chinese name for the Philippine archipelago), whose King sent regular tribute to the Chinese emperor through Chinese traders who frequented the place in the 13th to 14th centuries. Local historians attribute this long lost kingdom to modern-day Kumalarang (now reduced to a Barangay) located along the northwestern coast of Basilan island.
Specifically, according to the Ta Min Hui Tien (Great Ming compendium of laws), a report gleaned from the records of Tehchow, Shantung, China (archived and researched in the years 1673, 1788 and 1935): 3 months after the death of Paduka Batara (the Tausug potentate who visited the Chinese Emperor Yung Lo and died on October 23, 1417), a High Court Mandarin, Chan Chien, was ordered to sail to Kumalarang (Chinese texts refer to "Kumalalang"), a vassal state of the Sulu Sultanate located on the northwestern coast of Taguima (Basilan Is.).
Chan Chien was received by Lakan Ipentun (Ch. ref. "Kanlai Ipentun"), presumably a Yakan Prince, who ruled the Kingdom as a vassal to the Sultan of Sulu. The Mandarin official stayed in Kumalarang for 2 years before returning to China.
He was accompanied by Lakan Ipentun and an entourage of several hundred, composed of his immediate family, minor chieftains (datus), and servants. They were finally given an audience with the Chinese Emperor on November 16, 1420 where he formally asked the latter to proclaim him as a recognized sovereign and vassal to the Dragon Throne.
Lakan Ipentun wrote a missive to the Chinese Emperor on December 28, 1420, complaining about the time it took for the Chinese Emperor to act on his request. The Chinese Emperor received the petition and finally granted Lakan Ipentun with the title of "wang" (king). After his request was granted, a satisfied Lakan Ipentun, along with his entire retinue, started for home.
On May 27, 1421, however, unaccustomed to the cold climate of the preceding winter and due to his advancing age, Lakan Ipentun died in Fujian, China, just as they were about to embark on Chinese junks that would have brought them home. His funeral was supervised by Yang Shan, administrator of the temples, and was likewise honored by a eulogy sent by the Chinese Emperor which extolled his virtues of "determination and serenity". His son, Lapi, was then proclaimed as rightful successor to the just bestowed title of "wang". Lapi sent one of his father's most trusted officials, Batikisan, to petition for an audience with the Chinese Emperor where he presented a "memorial" in gold plaque on November 3, 1424.
The party, with its newly proclaimed King, eventually returned to Kumalarang, and almost just as promptly faded from the historical records of the period.
Spanish era.
The first Europeans to ever document Basilan were the remainder of the ill-fated Ferdinand Magellan expedition, led by Juan Sebastián Elcano, and extensively documented by Italian scholar Antonio Pigafetta in the later part of 1521. Fresh from the debacle in Mactan, and after having their numbers reduced from 254 to less than a hundred scurvy-ridden sailors, the Spanish party scoured the area of the Sulu Archipelago for a route to the Moluccas (Spice Islands). After passing reefs and bountiful seaweeds, they came to an archipelago, the main islands Pigafetta recorded as "the islands of Zolo and Taghima (Sulu and Basilan) near which pearls are found". Food and water were difficult to come by in this episode of their voyage, however, so they eventually returned to Mindanao. The expedition eventually found its way to the Moluccas and then finally returned to Spain. They were the first Europeans to circumnavigate the world. Only 18 of them survived the long voyage and made it back to Spain.
Upon the return of Adelantado Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565, and the establishment of the Spanish colonial government first in Cebu, then in Iloilo and finally in Manila, the island of Basilan was gradually colonized and settled, inducted as a Spanish possession as early as 1636, formally organized as the 6th District of the Police-Military Government of Mindanao by 1860, and completely pacified by 1886 - a period spanning exactly 250 years.
In September 1581, Msgr. Domingo de Salazar, O.P., the first bishop of the islands, arrived in Manila. It was during his time and on his initiative that an assembly of sorts was convened in 1582 on the lines of a council, "to deal with matters concerning the furthering of the Faith and the justification of past and future conquests by Spain".
The fathers of the council were of the opinion that no valid claim could be laid to the conquest of the Philippines other than that based on the right to preach the gospel, with the qualifying clauses, mentioned above. But for this right to justify possession of territories, it was unnecessary to depend on any direct opposition of the natives to the preaching of the gospel, since the inferior or primitive organization of their government and of their laws as would hinder or thwart their conversion was, in itself, sufficient reason.
This theory of the Council of 1582 was unanimously accepted by the religious of the Philippines, including Bishop Salazar.
Stemming from this Council's resolutions, real Spanish authority spread over the islands hinged on the theory of "voluntary submission" or "free consent" from the natives. Such a consensual contract was institutionalized in the "cedula" imposed by the Spanish government on all its subjects in the islands.
There is also the free consent given in 1845 by the different chieftains of Basilan Island in Mindanao, who were contacted by the governor of Zamboanga upon instructions to that effect given him by the then Governor-General Narciso de Claveria. This free consent was construed as having been represented by the issuance of "cedulas" to residents of Basilan.
It is noteworthy though, that in a later communication to the central government in Spain, Governor Claveria corrected the earlier erroneous information that Dato Usuk and the people of the Maluso region, in the said island had given their consent. Governor Claveria made it clear that such had not been the case, so the government was to refrain from exercising any sovereignty over them. Such was the scrupulousness with which this matter of free consent was regarded by Spain. Even as late as 1881 the same criterion would be followed by the Spanish government.
Colonization & the Jesuit "reducciones".
The legendary Sultan Kudarat (Qachil Corralat to the Spanish) of Maguindanao maintained lucrative trade routes between his mainland kingdom and the Sulu Archipelago through a base situated in Lamitan. The Maguindanaos then called the island "Matangal" after the highest visible peak from the Celebes Sea. This base served as a staging ground for much of Sultan Kudarat's offensives against the Spanish until the Spaniards under the command of Governor General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera crushed it in 1637, just one year after the Spanish Fort in nearby Zamboanga was established. Spanish reports of the battle listed an Apuh Menggah, and Apuh Dagang and Apuh Batalan as the main Yakan Chieftains leading the local resistance at that time, all of whom were roundly defeated, prompting a significant number of their followers to move farther inland and southwards.
The proselytization of Basilan started in earnest, however, when Fr. Francisco Lado, a Jesuit, established the first Catholic mission, in an area called Pasangen by the native Yakans. "Pasangen" is a Yakan term for "commune", "town" or "a place where people visit or stay". This coastal area, however, was already predominantly populated by Tausug and Samal settlers when the Spanish came, and therefore was likewise locally called a "pagpasalan" or "settlement area". The Jesuit missionaries from Zamboanga arrived on the same year that the removal of Sultan Kudarat's base from Lamitan was effected, and established themselves in Pasangen on the island's northwestern coast. They constructed the first wooden mission and palisade wall near the mouth of the Aguada River, and dedicated the Island to St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order.
Pasangen then was ruled by three Tausug Chieftains, i.e., Datu Ondol, Datu Boto and Datu Kindingan. Through the efforts of the early missionaries, supported by Don Pedro Palomino of the Zamboanga settlement, all three were persuaded to be converted to Catholicism, with the last having been baptized Luis Quindingan - the first Christian Basileño and anointed head of the local "principalía".
The Spaniards made several attempts to control Jolo, but failed to do so until 1876. Basilan, however, was a wholly different story. Catholic missionaries together with Spanish soldiers who inter-married into the native population were able to successfully penetrate Basilan. So much so that by 1654 there were about 1,000 Christian families living in the island. Foremost among these pioneering families is the extended Lazaro Clan who, together with its cadet branches, the Saavedra, Generalao, Suson, Pardo, Barrios and Guevarra families, owned most of the cultivated lands that was to form part of the growing Christian settlement.
Thus, the veil of Catholicism began to slowly spread across the island with the spirited drive of the militant Jesuits. With no spices or gold to enrich the Spanish king’s coffers, except for local taxes, the Jesuits refocused the Spanish government's agenda and made religion the object of their expansion and conquest here.
In anticipation of an invasion from the Chinese pirate-warlord Koxinga, that was expected to devastate Manila, the Spanish authorities withdrew all stations in the south of the country to augment their forces holed up in Intramuros, temporarily freeing Zamboanga and Isabela from direct Spanish administration in 1663.
Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara signed a decree on May 6, 1662 ordering the military evacuation of the fort in Zamboanga, and of other Spanish colonies, including that of Ternate in the spice islands of the Moluccas. Upon receipt of these orders on June 17, 1662 the Spanish garrisons, along with a number of priests and their chosen local people started preparations for the eventual evacuation. The garrison were given orders to abandon the fort to the Christian Samas (progenitors of modern-day Chavacanos). Such a move was vigorously opposed by the Jesuits, though, particularly by Rev. Francisco Combes, SJ, even then, an acknowledged historian of Mindanao, but to no avail. The Zamboanga fort was finally abandoned sometime in April 1663 by the last remaining Spanish troops, they were evacuated and returned to Cavite to help defend Manila's Intramuros from a threatened invasion by Chinese pirate Koxinga, which never happened.
As fate will have it, the Chavacanos of Zamboanga and Pasangen, Jesuits included, will amazingly endure another 56 years (1662–1718) of isolated existence and proliferation amidst the hostile threat and return of the Moro Pirates who overtook and destroyed the abandoned fort. In the face of renewed threats from the surrounding Moro kingdoms of the area, the beleaguered Christian native population of 6,000 including a number of Jesuit priests, moved their settlement farther inland towards the area of modern-day Tetuan, where a Jesuit mission dedicated to Saint Ignatius was built. The Jesuit mission in Basilan, too, held out, albeit having its population drastically reduced by the seemingly endless onslaught by hostile neighbors.
The Jesuits, belonging to the aggressive religious expansionists' Society of Jesus, who remained in Zamboanga were historically credited for petitioning Madrid for the reconstruction of the damaged fort in 1666, three years after the last Spanish soldiers vacated their walled post. Spanish Queen Regent Maria Anna issued a "cedula" to the effect, but orders were not carried out by the authorities in Manila. A second order to re-establish the Fort was issued in 1672, but Gov. Diego de Salcedo again failed to carry this out as well.
In the absence of Spanish Royal authorities the Jesuits formed a sort of Christian city-state, called "reductions" (Spanish "Reducciones", Portuguese "Reduções") in and around their 3-decade old Presidios both in Zamboanga and Basilan. These were societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model. The same type of communities were likewise established by the Jesuits throughout South America, but especially in present-day Brazil and Paraguay. The abandoned "reduccion" of some 1,000 Christian converts on the island of Basilan was thus placed under the leadership of Luis Quindingan, designated as Camp Marshal and Chief by the retreating Spanish garrison.
Although Koxinga died about a year after his veiled threat to invade Manila, which caused the recall of Spanish troops to defend it, there was no formal reason given as to why the Spanish government refrained from returning their troops to Zamboanga soon after.
On January 17, 1673, an English freebooter, Capt. William Dampier reached Tictabun island off the Zamboanga coast. There he wrote down this account: "A little to the westward of the Keys (Tictabun island) we saw an abundance of coconut trees, therefore we sent our canoes, thinking to find inhabitants, but found none, no sign of any, but great tracks of wild hogs and great cattle, and close by the sea were ruins of an old fort. The walls thereof are of good height, built with stone and lime, and by the workmanship seemed to be Spaniard."
The year 1718 will change it all.
The Spanish royal authorities eventually returned in 1718. Both the Tetuan and Basilan missions, however, held out against all odds. Despite incessant attacks and raids by the Moros, the surviving Christian populations of both missions still numbered over 3,000 by the time the Spanish returned.
After having re-established lucrative trading agreements with the native kingdoms that dotted the area, nearby Zamboanga experienced a revival in its economy. The increasingly wealthy Spanish trading post in Zamboanga became an even more sought after prize for the Moro pirates of the era, so much so that the surrounding islands started to attract the attention of other foreign powers, and chief among these coveted islands was Basilan.
Hostilities resumed in the 18th century and this was triggered by the decision in 1718 by Gov. Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante to reconstruct Real Fuerza de San José in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga. The fort completed in 1719 was renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar is its popular name today). The rebuilt fort was inaugurated on 16 April by Don Fernando Bustillos Bustamante Rueda, senior maestro de campo of Zamboanga. Three years later in 1722, the Spaniards were launching another expedition against Jolo. Led by Andres Garcia, the expedition failed miserably.
By then, Badar ud-Din, Sultan of Sulu, wo was keenly interested in developing commercial ties with Manila and China, approached the Spanish with a proposal of peace. According to the agreement they arrived at in 1726, the Spanish and Sulu were permitted to trade freely with each other and the Island of Basilan was ceded to Spain. However, in a series of raids on the Visayas, subjects of the Sultan broke the treaty which resulted in the renewal of large-scale hostilities by 1730. [http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=S5q7qxi5LBgC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=sultanate+of+maguindanao&source=web&ots=tm1Bv-Nh9t&sig=sZOR0sYN5590wlfOoR4gu20lJqs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result#PPA203,M1] In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege. But the Spaniards left after a few days.
In order to strengthen the Spanish position in Zamboanga and the neighboring regions, three companies of native volunteers were organized in 1832. These natives together with the Spanish troops defended the town and the province from the sporadic attack by the Moros.
In a slew of misnomers, the Spaniards mistakenly referred to the Sultan of Sulu's subjects as Moros (Spanish for "Moors"). The word Moor was derived from the ancient "Mauri/Maure" tribe of North Africa, found in the ancient Roman Provinces of Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis. Today, the descendants of the Mauri/Maure - the Berbers - continue to occupy the northwestern coasts of Africa, and are spread throughout the countries of Morocco, western Algeria, and Mauritania, all of which are North African countries just across the narrow western end of the Mediterranean Sea from Spain, and peopled by Muslims which conquered and ruled Spain for 800 years. This explains the seemingly natural animosity felt by the Spanish against the Muslim natives in these islands, especially coming from a victorious war against Muslims for the reconquest ("Reconquista") of the Iberian Peninsula from the Almohads and the Taifa Kingdoms which lasted for centuries.
On the other hand, due primarily to their decidedly Hindu-Buddhist influenced societies - having been long-time vassals of the thalassocratic Hindu-Buddhist Sri Vijaya Empire - the non-Muslim native tribes were then referred to by the Spanish as "Indios" (Spanish for Indians), and called their colony in the far east, Las Indias Orientales Españolas (or the "Spanish East Indies").
Half of the Zamboanga peninsula was made into a Corregimiento (district) de Zamboanga with its jurisdiction reaching as far as Sindangan to the north and the whole of Basilan island to the south, while the northern half of the peninsula belonged to the District of Misamis. In 1837, the government was changed to a Gobierno Militar. Zamboanga was made the capital of Mindanao throughout the Spanish regime, except the period between 1872 and 1875, when the government was at Cottabato.
Dutch attack & the Jesuit expulsion.
The Dutch East India Company bombarded Jolo in 1744 and attacked Basilan soon after, establishing a Dutch base which they called Port Holland in 1746. They were eventually repulsed by Tausug warriors, sailing from Sulu and led by a Tausug prince, Datu Bantilan. (The site of the short-lived Dutch encampment is still called Port Holland, a coastal barangay of Maluso town, to this very day.)
Towards the second part of the 18th century, pirate raids from Sulu increasingly harassed the Spanish settlement in nearby Zamboanga, usually using their heavily fortified base in Maluso as a staging ground for some of their more successful forays. The Tausug raids reached a fevered intensity by 1754. By this time, a flourishing kingdom of Yakans and Samals was established in the area of modern-day Lamitan City. Headed by a loose confederation of Datus (local tribal chieftains), called a Kadatuan, the Yakan Confederacy traded with the Yakan communities farther inland.
In the meantime, the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, France, the Two Sicilies, Parma and the Spanish Empire in 1768. Jesuit missions were very controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the natives and slavery. It is partly because the Jesuits protected the natives whom certain Spanish and Portuguese colonizers wanted to enslave that the Society of Jesus was eventually suppressed. The Recoletos de San Jose (Recollects) took over territories previously assigned to the Jesuits.
In 1755, contingent of 1,900 men led by captains Simeon Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo to avenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din. But were roundly defeated. In 1775, after Moro raid on Zamboanga, Capitan Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo but was repulsed.
Throughout this brief period, however, Catholic missionaries continued their avid proselytization, converting entire clans of Subanen, Samals, Yakans and Tausugs to Catholicism, adding to the growing Visayan populations brought in primarily from Cebu and Panay.
Tausug Karajaan of Maluso.
Historical records about Basilan shifted then to the archives found in the Royal courts of the maritime power that is right next door - the Sulu Sultanate.
The sultanate of Sulu became a center of power in the 18th century, ruled over the island of Basilan nominally, and had little influence over the Yakan who were gradually driven far into the island's interior (Sherfan 1976:11; Haylaya 1980:43).
It is widely assumed that by this time, Kumalarang has either ceased to exist as a kingdom or was eventually broken up and its Yakan inhabitants forced to migrate emmasse towards the hinterlands. The Yakans, having retreated from any considerable direct contact with the invading Tausugs, have retained their ancient animist beliefs in large measure, only embracing Islam at a much later date.
Islam is said to have started in the Philippines in 1380 but some scholars believe that Islam spread in some areas of the archipelago during the early 13th century. Then and now, the inhabitants of the Sulu archipelago have been described as Muslims who have retained much of their pre-Islamic beliefs. Such folk-Islamic culture resulted from the fact that Islamic conversions were mostly undertaken not by full-time religious teachers but by Arab Muslim traders who traversed the Malacca–Borneo–Sulu–Luzon–Formosa route (Sherfan 1976: 12-13).
By the early 18th century, the Sultan of Sulu had defeated the Sultan of Maguindanao, signaling the rise of the Sulu sultanate in southern Philippines, with Jolo as the seat of power. Some Yakan villages sent a yearly tribute to the Sultan.
The Royal Archives of the Sulu Sultanate record that Sultan Azim ud-Din I, son of Badar ud-Din, and who was known to the Spaniards and most Tausugs as Alimuddin, ruled from 1735 to 1748. He was dethroned, exiled, then returned as Sultan from 1764 to 1774. His father proclaimed him ruler of Tawi-Tawi in 1735. In 1736, in a bid to cement the Sultanate's control over the busy trade routes that criss-crossed the area, the new Sultan decided to return his court from Dungun (Tawi-Tawi) to the old capital at Bauang (Jolo), which was abandoned in 1638 when the Spanish armada under Gov. Gen. Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera attacked and occupied it until 1645.
However, distance from the powerful Datus at the court in Tawi-Tawi made relations between them more and more tenuous. These Datus grew increasingly hostile to Azim ud-Din I as the years progressed, having been seen as a friend of the Spanish. They hatched a plot that would eventually lead to Azim ud-Din's removal as Sultan in favor of his younger brother, who was known to Spanish officials and missionary priests as Pangiran Bantilan or Datu Bantilan. In 1748, Sultan Azim ud-Din was forced to leave Jolo for Taguima and then Zamboanga. His younger brother, famed and respected for repulsing a Dutch invading force in 1747, having been conferred his Royal name Muizz ud-Din, was then proclaimed sultan.
Still a strapping youth when he became a Sultan, Datu Bantilan ruled the Sultanate of Sulu for sixteen (16) violent though productive years (1748–1764), having vigorously promoted trade that linked Bauang (Jolo) with major trading ports straddling the Sulu Sea. He likewise launched several raids on the Spanish settlements in Zamboanga and the Visayas islands of Panay and Negros, and greatly profited from the slave-trade of captives taken from these raids which reached a fevered-pitch by 1754. He likewise repelled a Spanish attack consisting of some 1,900 soldiers sailing from Zamboanga.
In the meantime, Azim ud-Din, fearful that his enemies might seek him out even in exile, sailed off to Manila where he remained for sometime, relatively out of reach from his brother's lieutenants. His Manila sojourn included a few years of imprisonment at Fort Santiago, as well as an unconfirmed conversion to Catholicism.
To further strengthen his naval superiority in the Sulu Sea, several Tausug warriors were sent to establish a base on the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago, which until then was called Taguima, after the Tagihamas (descended from the Orang Dyaks and ancestors of the modern-day Yakans who are the acknowledged natives of the place). This base was built on the island's southwestern coast facing Sulu, an area already thickly populated by Tausug traders and fisherfolk. Maluso as it was called then, and is so to this day, was the same site where the young Datu Bantilan met and vanquished the Dutch, and razed their encampment at Port Holland, one year before he became Sultan.
This Tausug base became a vital jump-off point for raids on Zamboanga. As a major military naval base, Maluso was staffed with some of Sulu's best blade-smiths and boat-builders to see to it that the Sultan's raiders were properly equipped before any raid was launched. Slave-raids into the island's interior likewise commenced.
As these raids became more and more frequent, the native Yakans retreated farther and farther inland, away from the coasts which were periodically harried by Datu Bantilan's Tausug warriors and slave-raiders. The biggest and most advanced Yakan coastal settlement was located on the northeastern shores of Basilan, in Lamitan, and far from the usual routes of pirate raiders on their way to Zamboanga from Sulu and Maluso. The Yakans were understandably wary of the Tausugs who proceeded to occupy much of the lowlands of the island's southeast coast, and have remained hostile to the Tausug kingdom that eventually flourished in the area.
After several successful incursions on Zamboanga were known to originate from this new Tausug base, Spanish surveyors stationed in Zamboanga took note of this and recorded Datu Bantilan's settlement, which by then was conferred the formal recognition as a vassal kingdom of Sulu, the Karajaan of Maluso.
Datu Bantilan died in the middle of 1763. His son, Azim ud-Din II governed Sulu with his brother after the death of their father. By the end of that year, he had become, for all practical purposes, the Sultan.
Azim ud-Din, now an old man, finally returned to Jolo in 1764 after Manila fell to the British. In the same year, on June 8, he was formally reinstated to the throne by his British sponsors. In 1774, tired of affairs of state, he formally handed over the throne to his son Muhammad Israil. With the arrival of his uncle Azim ud-Din I from Manila in 1764, whom he received well, Azim ud-Din II left his followers for Parang. Azim ud-Din II returned in 1778 after his cousin's sudden death (which some claim was poisoned by Azim ud-Din II himself), and was promptly proclaimed Sultan and reigned until his death in 1791.
The British Navy in the Sulu Sea.
In 1755, a contingent of 1,900 men led by captains Simeon Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo to avenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din, but were roundly defeated. In 1775, after a Moro raid on Zamboanga, Capitan Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo but was repulsed.
The second half of the 18th century saw a new player in the Sulu Zone. After occupying Manila from 1762–64, during the Thirty Years' War between Spain and England, the British withdrew south. There they established trading alliances between the Sulu Sultanate and the British East India Company. Spanish attacks on Jolo were now directed at weakening British trading interests in the south. In 1784, Aguilar conducted a series of unsuccessful assaults against Jolo and in 1796, Spanish Admiral Jose Alava was sent from Madrid with a powerful naval fleet to stop slave-raiding attacks coming from the Sulu Sea. British presence was signaled when in 1798, Fort Pilar in Zamboanga was bombarded by the British navy, which had established a base in Sulu. In 1803, the Lord Arthur Wellesley, governor-general of India, ordered Robert J. Farquhar to transfer trading and military operations to Balambangan island in Borneo. By 1805, the British had withdrawn its military from Sulu.
1815 saw the end of the galleon trade with Mexico as the wars of independence in the Americas was brewing. In 1821, administration of the Philippines fell directly under Madrid after Mexico had become independent. The Madrid government sought to end the “Moro threat.” In 1824, the Marina Sutil, a light and maneuverable armada under Capitan Alonso Morgado encountered the slave raiders in the Sulu Sea and routed the pirates, thus effectively extending Spanish naval supremacy in an increasing area over the Sulu Sea. This naval victory was followed by many more throughout the rest of the 19th century, ultimately reducing the once-unchallenged Tausug navy to a shadow of its former self.
The French blockade.
By the 1840s, colonial interests other than Spanish focused over western Mindanao, particularly the territories under the Sulu sultanate. The British, French, Germans, and Americans all became interested in these rich islands.
In 1843, the French Foreign Minister François Guizot sent a fleet to Vietnam under Admiral Cécille and Captain Charner, which started the French intervention in Vietnam. The move responded to the successes of the British in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam. The fleet, accompanied by the diplomat Lagrene, tried to seize the island of Basilan in order to create a base similar to Hong Kong, but projects had to be abandoned following the strong opposition of Spain claiming the island was part of the Philippines.
When the French under Admiral Cécille blockaded Basilan in 1844-45, an island which they called Taguime, intent on establishing a network of naval stations to protect French trade in the area, the Spanish governor protested that Basilan had recognized Spain's sovereignty just the year before, in February 1844. The French then forced the Basilan datus to sign a document affirming the “absolute independence of Basilan vis-a-vis Spain” on January 13, 1845 aboard the steamer Archimede.
On February 20, 1845, France forced the Sulu Sultan to formally cede Basilan Island to France in exchange for 100,000 piastres or 500,000 French francs. The French Admiral totally ignored Spanish protests. However, the inhabitants of Basilan who remained loyal to Spain, fought against the French for a year, forcing the French King, Louis Philippe, also a Bourbon, to ultimately decide against taking Basilan although the French Cabinet already approved the annexation, even allocating the budget for Basilan for that year.
France's claims on Basilan were based on a formal cession from the Sultan of Sulu as well as formal written agreement from the Basilan datus. These claims were eventually withdrawn by France, formalized in a proclamation dated August 5, 1845, turning over full sovereignty of the island to Spain. During the same year, a US survey mission studied the potentials of the Sulu archipelago, but American intervention did not start until 1899.
Fuerte de la Reina Isabella Segunda.
After two centuries of incessant and unrelenting raids and counter-raids, the fortunes of the Spanish Empire in the Sulu Archipelago took a dramatic turn for the better in 1848, primarily due to three watershed events: (1) the advent of Spain's steam-powered naval superiority over Sulu's outrigger-and-sail paraws; (2) the fall of Sulu's Balangingi allies on Tungkil; and, (3) the establishment of Fuerte Isabella Segunda or Fort Isabella Segunda on Basilan Island. These three benchmarks sparked off a series of events which, from 1848 on, saw Sulu's power wane until it was finally blighted and almost completely snuffed out on the eve of the American occupation.
To check the inroads of both the increasingly bloody Tausug pirate raids and the growing influence of Lamitan's Yakan kingdom, as well as to thwart any further attempt by other European powers to colonize Basilan (the Dutch in 1747 and the French in 1844) the Spanish commandery in Zamboanga City sent over an expeditionary force tasked at establishing Spanish fortifications on Basilan island, both to serve as an early beacon and defensive perimeter against the pirate parties, and as a trading post for Spanish interests on the island.
In 1845, Don Ramon Lobo, the Marine Chief of Zamboanga, accompanied Don Cayetano Suarez de Figueroa, District Governor of Zamboanga, to the coastal settlement of Pasangen. Wooden fortifications were initially erected on the settlement's highest point facing the narrow channel about 800 meters from the shore. The 200-year old Jesuit mission was situated half-way between the Fort and the shore. The fortification proved to be easily defensible as nearby Malamawi Island blocked direct attacks and raids from the sea. Later that same year, Gov. Narciso Claveria ordered the construction of a stone fort, following the plan of engineer Emilio Bernaldez submitted in 1844. Construction lasted four years.
By 1848, the stone fort was finished, replacing the wooden fortifications. In the meantime a sizeable and growing Christian settlement continued to flourish around the Recollect mission, re-dedicated since the expulsion of the Jesuits, to Sta. Isabel de Portugal (St. Elizabeth of Portugal). The Fort thus established was subsequently named in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Indies, and was named Fuerte dela Reina Isabela Segunda. The military garrison was initially placed under the direct command of the Fuerza dela Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar) in Zamboanga.
Nieto Aguilar (1894) describes the fort as “magnificent”. Situated 20 meters above sea level, the fortification overlooked the two entrances to the bay, formed by Basilan and Malamawi Island. To the fort's east were the barracks. The fort had four bastions at the corner of its rectangular perimeter. It enclosed a well and had four structures for the corps of guards, the garrison personnel, the presidio, jail, artillery corps and the "casa comandancia".
In the fort was the governor’s residence as well as that of his officials. It was also a naval station where the navy maintained small workshops for urgent repairs. It had a storehouse for coal near the shore. Total personnel: two officer, 50 men.
Outside the fort were built other structures, namely: a military infirmary, school, ayuntamiento (city hall), corps of engineers' building, storehouses and dependencies of the naval station, barracks for the marine infantry, gunpowder storehouse, and the Jesuit church and convent.
To further cement the presence of the missionaries in the area, the Augustinian Recollects, under the leadership of Padre Jose Riboste finally built a Church on the site of the old mission, situated opposite the stone fort and across a grassy Plaza nearly halfway between the fort and the shoreline. The Church was completed in 1850, and quickly became the locus of the fledgling Christian town which then grew around it.
Fall of Tungkil & Maluso.
In 1848, Gov. Gen. Narciso Claveria with powerful gunboats Magallanes, El Cano, and Reina de Castilla brought from Europe supervised the attack on Balangingi stronghold in Tungkil. The raid resulted in the capture of many Sama Balangingi and the exile of many to the tobacco fields of Cagayan Valley. However, the leader of the Sama, Panglima Taupan, was not captured. He, along with his closest ally Datu Jalaban Dasido, fled northwards to Basilan, where they hied off, hoping to be able to spring a counter-attack and recoup their tremendous losses. However, with the fall of the Balangingi, a powerful ally of the Sulu Sultanate was decimated, this started the downturn of the sultanate’s maritime sea power.
The continuing difficulty posed by the Tausug Karajaan in Maluso to Spanish interests on Basilan exemplified by its willingness to enter into treaties and agreements with other European powers, however, forced the Spanish to rethink this policy of leaving Maluso essentially free from Spanish rule. To ensure the unassailability of Spain's claims over Basilan, a military-naval operation commenced to put an end to the enduring Maluso Kingdom.
From the newly established Fort of Isabella Segunda and the Spanish Naval headquarters also in Isabela, the Spanish forayed into the erstwhile Tausug dominated area of Maluso with a band of Spanish and local troops, attacked the Tausug base led by Zamboanga District Gov. Figueroa, razing coastal Tausug and Samal towns along the way from Isabela. Upon the defeat of the remaining forces of the Maluso Karajaan on May 31, 1849, an army barracks was constructed beside a tree-lined plaza surrounded by a few houses. Finally, after a Tausug counter-attack on Fort Isabela II was repulsed by the Spanish garrison on September 29, 1849, wooden fortifications were built around what eventually became known as the Maluso Poblacion, which during the American era was renamed the Maluso Townsite.
Most of the Tausug and Samal nobility established by the Sulu Sultanate withdrew from Maluso, preferring to return to Jolo and Tawi-Tawi. The majority of the Tausug and Samal settlers, however, opted to remain, even opening ultimately profitable trade relationships with both the Spanish and the Christian indios in Zamboanga and Isabela.
Spanish raids were likewise carried out farther south and towards the western tip of the island, resulting in the surrender of Tausug chieftains Panglima Taupan and Datu Jalaban Dasido on July 16, 1857. Thus, the Spanish effectively pacified nearly all of the Tausug and Samal settlements along Basilan's western coasts.
By then, only the largely Yakan areas of Lamitan and the interior remained outside of Spanish control.
As the situation in the island's western half started to normalize, Christians and Tausugs likewise started a long-lasting socio-political and economic alliance, which when used against the Yakans, proved to be effective in advancing each other's interests for the next century. This Christian-Tausug alliance was only broken in 1988, when a Yakan was finally elected to the highest post in what became the Province of Basilan for the very first time.
The Treaty of 1851.
In 1850, Gov. Gen. Juan Urbiztondo continued with Claveria’s campaign and annihilated the remaining Balangingi strongholds at Tungkil. However, a raid on Jolo that same year was a failure. On 28 February 1851, Urbiztondo launched another campaign against Jolo, destroying the whole town by fire and confiscating 112 pieces of artillery.
On April 30, 1851 a Treaty, otherwise known as the "Act of Incorporation into the Spanish Monarchy" was signed between the Spanish authorities and the Sultan of Sulu.
""A solemn declaration of incorporation and adhesion to the sovereignty of Her Catholic Majesty Isabella II, constitutional Queen of Spain, and of submission to the Supreme Government of the Nation, made by His High Excellency the Sultan of Sulu, Mohammed Pulalun, for himself, his heirs and his descendants, Datus Mohammed Buyuk, Muluk, Daniel Amil Bahar, Bandahala, Muluk Kahar, Amil Badar, Tumanggung, Juhan, Sanajahan, Na'ib, Mamancha and Sharif Mohammed Binsarin, in the name and the representation of the whole island of Sulu, to Colonel Jose Maria de Carlos y O'Doyle, politico-military governor of the Province of Zamboanga, the islands of Basilan, Pilas, Tonkil, and those adjacent thereto, as Plenipotentiary specially authorized by His Excellency Antonio de Urbiztondo, Marquis of Solana, Governor and Captain-General of the Philippine Islands.""[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_UyVI5IxcjIC&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&dq=spanish+governors+of+basilan&source=web&ots=lu070H6B-x&sig=TwMlpD3F3PdJLhLabIzMPUw6pHA&hl=en&ei=9XqRSd70MJj07AOGi-SwCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA285,M1]
Don Pedro Gonzalez led an attack on Balanguingui on September 28, 1853 to complete the depopulation of the area. It is during this attack that Panglima Taupan and Datu Jalaban Dasido fled Balanguingui towards Basilan, landing in the southern coast of Lantawan. Sustained searches across the thick jungles of Basilan by Spanish authorities finally forced both Samal Chieftains to surrender to the Spanish on July 16, 1857.
6th Politico-Military District of Mindanao.
On July 30, 1859, a royal decree was issued allowing the Jesuits to recover their Missions in Mindanao from the Recollects.
A year after, on July 30, 1860, the Spanish government on the Isla de Gran Molucas (Mindanao) was divided into six Police-Military Districts, namely:
(1) Zamboanga (covering present-day Zamboanga City, Zamboanga Sibugay and the southern part of Zamboanga del Norte up to Sindangan Bay);
(2) Misamis (which covered the rest of Zamboanga del Norte, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, Lanao del Norte, Bukidnon and the Cities of Dipolog, Dapitan, Cagayan de Oro, Ozamiz, Oroquieta, Tangub and Iligan);
(3) Surigao (covering Agusan del Norte and Sur, and Surigao del Norte and Sur, and the Cities of Butuan, Surigao and Tandag);
(4) Davao (covering all of the Davao Provinces, Davao City, South Cotabato, Sarangani and the Cities of Koronadal, General Santos,Tacurong, Tagum, Digos and Panabo);
(5) Cotabato (covering Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato and the Cities of Cotabato and Marawi); and
Fort Isabela Segunda became the focal point of the 6th District of the Police-Military Government of Mindanao.
Thus, from 1860 until the end of the Spanish regime 39 years later in 1899, the islands of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi and all of their outlying islets were placed under the jurisdiction of Basilan, with its administrative capital in Isabela.
By 1879, the Spanish fleet for the entire southern Philippines was moved to Isabela, where a "floating" Naval Hospital was built on shallows guarding the eastern entrance to the Isabela Channel. The southern shore of nearby Malamawi Island became the repository of the coal used by the Spanish steam-powered naval vessels, and has since been called Carbon (currently a Barangay). Further to the east of the Isabela Channel, the Spanish buried their war-dead on a small tongue of land off Malamawi's Panigayan coast, this area was called Isla Calavera (Eng. Skeleton Island) until rising tides completely submerged it.
The fall of Jolo.
After a series of less-than-successful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces captured the city of Jolo, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876.
On that year, the Spanish launched a massive campaign to occupy Jolo. Spurred by the need to curb slave raiding once and for all and worried about the presence of other Western powers in the south (the British had established trading centers in Jolo by the 19th century and the French were offering to purchase Basilan Island from the cash strapped government in Madrid), the Spanish made a final bid to consolidate their rule in this southern frontier. On 21 February of that year, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent against Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers, in 11 transports, 11 gunboats, and 11 steamboats. Headed by Admiral Jose Malcampo captured Jolo and established a Spanish settlement with Capt. Pascual Cervera appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor; He served from March 1876 to December1876 followed by Brig.Gen. Jose Paulin (December 1876-April 1877), Col Carlos Martinez (Sept 1877-Feb 1880), Col. Rafael de Rivera (1880–1881), Col. Isidro G. Soto (1881–1882), Col. Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Col. Julian Parrrado (1882–1884), Col. Francisco Castilla (1884–1886), Col. Juan Arolas (1886-18930, Col. Caesar Mattos (1893), Gen. Venancio Hernandez (1893–1896) and Col. Luis Huerta (1896–1899).
The Spaniards were never secure in Jolo so by 1878 they had fortified Jolo with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta España, and Puerta Alfonso XII; and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina. Troops, including a cavalry with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective confine of the walls. From Jolo, in 1880 Col. Rafael Gonzales de Rivera who was appointed the governor dispatched the 6th Regiment to Siasi and Bongao islands. The Spaniards were not secure in their stronghold because it would be sporadically attacked. On 22 July 1883, it is reported that three unnamed juramentado succeeded in penetrating the Jolo town plaza and killed three Spaniards.; The word “Ajuramentado” was coined by Spanish colonel Juan Arolas after witnessing several such acts while serving duty in Jolo garrison.
Conquest of Lamitan.
Throughout most of the Spanish regime the advance of Spanish interests was cultivated chiefly in the area around Fort Isabela Segunda or Isabela. A few adventurous colonists from Zamboanga settled in Lamitan over the years, but the area was fairly isolated from Spanish military incursions from Isabela by impenetrable jungles. Even so, a few Christian settlers, mostly traders, lived in Lamitan.
The most common strand about Lamitan's name is relayed thus: "On the island's northeastern coastal plains, the bustling Yakan community was in the midst of a native festival when intrepid Spanish explorers from Zamboanga pulled ashore. When the visitors asked the astonished natives where they were, the Yakans replied that this was their "meeting place" or Lami-Lamihan, which when roughly translated, refers to merry-making or conference. The Spanish explorers recorded this as Lamitan, thus the name."
A more comprehensive study of Lamitan's etymology, however, points to a far less merry circumstance. In fact, studies point to the naming of Lamitan after a Kuta (Fort) built by the Maguindanao warlord Sultan Kudarat on Basilan's northeast coast, to be used as a way-station for attacks carried out against the Spanish in Zamboanga, as well as to guard the sea approach to the Maguindanao Kingdom of Kuta Bato (Cotabato) from the Spanish navy that roamed the area.
This fortified garrison eventually became the center of a bustling community of thousands as Yakan farmers, artisans and traders, attracted by the relative safety that the Maguindanao base offered against both Spanish and Tausug attacks. Trade between Basilan and the Mindanao mainland soon ensued, linking this thriving community with another merchant-settlement located along the northern coast of the Pulangui River (Rio Grande de Mindanao), Sultan Kudarat's capital town and a coastal Barangay still called Ramitan to this day. Maranao traders from Ramitan were quartered within the walls of the Kuta, along with their Maguindanao hosts. The Yakans, who traded with the Maranao's thus regarded the Kuta as "the place where the merchants from Ramitan stayed". Eventually, the native Yakans, having difficulty in pronouncing the sound for "r", replaced it, by habit, with the sound for "l". Thus, the Fort was called "Kuta Lamitan" by the natives, and then after the razing of the Fort and the evacuation of the Maguindanao garrison, to simply - Lamitan.
Unlike the earlier Karajaan or Vassal Kingdom of Kumalarang, however, the Yakans of Lamitan, rejected Tausug suzerainty and systems of governance in their territories. They did not fully unite themselves under a single King or Lakan/Raha, choosing instead to consult clan elders or Chieftains which they called Datus or Orang Kayas ("rich men") in a loose confederation called a Kadatuan (similar to the Maranao's Pat a Pangampong Ku Ranao or Maranao Confederation), keeping away for the most part from the Tausug Karajaan of Maluso and the Spanish Reduccion of Isabela, and thus remaining fairly isolated from the pitched battles waged between the Sulu Sultanate and Spain throughout the 17th-19th centuries.
The Yakan therefore largely inhabited the island's eastern half and the interior, and almost by habit, remained hostile to lowlanders throughout the epic clash of civilizations that saw some of its bloodiest confrontations fought on the island. The Yakan likewise remained faithful to their traditional beliefs, a mix of animist customs with Hindu influences, with Islam having been confined for the most part to the higher classes. A significant number moved to Zamboanga during the Jesuit reduccion years (1663–1718), where they were assimilated into society as Christian converts.
In 1874, a fugitive from Cavite named Pedro Cuevas (born 1846) who was remanded to the San Ramon Penal Colony in Zamboanga, escaped the sprawling facility, and found himself hiding from his Spanish jailers in the Yakan enclave of Lamitan.
He stayed in Lamitan for some time, given refuge by Chavacano merchants who traded with the Yakans in the area. He arrived at an opportune time, as it turned out, for a particularly zealous Yakan chieftain named Datu Kalun (also spelled Kalung and Kalum) wanted to rid Lamitan of its small but growing Christian presence. The Christian community got wind of this plan, however, and Pedro Cuevas characteristically volunteered to lead the resistance composed of the Chavacanos and their Yakan converts and sympathizers. In the confrontation between the two groups, the Yakan Datu Kalun was subsequently slain and his supporters roundly defeated. Cuevas then adopted the name of Datu Kalun (Haylaya 1980:43), claiming for himself the vacated position of his defeated enemy. The rest of the Yakan clans were then forced to accept Cuevas as their sole leader soon after. He married one of the daughters of the defeated Yakan chieftain to further cement claims of nobility for himself and his heirs, converted her entire family to Catholicism, and instituted meaningful socio-political changes in the lives of the residents of Lamitan. Datu Kalun consolidated the Yakans, led battles against the slave-raiders from Jolo, and rid Basilan's eastern coast of pirates and marauders.
With his advanced knowledge of Spanish armaments and military tactics of the day, he commanded a group of Yakan warriors, by then converted to Christianity, as well as some Chavacano conscripts from nearby Zamboanga, and proceeded to subjugate the remaining Yakan tribal leaders in the interior by force of arms.
After having consolidated his power over the flourishing Yakan enclave, Don Pedro Cuevas, sent emissaries to the Spanish authorities in Isabela and Zamboanga. For his services as the Last Conquistador of the Spanish Empire, he was eventually pardoned by Gov. Gen. Fernando Primo de Rivera in 1884, and, having formalized his position as leader of the Lamitan District of Basilan island, was finally and officially installed as such in 1886.
The Orang Kayas.
The fall of Jolo, and the subsequent occupation by Spanish forces of the Sultanate's principal town, ended all legitimate claims by the Sultanate of Sulu over Basilan Island. Yakan villages, located in the heavily forested interiors, and situated far beyond any effective direct control by Spanish authorities however, have remained fairly isolated from the rest of the island, with its three main population centers, Isabela, Lamitan and Maluso firmly under Spanish administration.
By 1874, with Spanish support and Christianized Yakan warriors under his wing, Lamitan's conquistador - Datu Kalun - commenced offensives which aimed to pacify the Yakans of Basilan's interior. He was initially successful in so far as he was able to reach the previously impregnable Yakan enclaves in Bohelebung, Tipo-Tipo and Tumahubong, Sumisip, eventually establishing a foothold for the Spanish authorities in these otherwise inaccessible territories.
It was during these heady days of conquest that the names of two notables or "Orang Kayas" (Rich Men) were first made known. The first of these two, Orang Kaya Pukan (Ungkaya Pukan), a Yakan chieftain, ruled and reigned over the relatively untouched, rich southeastern slopes of the island. He held fast against incessant attacks from Datu Kalun's forces for a few years, resisting surrender at a high cost in the lives of his sturdy warriors. He did eventually retreat from his jungle fortress, however, giving up his domain to Datu Kalun in 1884.
Refusing to personally surrender to Datu Kalun, however, Ungkaya Pukan moved his entire clan westward, eventually reaching the settled territory of yet another Chieftain, albeit this time a member of the Samal Bangingi. Orang Kaya Tindik (Ungkaya Tindik), who ruled over much of the southwestern slopes of Puno Mahaji (Basilan Peak) was the son of the Balangingi leader Panglima Taupan. Their clan fled Tongkil after the successful Spanish inroads in 1850, and landed on Basilan's southwestern coast.
The initial contact between Ungkaya Pukan and Ungkaya Tindik was far from friendly, with several battles being fought between the two clans for what seemed like a steadily shrinking realm.
Having realized their equally untenable positions vis-a-vis the Spanish and the Tausugs on two fronts, however, the Chieftains eventually came to an alliance, agreeing to accommodate each other's clans, with Ungkaya Pukan having been given the area around Canibungan, Lantawan to settle after marrying one of Ungkaya Tindik's daughters.
Treaty of 1878 and the Philippine Revolution.
The Spanish and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Spanish Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878. The Spanish-language version of the Treaty gave Spain complete sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago, this includes Basilan, while the Tausug version described a protectorate instead of an outright dependency.
The book "Mindanao: Su Historia y Geografía Por José Nieto Aguilar Con un prologo de Don Francisco Martín Arrúe (Madrid, Imprenta del Cuerpo Administrativo del Ejército. 1894)" describes the Sixth Politico-Military District of Basilan as such:
"Sexto distrito: Basilan.—La isla de Basilan, que con la extremidad SO. de Mindanao forma el estrecho de su nombre, es la mayor y principal de este grupo.
"Se halla situada entro los 127° 59′ 30″ y 128° 44′ 30″ de longitud E. y entre los 6° 25′ á 7° 45′ 1″ latitud N."
"El establecimiento militar de la Isabela de Basilan se halla próximamente á media longitud del canal, en la embocadura del río Pasahan ó de la Isabela. Al S. de él, y á corta distancia, tiene un fuerte, elevado 20 metros sobre el nivel del mar, que domina las dos entradas, y á su parte E. se halla el cuartel. Es también estación naval, en donde la marina militar tiene algunos pequeños talleres para sus más urgentes atenciones, y los depósitos de carbón se hallan enfrente del pueblo, sitio que es el más á propósito para fondear."
"Aguada.—Esta se encuentra no lejos del fuerte; antes del establecimiento de la Isabela sólo se conocía la del río Gumalaran, en cuya barra se encuentra casi siempre un metro de agua á bajamar, teniendo cuidado con dos cabezos de roca que no descubren. El agua se hace en pequeñas cascadas á media milla hacia dentro."
"Las islas principales de este grupo son unas 40, ocupadas por moros de los mismos usos y costumbres que los de Mindanao, siendo la superficie total de 68.320 hectáreas."
"La Isabela, pueblo el más importante de la isla y la capital del distrito, está situada en un declive pedregoso, dominándola el fuerte llamado de Isabel II. Este consta de cuatro baluartes que ocupan los ángulos del rectángulo que lo forma. Está rodeado de foso y tiene cuatro edificios que están destinados para cuerpo de guardia, cuartel para el destacamento, presidio y calabozos, fuerza de artillería y casa Comandancia."
"Los principales edificios de la colonia son: Enfermería militar., Escuela, Casa Ayuntamiento,
Comandancia de Ingenieros, Almacenes y demás dependencias de la Estación naval, Cuartel de Infantería de Marina, Hospital, Polvorín, Iglesia y convento de jesuitas"
"Industria.—La de este distrito se reduce á la venta de artículos para el consumo del Ejército y Marina y algunas telas que los chinos cambian á los moros por los productos agrícolas y algún balete y concha que se recoge en aquellos mares."
"Agricultura.—El terreno cultivado no pasa de 8 á 10 hectáreas, dedicadas al cultivo de caña dulce, arroz, café, cacao, maíz y algunas hortalizas."
"Los principales artículos que el comercio importa son aceite, arroz, café, cacao, azúcar refinado, vino, garbanzos y otros artículos de Europa."[http://www.librosdescargar.com/historia/70-gratuitos.html]
In 1895, the Sultan of Sulu sent one of his most accomplished generals, Datu Julkarnain, to regain control over Basilan, only to be defeated by the combined forces of the Spanish and their local ally, Datu Kalun. The ensuing peace encouraged more Christians to settle in Basilan.
By this time, the Katipunan (revolutionary organization) had gained enough momentum in Luzon and the Philippine War of Independence was engaged in 1896. In Mindanao, locals' resistance contributed greatly to the weakening of the Spanish colonizers. The Spanish campaigns against the "Moros" - a derogatory term used by the Spanish against the Muslim Filipinos - likewise caused heavy casualties and depleted Spanish resources (Haylaya 1980).
While Zamboanga and Sulu were the centers of Spanish-Muslim hostilities, Basilan's inhabitants remained fairly unaffected by the social upheavals. Still, the indigenous Yakans, together with the considerable Tausug, Samal and Bajau populations on the island were among those natives called Moros by the Spaniards (Jundam 1983:8-9).
An American paper on Mindanao, Basilan and Sulu at the end of the Spanish-American war contains the following report:
"At the end of the Spanish era, Basilan's garrison was reduced to 2 officers and 50 men stationed on the Fort of Isabella Segunda. However, Isabela, which was the Naval headquarters for the south was garrisoned by 30 marines 27 sailors in addition to ship's crews. There were two brigades of marine infantry in the Philippines, composed of 375 men and 18 officers. Most of this force, including the 18 war vessels in Philippine waters, were used at one time or another, for the suppression of Moro piracy. The naval expenditure in the later period of Spanish occupancy amounted to more than $2,500,000 per year.
"The total fighting force of the Moros at the close of the Spanish-American War appears to have been about 34,000 warriors. This total was made up of 19,000 in Mindanao, 10,000 in Sulu and about 5,000 on Basilan Island.
"The total Moro population of the Philippines was about 380,000. Due to the absence of birth statistics among Mohammedans, any population figure can only be an estimate. A considerable percentage of the population of Sulu was transient, moving from Sulu to Borneo according to their desires.
"The Yakans, a tribe of mountain Moros, many of whom are pagans. About 20,000 of them are found on the Island of Basilan, fifteen miles from Zamboanga. They are famous for the excellence of their outrigger canoes or vintas and they supply many of the other Moro tribes with these vessels."[http://www.bakbakan.org/swishk/swknotes.html]
On September 21, 1897 a temblor rocked the Sulu Sea basin sending 100-foot waves which ravaged and flattened Basilan North-western coast. Isabela itself was badly hit, with waves reaching as far up as the foot of the Spanish stone fort. To be sure, the damage was minimized due to the presence of Malamawi Island which save much of the small town from utter destruction. Some accounts of an apparition of St. Elizabeth of Portugal (Sta. Isabel de Portugal) holding back the waves from completely engulfing the entire town, led to the celebration of the annual Terremoto Festival, featuring a fluvial parade along the Isabela Channel.
The Philippine Revolution against Spain seems to have made no impact in Basilan. However, when the United States defeated Spain in the Philippines, many Spaniards, including Spanish clergy evacuated the Philippines. By January 15, 1899 it already became necessary to call a plebiscite at Isabela to form some kind of Government in Basilan. This plebiscite appointed Don Ramon Larrachochea as Governor and Don Pedro Javier Cuevas (aka Datu Kalun) was made Mayor of Isabela.
On May 16, 1899 all the Spaniards in Basilan, led by the last Spanish Military Governor of Mindanao's Sixth District, Capt. Jose Llobregat y Martin, evacuated and left the island to Don Pedro Javier Cuevas, who was later elected Jefe Provisional by the town council.
This Provisional Government ruled and protected Basilan until the military representatives of the United States Government took formal possession of the island on December 8, 1899.
American regime.
By 1898, Basilan Island was administratively divided into three districts, i.e., (1) Isabela de Basilan (capital), (2) Lamitan, and (3) Maluso.
Spain ceded the Philippine islands to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish-American War. Following the American occupation of the northern Philippine Islands during 1899, Spanish forces in Mindanao were cut off, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and Jolo. American forces relieved the Spanish at Zamboanga on May 18, 1899, and at Basilan seven months after.
American occupation.
On December 8, 1899, the Americans led by Col. James S. Petit occupied the Spanish naval base of Isabela de Basilan. In Basilan, an increasingly old and sickly Datu Kalun (Pedro Cuevas) supported the new colonizers. Sovereignty over both Isabela and Lamitan then was effectively transferred from Spain to the Americans.
At that time, the Philippine–American War was raging in Luzon. So as not to spread out their forces, the Americans employed the classic divide-and-rule tactic. Maj. Gen. E.S. Otis, commander-in-chief of the US Forces, sent Gen. Bates to negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu. Known as the Bates treaty, the agreement provided for the exercise of American authority over the Sulu archipelago in exchange for the recognition of Muslim culture and religion.
The Bates Treaty of 1899 between Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and American Brigadier General John C. Bates, further acknowledged American administrative control over the Sulu Archipelago, including Basilan.
Initially Sultan Kiram was disappointed by the hand-over of control to the Americans and had expected to regain sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago after the defeat of the Spanish. Bates' main goal though, was to guarantee the Sultanate's neutrality in the Philippine–American War, and to establish order in Mindanao. After some negotiations, the Bates Treaty was signed.
This treaty was based on the earlier Spanish treaty, and it retained the translation discrepancy: the English version described a complete dependency, while the Tausug version described a protectorate. Although the Bates Treaty granted more powers to the Americans than the original Spanish treaty, the treaty was still criticized in America for granting too much autonomy to the Sultan. One particular clause, which recognized the Moro practice of slavery, also raised eyebrows in Washington, D.C. Bates later admitted that the treaty was merely a stop-gap measure, signed only to buy time until the war in the north was ended and more forces could be brought to bear in the south.
The peace created by the Bates Treaty did not last, however. This became evident when the Muslims repudiated the Moro province, a politico-military government in Mindanao lasting from 1903 to 1914, and the Moro Rebellion soon broke out. It is important to note that barely two months before the creation of the Moro province, the American colonial government declared and classified all unoccupied lands as public lands. Immediately after the declaration, American investments entered Mindanao and mass migration of Christians was encouraged. (Rodil 1985:4).
The American forces eventually arrived under the command of Capt. Wendell C. Neville, who eventually became a Major General, the 14th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps in 1929-1930. He was initially posted as Military Governor of Basilan from 1899 to 1901, and was tasked at the establishment of a civil government for the island of Basilan.
By July 1, 1901, the Municipality of Zamboanga was inaugurated under Public Act No. 135. This constituted Zamboanga and Basilan Island.
On September 15, 1911, the governing body of the Moro Province, the Legislative Council, passed Act. No.272 converting the Municipality of Zamboanga into a city with a Commission form of government. The ceremony was held on January 1, 1912 with the appointment of American Christopher F. Bader as the first City Mayor. With the island of Basilan as part of Zamboanga, this made the City of Zamboanga the biggest city in the world in terms of land area. Two years later he was succeeded by Victoriano Tarrosas the first Filipino Zamboangueño Mayor of the city when Bader resigned.
The Department of Mindanao and Sulu replaced the Moro Province in 1914, and its districts broken up into separate provinces, namely: Davao, Misamis, Lanao, Cotabato, Sulu, and Zamboanga, the city was then reverted to its original status as a municipality administered by a Municipal President and several Councilors. The municipality included the whole of Basilan Island and it remained as the capital of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, with a civil government under an American civil governor, from 1913 up to 1920.
The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Frank W. Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920 by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona, Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began.
Datu Kalun died in Basilan on 16 July 1904 at the age of 58, soon after his first contact with the Americans. His nephew Gabino Pamaran became his successor and adopted the name Datu Mursalun. Mursalun, also pro-American, led the town of Lamitan which became an American model of civil government and development. Mursalun worked for the material progress of Basilan, and sought ways to fight banditry and piracy in the area.
Philippine Commonwealth.
Politically, Basilan became a part of the Moro Province (1899–1914, encompassing most of Mindanao Island). Basilan was then included in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1914–1920), a district of Zamboanga Province (1920–1936), and then of the Chartered City of Zamboanga (1936–1948), before it became a Chartered City on its own right at the beginning of the Philippine Republic.
Alongside military suppression came a policy of education. Public schools were built but Muslim enrollment was way below Christian school attendance. Muslims considered public education a threat to their culture and religion.
To ensure Muslim participation in government affairs, the Americans soon adopted a Policy of Attraction for western Mindanao. Moreover, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) replaced the United States Army units pursuant to colonial efforts to reduce American presence. The replacement of American troops, mostly by Christians under the PC, increased the hostility between Muslims and Christians.
In the political sphere, the management of Muslim affairs through the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914 was unsuccessful, as leadership in the department fell in the hands of Christians. Thus, the Muslim leaders were historically opposed to the idea of independence, which meant the incorporation of Muslim areas into a political system dominated by Christians.
Early in the American period, American plantation owners cleared vast expanses of Basilan's virgin forest land and established what was to be Basilan's primary economic activity - plantation agriculture, mainly rubber and copra. American Dr. James D. W. Strong, the Father of the Philippine Rubber Industry, inaugurated the first rubber plantation in the Philippines (inauguration was attended by President Manuel L. Quezon no-less) in Baluno, a plaque and shrine to this pioneering individual may be visited in the same Barangay to this day.
The success of what was soon to be the B. F. Goodrich rubber concession in the northern part of Isabela City, enticed other multi-national firms, such as the British-Malaysian Sime Darby and the Hispano-German Hans Menzi Corporation to open rubber plantations in the City's southern areas. The first Filipino-owned plantation was established on Malamawi Island by Don Juan S. Alano, originally of Malolos, Bulacan, who served as Representative of the entire Moro Province (Mindanao) during the Commonwealth Era (1936–1942), and the first Congressman of Zamboanga Province (now comprising Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan) in the Republic's first Congress (1946–1949). He authored the Charter of both the Cities of Basilan and Zamboanga.
More Filipino settler families, such as the Cuevas-Flores-Pamaran-Antonio clan (progeny of the legendary Datu Kalun) in Lamitan and the Pardo, Barandino, Brown, Dans, Biel, Encarnacion, Dela Pena, Luistro, Zagala and Nuñal families of Isabela itself soon followed suit, establishing sizeable plantations, usually engaged in coconut/copra production.
Japanese invasion.
The outbreak of World War II disrupted Commonwealth administration. In 1942 Japanese soldiers landed in Basilan and occupied it until 1945.
Christians and Muslim officers and men of the military district in Mindanao and Sulu shifted to the Moro guerilla activities against the Japanese. A civil government called Free Sulu Government administered activities in the locality. At that time, Elpidio Sta. Elena was the municipal president in Isabela, Monico E. Luna was Treasurer, Joe Borja the Chief of Police, and R.C. Climaco was Justice of the Peace. They conducted the affairs of the local government from Fort Isabella Segunda throughout the duration of the war. Behind the Fort, overlooking Aguada River and the water fountain serving hundreds of homes, there was a large pit - used by the Japanese soldiers to bury Filipino and American casualties, usually beheaded with the sword! (from Cawa-Cawa Smorgasbord, by R C Climaco)
The Japanese Occupation forces established a government in Basilan to govern both Zamboanga and Basilan. The Japanese Occupation of Basilan was rather uneventful, however, it barely affected the residents, except in terms of Japanese demand for food for their military machinery. In fact, Datu Mursalun and his family watched, without much interest, the American bombings of the Spanish fort and naval hospital in Isabela which signaled the retaking of Basilan by joint Filipino and American troops in 1945.
Liberation.
On 10 March 1945, the U.S. Eighth Army under Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger was formally ordered by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to clear the rest of Mindanao was supported by the Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 101st and 102nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and guerrilla resistance fighters, with the start of Operation VICTOR V, with expectations that the campaign would take four months. Eichelberger had misgivings about the projected timetable for the operation, but nonetheless, his Eighth Army staffers came up with a more effective plan.
On the same day Eichelberger's forces were ordered to invade Mindanao, remnants of Maj. Gen. Jens A. Doe's 41st Infantry Division carried out Operation VICTOR IV, the seizure of Zamboanga, which was concurrent with the recapture of Palawan, dubbed Operation VICTOR III. A sizable force, numbering about 9,000 men of the 54th Japanese Independent Mixed Brigade (IMB), had established strong defensive positions around Zamboanga City at the southern tip of the peninsula.
The slow construction of the airfield at Palawan posed a problem for tactical air support augmenting the Zamboanga operation. The seizure of a makeshift airstrip at Dipolog, about 145 miles (230 km) to the northeast of Zamboanga City, the Americans rapidly exploited the opportunity, airlifting two reinforced companies from the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Division to ensure control of the airstrip. Soon thereafter, Marine Aircraft Groups Zamboanga (MAGSZAM) under Col. Clayton C. Jerome was flying sorties off the airstrip to cover naval bombardment and landing preparations off Zamboanga City.
After bombings of the landing areas by the 13th Air Force and a three-day bombardment by the U.S. Navy, the 162nd and 163rd Infantry Regiments landed three miles (5 km) west of Zamboanga City. Japanese opposition to the landings were minimal, and the 41st Division troops quickly captured the city, which was decimated by the pre-invasion bombardments. The next day, 11 March, the Americans and the Filipinos encountered strong resistance when they attacked Japanese positions in the hills, overlooking the coastal plain. For two weeks, U.S. infantry, ably supported by Marine aviation and naval gunfire together with the Philippine Commonwealth Army forces, fought the Japanese along a five-mile (8 km) front, in terrain so rugged that tanks could not be used, and in positions heavily fortified with deep earthen emplacements, barbed wire, minefields, and booby traps.
On 23 March, after heavy fighting, the center of the Japanese line finally broke, and in the next three days, the 162nd Infantry continued eliminating resistance in the central sector. The 186th Infantry, replacing the 163rd, continued the attack and the 54th Japanese IMB was forced to pull out a week later, harried by the Philippine Commonwealth troops & guerrilla units, retreating through the peninsula and into the jungle. After some time, mopping up operations resulted in 220 Americans and 460 Filipinos killed compared with 6,400 Japanese dead.
Alongside the Zamboanga operation, smaller units of the combined soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army's 6th, 101st and 102nd Division and the U.S. Army's 41st Division invaded the Sulu Archipelago, a long stretch of islands reaching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to North Borneo. Rapidly taken in succession were Basilan, Malamawi, Tawi-Tawi, Sanga Sanga and Bongao. It is during this phase of the operations when American bombing raids completely destroyed Fort Isabela Segunda, which was used by the Japanese as military headquarters, prison and munitions dump, and razed the "Spanish" Naval Hospital. Minimal resistance from entrenched Japanese positions in Isabela and Malamawi Island brought about a quick reoccupation which was completed by the beginning of April. On 9 April, strong resistance at Jolo was encountered. Anchoring their stubborn defense around Mount Dabo, some 3,900 Japanese troops held off the U.S. 163rd Infantry supported by Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and other local Moro guerrillas. By 22 April, the Allies took the position after hard fighting and the rest of the troops fled and held out in the west for another two months. The 163rd suffered 40 dead and 125 wounded by mid-June, 1945, while some 2,000 Japanese perished.
Philippine Republic.
When the town of Zamboanga became a chartered city in 1936, it included Basilan. On July 1, 1948, by virtue of a bill filed by then Congressman Juan S. Alano, Basilan itself became a separate city after Republic Act. No. 288 was passed by the 1st Philippine Congress. The first city mayor was Nicasio S. Valderroza appointed by President Elpidio Quirino.
Mayor Nicasio S. Valderroza was considered a builder of cities, having been variously a Provincial Treasurer, an acting Provincial Governor of the old Province of Zamboanga, Mayor of Baguio City, first Mayor of Zamboanga City, First Mayor of Davao City and the first appointed Mayor of the new City of Basilan.
When President Ramon Magsaysay became the Chief Executive of the land in 1954, he appointed Leroy S. Brown as mayor of Basilan City. He served as the second and the last appointive mayor of this city until December 31, 1955. The city was then classified as a first class city.
With the approval of Republic Act. No. 1211 amending the charter of the City of Basilan, the position of the City Mayor became elective.
The first election for local officials in Basilan was held on November 8, 1955. Mayor Brown was overwhelmingly elected as the first elective mayor of the city. He was responsible for the construction of several concrete bridges, notably the Aguada Bridge and the impressive Balagtasan Bridge in Lamitan, as well as the construction of a number of public buildings, the expansion of the Isabela wharf, and many more, all of which greatly benefited the people of Basilan.
He was the first and the last elected city executive of Basilan. He served uninterrupted from January 1954 to December 31, 1975, under the Administrations of Presidents Carlos Garcia, Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand Marcos. During his term, the city council gave birth to a new breed of legislators and leaders from 1954 to 1975. These years have since been called Basilan's "Golden Years".
Moreover, Mayor Brown was a stalwart member of the Philippines' oldest political party - the Nacionalista Party (NP) - having been elevated to the 7-man Ruling Junta of the NP until the party's suppression by former NP-party-man-turned-nemesis Ferdinand Marcos' Martial Law government.

Martial Law years.
On September 21, 1972 President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law. At that time, Basilan was in the middle of the Moro National Liberation Front Uprising prompted by the expose of the Jabidah Massacre on March 18, 1968. A number of native Moro leaders joined the MNLF rebellion, making Basilan a veritable warzone. The first-ever armed confrontation occurred around the heavily forested hills of Bagbagon and Canibungan in Lantawan on the island's western area. This was followed by the occupation of the Alano Plantation (declared "No Man's Land" by the military) by MNLF "munduhin" and "blackshirts" and the ensuing aerial bombardment by the military which burned down and left the Anoos Ancestral house,the Anoos ranch and its vast coconut, rubber and coffee plantations in Tuburan totally devastated. MNLF rebels then laid siegedowm over Lamitan's poblacion, but was eventually staved off by fierce resistance from Lamitan residents who volunteered to fight valiantly beside elements of the Armed Forces and the Philippine Constabulary.
Several more raids and ambushes were made throughout the island, which succeeded in stopping all the operations of the plantations. Sporadic gun-battles, too, broke out within Isabela's poblacion, and pirate raids harried fishing operations as well as passenger ferry traffic between Basilan and Zamboanga.
After more than two years of incessant fighting, a substantial number among Basilan's Christian populace left the place altogether reducing the Christian tribes to minority status once again. After nearly 50 years of continuous immigration from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon, Basilan experienced, for the very first time, a net outflow of people.
On December 27, 1973, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 356, converting the City of Basilan into the Province of Basilan "to provide the close government attention and for the purpose of spurring its growth". The first appointed Provincial Officials took their oath of office on March 7, 1974, making this day the official Founding Anniversary of the province. Another Presidential Decree numbered 593 dated December 2, 1974, amended P.D. 356. The law not only defines the City's territory but also provided that the capital of Basilan shall be the Municipality of Isabela. It also created ten (10) Municipalities to comprise the new Province of Basilan.
Presidential Decree No. 593 was later amended by Presidential Decree No. 840 dated December 11, 1975, reducing the number of municipalities to seven (7) in order to render its "territorial portion more complementary to the size of the area and more responsive to pacification, rehabilitation and total development of the province". The municipalities specified in the said amendment were the following: Isabela, Lamitan, Tuburan, Tipo-Tipo, Sumisip, Maluso and Lantawan, of which five (5) municipalities are now in existence. It also provided for the absorption of the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Basilan into the Municipality of Isabela with its poblacion as the capital seat of the province.
The conversion to Province-hood, and the creation of Municipalities ensured that Basilan's sparsely populated areas were "given" to Muslim warlords and surrendering MNLF Commanders by Presidential fiat, as a form of bounty or reward for laying down their arms. The once-progressive First-Class City of Basilan was emasculated beyond recognition, having been reduced to an area exactly One-Kilometer radius within the Isabela Poblacion.[Source?]
Under Martial Law, Basilan had its first military governor in the person of Col. Tomas G. Nanquil, Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan. There were three (3) Vice-governors during his tenure as military governor. Col. Nanquil served for about a year and half.
Before Basilan was converted to a province, it had three regular municipalities, Isabela, Lamitan, and Maluso which are districts of the city of Basilan. Even when Col. Nanquil was appointed Military Governor, the city of Basilan was still functioning under Mayor Brown until December 31, 1975 due to its territorial boundary dispute with the Province of Basilan.
The second military Governor was Rear Admiral Romulo M. Espaldon. Due to his numerous functions and responsibilities as Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Southern Command (SouthCom), South Sulu Sea Frontiers Command, over all military supervisor of Mindanao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFP and Regional Commissioner for Islamic Affairs in Region IX, Adm. Espaldon could not possibly attend to his duties as Military Governor of Basilan. To this effect, he designated Col. Florencio Magsino, Brigade Commander of the 21st Infantry Brigade as Military Supervisor for Basilan and Officer-In-Charge. His Deputy Brigade Commander Col. Recaredo Calvo ably assisted Col. Magsino. When Col. Magsino was appointed Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in Baguio City and Col. Calvo was recalled to Headquarters, Col. Alfredo Rillera assumed command of the Brigade and became the Military Supervisor of Basilan. He was succeeded by Col. Salvador Mison. Col. Augusto Narag, Jr., later replaced him. The last military Supervisor was Gen. Rodolfo Tolentino, consequently, the first military with a star rank to be appointed Military Supervisor in Basilan. Admiral Espaldon was the last military governor of the province, his term lasted until December 31, 1975.
On December 11, 1975, President Marcos appointed then Vice-Governor for Administration Asan G. Camlian, a thrice-elected City Councilor.
Together with Gov. Asan G. Camlian, the first mayors of the seven municipalities were also appointed they were: Ricardo G. Mon, Isabela; Pedro C. Pamaran, Lamitan; Jean S. Yasin, Maluso; Herman H. Hatalan, Sumisip; Muhtamad S. Akbar, Lantawan, Candu I. Muarip, Tuburan; and Abduca Osani, Tipo-Tipo.
In the local elections held on January 30, 1980, and running under the banner of Marcos-led Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL or New Society Movement), a huge majority elected Gov. Camlian. He served for ten (10) years (1976–1986).
The first representative of the Federation of the ABC in the SP was Yusan A. Ismael while Sahak Habil represented the KB after Nasser Mustafa.
The representative of the Province in the Batasang Pambansa was Kalbi T. Tupay, a former MNLF Commander who was among the first to return to the folds of the law. In the second election after martial law, however, he lost to a native son of Basilan, Candu I. Muarip, the first and last Yakan to serve as Assemblyman in the Batasang Pambansa until its abolition in 1986; the first and only Basileno to get a Cabinet Portfolio when he served as Secretary of the Office of Muslim Affairs and Cultural Communities (OMACC) from 1986-1987 under the Administration of Corazon C. Aquino; and the first Yakan Congressman to represent Basilan Province in the House of Representatives (1995–1998).
In 1984, Basilan had three (3) representatives in the Autonomous Government of Region IX; namely; Ulbert Ulama Tugung, Chairman, LTP, Sagga H. Ismael and Hudan Abubakar.
Elnorita Pamaran Tugung widow of assassinated LTP Chairman Ulbert Ulama Tugung became Chairman of the Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook and later represented Basilan in the House of Representatives (1992–1995) after the term of Cong. Alvin G. Dans who served from 1987-1992.

People power.
The snap presidential election of February 7, 1986, followed by the famous and historic EDSA People Power Revolution toppled President Marcos and installed President Aquino to power. The Batasang Pambansa was abolished and all local officials were replaced. President Aquino appointed Louis W. Alano, grandson of Cong. Juan S. Alano, and Basilan's Lead Convenor of the Concerned Citizens' Aggrupation (CCA) founded by the late Zamboanga City Mayor, and staunch Marcos Oppositionist, Cesar C. Climaco, as interim governor of Basilan together with Vice-Governor Ping A. Kasim, the members of the Provincial Board, the mayors of the seven municipalities and all municipal councilors in the province. This is preparatory to the local election in 1988.
Prior to the appointment of Gov. Alano, the Department of Interior and Local Government installed government Operations Officer Pepito Pamolana as Officer-In-Charge of the province, through it lasted for only 2 hours. When the local officials filed their candidacy for the 1988 elections, Poe Reynera and Hji. Calama Ibama served as Governor and Vice-Governor respectively.

Gov. Abdulgani "Gerry" Salapuddin won the elections on February 2, 1988. He was the first Provincial Governor from the Yakan tribe and served for three consecutive terms, from 1988-1998.
The Administration of Gov. Salapuddin started the re-construction of the Provincial Capitol Building (burned on June 6, 1993), supported trade missions to neighboring countries, established joint peace and order development councils, improved and rehabilitated major road networks, offered medical and financial assistance to the needy, loan assistance and livelihood program to new entrepreneurs and cooperatives, employees amelioration and welfare.
He likewise served as representative of the Lone District of Basilan in the House of Representatives, for three consecutive terms, during his second term, he became the First Yakan representative to become Deputy Speaker for Mindanao in the Philippine Congress' Lower House during the 12th Congress, he was returned as Deputy Speaker for Mindanao on his third and last term as Representative in the 13th Congress.
The rise of the Abu Sayyaf.
In the decades following the establishment of Basilan City, the island's interior was effectively secured from attacks of all kinds by the multi-national plantations and its complement of well-equipped security personnel. This, plus the centralization of authority in Isabela, assured a steady and uninterrupted development of Basilan's countryside.
In the early part of the 1990s, however, the government's implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) brought widespread confusion and severely affected Basilan's traditional plantation agriculture economy. The withdrawal of the multi-national plantations was quickly followed by the decommissioning of their respective security contingents. The Christian-Tausug communities within the plantations were left out on their own, ripe for an attack from their traditionally hostile Yakan neighbors previously held at bay by the presence of security forces paid for by the plantations. Basilan's Christian-Tausug plantation communities had to fend for themselves, depending on agrarian reform cooperatives with limited resources to quell any serious threat on their newly acquired properties.
This threat did not take long in making itself known. The establishment of a group of young, Syrian-, Afghan- and Libyan-trained Filipino mujahideen - the Al-Harakatul Al-Islamiyah, better known as the bandit group Abu Sayyaf - founded by Yakan firebrand Abdurajak Janjalani, a Yakan-Ilonggo, allegedly assisted by a preacher-classmate in his years of training in Syria and Afghanistan, Wahab Akbar, soon catapulted Basilan to international notoriety as a haven for terrorists.
This band of brigands stormed Ipil town in Zamboanga Sibugay Province in April 1995 and planted a bomb on American Library ship M/V Doulos, docked in Zamboanga's port. On the same year, Janjalani's younger brother, Khadaffy, escaped from a Manila prison. From then on, Abdurajak was said to be grooming his brother to be his successor, Khadaffy Janjalani.
On December 18, 1998, Abdurajak Janjalani was eventually tracked down and killed in a Lamitan hideout. The group then went into hiding as Khadaffy, Janjalani's brother and anointed heir-apparent, consolidated his control over the many different groups that composed the Abu Sayyaf then. Assisted by Abu Sabaya in Basilan and Commander Robot in Sulu, both of whom are Tausug, Khadaffy soon revived the group - this time receiving hefty funding from international terror networks Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah.
They then engineered a series of arguably successful kidnap-for-ransom operations which reached its fever point in 2000 and 2001, when high profile hostages from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan and then tourists from a Palawan resort were kidnapped and brought to Basilan and Sulu. This episode saw the killing of American Muslim Jeffrey Schilling and Christian Missionary Martin Burnham. His wife, Gracia Burnham, was eventually rescued. The town proper of Lamitan was likewise attacked by the group, briefly occupying the Jose Ma. Torres Hospital and the St. Peter Parish, and then escaping a supposedly tight military-police dragnet under a cloud of accusations and allegations of payments and collusion on the part of military officials and their Abu Sayyaf counterparts.
For a time, the entire Basilan island was blockaded off by Philippine Navy ships, in an effort to contain the group, and prevent any further traffic between Zamboanga, Basilan and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago. This, too, however, proved futile.
This prompted the government, assisted by the United States under President George W. Bush, to inaugurate Balikatan 02-1 Joint US-RP Training in 2002, wherein a contingent of about 3,000 US troops were deployed in Basilan to offer training and technical assistance to the Philippine Armed Forces, as well as humanitarian services to the general populace.
This then led to an avalanche of NGOs and ODA-funded projects which aimed to transform Basilan from the Philippines' "Wild, Wild West" to a showcase for US/foreign-assisted efforts in former terrorist hotbeds, dubbed the "Basilan Model". ODA-funded initiatives from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, UK, Belgium, Japan, Germany and Spain complemented the larger US presence in the area.
To date, the Abu Sayyaf, has continued on its kidnapping rampage, killing off 14 personnel of the Philippine Marines in an ambush on July 11, 2007. It has likewise carried out several high-profile kidnappings, all of which were on Sulu island, including ABSCBN Reporter Ces Drilon (June 8, 2008), GMA7's Susan Enriquez (April 2000) and Carlo Lorenzo (September 2002), controversial reporter Arlyn dela Cruz (January 2002, believed to have had a "special relationship" with Khadaffy), as well as a number of foreign journalists from Germany (Der Spiegel), France, Australia and Denmark. Its latest exploit is the kidnapping of 3 high-level staff workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross or ICRC (1 Filipino, 1 Swiss and 1 Italian), also in Sulu.
In July 2004, Gracia Burnham testified at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf member and identified six out of the suspects as being her erstwhile captors, including Alhamzer Limbong alias Kosovo, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul and Dazid Baize.
"The eight suspects sat silently during her three-hour testimony, separated from her by a wooden grill. They face the death sentence if found guilty of kidnapping for ransom. The trial began this year and is not expected to end for several months."
Alhamzer Limbong was later killed in a prison uprising.
Gracia Burnham has caused controversy since returning to the US, by claiming that Philippine military officials were colluding with her captors. She made the claim in a book about her experiences called "In the Presence of My Enemies". In it she complains the Armed Forces of the Philippines "didn't pursue us ... "As time went on, we noticed that they never pursued us."
A series of kidnappings and beheadings since 2007 have been attributed to the Abu Sayyaf Group, with some of its members having been given the distinction of having US$5 million (some of them US$30 million) placed on their heads as monetary rewards by the U.S. Government for their capture.
The most recent kidnapping spree involved two Chinese-migrant businessmen and their Filipino employee (who was eventually beheaded) in Maluso, and businessman Lario delos Santos who was abducted from his Isabela City resort December 16, 2010. Allegations of the proliferation of "absentee executives" in Basilan's hinterland municipalities have been blamed for the steep rise in the spate of kidnap-for-ransom cases. Likewise, rumors about military-police collusion with the kidnappers, as well as a worsening narcotics-prohibited drugs trade in the province have been pointed at as possible causes for the recent lawlessness in the province.

Days of Dynasty.
Republic Act. 7160 known as the Local Government Code of 1992 gave the Vice-Governor the power to become the Presiding Officer of the Sanggunian Panlalawigan, thereby separating the Executive function of the Governor and Legislative power of the Provincial Board headed by the Vice-Governor.
Vice Governor Ping A. Kasim served uninterrupted from 1986-1998. Otoh Fernandez, Perfecto C. Antonio, Jr., Andriel B. Asalul, and Nato Asmawil were the longest serving members of the board.
Former Congressman Alvin G. Dans served for two (2) months as Governor in the later part of 1996 after the Commission on Elections declared him the winner in the gubernatorial race of 1992.
Another interim governor, former Vice Governor Ping A. Kasim served for three (3) months as Chief Executive. He served in this capacity from April to June 1998.
Gov. Wahab M. Akbar assumed office on July 1, 1998. His first term was highlighted by his close affiliation with President Joseph Estrada, he switched sides during the 2001 EDSA DOS People Power which booted Pres. Estrada and installed President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in power. During Akbar's administration various projects for Communication and Health Services, the Full implementation of the Salary Standardization Law, Infrastructure Projects, Food Security Programs and Peace and Order Programs in the province were made. The re-construction of the Provincial Capitol was likewise completed during his term.
Recent developments brought about by the inclusion of Basilan into the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao(ARMM)increased the number of Basilan's Municipalities to eleven (11), namely the original: Maluso, Lantawan, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, and the ARMM-created Al-Barka, Akbar, Muhammad Ajul, Ungkaya Pukan, Hdji. Muhtamad and Tabuan Lasa, municipalities with an average of only 10 Barangays each and populations that increduously grew by an average 100% over the period of only seven years.
Case in point is the eponymous Akbar Municipality (named after the late Congressman Wahab Akbar, during his lifetime), which used to have a population of only 10,581 in 9 barangays in 2000, to 21,312 in 2007, or an actual population increase of 101.42%.
On April 25, 2001, by virtue of Republic Act. No. 9023, sponsored by Dep. Speaker Gerry Salapuddin, the people of Isabela, through a plebiscite, overwhelmingly ratified the conversion of the Capital Town of Isabela into a Component City.
Into the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
On August 14, 2001, a majority of the voters in the Municipalities Lantawan, Maluso, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo and Tuburan opted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in a plebiscite expanding the territory of the Autonomous Region. Isabela City and Lamitan Municipality voted against inclusion. Nevertheless all of Basilan's municipalities (including Lamitan) have been enrolled as a part of the expanded ARMM. Isabela City alone was placed under the regional jurisdiction of Zamboanga Peninsula.
In the ARMM election of November 26, 2001, Rajam Akbar, Hatimil Hassan, Harisul T. Samanul won as Assemblymen representing the province in the ARMM Regional Assembly.
Results from the recent 2007 Local Elections had the COMELEC declaring former Governor Wahab Akbar, an acknowledged Yakan leader, as Congressman of the Lone District of Basilan, a position he served until November 14, 2007 when he was killed by a bomb blast at the Philippine Congress grounds. His first wife, Jum Jainuddin-Akbar was proclaimed Governor, and his second wife, Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar, was proclaimed Mayor of Isabela City. Allegations of massive, systematic and comprehensive electoral fraud, vote-buying and voter intimidation were leveled at the Akbar dynasty. Akbar's nephews and nieces also won the chief posts in almost all municipalities. The only exception being Lamitan, having elected a descendant of the feisty Datu Kalun - Roderick C. Furigay, defeating Akbars third wife in the 2007 elections by a landslide.
Former MNLF Commander and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Abdulgani 'Gerry' Salapuddin, along with Akbar foes Hajiman Hataman and his brother, Party-list Representative Mujiv Hataman have been implicated in the bombing incident which killed their political nemesis.

Avshalom Haviv

Avshalom Haviv (June 18, 1926 – July 29, 1947), was a pre-Jewish state Irgun underground member and one of the 12 Olei Hagardom tried by the British Mandate courts and sentenced to death by hanging at Acre Prison.
Childhood and adolescence.
Avshalom Haviv was born on June 18, 1926 (Tammuz 6 5486 according to the Jewish calendar), in Haifa, the son of Rivkah, a well-known merchant, and Eliezer. Haviv grew up and received his education in Jerusalem, residing with his family on Straus Street. In his youth he studied at the Tachkemoni School and as a high school student in Beit Hakerem he was drawn towards Zionist ideas. His school essays expressed opinions on the achievements of the Zionist party and the policy of the British government. In an essay entitled "The Aspirations of an Enslaved Youth" he included the passage:
My aspiration is: one language will take hold in the land, not German, not Yiddish will be spoken in the land of Israel, but rather the language of the Tanakh, the ancient language of Hebrew. My ambition is the aliyah of all of the nation of Israel into the land of Israel and those that will dwell here on the two sides of the Jordan river, and the land that was promised to us by the English will be only ours. In this hoped-for time there will be here a Hebrew state like all states. "Amen, ken yihyeh ratson!" ["Amen, may it be your will!", a phrase used in the Jewish liturgy]
At 16, Haviv joined the Irgun Zionist underground movement and received the nickname "Efraim".
The underground.
On finishing school, Haviv served for a year in the Palmach elite fighting force of the Haganah. During this time he participated in an operation to free detained immigrants from the Atlit detainee camp. One of the freed captives was , who would eventually be hanged alongside him.
After his year with Palmach, he began to study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and at the same time returned to the Irgun. Gradually, he spent more and more time on operations with the Combat Corps of the Irgun (the HaK, "hayil kravi"), and as a result ended his university studies. In many operations, Haviv took on the job of machine gunner, mainly participating in attacks on the central British secret police in Jerusalem and government income tax offices. He also participated in the Irgun's attempt to free their imprisoned members from the central prison in the Russian Compound as well as the bombing of "Goldschmidt House Officers Club" on March 1, 1947. The attack took place on Shabbat, and Haviv, who was traditionally religious, left the synagogue during prayer. During the operation he was ordered to provide the intruders with cover fire from a Bren gun. Although seriously injured in the hand by the searing hot barrel of the machine gun, he continued to fire meticulously throughout the entire operation.
Haviv's final mission was to take up a blocking position during the operation that scattered mines in support of the Acre Prison break on May 4 1947. He was captured during the engagement along with Irgun fighters Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss, Amnon Michaelov, and Nachman Zitterbaum when the group ran out of ammunition.
Trial and verdict.
The trial began on Wednesday, May 28, 1947, after a delay of two days due to Jacov Weiz's illness. The accused sang the pro-Israeli song Hatikvah to the members of the court, whereupon the judges stood up to be later rebuked by the presiding judge for shaming the court. Haviv asked to read a declaration in response to the judge's question, but was told by the President of the Court that he was there to answer questions, not to recite declarations. When Haviv insisted, two policemen were ordered to bring him forward by force. Meanwhile, the accused disrupted the trial by not answering the judge's questions, asking their friends to answer for them, or alternatively got up from their places or pretended to doze off. When witnesses were called to testify, the defendants chatted among themselves and exchanged jokes. In isolated incidents the defendants referred to the events preceding their trial. Avshalom got up and asked one of the witnesses, a British soldier who was present during his detention: "Can you explain to me precisely what you meant when you said to me 'gas chambers are a game compared to what is expected for you in Israel'?". When they weren't answering questions, the defendants continued to talk amongst themselves and to draw caricatures of members of the court.
The trial lasted 14 days and 35 witnesses were called before the time came for the defense to present its case. The defendants, who originally opposed the authority of the court to judge them, also opposed defense proceedings. Despite this each defendant prepared a long affidavit with statements opposing tyrannical British rule, which were delivered on June 10, 1947. In his affidavit Avshalom equated the Irish War of Independence in Britain to the underground struggle in the land of Israel. He finished his speech with these words:
On June 16 the court convened at 11:10 with the delegation of Colonel Pel, Major Lee Hunter, and Captain Barker. Lieutenant Colonel Norman, vice commander of the British forces in mandate Palestine also attended the proceedings. The jurors entered 15 minutes late and complained to the presiding judge about being subjected to a "precise, extended, and embarrassing" body check. This was part of the enormous ring of protection surrounding the court. The check even extended to cigarette cases, matches, and fountain pens. 
In unison, the indicted parties sat bound and sang songs from the Betar Revisionist Zionist youth movement, which were translated for the many foreign journalists in attendance. The defendants entered the hall under heavy guard with chains on their hands and legs. It was reported that Haviv refused to raise his legs for the manacles to be put on and in a loud voice answered the British jailer "If the British mandate wants to put handcuffs on me, may it submit!". The shackles were only removed shortly before the assembly of the panel of the court. The accused reassured their families "We will yet laugh at them, and if not us, others will laugh." The presiding judge, Colonel Pel, declared the accused had been found guilty of all charges. At the request of the judges, lawyers brought forward documents concerning the ages of Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum.
Consultation over the verdict lasted for nearly two hours during which time observers and journalists were transferred by the police to a grated porch under the sun. The resentment of the journalists over this "confinement" didn't help. After two hours, the presiding judge entered the hall wearing a red hat, a sign that the verdict was death. He informed Meir Nakar, Jacov Weiz, and Avshalom Haviv that they were sentenced to "hanging until their spirit departs". Amnon Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum were sentenced to imprisonment "until the commissioner choses to free them" due to their youth. When they heard the verdict the accused burst into song with the crowd in the hall joining them in a rendition of "Hatikvah". Immediately afterwards the entire crowd was put onto the barred porch for three quarters of an hour until the jury left. It was reported that the crowd were told anyone trying to leave would "be shot where they stood". The condemned parties were loaded into an armored vehicle that then made its way to the Acre Prison. Haviv's mother exercised self-control when the verdict was declared and remained silent throughout.
According to the newspaper Davar, which carried out investigations in Haviv's household, his family had held on to the hope that he would be saved through a visit by the UN council. Haviv sent a message to his family: "We are ready to sabotage, the question is how ready are you for it?" On the 29th of Tammuz, the day Irgun leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky was released, Haviv and the two other condemned men were promoted from group leader ("rosh kvutza") to sergeant ("samal"). The Irgun approached the UN council and asked them to annul the death sentence. This was in light of the UN calling on all sides to refrain from violence during the investigation, and also based on a similar event that had occurred in Greece along with the fact that no one from the security forces lost their life in the attack on the Acre Prison – the only victims were underground fighters. During the UN council investigation, support developed for intervention in the affair, but after the matter was brought to the chairman of the council and after stormy deliberations behind closed doors, it was decided on June 23 not to adopt a position contrary to the decision of the British mandate. A hostile government request for a conference concerning the three convicts worsened relations between the parties, and shortened the duration of the UN Council's stay in the land of Israel. David Ben-Gurion, Chaim Weizmann, and the head rabbis, all pleaded with the chief commissioner for amnesty. Many other bodies joined in the call for amnesty, including the council of the Sephardic union, the council of Ramat Gan, American students, and even the New York Post and Czech newspapers. 
The convicted men passed their time in the chamber studying and reciting Psalms. When the prisoners' rabbi Aryeh Levin visited them they received him happily and asked him to report that they were in strong condition. On July 8 at 01:00 the army commander confirmed the verdicts. In due course the Irgun would capture two British sergeants and guarantee that if the death sentence went ahead, they would hang the sergeants as "an eye for an eye".
Ascending the gallows.
On the night of Monday, July 28, the prisoners heard the sound of the Hatikvah coming from the condemned men's cells. Suddenly the rumor spread that they would be hanged that night. Throughout the whole night the three condemned men sang songs of the underground and the rebellion. At 02:00, the chief Sephardic Rabbi of Haifa, Nissim Ohana, came to see them. He spent fifteen minutes encouraging them, although the Rabbi ended up being heartened by the prisoners. Amnon Michaelov, who was judged with them and was in Acre Prison at the same time testified:
Michaelov says that later that night the doors of the corridor opened and the hangman approached the convicts' cell together with some policemen, a military doctor and the manager of the prison in Nablus.
Some time afterwards, prisoners once more heard the "Hatikvah" breaking from the area of the oubliette. All Jewish prisoners then joined in the singing, which rang throughout the building. After twenty minutes, at 04:00 on Tuesday, the prisoners heard Haviv singing. His voice then stopped when he was hanged at 4:03. Haviv died on July 29 at the age of 21. Meir followed and like Haviv, sang until his last moments. Twenty minutes later his body was brought out, and at 04:25 Yaakov Weiss ascended the gallows, where he too sang the "Hatikvah" with other prisoners joining in.
Aftermath.
On the following day, July 30, at 10:00, the funeral cortege of the three fighters proceeded towards the graveyard in Safed in a convoy led by a military vehicle followed by a family car and the "chevra kadisha". Nakar was first to be buried followed by Weiz and Haviv. The shock in Israel was deep at the time, coming as it did on top of an incident that created a storm in the settlement of the SS Exodus.
Charlton resigned as manager of the Acre Prison on the same day. It is known that he refused to execute the men personally and a replacement had to be brought in.
On July 30, the Irgun carried out their threat to kill the two British sergeants they had kidnapped earlier. The soldiers were hanged and their bodies booby-trapped and left in a grove near Netanya. This operation shocked Britain, despite the explicit threat beforehand, and brought to an end hanging of Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine. Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss and Avshalom Haviv were the last to ascend the British gallows.

Gala, the State Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex.
The State Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex Gala was founded according to the initiative and with the assistance of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. 
There have been collected and reconstructed constructions, dwelling places of the Absheron ancient inhabitants as well as reproduced scenes of their lives and occupations. There is also the rich collection of archaeological artifacts, petroglyphs and handicraft products. 
Located in the historical part of Gala Village, this open-air museum complex occupies the 1,5-hectare territory where are unique monuments of scientific, historic and artistic significance. Altogether there are 216 monuments in the territory of Gala Village. Among them are 5 mosques, 3 baths, 4 ovdans (water reservoirs), dwelling houses, agricultural premises, burials, tombs, tumuli, fortress ruins, etc.
Foundations for the Medieval Dwelling Houses.
The foundations, which are to be found in the territory of the museum complex, prove the high level of the town-planning culture of medieval Gala. In fact, they evidently demonstrate the centuries-old town-planning traditions existing in the village. From structural standpoint, these fundaments are rectilinear and rectangular constructions. In the rooms, there are niches-jumakhatun and niches-takhcha, in the living-room – a hearth (kursu), in the kitchen part – tandir (a clay oven for baking bread); there is also a bathroom (suakhan). Each room had its own exit to the yard.
Petroglyphs.
The systematic scientific study of the Eastern Absheron’s monuments was started in the 1960s and resulted in the discovery of petroglyphs dating back to the Bronze and Iron Age. There is a diversity of topics and scenes of the Absheron rock depictions. They reflect the ideology and world-view of ancient people, describe scenes of hunting, human sacrifice, sacred marriage, etc. The central place of some petroglyphs is occupied by the female deity depicted in detail. By the way they were depicted paintings of dog, lion and other wild animals are similar to the painting traditions of the ancient art of the Near and Middle East. Among these petroglyphs are many geometric symbols and khoncha-shaped (diamond-shaped) signs. 
Archaeological Gallery.
One of the most attractive parts of the Museum Complex is the archaeological gallery. There are demonstrated examples of the household ceramics dating back to the 3rd-2nd millennia BC, antiquity and the Middle Ages. Among other exhibits are a stone idol, grain threshers, woman’s ornaments (a copper bracelet, copper earrings, glass and clay beads), coins of the Azerbaijan khanates, fragments of books. 
Dolmen.
The production of building stone as the most widespread material on the Absheron has the ancient traditions. To prove the fact, there are the ancient stone quarries located in different parts of the Absheron. One of the main features of the Absheron ancient constructions is an accurate masonry and stones fixed in the northern part of the constructions, sometimes using big boulders set edgewise in the earth. The latter is to be explained by the climatic conditions of the Absheron, namely, heavy winds mainly blowing from the north. Discovered at the primitive nomadic campsite of Agdashduzu not far from Shuvelan Village, the dolmen dating back to the 3rd millennium BC is one of those constructions. Walls and a roof of the dolmen consist of big stone slabs. 
Two-story House.
According to the climatic conditions of the Absheron as well as to the local traditions, the medieval dwelling houses in Gala Village were enclosed by high stone walls. In the late 19th – early 20th century, timber started to be imported from the Transcaucasus and Russia that was followed by using the wood constructions when building dwelling houses. This practice resulted in the formation of new architectural compositions – two-story dwelling houses.
The first story of the so-called Merchant’s House is dated back to 1810, while the second one – to the end of the 19th century. There is a stone reservoir in the small yard. The first story was used for everyday needs of a family and rooms of the second floor – for guests and as a bedroom. In these rooms, there are a kursu (a hearth), a takhcha (niches) and a jumakhatun (niches divided into shelves like a built-in closet), a lyama (shelves). Located in a yard, the detached kitchen had a tandir (a clay oven for baking bread) and a hearth for cooking, a suakhan (a bathroom), etc. 
Tent.
The history of ancient settlements goes back to the distant past. Emerged at the beginning of the civilization, the first settlements of the primitive people differed from each other in their household activity. In Azerbaijan, the temporary dwellings of the nomadic tribes engaged in stockbreeding had different shapes. Ethnographic researches reveal that the Azerbaijan nomad-stockbreeders preferred a tent-shaped dwelling along with other temporary dwellings. The temporary dwellings were mostly placed in pastures and were easily assembled and disassembled. They had either an oblong or a round form; straw, reed, animal skins and any wood were used as a building material. 
Ancient Settlement in Zirya.
The architectural style of the Absheron ancient settlements features a round shape of buildings. One of those constructions is the ancient settlement of Zirya. The settlement reinforced on the north side by big stone slabs has a hearth in its centre. There are small detached constructions located outside, near the walls. The inner side of the walls is traditionally covered with topical petroglyphs depicting various scenes of religious rituals of the Absheron ancient inhabitants. Additionally, there are depictions of people, animals and different geometric symbols. The eastern side of one of the walls bears a depiction of a deer while in its upper part there is a depicted man with a staff in his hands. According to the ancient people’s interpretation, a deer with branched horns symbolized the sun and a figure of a man with a staff in the religious pantheon – one of the gods. The settlement dates back to the late 3rd – early 2nd millennia BC. 
Ethnographic Scene.
The territory of Azerbaijan has an abundance of copper deposits which were insufficiently discovered. Ancient and multiform art of copper work continue to be appreciated by several generations of the antique lovers. “The ethnographic scene” demonstrates all kinds of copper utensils, which, besides being practical and useful, have high-level artistic features. Here, one can see artifacts dating back more than 300 years. Among the most known Azerbaijan copper wares are items produced by craftsmen from Lagij, the world-known craft and trade center, which have achieved worldwide fame. In the late 19th – early 20th century, the works made by Azerbaijan craftsmen were highly valued in the regular Caucasian exhibitions. The copper wares of Azerbaijan coppersmithes were awarded the top prizes in the Vienne International Exhibition held in 1873. Nowadays, the examples of copper wares produced by Azerbaijan craftsmen are kept in museumsof Russia and Europe. Genre diversity, original skilful approach, adherence to the copper smithing traditions and national roots demonstrate the close connection between everyday life and our people’s traditions.
Marketplaces in Dwelling Quarters.
People always needed to obtain food that was mainly provided by agriculture and stockbreeding. Later, the requirement for everyday foodstaffs was satisfied on bazaars located in all small quarters. 
In the territory of the Museum Complex, there was reconstructed a small covered market where a number of different balances are exhibited. On those small quarter bazaars, one could buy dairy and meat products, vegetables, fruits, etc. 
Tumulus in Tyurkan.
The tumulus located between Govsani and Tyurkan Villages was explored in 2005. Before being cleared, the mound was 15 m in diameter and no more than 1 m in height, and was surrounded by stones. Currently, it looks like a 9-m-diameter circle of stones. In the center, there is a chamber constructed of a number stone blocks. Discovered in the mound, an anthropomorphous stele dating back to the early Bronze Age (3rd-2nd millennia BC) is one of the most interesting finds. This unique archaeological monument has no analogues. On the stele, there are discerned a head turned to the south-west, a neck and a chest. The upper part of a body is decorated with perforations. A small oblong hollow was made in the belly area. The height of the stele is 245 cm, the width of its base is 80 cm. Among other artefacts found in the tumulus are human bone fragments and small-sized pale red crockery. 
Stone Chest Tombs.
Numerous burial types differ from each other either in a geographic location, building materials, a social status of the deceased or in his ethnic origin and religious beliefs. The abundant existence of limestone in Azerbaijan caused this stone to be widely used and produced. The gorgeous and exquisite ornaments of stone plastic art were revealed both in civil, sacred architecture and on tombstones. The medieval tombstones and shrines serve as an example for the aforesaid. Unlike other territory of Azerbaijan, the Absheron tombstones are notable for their original forms. They imitate a stone sarcophagus decorated with geometric and floral ornaments stylistically similar to the architectural décor of the Shirvan architectural school. 
Khaki-khana.
The Absheron ancient settlements date back to the period BC. It can be confirmed by the tumuli discovered during the archaeological excavations, the remains of hearths and burials. 
One of the dwelling types – Khaki-khana is such a monument dating back to 2000-1000 BC. Khaki-khana in Azerbaijani means “a clay room” (khak – clay, khana – a room). Visually, its shape resembles a tent. The inner part is located below ground level while the other one slightly towering above the ground consists of a mix of clay and straw. 
Smith.
The blacksmith's work was one of the most popular crafts in many regions of Azerbaijan, including Baku. According to the intended purpose of the products, the blacksmith’s production was subdivided into three parts: 
- agricultural tools;
- household utensils;
- tools for using in other crafts. 
There were specialized craftsmen involved in each of these three sectors. As a rule, 3-4 men worked in the blacksmith’s shop: a master, journeyman or journeymen-in-training. Their products were sold in the town and country markets. Among the blacksmith’s shops, those specialized in making horse-shoes were widely spread. Mainly located along roadsides, they were engaged in horseshoeing and minor repairs. Horseshoes were divided in three types: a local horseshoe – Lagij nali, a Russian horseshoe – Gazakh nail and Garabagh nali. 
Tumulus in Dubendi.
This is a stone construction 8.60–8 m in diameter. The outer enclosure was composed of one or two horizontally placed stone slabs. In the south-western part of the cromlech (a prehistoric structure usually consisting of several upright processed and unprocessed oblong stones forming one or more concentric circles), there is an outwardly placed anthropomorphous idol for worshiping and sacrifice which is attached to the walls of the cromlech. The ‘box’ altar was composed of stone slabs of different sizes, some of which have lost their initial position. One of the ‘box’ altar’s sides is formed of the aforesaid stone idol. According to the prehistoric people’s religious ideas, the South and the West had different meanings. The South symbolized the Paradise-eternity and calmness, while the West meant the Hell-chaos and impossible catharsis of the soul. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the grave of the dead and the anthropomorphous stele of the God of Death were directed towards the south-west. Accompanying and departing the soul of the dead to the Paradise or the Hell depended on his activities while being alive. Located in the center, the burial chamber was composed of four solid plates. There were discovered bones of the dead, fragments of clay crockery and beads. The tumulus in Dubendi is not only a sepulchral monument but also a Bronze Age original architectural structure dating back to the 3rd millennium BC. 
Grain Threshing Floor.
Azerbaijan is one of the ancient agricultural countries. Agriculture was one of the main occupations of the local people, including inhabitants of Gala Village. By the popular etymology, the name of the village means “a bread place”. After mowing, wheat was delivered to a grain threshing floor and was ground using the wood threshers. Wheat was spread around on the surface of the circle, where rotating threshers were dragged by horses or donkeys. The grain was separated from the loosened chaff and rolled down into the hollow in the center. After being threshed, the grain was brought to a mill for grinding. For these purposes, there were used millstones driven by draught animals. Grain thrashers were also used for grinding. 
Menhir.
Due to their original forms, some stones were considered by the prehistoric people to be idols and deities. From this standpoint, the menhir (a large upright standing stone) was believed to be sacred. The local people worshiped the menhir, said their prayers here, offered gifts and sacrifices. 
House.
The two-domed classical one-story dwelling houses date back to the 17th-18th century. The dwelling houses consisting of two or more rooms were built according to a social and economic status of the family. Most of the dwelling houses built in the territory of Gala were the two-domed constructions. The key reasons for building such type of dwellings were climatic conditions, lack of wood and abundance of limestone deposits. The one-story house consists of two rooms. On the flat surface of the roof, there are two dome-shaped chimneys and a stone drain. The roof surface was clayed. The utility room has a tandir and a hearth for cooking. There is a suakhan (a bathroom) in a corner of the kitchen part. In the living room, there are a takhcha and a jumakhatun (niches for different goods), as well as a lyama (shelves). In the center of the room, there is a kursu (a hearth). 
Potter.
One of the most ancient crafts in Azerbaijan is the pottery. The ceramics discovered during the archaeological excavations testify again the centuries-old history of the pottery. According to different resources, the history of the pottery development in Azerbaijan dates back to the 2nd millennium BC. The main stage of the pottery is the clay preparation (its selection, extraction, transportation, preparation for production and storage). Traditionally, there were two types of a potter’s wheel in Azerbaijan: manual and pedal-powered. Among the main potter’s tools were a comb, pottery knife, gelem (a pen), wire, paddle, etc. Another important process of the pottery is firing the ceramics in hearths, pits, tandirs, open and closed kilns. Much attention was devoted to glazing and decorating the ceramics. Diversity of everyday household activities caused to the production of numerous types of ceramics.

Sampit conflict

The Sampit conflict was an outbreak of inter-ethnic violence in Indonesia, beginning in February 2001 and lasting throughout the year. The conflict started in the town of Sampit, Central Kalimantan Province, and spread throughout the province, including the capital, Palangkaraya. The conflict was between the indigenous Dayak people and the migrant Madurese from the island of Madura. 
It broke out on February 18, 2001 when two Madurese were attacked by a number of Dayaks. The conflict resulted in more than 500 deaths, with over 100,000 Madurese displaced from their homes. Many Madurese were also found decapitated by the Dayaks.
Background.
The Sampit conflict in 2001 was not an isolated incident, as there had been previous incidents of violence between the Dayaks and the Madurese. The last major conflict occurred between December 1996 and January 1997, and resulted in more than 600 deaths. The Madurese first arrived in Borneo in 1930 under the transmigration program initiated by the Dutch colonial administration, and continued by the Indonesian government. In 1999, Muslim Malays and Animist Dayaks joined together in Kalimantan in Indonesia to persecute and massacre Muslim Madurese during the Sambas conflict. Madurese were mutilated, raped, and killed by the Malays and Dayaks and 3,000 of them died in the massacres, with the Indonesian government doing little to stop the violence. 
In 2000, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in Central Kalimantan. The Dayaks are said to be dissatisfied with the increased competition coming from the more aggressive Madurese. New laws had allowed the Madurese to assume control of many commercial industries in the province, such as logging, mining, and plantations.
There are a number of stories purportedly describing the incident that sparked the violence in 2001. One version claims that it was caused by an arson attack on a Dayak house. Rumours spread that the fire was caused by Madurese, and later a group of Dayaks began burning houses in a Madurese neighborhood.
Professor Usop of the Dayak People's Association claims that the massacres by the Dayaks were in self-defense, after Dayaks were attacked. It was claimed that a Dayak was tortured and killed by a gang of Madurese following a gambling dispute in the nearby village of Kerengpangi on December 17, 2000.
Another version claims that the conflict started in a brawl between students of different races at the same school.
Decapitations of Madurese.
At least 100 Madurese were decapitated by Dayaks during the conflict. The Dayaks have a history in the ritual practice of headhunting, though the practice was thought to have died out in the early 20th century.
Response by authorities.
The scale of the massacre made it difficult for the military and the police to control the situation in Central Kalimantan. Reinforcements were sent in to help existing personnel in the province. By February 18, the Dayaks assumed control over Sampit.
Police arrested a local official believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the attacks. The masterminds are suspected of paying six men to provoke the riot in Sampit. The police also arrested a number of rioters following the initial murder spree.
Later, on February 21, thousands of Dayaks surrounded a police station in Palangkaraya demanding the release of detainees. The police succumbed to this demand. By, February 28, the military had managed to clear the Dayaks off the streets, but sporadic violence continued throughout the year.

After a short stint with Karlsruher SC, he once again returned to Offenbach in 1987. In 1989, 1. FC Kaiserslautern called him up to the Bundesliga. With Kaiserslautern, Stumpf won the German Cup in 1990 and the German Championship in 1991. His Cup win also provided a football novelty: only a few hours earlier, his sister Daniela Stumpf had won the women’s cup competition with FSV Frankfurt on exactly the same pitch. In 1992, Stumpf joined Galatasaray Istanbul and went on to win the double of Turkish league title and cup competition in 1993. In 1994, he added yet another Turkish league title to his résumé. Following this success, he returned to Germany. After playing two more seasons at 1. FC Köln, he went to Japan's Brumell Sendai, only to stay there for less than six months. Back in Germany, he joined Hannover 96’s minor league team in 1997 before ending his active professional career here.
Coaching career.
As assistant coach under Otto Rehhagel at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Stumpf's coaching career kicked off seamlessly. After Rehhagel's resignation in October 2000, Stumpf became head coach, Andreas Brehme taking over as the Red Devils team manager. In 2002, however, Reinhard Stumpf was dismissed. Between September 2002 and May 2007, he worked as assistant coach under Erik Gerets – first until February 2004 at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, which rehired him after his earlier dismissal, followed by one more year at VfL Wolfsburg until 2005. The duo's last stop was a two-year stint with renowned Turkish club Galatasaray Istanbul, winning the 2005/2006 season Turkish league title. In September 2007, Stumpf succeeded Fuat Çapa as head coach at Gençlerbirliği Ankara. His contract, however, was already ended at the end of October. In August 2009, he once again became assistant coach under Erik Gerets, this time at Al-Hilal (Saudi Arabia) in the Saudi Professional League. In 2010, he won the Saudi Championship as well as the Crown Prince Cup at Al-Hilal. Following Geret's departure in October 2010, he worked as interim head coach for the professional team before taking over Al-Hilal's U21 team in November 2010. In September 2011 he has signed his contract as head coach at Tunisian side Club Sportif Sfaxien.
On 29 December 2011, Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 side CS Sfaxien have fired coach Reinhard Stumpf due to the German's apparent inability to communicate adequately with his underperforming players.
On 5 January 2012 he succeeded Rudi Bommer as manager of German 3rd Liga club Wacker Burghausen. On July 2013 Reinhard Stumpf became head coach of Al-Hilal's U21 team again.

Cervical mucus plug

A cervical mucus plug (operculum) is a plug that fills and seals the cervical canal during pregnancy. It is formed by a small amount of cervical mucus. 
The mucus plug acts as a protective barrier by deterring the passage of bacteria into the uterus, and contains a variety of antimicrobial agents, including immunoglobulins, and similar antimicrobial peptides to those found in nasal mucus.
Normally during human pregnancy, the mucus is cloudy, clear, thick, and sticky. Toward the end of the pregnancy, when the cervix thins, some blood is released into the cervix which causes the mucus to become bloody. As the woman gets closer to labor, the mucus plug discharges as the cervix begins to dilate. The plug may come out as a plug, a lump, or simply as increased vaginal discharge over several days. The mucus may be tinged with brown, pink, or red blood, which is why the event is sometimes referred to as "bloody show". Loss of the mucus plug by no means implies that delivery or labor is imminent.
Having intercourse or a vaginal examination can also disturb the mucus plug and cause a woman to see some blood-tinged discharge, even when labor does not begin over the next few days.

Sir Thomas Miller, 6th Baronet

Sir Thomas Combe Miller, 6th Baronet (1781–29 June 1864), was an English clergyman and landowner. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge.
The second but eldest surviving son of Sir Thomas Miller, 5th Baronet, Miller became a Church of England priest and Vicar of Froyle, Hampshire, in 1811. He was largely responsible for the rebuilding of the nave of the parish church in 1812. He had an elder brother, John Miller, who died in 1804, so in 1816 he inherited the family seat, Froyle Place, becoming both Vicar and Lord of the manor of Froyle. For many years he had a curate named Aubutin who took care of the stained glass in the church.
On 24 February 1820, when an election for the Hampshire county constituency was approaching, Miller wrote to George Purefoy-Jervoise, a successful candidate, to say that he would be away on polling day but would use his influence among his tenants to secure votes for Jervoise.
On 5 May 1824, Miller married Martha, daughter of the Rev. John Holmes. They had five sons, Sir Charles Hayes Miller, 7th Baronet (1829–1868), Sir Henry John Miller (born 1830), who became Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council, Major Thomas Edmund Miller (born 1832), George Miller CB (born 1833), Assistant Secretary in the Education Department, and Richard Combe Miller JP DL (born 1841); and three daughters, Marianne, Frances Margaret, and Georgina Emily.
Between 1803 and 1805, Miller was buying several pieces of land in Holybourne. In 1846, he expanded his estate by buying a property near his Park at Froyle, described as: "The Shrubbery, Froyle, comprising a dwelling house with outhouses, outbuildings gardens, lawn, a shrubbery, plantation and 2 pieces of meadow or pasture... along with coach houses, stables and other buildings with a yard and adjoining land.
As well as Froyle, he inherited and was lord of the manors of Ludshott, which he sold in 1825 for £17,000, and Fishbourne in Sussex, which he sold to Edward Stanford.
Miller's grandson, Sir Hubert Miller, said of him in 1936, "My grandfather hunted hard to hounds and drank two bottles of port with his dinner. I wonder he wasn’t sick." It was also reported that on hot Sunday mornings the sixth Baronet would smash the church windows with his walking stick to let air in.

<doc id="18839594" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18839594" title="Test strategy">
Test strategy

A test strategy is an outline that describes the testing approach of the software development cycle. It is created to inform project managers, testers, and developers about some key issues of the testing process. This includes the testing objective, methods of testing new functions, total time and resources required for the project, and the testing environment.
Test strategies describe how the product risks of the stakeholders are mitigated at the test-level, which types of test are to be performed, and which entry and exit criteria apply. They are created based on development design documents. System design documents are primarily used and occasionally, conceptual design documents may be referred to. Design documents describe the functionality of the software to be enabled in the upcoming release. For every stage of development design, a corresponding test strategy should be created to test the new feature sets.
Test Levels.
The test strategy describes the test level to be performed. There are primarily three levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. In most software development organizations, the developers are responsible for unit testing. Individual testers or test teams are responsible for integration and system testing.
Roles and Responsibilities.
The roles and responsibilities of test leader, individual testers, project manager are to be clearly defined at a project level in this section. This may not have names associated: but the role has to be very clearly defined. 
Testing strategies should be reviewed by the developers. They should also be reviewed by test leads for all levels of testing to make sure the coverage is complete yet not overlapping. Both the testing manager and the development managers should approve the test strategy before testing can begin.
Environment Requirements.
Environment requirements are an important part of the test strategy. It describes what operating systems are used for testing. It also clearly informs the necessary OS patch levels and security updates required. For example, a certain test plan may require Windows XP Service Pack 3 to be installed as a prerequisite for testing.
Testing Tools.
There are two methods used in executing test cases: manual and automated. Depending on the nature of the testing, it is usually the case that a combination of manual and automated testing is the best testing method.
Risks and Mitigation.
Any risks that will affect the testing process must be listed along with the mitigation. By documenting a risk, its occurrence can be anticipated well ahead of time. Proactive action may be taken to prevent it from occurring, or to mitigate its damage. Sample risks are dependency of completion of coding done by sub-contractors, or capability of testing tools.
Test Schedule.
A "test plan" should make an estimation of how long it will take to complete the testing phase. There are many requirements to complete testing phases. First, testers have to execute all test cases at least once. Furthermore, if a defect was found, the developers will need to fix the problem. The testers should then re-test the failed test case until it is functioning correctly. Last but not the least, the tester need to conduct regression testing towards the end of the cycle to make sure the developers did not accidentally break parts of the software while fixing another part. This can occur on test cases that were previously functioning properly.
The test schedule should also document the number of testers available for testing. If possible, assign test cases to each tester.
It is often difficult to make an accurate estimate of the test schedule since the testing phase involves many uncertainties. Planners should take into account the extra time needed to accommodate contingent issues. One way to make this approximation is to look at the time needed by the previous releases of the software. If the software is new, multiplying the initial testing schedule approximation by two is a good way to start.
Regression Test Approach.
When a particular problem is identified, the programs will be debugged and the fix will be done to the program. To make sure that the fix works, the program will be tested again for that criteria. Regression test will make sure that one fix does not create some other problems in that program or in any other interface. So, a set of related test cases may have to be repeated again, to make sure that nothing else is affected by a particular fix. How this is going to be carried out must be elaborated in this section. In some companies, whenever there is a fix in one unit, all unit test cases for that unit will be repeated, to achieve a higher level of quality.
Test Groups.
From the list of requirements, we can identify related areas, whose functionality is similar. These areas are the test groups. For example, in a railway reservation system, anything related to ticket booking is a functional group; anything related with report generation is a functional group. Same way, we have to identify the test groups based on the functionality aspect.
Test Priorities.
Among test cases, we need to establish priorities. While testing software projects, certain test cases will be treated as the most important ones and if they fail, the product cannot be released. Some other test cases may be treated like cosmetic and if they fail, we can release the product without much compromise on the functionality. This priority levels must be clearly stated. These may be mapped to the test groups also.
Test Status Collections and Reporting.
When test cases are executed, the test leader and the project manager must know, where exactly the project stands in terms of testing activities. To know where the project stands, the inputs from the individual testers must come to the test leader. This will include, what test cases are executed, how long it took, how many test cases passed, how many failed, and how many are not executable. Also, how often the project collects the status is to be clearly stated. Some projects will have a practice of collecting the status on a daily basis or weekly basis.
Test Records Maintenance.
When the test cases are executed, we need to keep track of the execution details like when it is executed, who did it, how long it took, what is the result etc. This data must be available to the test leader and the project manager, along with all the team members, in a central location. This may be stored in a specific directory in a central server and the document must say clearly about the locations and the directories. The naming convention for the documents and files must also be mentioned.
Requirements traceability matrix.
Ideally, the software must completely satisfy the set of requirements. From design, each requirement must be addressed in every single document in the software process. The documents include the HLD, LLD, source codes, unit test cases, integration test cases and the system test cases. In a requirements traceability matrix, the rows will have the requirements. The columns represent each document. Intersecting cells are marked when a document addresses a particular requirement with information related to the requirement ID in the document. Ideally, if every requirement is addressed in every single document, all the individual cells have valid section ids or names filled in. Then we know that every requirement is addressed. If any cells are empty, it represents that a requirement has not been correctly addressed.
Test Summary.
The senior management may like to have test summary on a weekly or monthly basis. If the project is very critical, they may need it even on daily basis. This section must address what kind of test summary reports will be produced for the senior management along with the frequency.
The test strategy must give a clear vision of what the testing team will do for the whole project for the entire duration. This document can be presented to the client, if needed. The person, who prepares this document, must be functionally strong in the product domain, with very good experience, as this is the document that is going to drive the entire team for the testing activities. Test strategy must be clearly explained to the testing team members right at the beginning of the project.

Walchensee

Walchensee or Lake Walchen is one of the deepest and largest alpine lakes in Germany, with a maximum depth of and an area of . The lake is south of Munich in the middle of the Bavarian Alps. The entire lake, including the island of Sassau, is within the municipality of Kochel. To the east and the south, the lake borders the municipality of Jachenau.
Etymology.
The name "Walchen" comes from Middle High German and means "strangers". All Roman and romanized peoples of the Alps south of Bavaria were known to the locals as "Welsche" or even "Walche". This is also true of the etymology of the Swiss Lake Walen and the Salzburg Wallersee.
Another possible interpretation is that it comes from the Latin "Lacus vallensis", meaning "lake in a valley". On 16th-century maps, the lake is also labelled "dicto Italico", meaning "leading to Italy", probably because the route through the Walchensee valley led through Mittenwald and Innsbruck to Italy.
Geography.
Genesis.
Walchensee fills a tectonic valley, part of the "Bayerisches Synklinorium" (Bavarian Syncline) and from rocks of the triassic period (the main dolomite, Plattenkalke, and Kössener layers). The extreme depth of the lake, , is the result of this tectonic formation. The rock faces of the northwestern shore clearly show the steep arrangement of the rock layers. The creation of the lake from the forces of mountain building indicate that Walchensee could be one of the oldest lakes in Germany. During the ice age, the Isar–Loisach glacier repeatedly left its mark on the morphology of the area and thereby the Walchensee.
Location and surrounding communities.
The mountain lake has a shoreline of approximately and contains of water. The Jachen is the natural outflow of the lake, eastwards through the valley of Jachenau to the Isar. Obernach is the largest natural inflow to the lake, which flows in from the southwest. Together with the artificial inflow (see "Peculiarities"), the lake has a catchment basin of .
Walchensee lies at above sea level. It is surrounded by wooded mountains. To the northwest stands the Herzogstand–Heimgarten group at and respectively and to the west is the valley of the Eschenlaine. The south side of the Eschenlaine valley is the Simetsberg (), which is the end of the Ester Mountains. To the south of the lake, the Altlacher Hochkopf separates Walchensee from the valley of the Isar. On the eastern shore lies the Jachenau, a long alpine valley that stretches in the direction of Lenggries. The northeast is dominated by the Benediktenwand. A little further to the west is Jochberg (), which completes the valley wall. Between Herzogstand and Jochberg is little Kesselberg, which because of its relatively low prominence appears as a depression between the two higher peaks, but actually separates Walchensee from Kochelsee, below.
Directly on the west bank of the lake is the tiny "Luftkurort" settlement of Walchensee, with only about 600 inhabitants. Walchensee belongs to the municipality of Kochel as do the yet smaller settlements of Urfeld at the northern tip of the lake, Zwergen on the western shore, and the houses of Einsiedl am Walchensee on the orographic left bank of the Obernach at the far southwestern end of the lake. The houses of Einsiedl am Walchensee on the right bank of the Obernach and Altlach on the southern shore, the farmsteads of Matheis, Christopher, and Breitort, Sachenbach on the east shore, and Niedernach in the far southwest, belong to the municipality of Jachenau. Between the settlements of Walchensee and Einsiedl, the Katzenkopf peninsula reaches into the lake. The settlement of Zwergen lies on this peninsula.
The surface of the lake forms a north-facing triangle, with the southern shore forming a base from Einsiedl to Niedernach and the height reaching from Breitort to Urfeld.
Climate.
Due to its location in a valley, the lake is protected from northern and eastern winds. The relatively low mountains on the south shore let in the optimal amount of sunlight, giving Walchensee a milder climate than one might expect in the mountains. During the summer months, heat on southern side of Herzogstand and Jochberg create strong thermals on sunny days. Stable thermal winds blow generally southwest. When the thermals carry saturated air masses from the Walchensee high into the air and mix with air from the more northerly Kochelsee by a prevailing wind from the northwest, it can lead to particularly violent thunderstorms.
In contrast to a Foehn, when a Katabatic wind blows from south to north, the associated dry air ensures excellent visibility.
History.
Since prehistoric times the local population has probably felt a close association with the lake; for example until the 18th century is was customary to throw consecrated gold coins into the deepest part of the lake.
The wealth of fish in the lake led the monasteries of Benediktbeuern Abbey and Schlehdorf Abbey to claim Walchensee by 740 AD. The monasteries owned the lake until secularization in 1803. The abbey at Benediktbeuern had more rights than Schlehdorf. Today the free state of Bavaria owns Walchensee.
In Munich around 1900, the idea of using the drop between Walchensee and Kochelsee to generate power was born. Dives to survey the lake bottom were already under way by 1903. The driving force behind this venture was Oskar von Miller, who founded the Deutsches Museum in 1903. The approval process dragged on until 1918. Construction work began immediately after World War I. On 24 January 1924 water from Walchensee turned the turbines at the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station on the shore of the Kochelsee for the first time.
During World War II at least two aircraft ditched and sank into the lake. In April 1945 the Wehrmacht and officials of the Reichsbank approved a plan to store at least part of the reserves of the German Reichsbank at Einsiedl, a small town on the south-west shore. Subsequently, the assets were buried in an undisclosed location in the crags above the Obernach power-plant. The assets consisted of 365 sacks, each with two gold bars, nine envelopes with gold documents, four crates of gold, two bags of gold coins, six boxes of Danish coins, and 94 sacks of foreign currency. The foreign currency was mainly U.S. dollars and Swiss francs. On 6 June 1945, the treasure was handed over to the Allies. 100 gold bars and all the U.S. dollars and Swiss francs were missing. Possibly there are other hoards, where valuables such as other currencies or gemstones were hidden. Even today, speculation continues about the existence and exact location of such caches.
Since the 1950s, Walchensee has become a popular destination for day trips from Munich and other upper Bavarian cities as well as for tourists. The local population now lives primarily from tourism.
Biology.
Ecology.
The clear waters with an average visibility of 8–10 m owes its turquoise-green color to the relatively high proportion of calcium carbonate. The waters of Walchensee rate as water quality class 1 under the saprobic system. The temperature of the water is relatively low, which is typical for a mountain lake. In summer the water temperature ranges from to and from to in the spring and fall. The nutrient load on the originally oligotrophic Walchensee has declined since the mid-1980s, due to improvements in sanitation in Mittenwald. 
The Walchensee including its shores is a Lanschaftsschutzgebiet "landscape protection area". Of the south shore, are set aside for recreational purposes, such as bathing. The rest of the shore drops steeply for the most part. The western lakeshore is undeveloped, with a few exceptions.
The island of Sassau () is a nature reserve and is off limits all year round. The island is long and wide in the west. In the east it is only half as wide. Its highest point is above the surface of the lake.
Flora and fauna.
More than 500 years ago, the first fish species was introduced into the lake. In 1480 Coregonus were introduced from Kochelsee, followed by char from Tegernsee. The lake environment can be divided into three zones: shore, bottom, and open water. The following table lists the fish that can be found in these zones.
More than 50% of the fish that live here are threatened or at least endangered in Bavaria or in this stock, such as the Wels catfish or "Rutilus meidingerii". The Swan mussel is also on the red list of endangered plant and animals.
In 2003, Upper Bavaria began a project to stock Walchensee again with European crayfish "Astacus astacus". For this purpose, 1900 crayfish were captured in Eibsee, west of Garmish-Partenkirchen. However, success of the resettlement can only be declared once five years have passed.
For many bird species, the lake and the island Sassau offer excellent breeding opportunities. For migrating birds, it offers a safe winter quarters or resting place for further migration. In addition to Red-necked and Black-necked Grebes, Mallards, and Eurasian Coots, one can find Common Mergansers and Great Northern Divers here.
Near the shore in many inlets, "Ranunculus fluitans" and "Myriophyllum spicatum" grow just below the surface. The vegetable plankton Diatoms and Green algae together with the animal plantons Water fleas ("Cyclops" sp.) and occur in virtually all areas on the lake. Also in the shore zone grow native "Phragmites" and "Schoenoplectus". "Nymphaea alba" and "Nuphar lutea" offer reliable shelter to more than just the Grass Snake.
Tourism.
Like other large lakes, such as Tegernsee, Walchensee plays a major role is tourism for the region. Enthusiasts of windsurfing and sailing take advantage of the continuous thermal winds of the summer months. Creation of thermals is encouraged by winds from the East or North and by the relatively large day and night temperatures. The clear waters with visibility of up to and a whole series of car, boat, and even aircraft wrecks make the lake particularly interesting for scuba divers. In addition to the usual activities, such as swimming and hiking, those seeking recreation in the winter months can hike and cross country ski in the surrounding mountains.
The "Herzogstandbahn", a gondola lift, runs from Spring to Fall from Walchensee up the Fahrenberg. From there one can walk past the Herzogstandhaus to the top of the Herzogstand in 30–45 minutes.
Points of interest.
Walchensee Power Station.
In 1924, Bayernwerk AG put the Lake Walchen Power Plant into operation on the south shore of Kochelsee. Six pipes carry water from Walchensee 200 m down the mountain to the hydroelectric plant. In order to increase the amount of water available for the plant, a 7-km long tunnel was driven in the Karwendel to tap the Rißbach and Isar rivers, feeding Walchensee. Overall, Walchensee has an average volume of 1.3 billion cubic meters. Two smaller hydroelectric plants were built directly on Walchensee: one at the mouth of the Niedernach in the southeast and one on the Obernach in the southwest.
Large amounts of water are only taken from lake during winter months so as not to disturb the tourist industry during the peak season. Because of the large fluctuations in water level during the winter, the lake no longer freezes.
The ice that does form in the individual bays is very thin and is off limits.
Wrecks.
On the lakebottom is a series of wrecks, including three aircraft. From World War II there is a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and a British Avro Lancaster bomber. Among the debris the remains of an Aero Commander 680W was found. The high-wing twin-engine plane with the markings D-ID MON crashed into the lake on 27 December 1978 after its tail broke off. The plane crashed in shallow water and was immediately salvaged along with its crew.
The wrecks of two cars near the shore, a Volkswagen Beetle and a Ford, are also popular for divers to explore.
Landscape painting.
In 1934, the painter Lorenzo Quaglio the Younger immortalized Walchensee in an oil painting titled simply "Der Walchensee". The painting hangs today in the Munich City Museum. 
After World War I, the artist Lovis Corinth bought a house in Urfeld. From 1919 until the end of his life in 1925, the Impressionist spent his summer months along with his wife at the lake. His success as a landscape painter rests on the work he did with Walchensee as a subject. He did more than 60 of these paintings.

Graham Maxwell

Arthur Graham Crowder Maxwell (18 July 1921 – 28 November 2010), often abbreviated as A. Graham Maxwell, was a Seventh-day Adventist theologian, and the emeritus professor of New Testament studies at Loma Linda University. In a 1985 survey of 55 religion teachers at North American Adventist colleges, Maxwell tied for fourth place among most influential Adventist authors.
Biography.
1921–1936: Early years in England.
A. Graham Maxwell was born in Watford, England on July 18, 1921. His father was "Uncle Arthur" Maxwell, who was known for his children's books. His mother was Rachel Elizabeth Maxwell (née Joyce). In the Maxwell home were six children, four boys and two girls. First Maureen, then Graham, Mervyn, Lawrence, Malcolm, and Deirdre. All the children in their younger days attended non-Adventist schools. They all grew up devoted Seventh-day Adventists. Most of them became influential leaders within the church. 
Music played an important part in young Maxwell's life. At fifteen years of age he sang for the 1936 British Union's quadrennial session held at Stanborough Park. The British Advent Messenger reported that "Master Graham Maxwell, the boy singer of the Stanborough Park church, pleasingly rendered the solo, 'How lovely are Thy dwellings'". A week earlier, at a youth rally, he is reported to have sung what some might view as a prayer later answered in his own life, "God Make Me Kind." 
Early influences apart from immediate family include R. A. Anderson who was an associate of his father. (Anderson received a call to California the same time his father did.); F. C. Gilbert; W.G.C. Murdoch; Meade MacGuire. His uncle, Spencer George Crowder Maxwell, left for Africa a year before Maxwell was born. Spencer's influence was one of respected service and the occasional visit, such as the 1936 meetings, also attended by the 15 year old Maxwell.
1938–1943: Student years at Pacific Union College.
He came to America in 1936, and lived in Los Altos, California where his father was editor for the Signs of the Times. In 1938, he began studies at Pacific Union College. He was the spokesperson for the new students at the reception and handshake services. By 1940, he held was one of the student leaders. He helped earn his way through college by selling Christian books as a colporteur. Maxwell began teaching Greek as a student in 1942.
Maxwell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Pacific Union College with a double major in Ministerial and Biblical Languages. He met Rosalyn Helen Gildersleeve at Pacific Union College, and they married in 1943. They had three girls, Lorna, Audrey and Alice. By his death in 2010, he had 7 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren. In 1945, as instructor of Greek and English, he gave the April Rine lecture before an audience of teachers and students of the English and language departments. His subject was the Romantic movement in English literature. In 1946 Maxwell met W. G. C. Murdoch, the principal of the England's SDA college. Murdoch reported: "It was a pleasant surprise to meet young Graham Maxwell in Chicago. Graham has grown to be very like his father and is giving such promise as a teacher that the college board of Pacific Union College has voted him time off to study for his doctor's degree at the University of Chicago..." 
He received his Ph.D. in New Testament in 1959 from the University of Chicago Divinity School; his thesis: 'Elements of Interpretation in the Translation of the New Testament.' He focused especially on the book of Romans. Upon receiving his doctorate, he was appointed Chairman of the Division of Religion at Pacific Union College, replacing L. H. Hartin who retired at the close of the 1959 school year. Maxwell remained division chair until moving to Loma Linda in 1961.
Leadership experience.
In 1948, Maxwell was elected president of the PUC Alumni Association (for a two year term.) In July, 1950, some 500 P.U.C. alumni gathered in San Francisco's Whitcomb Hotel for a Luncheon timed to coincide with the influx of denominational workers from all over the world for the General Conference meetings. Maxwell was toastmaster for the occasion. Back on campus, he organized and led out in faculty and staff social events. 
In 1950, both he and his brother Mervyn were ordained to the Gospel ministry.
1961–1988: Teaching years at Loma Linda University.
Maxwell taught at Loma Linda University for the next 27 years, and for 15 of those years he was the Director of the Division of Religion. In 1983, at a ministerial retreat in Michigan, Maxwell was honored for forty years of service to the Seventh-day Adventist church. In 1988 he retired from Loma Linda University as an Emeritus Professor of New Testament. To encourage such thinking, he began a class in what he called Biblical Philosophy. Central to this philosophy were these questions: "Is God arbitrary, vengeful, stern, and severe; as His enemies have made Him out to be? Or, is He very patient, and kind, and forgiveness personified?" 
His sense of humor was appreciated by many. One associate describes a visit by Maxwell to their house. It was middle August in Southern California. The father of the house "came to the door wearing a plaid work shirt, open at the neck to reveal heavy underwear, heavy wool pants, wearing lined gloves." Maxwell asked him if he could come up to his house which was under construction, and give him some building advice. The father agreed and went to get his cap and jacket. The son said to Maxwell that his father seems to have the same problem that King David had in old age. Maxwell paused for a second and then said, "Yes, but it seems he has found a different solution."
1988–2010: Retirement years.
In 2005, A special event celebrating the founding of Loma Linda University took place November 11 to 13, at Loma Linda University's Drayson Center. On Sabbath morning, November 12, worship services were led by longtime faculty members Maxwell and Louis Venden. 
In 2006, at the Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) Centennial Gala, “Looking Back to the Future,” held on April 9, Maxwell was honored with the Vanguard Award for Mission of Wholeness, "to make man whole”, along with eleven others. Recipients for the Vanguard Award for Mission of Wholeness were: Wil Alexander, Leonard Brand, Beverly Buckles, Harrison Evans, Kiti Freier, Gordon Hadley, George Hardinge IV, Lucille Lewis, Maxwell, William Murdoch Jr., Jack Provonsha, and Gerald Winslow.
Theology.
God.
"Can God Be Trusted?".
In December, 1976, Neal C. Wilson, President of the North American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church visited Maxwell at Loma Linda University. Subsequently in the Review and Herald, he announced: "Early in December I was at Loma Linda University and visited with A. Graham Maxwell about the progress he is making in writing two books. The first deals with the question "Can God be trusted?" and the second develops the theme "The picture of God and what we are told about His character in all 66 books of the Bible."...
"Dr. Maxwell, a respected and much-appreciated professor of religion at Loma Linda University, has been granted a leave of absence for three quarters to concentrate on writing these much-needed books. One of the critical issues currently being discussed in theological circles and religious journals has to do with misconceptions about God's character. This should come as no surprise to Seventh-day Adventists, because Ellen G. White has warned us that in the final struggle of the great controversy between Christ and Satan everything possible will be done to distort and malign God's character. Creating doubt and destroying faith in the integrity of God's character has been one of the most effective tools employed by Satan. Each of us is a target for the deceptive efforts of evil forces seeking to discredit God's love and weaken faith in His word..." 
Maxwell's book "Can God Be Trusted?" became the Seventh-day Adventist Church's Missionary Book of the Year for 1978. This book was published by sections in the twelve issues of the Signs of the Times in that same year.
Belief in a personal God.
Maxwell held to a theistic worldview. In his book "Can God Be Trusted" he begins by describing a conflict that arose between God and Lucifer who later became known as Satan. Adventists consider this the beginning of what they refer to as the Great Controversy. Maxwell focused on Lucifer's lies about God:
"To set himself up as God he first must undermine confidence in the One he wished to supplant, and he sought to do this by destroying God's reputation. Since he could find no fault in God, he must resort to lying and deceit. 
So began that long struggle for the loyalty of God's free, intelligent creatures. Who was right? God or the brilliant Light Bearer? Could it be true that God was arbitrary and severe, unworthy of the love and trust of the beings He had made? What kind of god would allow his character to be so challenged? Was it strength or weakness that led our God to permit such long debate, to allow this controversy to spread throughout His universe? 
Finally Satan and his followers ventured into open revolt. Then God, in His farsighted plan for the best good of all concerned, expelled the rebels from His presence, and the great controversy was extended to the planet on which we live." 
God, according to Maxwell, was the creator of all things who took actions motivated by love for all.
The Bible as God's special revelation.
Bible translations and the word of God.
In 1952, at thirty-one years of age, Elder Maxwell expressed confidence and good will toward Biblical scholars and translators. He stated that their work in translating the Bible may be of varied quality, but any version sincerely prepared by a qualified scholar(s) may rightfully claim to be the word of God: 
"A recent sensational article in Look magazine has suggested that modern research among the ancient manuscripts of the Bible is revealing that actually we are quite uncertain about the authenticity of a large share of the Biblical text. The writer was particularly referring to an enormous research project now in progress on both sides of the Atlantic with headquarters at Oxford and Chicago Universities. 
The purpose of this vast endeavor is to completely recheck the sources of the New Testament text in the thousands of Greek manuscripts, the early versions, the lectionaries, and the writings of the early fathers of the church. I have watched friends of mine at work on this project—and very tedious but thorough work it is. The results will hardly be those so shockingly presented in the Look article, but rather will provide further evidence of the remarkable preservation of the Scriptural text. 
There is still only one Bible, but more and still more versions. Not all are of equal quality, but any version sincerely prepared by an adequately qualified scholar or committee of scholars—and this would include all of the better known versions—may rightfully claim to be the word of God." 
Salvation.
Sin.
Maxwell defined sin as a "breakdown of trust in God" 
He wrote:
"The fact that God’s friends are not so preoccupied with their legal standing does not mean that they take sin lightly. Precisely the opposite is true! Whereas servants are concerned about breaking the rules, friends are concerned about anything that would undermine trust and damage their relationship with God. Most of all, they are concerned about anything that would in any way misrepresent God—whether or not the details have been spelled out in any law.
Friends understand salvation as the healing of the damage sin has done. And sin’s damage, if not healed, is nothing less than fatal. Disorderly, irresponsible behavior, if persisted in, can totally destroy the capacity for trust and trustworthiness.
To the servant, what makes sin most dangerous is that it angers God.
To the friend, what makes sin most dangerous is what it does to the sinner. To persist in sin is to destroy oneself." 
The Gospel as the good news about God.
"The good news is that God is not the kind of person Satan has made Him out to be... Since the great controversy began, it 
has been Satan's studied purpose to persuade angels and men that God is not worthy of their faith and love. He has pictured the Creator as a harsh, demanding tyrant who lays arbitrary requirements upon His people just to show His authority and test their 
willingness to obey... ("But") instead of destroying or resorting to force, God simply took His case into court. In order to prove the rightness of His cause, to demonstrate that His way of governing the universe was the best for all concerned, God humbly submitted His own character to the investigation and judgment of His creatures... The good news is that God has won His case. Though all of us should let Him down, God cannot lose His case. He has already won! The universe has conceded that the evidence is on His side, that the devil has lied in his charges against God."
Maxwell asserted that Jesus showed the truth about the Father: 
"It is finished," Jesus cried. John 19:30. By the life that He lived and the unique and awful way He died, Jesus has demonstrated the righteousness of His Father and has answered any question about God's character and government. See Romans 3:25, 26." 
Controversy about salvation.
Many charges have been made that Maxwell taught the moral influence theory of the atonement although Maxwell denied it.
Alden Thompson has compared various different Adventist theologians to either Peter, Paul or Apollos. He compares Maxwell to Apollos, because of their shared emphasis on God's love.
Christian life.
Prayer and Bible application.
In 1941, at twenty years of age, student colporteur Maxwell expressed his belief in prayer and in persistence. He used a biblical story to help him meet a difficult situation while selling Christian books:
"The desert has taught me many lessons that I shall never forget. It has taught me that the best substitute for 'high pressure' is prayerful persistence. Six times I called on one desert family, and six times I came away without an order. There was always some reason why they could not take time to see me. Then I recalled how Joshua conquered the city of Jericho, and back I went the seventh time! And just as the walls of Jericho fell flat as the Israelites encompassed the city the seventh time, so the walls of resistance crumbled around this desert family, and I left them with the largest order I have yet received! To my fellow wingmen I would suggest: 'Remember Jericho! Pray often, and never give up until you have called the seventh time!' " 
Sanctification and perfection.
During the 1950s, those who reported on Maxwell's talks for church periodicals commented on his strong emphasis on perfection:
1951. "Youth Rally Speaker. The featured speaker of the Sabbath afternoon regional youth rally, February 17, was Elder Graham Maxwell, of Pacific Union College. He appealed for everyone to strive more earnestly to become like Christ in character—NOW." 
1952. "Newbury Park Academy News Notes: ... Each student is striving more diligently for the goal of perfection, especially after Elder Graham Maxwell from Pacific Union College gave the spring Week of Prayer studies, pointing out that perfection should be our goal if we are to attain eternal life." 
1954. Maxwell writes: "Recently I had the privilege of helping with the spring week of devotion on the Loma Linda campus of the College of Medical Evangelists, April 11–17... The discussions during the week were based on the question "When will Jesus return?" and on the answer found in that memorable sentence in Christ's Object Lessons, page 69, 'When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come.' "
1958. " 'Be Ye Therefore Perfect' was the sermon delivered by Elder Graham Maxwell, teaching us that we can and we must be perfect to meet Jesus when He comes again soon." 
This emphasis on "Perfection" could be the same as emphasis on "wholesome Christian living". Maxwell conducted a Spring Week of Prayer in 1953 at La Sierra College. He was invited back to conduct another Spring Week of Prayer in 1956: 
"The speaker for the annual spring Week of Prayer being conducted at La Sierra College March 16–24 is A. Graham Maxwell, professor of Biblical languages at Pacific Union College. This is a return appointment for Professor Maxwell, as he conducted a similar week here three years ago. His fine understanding of our young people and their church and his contagious enthusiasm for wholesome Christian living make him especially effective in working with Adventist youth. The students and faculty here genuinely appreciate his work." 
Last things.
The destruction of the wicked.
Isaiah 33:14-17 asks who can live in the eternal fire and the answer is the righteous people. Graham Maxwell taught that hell fire is not the same substance as say in lighting a match or in a volcano, but that it is the glory, beauty and love of God seeing God in all God's brightness and glory. God treats everyone the same. Everyone is welcomed into heaven, however some will find it heaven to be there with God and their loved ones. But just as when Jesus was on earth some loved to be with him others wanted to be away from him even to the point of wanting to put him to death. So at the end as we see God visible in person those who are used to yielding to the Holy Spirit's prompting will find it heaven to live in the eternal fire, living forever with God. But others will choose to separate themselves from God. Since God is the only source of life, if you separate yourself from the only source of life the only other option is death, with God crying "Why oh why will you die? How can I give you up? How can I let you go?" but God will not force the will to force them to be citizens of heaven and thus allow them to have the natural result of their choice.
Criticisms of Maxwell's theology.
Adventist publications avoid opposing Maxwell by name.
The Adventist Church has not published any specific criticism against Maxwell by name. It has addressed concerns for those within the church who promote what has been called the moral influence theory of atonement. Maxwell and those who support his teachings have denied that their views are the same as the Moral Influence Theory. 
In 1990, Dr. Alden Thompson, of Walla Walla College's Department of Theology, noted this practice of avoiding the direct naming of individuals and expressed the wish that the church could be more open and still respect those who differ:
"...George Knight has given me permission to use his recent book on the atonement, My Gripe With God (Review and Herald,1990) to illustrate my point. Knight and I agree that naming names would be good. But we probably don't see eye to eye on the atonement — a topic on which two people could likely never agree! 
Knight argues that the (objective) substitutionary view of the atonement is the foundation for all other views. In the process, he critiques the subjective view of the atonement as articulated among Adventists by Maxwell and Jack Provonsha. But Knight does not mention Maxwell and Provonsha by name. I wish he had. I wish it were safe to do so — without jeopardizing the status of Knight, Maxwell, or Provonsha as faithful and committed Adventists. 
Knight looks to Paul for support (especially Romans and Galatians); Maxwell and Provonsha appeal to John (especially John 14-17). The perspectives are different; both are biblical; we should expect both in the church. But a tug-of-war view of truth tempts us to homogenize John and Paul, making them say the same thing, namely, what we want or need to hear. Then we can't hear our brothers and sisters, or listen to their needs, letting them hear Paul or John as needed, so that they, too, can worship God with all their hearts and love their neighbors as themselves..." 
Concerns raised by Adventist scholars.
Maxwell was well known for his book, Can God Be Trusted? It was a denominational book of the year. David McMahon says it "is conspicuous for what it omits in discussing the atonement." He compares the chapter, "Why Did Jesus Have to Die?" to a similarly titled much earlier article by E. J. Waggoner, "Why Did Christ Die?" (British) "Present Truth" 21 September 1893, p385–88. Samuele Bacchiocchi equates it with the moral influence theory.

Compassberg (), is a mountain peak of the Sneeuberge range in South Africa. It is located 55 km due north of Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape Province. At 2504 metres, it is the highest peak in South Africa outside the Stormberg-Drakensberg massif. It was named by Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon when he accompanied Governor Joachim van Plettenberg on a journey to the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony in 1778. 
The mountain is composed of sediments of the Beaufort Series in the Karoo System, and extensively intruded by dolerite dikes and sills.

<doc id="18839800" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18839800" title="Instruction path length">
Instruction path length

In computer performance, the instruction path length is the number of machine code instructions required to execute a section of a computer program. The total path length for the entire program could be deemed a measure of the algorithm's performance on a particular computer hardware. The path length of a simple conditional instruction would normally be considered as equal to 2, one instruction to perform the comparison and another to take a branch if the particular condition is satisfied. The length of time to execute each instruction is not normally considered in determining path length and so path length is merely an indication of relative performance rather than in any sense absolute.
When executing a benchmark program, most of the instruction path length is typically inside the program's inner loop.
Assembly programs.
Since there is, typically, a one-to-one relationship between assembly instructions and machine instructions, the instruction path length is frequently taken as the number of assembly instructions required to perform a function or particular section of code. Performing a simple table lookup on a unsorted list of 1,000 entries might require perhaps 2,000 machine instructions (on average, assuming uniform distribution of input values), while performing the same lookup on a sorted list using a binary search algorithm might require only about 40 machine instructions, a very considerable saving. Expressed in terms of instruction path length, this metric would be reduced in this instance by a massive "factor" of 50 – a reason why actual instruction timings might be a secondary consideration compared to a good choice of algorithm requiring a shorter path length.
The instruction path length of an assembly language program is generally vastly different than the number of source lines of code for that program, because the instruction path length includes only code in the executed control flow for the given input and does not include code that is not relevant for the particular input, or unreachable code.
High-level language (HLL) programs.
Since one statement written in a high-level language can produce multiple machine instructions of variable number, it is not always possible to determine instruction path length without, for example, an instruction set simulator – that can count the number of 'executed' instructions during simulation. If the high-level language supports and optionally produces an 'assembly list', it is sometimes possible to estimate the instruction path length by examining this list.
Use of instruction path lengths.
From the above, it can be realized that knowledge of instruction path lengths can be used:

Opatowiec

Opatowiec is a village in Kazimierza County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Opatowiec. It lies in Lesser Poland, on the left bank of the Vistula (opposite the confluence of the Dunajec), approximately east of Kazimierza Wielka and south of the regional capital Kielce. In 2006 the village had a population of 410.
Opatowiec has a rich and long history. It was granted town charter as early as 1271, and stripped of it by Russian authorities in 1869. The village is located on National Road Nr. 79 (Warsaw - Bytom). Local points of interest include a 15th-century Dominican church, and a monument to Józef Piłsudski next to the Vistula river.
The village of Opatowiec was first mentioned in 1085, when Judyta, the wife of Prince Władysław I Herman, presented it to the Benedictine Abbey from Tyniec. In 1271, Prince Boleslaw V the Chaste granted Opatowiec Magdeburg rights town charter, upon request of abbot Modlibob. The town became a local trade center, due to its location along the Vistula waterway, and on a merchant road from Silesia to Kievan Rus. In 1283, abbot Tomasz from Tyniec fouded here a Dominican Order abbey, and in 1341, King Kazimierz Wielki granted Opatowiec the right to organize fairs. In the mid-14th century, Opatowiec had almost 1,500 inhabitants. Here, in 1474, a congress of Lesser Poland’s szlachta took place, during which war with Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus was discussed. In the same year, King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk hosted at Opatowiec envoys from the Republic of Venice, to discuss war with the Ottoman Empire. By 1500, Opatowiec had a parish church, bath houses, hospital and several guilds. In 1579, it had 55 different workshops, and four mills. For centuries, the town belonged to Wiślica County of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship.
Like almost all municipal centers of Lesser Poland, the town was completely destroyed by Swedish soldiers in the Deluge (1655 - 1660). In 1772, when after the first partition of Poland, the Tyniec abbey became part of Austrian Galicia, Opatowiec changed hands and became the property of the government. Soon afterwards, it was purchased by the Walewski family. In 1815, the town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and began to lose its importance. By 1862, it had only 459 residents and 67 houses. In 1869, as a punishment for January Uprising, it was stripped of its town charter and became a village. Opatowiec was destroyed in World War I, further destruction was brought by World War II. In September 1939, the village was burned by the Wehrmacht, on Sept. 8, 1939, German soldiers shot here 45 Polish prisoners of war. On July 28, 1944, a skirmish took place here between a local Home Army unit and the Russian Liberation Army. As a result, the village was completely burned, and 31 persons were murdered, including children.

Early life.
Brady was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on December 9, 1838. He was the son of Jasper Ewing Brady, a lawyer who later served as a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, and whose uncles included noted Indian fighters Samuel Brady and Hugh Brady.
Civil War.
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Brady enlisted as a private in the 12th Pennsylvania Infantry. On July 8, 1861 he accepted a commission as a first lieutenant in the Regular Army's 14th Infantry Regiment. He served in this regiment throughout the war, participating in the battles of Gaines' Mill, Malvern Hill, Second Bull Run, Chacellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Laurel Hill, Petersburg, and Weldon Railroad. In the latter battle, he was taken prisoner and held at Libby Prison before being paroled in September 1864. Brady received a promotion to captain on June 10, 1864, and received a brevet as major for his gallantry at Weldon Railroad on August 18, 1864. On March 16, 1865 he was brevetted a lieutenant colonel for his meritorious services during the war.
Later career.
Immediately after the conclusion of the war, the 14th Infantry was sent to the west coast, where Brady was posted at Camp McDowell, Arizona, accompanied by his wife Henrietta Margaret and their baby daughter. The baby died in March 1866. In September 1866, he was transferred to the 23rd Infantry and was posted to Camp Three Forks Owyhee, Idaho, where he took part in the Snake War. His son, Mifflin Brodhead Brady, was born in Idaho in July 1868. 
From July 1869 to May 1871, Brady's company was posted at Sitka, Alaska, and Brady served briefly as commander of the Department of Alaska. He later served at various posts across the West, including Camp Lowell, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Supply, Fort Union, and Fort Mackinac.
He was promoted to major in the 18th Infantry in March 1886, and was stationed in Denver until May 1889 when he took command of Fort Hays. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the 17th Infantry in March 1891 and commanded that regiment at Fort D. A. Russell. Brady retired at his own request on August 16, 1894, and died in Chicago, Illinois on January 20, 1899.

Joseph Stewart (Alaska)

Joseph Stewart (1822–1904) was an officer in the United States Army notable for serving as commander of Fort Alcatraz, Fort Churchill and the Department of Alaska. His name is occasionally seen as "Jasper Stewart".
Biography.
Early life.
Joseph Stewart was born in Kentucky and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1842. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery and later the 3rd U.S. Artillery during the Mexican War. On January 3, 1856 he was promoted captain of Company H in the 3rd Artillery. In December 1859 Captain Stewart took command of Fort Alcatraz. In the years immediately preceding the Civil War, Stewart transformed the fort into the most powerful coastal defense in the west. It was also during Stewart's time on Alcatraz that it took on the role of a prison for the first time. 11 soldiers under Stewart's command were imprisoned there and soon other nearby forts were sending prisoners there too.
Pyramid Lake War.
In 1860 a vigilante force was soundly defeated by Paiute Indians in a battle near Pyramid Lake in present day Nevada. This defeat prompted the Federal government to dispatch a contingent of the U.S. Army to the area. Captain Stewart took command of the so-called "Carson Valley Expedition" composed of 200 regular army soldiers from the 3rd Artillery and 6th U.S. Infantry. Stewart was, however, subordinated to Col. John C. Hays who was in command of a regiment of U.S. Volunteers. Hays and Stewart defeated the Paiutes in the second Battle of Pyramid Lake.
Fort Churchill.
While Hays' volunteers disbanded shortly after the battle, Stewart's regulars remained in the area for some time. Stewart was ordered to construct a permanent army post in the area. Eventually he chose a site along the Carson River which he suggested should be named in honor of General Sylvester Churchill. The U.S. Army confirmed the site and name in August and construction of Fort Churchill began. Construction was completed in 1861 with Stewart as the post's first commander.
Civil War.
During the American Civil War Stewart briefly returned to command Fort Alcatraz. In 1861 he was transferred to the defenses of Washington, DC and commanded the artillery in George A. McCall's division of the Army of the Potomac from December 1861 to February 1862. From April to October 1862 he served as recruiting officer for San Francisco and was the Inspector General of the Humboldt Military District during the Winter of 1862/1863. He was chief of artillery for the Department of the Pacific from April to July 1863 and ended the war as recruiting officer for Salem MA from November to December 1865. On December 11, 1865 Stewart was promoted Major in the 4th U.S. Artillery.

Born-N-Raised

"Born-N-Raised" is the third single from DJ Khaled's debut album, "Listennn... the Album", produced by The Runners. The single features Pitbull, Trick Daddy and Rick Ross. It was released on June 6, 2006. The song is also included on Pitbull's second studio album "El Mariel".
Reception.
HipHopDX said, when reviewing for "Listennn...the Album": "Musically, Khaled and the crew keep it dirty with "Born-N-Raised," which is an infectious anthem.". According to PopMatters: "Listennn" "opens with the song, in which the local heavyweights Trick Daddy, Pitbull and Rick Ross reestablish their status as the leaders of the pack. The beat barely contains Trick’s greasy flow as he proclaims once again, against his own wailing overdubs, that he is a thug. Pitbull bilingually shouts out Trick and Luke (of 2 Live Crew). Rick Ross shines the most, closing the track with carefully enunciated statements proclaiming his greatness and name-checking neighborhoods." RapReviews commented on the song: "The Runners' opening organs and funk of "Born-N-Raised" are laced up." "XXL" said about "Born-N-Raised": "Inspired collaborations like the Miami anthem featuring Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Pitbull save it's album from further mediocrity." "Stylus Magazine": "Khaled constantly represents Miami and Dade County throughout "Listennn", not the least on the all-star anthem "Born N Raised" featuring Trick Daddy, Pitbull, and Rick Ross."

John Mendenhall (colonel)

John Mendenhall (July 12, 1829 – July 1, 1892) was an officer in the United States Army. As a Union Army artillery officer in the American Civil War, his performance was notable at the Battle of Stones River, where his concentration of guns broke the last Confederate attack.
Before the Civil War.
Mendenhall was born in Indiana, son of Miles and Nancy Mendehall. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point on July 1, 1847, graduating on July 1, 1851. Mendenhall's first assignment was as a brevet second lieutenant of cavalry at the barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Transferring to the 4th Artillery on February 20, 1852, he served at Fort Mifflin, Pennsylvania, 1852-1853. On frontier duty at Ringgold Barracks, Texas, he was promoted to second lieutenant on October 8, 1853. After serving in the garrison of Fort Hamilton, New York, 1854-1855, he was on frontier duty at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 1855. He was engaged in two skirmishes in 1855. Mendenhall was at Fort Laramie in Dakota Territory 1855-1856. Promoted to first lieutenant in 1856, he served in Florida during hostilities with the Seminoles. Lt. Mendenhall was back at Fort Leavenworth during the Bleeding Kansas disturbances of 1857-1858, and once more at Fort Laramie in 1858. He was in the garrison of Fort Columbus, New York, in 1859, followed by recruiting service in the same year. He was assigned to the Artillery School for Practice at Fort Monroe, Virginia, from 1859 to the outbreak of the war in 1861. He was promoted to Captain, 4th Artillery, on July 3, 1861. Mendenhall married Sophia Elizabeth Mix (1838-1895) on November 27, 1858.
War Service.
At the outbreak of the war, MG John E. Wool retained Mendenhall to train artillery recruits. Capt. Mendenhall first saw combat commanding batteries H and M of the 4th Artillery in the Army of the Ohio, supporting the division of Brig. Gen. William "Bull" Nelson. At the Battle of Shiloh, on the second day of the battle, April 7, 1862, his guns supported Nelson's attack on the Confederate lines. Several senior officer, including MG Don Carlos Buell, the army's commander, praised Mendenhall and his gunners for outstanding work. For his work at Shiloh, Mendenhall was appointed to the brevet rank of major in the regular army to rank from the day of the battle. He continued in Nelson's division during the Siege of Corinth, taking part in a minor fight with the Confederates on May 8, 1862.
Capt. Mendenhall was chief of artillery to Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden when he was assigned to collect guns at McFadden's Ford to stop an attack by the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge on the Union left flank. The guns broke the Confederate attack and relieved the threat to the federal left. Mendenhall was promoted to the rank of major and continued on Crittenden's staff. At the Battle of Chickamauga he pulled together another grand battery to resist the Confederate breakthrough on the second day of the battle, but he lost many of these guns. Mendenhall received brevet rank of lieutenant colonel for his role in that battle.
Late in the war, Maj. Mendenhall was inspector of artillery of the Department of the Cumberland. By March 1865, he was commander of the Artillery Reserve of the department, a post he held to the end of the war.
Post War.
After the war, Mendenhall served in Michigan, the Carolinas, California, Alaska, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut. He served as commander of the Department of Alaska, from June 15, 1876, to March 4, 1877. He died as colonel of the Second Artillery, while commanding Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island, on July 1, 1892. He left his widow and three grown sons: Clarence Miles, Theodore John, and Leo Thomas Crittenden. Col. Mendenhall was buried at West Point.[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=46850848]

Acron Group

Acron Group () is a Russian group of interrelated companies and one of the leading global mineral fertilizer producers in the world.
History.
At the core of the Group are two production facilities, Acron (established in 1961) and Dorogobuzh (established in 1966), which at one time formed the basis of the Soviet fertiliser industry. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, both enterprises were privatised, underwent a large-scale revamping and adopted the long-term reconstruction and upgrade programme and consolidated corporate governance system. Early in this decade the Company set a course to develop a vertically integrated business. Today, in addition to its production assets, the Group has its own logistics and distribution networks and is investing in raw material projects. In order to strengthen its hand in the world's largest fertiliser market – China – in 2005 the Group acquired complex fertiliser producer Hongri Acron and created its own extensive distribution network.
Owners and Executives.
Shareholder structure as of August 1, 2012
Vladimir Kunitsky, Chairman of the Managing Board and CEO (since 29 July 2011)

Coast-to-coast goal

A coast to coast goal in Australian rules football is a goal that is scored by delivering the ball from one end of the oval to the other and scoring a goal, without the opposing team touching the ball.
It can only be scored after one team scores a behind. After the ball is returned into play from the goal square, the ball is travelled to the other goalposts in the usual fashion (handballing, marking, and running with the ball). If a goal is scored at the other end without the defending team touching the ball, this is a coast to coast goal.
Coast to coast goals may be scored very swiftly and are extraordinary. There were two rule changes during the 1990s that have sped up the play considerably. A team may now kick a ball back into play as soon as the goal umpire signals that a behind had been scored. Previously the team would need to wait for the umpire to retrieve and wave a white flag as well. Also, when a goal is scored, instead of waiting for the ball to be retrieved from the crowd, a new ball may be obtained from a supply behind the goalposts. Since these rule changes, coast to coast goals have become easier, since a team that gets a ball quickly back into play may catch their opponents unprepared for rapid play.
Since the behind that initiated the action scores one point for the team that scored it, and the subsequent goal scores six points, the team that creates the coast to coast goal ends up gaining five points overall.

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Council

About Workplace Safety and Health Council.
The Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council was formed on 1 April 2008. The WSHC is an industry-led Statutory Body that is based in Singapore. It is a step-up from its precursor, the Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee (WSHAC) formed in September 2005. The WSHC is endowed with statutory powers and hence, would be well placed to lead or partner with the various industry sectors in Singapore through the engagement and capability building efforts.
The WSHC comprises 18 leaders from the major industry sectors (including construction, manufacturing, marine industries, petrochemicals and logistics), the Government, unions and professionals from the legal, insurance and academic fields.
Under the WSHC, seven industry committees, two taskforces and two workgroups have been formed to address the specific WSH challenges in their respective sectors:
Mission and Vision Statements.
The vision and mission of the WSHC are:
Vision.
A safe and healthy workplace for everyone; and a country renowned for best practices in WSH
Mission.
To lead industry efforts in strengthening capabilities and building a progressive culture in WSH
The Partners.
The WSHC works closely with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and other government agencies, various industry sectors, unions and professional associations in development of strategies and programmes to raise WSH standards in Singapore.
Main Functions and Key Programmes.
WSH 2018: A National Strategy for WSH for Singapore.
The WSH 2018 National Strategy spells out the national vision, strategies and strategic outcomes to lower Singapore's workplace fatality rate to less than 1.8 per 100,000 workers by 2018. Co-drafted by the WSH Council and MOM, the WSH 2018 National Strategy aims to synergise the efforts and resources of all stakeholders to realise the vision of "A safe and healthy workplace for everyone; and a country renowned for best practices in workplace safety and health".
To achieve the desired WSH 2018 vision, four strategic outcomes were identified:
A multi-pronged approach is needed to achieve these strategic outcomes. Therefore, four strategies were identified to guide the efforts of all stakeholders in strengthening WSH improvements and drive the process towards safer and healthier workplaces. The four strategies are:
Build Capability of the Industry to Better Manage WSH.
The WSHC collaborates with other government agencies including the Workforce Development Agency (WDA). Utilising the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) framework developed by WDA, the WSH Professional WSQ framework was established for the competency training of WSH Professionals. Complementing the training development aspects, the WSHC conducts regular reviews and audits of Accredited Training Providers so as to ensure a pool of highly credible and competent WSH training providers.
Promote WSH And Recognise Companies With Good WSH Performance.
To build and promote WSH culture in the community, the WSHC actively organises events and programmes, engaging various stakeholders, to promote the importance of WSH and its benefits and provide the necessary guidance for its implementation. Some of these activities include the National WSH Campaign, the WSH Awards and the “Safety Starts With Me” campaign and various WSH seminars, conferences and workshops targeting different categories of workforce. Among the staple of WSHC publications are the WSH statistical reports, case studies, guidelines, technical advisories, approved codes of practice, posters, flyers and videos, and iWSH (newsletter specially designed for workers). The WSHC also has an up-to-date website, and the WSH Bulletin, an electronic bulletin that highlights the latest in WSH issues.
Conduct Research And Setting Acceptable WSH Practices.
The WSHC conducts research and environmental scanning to keep abreast of both local and international WSH developments. By analysing and forecasting trends in WSH, the WSHC helps identify emerging challenges and develop new measures to improve WSH outcomes in Singapore. The WSHC drives the adoption of good WSH practices with various stakeholders in the WSH industry. The WSHC also works in collaboration with the other standard-setting bodies to develop national WSH standards, as well as lead the development of industry guidelines, and establish approved codes of practices for the industry.
WSHC Programmes.
Through effective WSH management, the business performance of an enterprise can improve. The WSHC has introduced and will continue to develop and introduce programmes and tools in collaboration with other agencies to assist enterprises to build their WSH capabilities. These programmes include:
bizSAFE.
bizSAFE is a capability building programme that is tailored to assist the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) in building up their WSH capabilities. It provides a 5-step approach ranging from top management demonstrating their commitment towards WSH, to acquiring Risk Management capability and inclusion of a Workplace Safety and Health Management System within the organisation.
Guidelines on Design for Safety in Buildings and Structures.
Design and planning is an essential component in every construction work. In line with the WSH Act, reducing risk at source is one of the key components towards improving safety at the worksite. To address the risk at source, there is a need to look at who creates the risk and address the issue from there. While the WSH Act imposes a duty on the occupiers, employers and principals, the risks inherent in the design will also need to be addressed and the means to mitigate the risks identified. In addition, accidents are often a result of either poor planning or lack of communication between the designer and the occupier, resulting in loss of information. The process to ensure the transfer of relevant information and documents are therefore recorded.
This guideline serves to assist key stakeholders on the process of design safety and the transfer of vital safety and health information along the construction process chain. To facilitate this, duties of the various stakeholders are specified, as well as Design Reviews stipulated, creating a framework which allows every stakeholder to participate in making vital safety and health decisions.
Risk Management Assistance Fund.
A co-funding assistance scheme for SMEs to implement risk management at the workplace.
Under the WSH (Risk Management) Regulations, a risk assessment must be conducted at the workplace in relation to the safety and health risks posed to any person. This includes the identification of the safety and health hazards, and the evaluation of the probability and consequences of injury or illness arising from exposure to the identified hazards. The company also needs to take reasonably practicable steps to eliminate, minimise or control the risks. In addition, the company should communicate the risks and control measures to persons at the workplace.

Cartoon Network (Pakistan)

Cartoon Network is a cable and satellite television channel created by Turner International Pakistan, a unit of Time Warner which primarily shows animated programming. The channel officially launched on April 2, 2004. Cartoon Network Pakistan follows Pakistan Standard Time (GMT +5:00) for its programming line-up schedule. It has also another time shift version (GMT +6:00), available in Bangladesh,and is available in Afghanistan,Tajikistan and Iran in English and Hindi.
History.
On April 2, 2004, Turner International Pakistan launched a localized feed of Cartoon Network off the Indian network feed. Formerly a full satellite of that schedule besides local advertising, the network has since developed their own schedule with local viewers in mind. It was the first children's channel in the country that was meant for the local market, rather than a relay of an Indian or Asian network feed.
Programming.
Cartoon Network Pakistan is available in English and Urdu-Hindi. The channel carries a number of popular animated shows, mainly those from Hanna-Barbera, Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network's internal studio division. Classic programming is available through the Boomerang block. The channel itself was not available in Pakistan till 2011 on PTCL Smart TV.
A few shows including "TMNT: Fast Forward", Chowder and a few episodes of "Winx Club" aired both in the Original English audio and Hindi-Urdu dub feeds were only aired in the original English audio. The network had a short shutdown in 2005 due to orders from local content regulator PEMRA, related to the lack of localized language dubbing for those programs.
"Boomerang".
Much like Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, it started in 2007 covering the late-night programming for Cartoon Network. It mainly featured the reruns of animated programming from Time Warner's extensive archives, including pre-1986 MGM, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and Warner Bros. programs including Flintstones, Johnny Bravo, The All New Popeye Show, Scooby-Doo Where Are You!, The Jetsons, The Tom and Jerry Show, Yogi Bear and all other Hanna-Barbera creations which had been put off the air due to the incoming of new, and more popular in culture, cartoons like Courage the Cowardly Dog, Samurai Jack, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy and Teen Titans were added.
"Candy Land Tasty Treats".
Originally, the "Candy Land Hour" premiered on March 16, 2009 replacing the previous "Tom & Jerry Cat & Mouse Full House", a one hour Tom & Jerry exclusive block.
It features Tom and Jerry followed by Ben 10 later on. The block was renamed as "Candy Land Tasty Treats" in 2011.
"Cartoon Network Popcorn".
"Cartoon Network Popcorn" is the network's animated film block.
"Hero Up".
This one and a half hour block named "Hero Up", was dedicated to the animated shows based on "Super Heroes" conceptual story plots and featured , The Superhero Squad Show and Wolverine and the X-Men.
Pogo.
Launched in March 2008 Cartoon Network currently runs a three-hour programming block showcasing POGO’s original productions which includes the multi-award winning show, M.A.D. (Music Art and Dance), F.A.Q. etc. and it has been very well received by kids in Pakistan.
As of April, 2013 the block starts with M.A.D. continues with "Mojacko",repeating episodes of "" and concludes at Mr. Bean (animated TV series). From June 2010 Sasha and Frank do a 19 minute sketch comedy which tells about latest cartoons and world news aired on Saturdays at 9:30 pm. Sasha and Frank's first season consisted of 18 episodes and ended on September 4 2010. The second season premiered on 16 October at 8:00 pm and ended on January 20, 2011. The third season premiered on 19 February 2011 and is ongoing.
"Lights Camera Pogo!".
As a part of the Pogo block, this movie block features live-action movies that includes Re-Animated, Doctor Dolittle, Liar Liar and many more. Most of the movies are aimed at kids.
"Rise And Shine".
Rise and Shine morning block premiered on August 3, 2010. It is a one-hour morning block on Cartoon Network Pakistan which is aimed on the early morning audience with some new and fresh cartoons including Nick Jr.'s cartoon series Oswald and Play with Me Sesame, spun off from Sesame Street.
Toonami.
The anime-dedicated Toonami block started on the broadcast premiere day of Cartoon Network Pakistan, April 2, 2004. Toonami block became one of the favourite blocks for the children in no time. According to the calculations, most of the children of the age 10-18 watch Toonami regularly. Much like its international counterparts, Toonami block features the Japanese animated shows, anime in short.
Initially, it was a two-hour block that featured four animes namely "Pokémon", "Duel Masters", "Beyblade" and the last but not the least, "Digimon". Later on, Bakugan Battle Brawlers, Blue Dragon, Dragon Ball Z and Swat Kats were also added to the block by replacing some of the old shows.
In late 2009, the block was extended to two and a half hours and the programming line-up was shuffled up once again. As a result, Digimon Data Squad replaced Dragon Ball Z and replaced Swat Kats followed by Blue Dragon and Bakugan Battle Brawlers. On September 11, 2009, the Toonami block went through a major overhaul along with the premieres of some new anime.
The block was pulled off from airing on March 8, 2010 but was renewed back to its original timings in 2011.
On 29 April 2013 Cartoon Network again removed the Toonami block and instead, started new episodes of Adventure Time moving to Oggy and the Cockroaches and concluding with one hour block of Tom and Jerry Tales.
Toonami returned to Cartoon Network on 1 October 2013 with the old aired anime ,Deltora Quest and Dragon Ball Z
"Toon Muqabla Double Action".
As a two-hour morning block, "Toon Muqabla Double Action" made its debut on May 5, 2008. Originally, it featured Ben 10, Dragon Ball Z, Pokémon and Naruto. In late 2008, Cartoon Network pulled it off from airing.
Big Bucket.
After removing Toonnami block, Cartoon Network started the two hour movie block on 4 June 2013 named "Big Bucket". It included the movies of Tom and Jerry, Scooby-Doo, Barbie and Ben 10.
Criticism and controversy.
In 2005, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority issued an order regarding the ban of several non-private channels because of their Urdu dubbed programs having Hindi blend. Later on, the Cartoon Network and another channel of Hindi versions had been switched to English versions on the Pemra's instructions but the mixed so called Hindustani feed of the channels were back after few months.
In early 2010, PEMRA again issued a notice against the non-private channels which resulted in a complete ban of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network's Pakistan feed. Once again, the flamed issue was the Hindi dubbed shows on its schedule line up and the Government's demand for a private kids-channel affiliated with PTV instead. The ban stayed and was not lifted till the end of the July 2011.
At last on August 1, an announcement was made by the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Firdous Ashiq Awan. She said ‘"Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, have been granted permission to air programmes in Pakistan"’. But at the closure, she expressed her interest in a private TV channel once again and said ‘"The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority will accommodate private TV channel if someone wished to launch channel for children."’
Ratings.
Cartoon Network Pakistan has rated some of the shows and movies (that includes Live-Action in particular) PG. The rated programs include Naruto, Mr.Bean, Just For Laughs Gags, Star Wars, Generator Rex and Dragon Ball Z Kai.
Some episodes of Naruto are rated 12+ while Generator Rex and Dragon Ball Z Kai have been rated as PG.

2003–04 Las Vegas Wranglers season

The 2003–04 Las Vegas Wranglers season was the Las Vegas Wranglers' inaugural season in the ECHL. The West Coast Hockey League had originally awarded an expansion franchise to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1999 were supposed to start play in the 2000–01 WCHL season, but were unable to find a home arena until signing a deal with The Orleans Hotel and Casino to play in their new arena that they were in the process of constructing in 2003. During the 2002–03 WCHL season, the league announced that it would be folding but six of their current franchises (Anchorage, Bakersfield, Fresno, Idaho, Long Beach, and San Diego) and three of their expansion franchises (Las Vegas, Ontario, CA, and Reno) were approved for membership, with all but the Ontario and Reno franchises to take the ice during the upcoming 2003–04 ECHL season.
The Wranglers first regular season began on October 17, 2003 against the Idaho Steelheads and concluded on April 3, 2004 against the Bakersfield Condors. The Wranglers made ice hockey's return to Las Vegas on October 21, 2003, defeating Bakersfield 4–2 in front of an announced sell-out crowd at Orleans Arena. The Wranglers would finish their first season in second place in the Pacific Division, falling to the eventual Kelly Cup champion, Idaho Steelheads, three games to two, after cruising to a two games to zero lead in the series.
Preseason.
The Wranglers saw numerous changes to happen to the team before they took the ice for the first time. On May 29, actor Rick Schroder, filling in for team owner Charles Davenport, introduced former Fresno Falcons player-coach, Glen Gulutzan as the team's first head coach and general manager. The team then changed its logo from a red, yellow, orange, and black outline of a cowboys face to a red, black, and silver color scheme with a hockey stick carrying "Wrangler" mounted on a bull. The Wranglers would unveil their home, road, and alternate uniforms a month before their season opener. The home sweater was white with a previously unreleased Wranglers logo on the chest and trimmed with black and red on the sleeves and waist. The road sweater was red with "Las Vegas" in script over the streaking Wranglers’ poker chip puck and trimmed in black on the sleeves and waist. The third jersey was black with another previously unreleased logo on the chest featuring "VEGAS" in individual circles across a red hockey stick and the Wranglers’ poker chip puck, trimmed in black with red rolling dice along the waist.
Regular season.
The Wranglers began the regular season on October 17 visiting the Idaho Steelheads. The team's home opener was played on October 21 against the Bakersfield Condors. The Wranglers were known for their unprecedented performance at home during the first half of the season, going 15 straight games without losing in regulation, a streak that started with a 4–2 victory over Bakersfield on opening night on October 21 and lasting to December 27, when the San Diego Gulls defeated the Wranglers 1–0. The Wranglers began the season on a 9-1-2 run, before heading east on an agonizing six game road trip in which they went 0-4-2. The team concluded the regular season on April 3 with a 4–1 road victory over Bakersfield.
The Wranglers longest winning streak during the season was six games which occurred twice, from November 28 to December 19 and from March 12 to March 26 respectively. The team's longest losing streak was also six games, which ran from November 14 to November 22.

Social Progressive Party of South Tyrol

The Social Progressive Party of South Tyrol (, SFP) was a regionalist democratic-socialist and hard-line German-speaking political party active in South Tyrol.
It was launched in 1966 by Egmont Jenny, former leader of the left-wing of the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), and thanks to the support of the Socialist Party of Austria and its leader Bruno Kreisky. Its best electoral result was in 1968 when it won 2.4% of the vote, although not winning any seat in the Landtag of South Tyrol, while in 1973 it took 1.7% and got Jenny elected to the Provincial Council. The party, after having failed to merge with the Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol (5.1% in 1973) and even tried to form an alliance with the right-wing Party of Independents, it was disbanded in the late 1970s, with Jenny leaving the Landtag in 1978.

Nevada State Route 427

State Route 427 (SR 427) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Nevada. It connects the community of Wadsworth in eastern Washoe County to the city of Fernley in western Lyon County. SR 427 comprises the former routing of U.S. Route 40 (US 40) through the towns it serves. SR 427 also provides an eastern link to Pyramid Lake via a junction with State Route 447 in Wadsworth.
Route description.
SR 427 begins at a cattleguard on Cantlon Drive just south of the Wadsworth/Pyramid Lake interchange (Exit 43) on Interstate 80 (I-80) in Washoe County. The highway proceeds northeast from there to meet State Route 447 in the middle of Wadsworth. The route curves southeast through the town and immediately enters Lyon County. Passing south under I-80 once again, as well as the Union Pacific railroad tracks, SR 427 curves east to follow Main Street/Truckee Lane into Fernley. The highway ends at the intersection with Alt US 50 and Alt US 95 in downtown Fernley.
History.
Originally, US 40 followed the routing of SR 427 through Wadsworth and Fernley. Completion of I-80 around both cities (and many other northern Nevada cities) made the US highway designation irrelevant, and US 40 was later removed from the highway system.

<doc id="18841002" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18841002" title="Virtual reality cue reactivity">
Virtual reality cue reactivity

Virtual Reality Cue Reactivity (VRCR) is an innovative computer-enhanced methodology used to assess behavioral and physiological reactivity to drug and alcohol triggers (cues). Studies indicate that cue reactivity—a response to the presentation of various visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile cues—increases physiological excitement in addicts. VRCR utilizes virtual reality (VR) technology to stimulate cue reactivity in the most efficient and realistic environments possible; the intention being that coping skills can be taught in a contextual scenario that reflect a real world situation. While still in the early stages of development, studies have shown that VRCR is an effective means of generating a craving-inspiring environment that is tempting to a patient suffering from addiction.
Use in addiction.
Studies have indicated that cue exposure in patients is closely related to increases in physiological responses. In addition, situational cues are also a leading cause in triggering relapse. People suffering from addiction have a tendency to attribute their addiction to specific scenarios or events. For example, a smoker might have a habit of only smoking on his porch. Consequently, whenever he is near or around his porch, he connects it to smoking, and a craving is initiated by the mere proximity. This is an example of the classical conditioning theory, which describes how a specific cue can trigger an entirely separate reaction.
One of the most effective ways to avoid patient relapse is to instruct them on coping skills—ideally in the most detrimental cue exposure settings possible. The idea being that if patients can learn to deny their cravings in a controlled environment, denial in a real world environment will be easier. Virtual reality helps to emulate a near lifelike situation, complete with sights, sounds, smells, and movement.
How it works.
In order to create a lifelike environment, actors are filmed on a green screen doing many various activities such as smoking cigarettes, dancing, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, and other provocative actions. The actors are then integrated into a three-dimensional background, giving the impression that they are in a real environment. Virtual reality (VR) technology allows a user to be immersed in a computer-simulated environment by engaging the senses of a human body. As of now, visual and auditory are the two most common senses appealed to when creating a VR environment—mainly because they use simpler technologies that are much cheaper to develop. However, advances in technology are allowing for a much more efficient way to appeal to the olfactory senses as well.
Visual senses.
Arguably the most important facet in making a virtual environment seem real is an appeal to sight. A head-mounted display (HMD) is placed in front of the eyes of a patient like a pair of sunglasses, enabling for complete visual attention. A virtual environment is then displayed. A motion sensor inside the HMD tracks movement of the patient's head. If the patient tilts, or turns his head to view another part of the room, the environment adjusts accordingly. This allows for a more realistic experience by limiting restrictions of the head.
Auditory senses.
A headset is placed around the ears of a patient that allows for sound to be heard. Generally, full surround-sound is desirable as it gives the patient a sense of space. For example, if a virtual person standing in front of the patient was speaking, the voice would be clear and audible. However, if a virtual person was standing to the left or right of the patient, the sound would be much quieter and muffled. Surround sound aids in giving a lifelike feeling to the VR environment.
Olfactory senses.
Olfactory cues are presented by a computer-controlled device that releases scents in accordance with a patient's virtual environment. The device has multiple chambers with different scents in each, and uses an air compressor to blow specific scents into a patient's testing area. For example, if the patient were to approach a table with marijuana on it, he would also smell marijuana in real life. Other important scents used in VRCR include vanilla, pizza, coffee, whiskey, cigarette smoke, beer, and pine trees. The use of olfactory stimulation allows for a much more realistic virtual environment.
Clinical use.
VR technology has been slowly gaining acceptance in a clinical environment. It is now used for treating specific phobias, pain management, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Studies have indicated that, "patients reported emotional and physiological arousal when immersed in VR, thus providing a tool for exposure in the treatment of psychological disorders". VR technology also allows for a standardized testing environment that could greatly increase patient recovery rates.
Evolution.
In the past, cue reactivity has been used in labs to instruct patients in beneficial coping skills that help them to avoid relapse. Virtual reality technology allows for a more effective approach to trigger physiological arousal than the standard cue reactivity methods used previously—primarily, presentation of paraphernalia or actor-based simulation.
Cue reactivity.
Presentation of paraphernalia works by presenting a patient with physical items relative to their respective addiction. For example, an alcohol abuser might have a bottle of liquor placed in front of him, and a marijuana addict, a pipe. However, despite the fact that the objects are real, the environment in which they are presented is far from realistic. Learning how to turn down substances in a lab setting is much different than turning them down at an actual party—thus, the instructional process is limited.
Actor-based simulation.
Another means of establishing a realistic situation is through actor-based simulation. Actors are hired, and stages are built to simulate what an actual situation might be like. Patients are able to interact with the actors in a realistic manner. While extremely lifelike and effective, efficiency is a major disadvantage. The actors are subject to availability, and must be paid for their services. Furthermore, stages are limited to constructed scenes that are not easy to change. Though more effective than standard presentation cue response, actor-based simulation is still limited.
Virtual reality technology.
Virtual reality cue reactivity, though still in an early stage of development, is aimed at becoming a much more efficient version of an actor-based simulation. The goal is to produce a system that will virtually simulate a given scenario while still allowing a patient to interact with the surroundings. The advantages include increased flexibility—an operator has the ability to produce virtually any scenario needed—as well as cheaper running costs because actors are no longer needed. The procedure is also much more accessible as actor availability is irrelevant.

Because You Left

"Because You Left" is the television season premiere of the American Broadcasting Company's fifth season of the serial drama television series "Lost". The episode is the 87th episode of the show overall, and was written by executive producers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams. It first aired on January 21, 2009 on ABC in the United States and was simulcast on A in Canada. It aired immediately after a clip-show that recaps the first four seasons and aired back-to-back with the next episode, "The Lie".
In 2007, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus start their quest to reunite the "Oceanic 6". Hugo "Hurley" Reyes and Sayid Jarrah are ambushed at their safehouse. Sun-Hwa Kwon is confronted by Charles Widmore. Kate Austen and Aaron Littleton flee from their home after being ordered to submit a maternity test. At the island, James "Sawyer" Ford, Daniel Faraday, Juliet Burke, Charlotte Lewis, Miles Straume, John Locke and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 left on the island erratically jump through time upon the island's move. "Because You Left" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the United States, and received good reviews, praising the writing and the unraveling of new elements.
Plot.
The episode begins in the late 1970s, when the Dharma Initiative has begun to build stations on the island. Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to film the orientation film for the , when he is informed of an incident at the construction site of the . Upon arriving there, he realizes that the workers have found the "unlimited" energy source that the Dharma Initiative has been looking for, which will enable them to manipulate time. As he leaves the station, he bumps into Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), who is dressed as a Dharma construction worker.
On December 30, 2004, following the island being moved in "There's No Place Like Home", the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time, while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them to the day when the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James "Sawyer" Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, saving Locke from Ethan in the process. When pressed for an explanation by Sawyer, Daniel Faraday likens the experience to a record skipping. Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and thus gives him a compass to get his younger self to trust Locke. He explains that the only way to stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. At the Swan station, which is now intact, Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside. Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond didn't know Sawyer already when they first met (later in Desmond's timeline), Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.
In 2007, back in Los Angeles, two lawyers visit Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). They deliver a court order for a maternity test for her and Aaron, Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son, whom Kate is raising as her own, but refuse to reveal their client's identity. In London while en route to Los Angeles, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is confronted by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), a desire they seem to have in common. Following Hugo "Hurley" Reyes's (Jorge Garcia) breakout of a mental institution, he and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, Ben and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. They discover that Hurley has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the Oceanic Six. On a boat in an unknown location, Desmond wakes up, having remembered what Daniel told him, and sets off for Oxford.
Production.
Following a writing "mini-camp" to map out the fifth season, the premiere's script was written and filming began on August 19. Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote "Because You Left", and decided to put in the episode a setup for most elements of season 5, specially time travel. In order to avert implementing the time travel in a confusing way, the exposition of Faraday's theories was rewritten to start earlier and be more specific. While previous seasons had been filmed in high definition, this season premiere was the first "Lost" episode to be edited in it. 
Lindelof stated that "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. And the way we tell stories will be different too", and confirmed that the "whooshing sound" effect will continue to be used as the transition for the new storytelling device. When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were "skipping" to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.
In regard to what Lindelof described as "the Zodiac boat with Faraday and the five people that have never spoken a line on show", executive producer/writer/show runner Carlton Cuse said that "I'd be a little bit more worried about the non-line speakers than Faraday", while Lindelof added that "things are looking up for Faraday" and "there is a monsoon coming." Regarding the background survivors in general, Carlton Cuse has responded that there is "a very tragic event that happens this season." According to Lindelof, Neil "Frogurt" (Sean Whalen), a background survivor who has appeared solely in the "" mobisodes, "will rise up this season in the grand tradition of Dr. Arzt [Daniel Roebuck] to let his feelings be known." Sawyer is shirtless throughout the episode. Cuse jokingly justified as that "for people who really couldn't grasp the time travel aspects of the show, there would be Sawyer without his shirt on for the entire hour." His actor, Josh Holloway, kept fit in the summer break before shooting and noted this as "really disturbing. Coming after a hiatus, that ain't fair!"
Release and reception.
The fifth season of "Lost" was promoted with a music video for the song "You Found Me" by The Fray intercut with new "Lost" scenes and the tagline, "Destiny Calls". Television critic Maureen Ryan of "The Chicago Tribune" has deemed the latter an "endlessly mockable slogan"; Don Williams of BuddyTV gave a more positive review, summing it up as "a fitting way to describe the upcoming season." The staff of TV.com ranked the fifth season first on their "Most Anticipated of Early 2009" list. Christopher Rosen of "The New York Observer" went so far as to deem the return of "Lost" a "biggeevent" than other happenings in that week, specifically the unveiling of the 81st Academy Awards nominations and the United States presidential inauguration of Barack Obama. "Because You Left", as well as the following episode "The Lie" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the US, and 1.195 million in the UK. The episode, aired by itself, brought in 405,000 Australian viewers. "Because You Left" and "The Lie" were uploaded to ABC's media website—ABC Medianet—on December 29, 2008 to be viewed by members of the press for advance reviews attached to limited confidentiality agreements. "Because You Left" was first broadcast on January 21, 2009 on ABC in the United States and was simulcast on A in Canada, back-to-back with the next episode, "The Lie". Before the broadcast was aired "Lost: Destiny Calls", a clip-show recapping the first four seasons. It marked "Lost"s return to its original timeslot on Wednesdays.
Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of "Time" thought that "Because You Left" provided a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended the character of Faraday, partially "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has turned him into a likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." Matt Mitovich of "TV Guide" stated that the premiere "offercompelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." Robert Bianco of "USA Today" wrote that "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as "Lost", or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done in a way that makes most big-screen versions pale in comparison." Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. Maureen Ryan of "The Chicago Tribune" praised the opening sequence, calling it "really, really great … nerd-tastic for hardcore "Lost" fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic "Lost" moments and trivia." She concluded that the premiere is "quite good" (three and a half out of four stars) with "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. Verne Gay of "Newsday" summed up that "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. A bloated feeling may result." Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the "San Francisco Chronicle" was impressed by the "parallel plotting" of the characters on and off the island in different times. Despite deeming the premiere "riveting" and the script "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of "The Boston Globe" had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to "Lost" to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" deemed it "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the "Chicago Sun-Times" stated that "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of "baby steps" that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. Caryn Kunz of the "Honolulu Advertiser" said that "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout."
Jeff Jensen of "Entertainment Weekly" summed up the entirety of the premiere as "pretty cool" and "worth the wait". He wrote that ""Lost"'s tradition of opening the year with a killer, capture-the-imagination sequence is honored and upheld, though the thing I loved most was how it was brazenly frank (and engagingly funny) about the heady high-concept conceit that will define the season." Brian Lowry of "Variety" concluded that ""Lost" … approaches its twists with what appears to be a greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that "the "Lost" mythology is a miracle to behold. It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". Katherine Nichols of the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin" enjoyed the opening scene, "but the rest of it didn't capture as [she hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be." John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that "the opening scene itself will leave your mouth wide open and you'll probably forget to close it for a few minutes." He also wrote the premiere episodes "are vintage "Lost", full of some unbelievable twists and a whole lot of groundwork". H.T. Strong of Ain't It Cool News said that "Because You Left" "is a corker, aggressively advancing the story in all kinds of directions."

Netropsin

Netropsin is a polyamide with antibiotic and antiviral activity. 
Netropsin was discovered by Finlay "et al." and first isolated from the actinobacterium "Streptomyces netropsis". It belongs to the class of pyrrole-amidine antibiotics. Synonyms for the compound are congocidine and sinanomycin.
DNA binding properties.
Netropsin binds to the minor groove of AT-rich sequences of double stranded DNA. 
In contrast, Netropsin does not bind single stranded DNA or double stranded RNA. 
Crystallographic structures of DNA-bound Netropsin have been obtained and elucidate details of how the drug binds in the minor groove.
In the bound structure, the drug makes hydrogen bonding interactions with four subsequent base pairs of the DNA duplex,
locally displacing the water molecules of the spine of hydration.
Using gel mobility and analytical ultracentrifugation, 
it was shown that Netropsin binding to DNA increases the twist per base by similar to 9˚ per molecule bound.
Therefore, it removes supercoils when interacting with positively supercoiled DNA and introduces 
(additional) negative supercoils when binding to relaxed or negatively supercoiled DNA.
Netropsin's effect on supercoiled DNA was observed in detail at the single-molecule level using a magnetic tweezers.
Antibiotic properties.
It has been shown that Netropsin is active both against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria

Party of Independents (South Tyrol)

The Party of Independents (, PdU) was a regionalist liberal-conservative political party active in South Tyrol.
It was launched in 1972 in support of the candidacy of Hans Dietl, member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies for the South Tyrolean People's Party, who was expelled from that party in 1971 for having taken a hard line over an agreement between the provincial and the national government known as "Pacchetto". In the 1972 general election Dietl won 20.8% of the vote in the single-seat constituency of Brixen, the major defection from SVP since then. After the election, Dietl launched the Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol, while the "Independents" formed a centre-right party.
PdU won 1.3% in the 1978 provincial election and 2.4% in 1983, electing Hans Lunger and Gerold Meraner respectively to the Provincial Council. Meraner later transformed the party into the Freedom Party of South Tyrol in 1988.
