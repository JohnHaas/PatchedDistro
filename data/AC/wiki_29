Breathe Carolina

Breathe Carolina is an American electronic rock band from Denver, Colorado, currently composed of David Schmitt and a live band. Breathe Carolina started in 2006, and to date have released three albums, and two EPs.
History.
Beginnings (2007).
Kyle Even, born on September 21, 1985, and David Schmitt, born on March 25, 1988, spent their early years playing in various local Colorado musical groups. After being introduced to alternative rock by an older stepbrother, Even moved towards vocals as a teen. Even performed in the band Rivendale. They produced an extended play called "Portrait of Shadows". Schmitt, on the other hand, started on bass at the age of 12 and then branched out to guitar, performing in Colorado with As the Flood Waters Rose (later named The Autobiography).
Both bands played together often. As the Flood Waters Rose opened up for Rivendale at Rivendale's album release at Grandpa's Music Box in Thornton. After leaving As the Flood Waters Rose, Schmitt started recording his own song on GarageBand, which he later asked Even to participate in creating. As both bands broke-up for the members' departure for college, Even and Schmitt started Breathe Carolina.
"Gossip" and "It's Classy, Not Classic" (2007–2008).
Breathe Carolina started in 2007 with Denver, Colorado natives Kyle Even and David Schmitt recording songs on the music-creating software GarageBand for fun. They created a MySpace profile, gaining over 10,000 song plays in 2008 and accumulating over 30 million plays during 2009. The name Breathe Carolina came from a dream that Schmitt had in 9th grade, about calming down a woman named Carolina. Soon afterwards, Even quit his job as a photographer to tour with the group full-time. Their first EP, "Gossip", was released as an iTunes exclusive on November 26, 2007. It was self-released and has since been removed from the store.
Breathe Carolina recorded their first album using GarageBand, and signed with Rise Records before its release. The album introduced a few new songs that were not featured on "Gossip", including "The Introduction", "No Vacancy", "Show Me Yours", "Classified", "That's Classy", and "You Wish". "Don't Forget: Lock The Door" was the only track from the "Gossip" EP that is not featured on the LP. The album was released on September 16, 2008, and was followed by a tour to promote the album. Breathe Carolina headlined their tour with Every Avenue, Brokencyde, and The Morning Of. While on "The Delicious Tour", they announced that they would be making a music video for "Diamonds". The video has appearances made by Millionaires, as well as Josh White from Umbrella Clothing and This City Is Burning Records.
"Hello Fascination" (2009–2010).
In September 2009, the band announced they will be headlining the EZ Bronz Tour. Also in 2009, Breathe Carolina was featured on the cover of "Substream Music Press", which also features an interview with Even and Schmitt. Toward the end of October 2009, "Hello Fascination" was released in Japan. The Japanese edition of the album includes a bonus song entitled "Have You Ever Danced?". This song features David Strauchman (Every Avenue), Jeffree Star, and Austin Carlile (of Of Mice & Men).
Breathe Carolina's "Hello Fascination" is the featured track playing in the background of the current promos for NBC's "The Jay Leno Show", airing from September 14, 2009. The track was also featured in MTV's The City. Their song "I'm The Type Of Person To Take It Personal" was also featured in The City’s Season Finale in December 2009. Breathe Carolina released a music video for "Hello Fascination" on February 3, 2010. The music video is directed by Spence Nicholsen.
The deluxe edition of "Hello Fascination" was released on July 6. On June 23, Schmitt and Even launched a clothing line called Blush, and "I.D.G.A.F." was announced as the band's next single, with the music video being released on July 30, 2010. The duo played on the Altec Lansing stage during Vans Warped Tour 2010 and covered the song "Down" by Jay Sean for the compilation album "Punk Goes Pop 3" that was released on November 2, 2010.
On November 21, 2010, Breathe Carolina released their second ever Christmas-themed song for a part on the '"Tis the Season to Be Fearless" compilation album. The song is titled "Mile-High Christmas". The first Christmas song they released was "Snowed In", which was the first song ever recorded and released by the duo. "Snowed In" was initially recorded when the band first recorded their "Gossip" EP, but the song was decided not to be included on the EP by the time of its release.
"Hell Is What You Make It" (2011-2012).
On December 22, 2010, Fearless Records posted a video featuring a 30-second preview of the track "Blackout". Recording for the third studio album took place in early 2011. On April 28, 2011, it was announced that the album would be titled "Hell Is What You Make It", and that its scheduled release date would be on July 12, 2011. A promotional website for the album launched a 40-second video containing a preview of the track "Wooly".
The album's first single, "Blackout", was available for streaming via MTV Buzzworthy on June 13, 2011, and was available for digital download the following day. On June 16, the duo performed "Blackout" for a nationwide television presentation on Jimmy Kimmel Live. A music video for the track was shot in Los Angeles, California on July 1 and 2, and was released on the duo's official Vevo page on YouTube on September 20. The song has since become the duo's most commercially successful single to date, peaking within the charts of Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, the United Kingdom and United States, while also being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling more than 500,000 copies. Two other tracks from the album, "Wooly" and "Sweat It Out", were available for streaming prior to the album's release. The group participated on the Scream It Like You Mean It 2011 tour during that summer to promote the album. An extended play titled "Blackout: The Remixes EP" was released on September 27 via iTunes.
On December 23, 2011, it was announced that the duo signed with Columbia Records. Throughout early 2012, the duo participated in the Blackout Forever tour alongside The Ready Set with guest appearances by Ashland HIGH and Matt Toka. On February 22, it was announced that the duo would be participating in the 2012 Warped Tour. The duo have also since re-entered the studio to continue writing and recording new tracks. The duo announced that a new single, "Hit and Run", which will be released on May 22, 2012. Schmitt also announced that a music video for the song is currently in production, saying that the video will actually have a concept, unlike their previous videos. The song premiered via "Alternative Press" on May 21, while being available for digital download the following day. The duo also contributed to the compilation album "Punk Goes Pop 5" with their cover of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean".
"Savages" and Departure of Kyle Even (2013).
Breathe Carolina is currently working on their fourth studio album and have said that they are going back to their old roots for the record. On March 25, 2013, it was announced that the title of the new album is "Savages". On July 6, 2013, the duo released their first mixtape "Bangers" for free download via Sol Republic. Following its release the band toured North America with bands We the Kings, The Ready Set and rapper T. Mills.
On October 15, 2013 David Schmitt made an announcement via Alternative Press discussing founding member Kyle Even's departure from the band, due to his new responsibilities as a father.
Musical style and arrangement.
Breathe Carolina is a electronic rock band. Post-hardcore influence also exists, evident by the use of screamed vocals and breakdowns. These elements, however, are usually kept to a minimum while electronic elements take precedence. This fusion of post-hardcore characteristics and dance-oriented electronica has led the group to be labeled crunkcore as well. Also typical of crunkcore is the prevalent use of Auto-Tune and vocoders on Schmitt's vocals.
Their entire first EP, "Gossip", and debut full-length album, "It's Classy, Not Classic", were recorded using only the computer program GarageBand. The group did not produce music via studio until the recording of "Hello Fascination", which can be considered the group's first true studio album.
Although much instrumentation is added through programming, typical instruments are also present in the duo's music in select songs; Schmitt provides lead singing vocals for the duo along with playing the guitar and drums while Even provides unclean vocals and occasional cleans in their newer material. Live performances by Breathe Carolina usually consist of an arrangement of three extra members providing keyboards, keytars, drums, guitars and bass. During most live sets, Joshua Aragon plays guitar (when necessary) and performs backing vocals while Eric Armenta provides drums on a standard drum kit all while Schmitt and Even perform the clean and unclean vocal positions respectively.

Rental Car Rally

The Rental Car Rally is a 36 hour city-to-city road rally that takes place on public roads several times a year in different cities, with a different route each time. Founded in 2008 by the organizers of Wiimbledon and Street Wars, RCR sees an annual entry of about 30 cars per rally, with each team required to compete in a themed costume of their choosing, so long as the costume includes their vehicle. The rally is not a serious race in the traditional sense of competitive rally driving, though teams win by merit of their costumes and low mileage. Organizers emphasize that Rental Car Rally is a road trip and not a race.
History.
Drawing inspiration from the Cannonball Run films, Smokey and the Bandit, the Wacky Races Cartoons as well as the Gumball 3000, the Rental Car Rally was born as a more reasonable alternative to for those wanting to participate in a rally but who may not have the time and money required to complete in events such as the Bullrun and the Gumball 3000.
The first Rental Car Rally took place on August 15–17, 2008. The route required that participants drive from New York to Montreal, attend a party and drive back to NYC.
Rally.
2008 NYC to Montreal.
The inaugural rally featured 74 cars and 189 participants, and traveled from Long Island City, Queens to Montreal, Canada. Drivers were required to stop at 5 checkpoints along the route (which necessitated that mostly local roads were used) and collect evidence of their passing through them. 3 cars never made it to Montreal due to mechanical problems and 1 team - Jake's Clown Car - did not make it back from Montreal due to an accident in which no one was injured. The winner drove a van converted to resemble an emergency blood delivery vehicle.
The Jake's Clown Car Accident""'
On the morning of Sunday, August 17, at approximated 9:30 A.M., Jake's Clown Car - a 2007 Ford Expedition containing 8 passengers (including Puat the Driver) - rear-ended a Toyota Prius in the middle of the Champlain Bridge leaving the Island of Montreal. Although no one was injured in the accident, the Expedition was totaled and there was minimal damage to the Prius. All of the members of Jake's Clown Car - except for Jake - ended up taking a Greyhound Bus back to New York. Jake, whose bachelor party the team was celebrating, rode back to Boston with the occupants of the rear-ended Toyota Prius.

At the beginning of the film, Doña Genoveva (Lucy Gallardo), the matriarch of the family, decides to buy a car but doesn't know how to drive. A man named Don Pedro offers to teach her, and the relationship gradually turns from platonic to romantic. Meanwhile, Doña Genoveva's daughter, Lolita, is torn between her co-worker at the butcher shop where she works and Victor, a married man who frequently makes passes at women around town. Seventeen-year-old Blanca falls for the new guy in town and learns about the joy and pain an intimate relationship can bring. 
Throughout the story, the women struggle to sort out their sexual feelings while trying not to further damage their sometimes-strained family relationship. Most of the dialogue is in English, with occasional humorous digressions of old men sitting around talking in Spanish about their past experiences with cars and women.

Farmall Cub

The Farmall Cub or International Cub (or simply "Cub" as it is widely known) was the smallest tractor manufactured by International Harvester (IH) under either the McCormick-Deering, Farmall, or International names from 1947 through 1981 in Louisville, Kentucky.
Description.
The two major variations of the Cub were the Standard Cub and the Lo-Boy Cub (or Cub Lo-Boy). They are recognized by their distinctive IH Red or Federal Yellow color schemes. In the late 1950s, sales of the Farmall Cub shifted from agricultural purpose to industrial purpose. IH capitalized on the shift, and the standard color for the Cub Lo-Boy and Cub changed from the familiar IH Red to Federal Yellow in 1960, with IH Red as an option. In 1963, International Harvester changed the grill of these tractors to a flat-grill style and dropped the Farmall name in favor of International. In 1981, the last production run of Cubs were painted IH Red.
The Demonstrator White color was used in 1950 on Cubs between serial numbers 99356 to 106516. These White Demo Cubs were used in the IH special demonstration program by dealers to highlight the abilities of the tractor. Dealers were expected to repaint these tractors back to IH Red before sale.
The market of this little tractor was the small-acreage farmer and it was designed by Farmall engineers in the years following World War II to replace a horse or mule for farming purposes. The tractor was offset to the left while the driver's seat and steering wheel were on the right. This concept was called "CultiVision", resulting in a clear view while working the fields.
The Cub sat on a 69¼ inch wheelbase, using a 4-cylinder, C-60 gasoline L-head engine, that consisted of a 2⅝ inch bore by 2¾ inch stroke, with a displacement of 59.5 cubic inches. At 1600 rpm, early versions of the C-60 engine produced on the belt and at the drawbar. Starting in the 1960s, Cub engines steadily increased power with higher rated RPM's, peaking at for the International Cub and 154 Lo-Boy by 1975, and for the 185 and 184 Lo-Boys.
The Cub Lo-Boy, introduced in 1955, was a lowered version of the Standard Cub. The rear axle housings were rotated, lowering the tractor about 7–8 inches. Also, the front axle extensions were lowered and the tractor wheelbase was shortened to 62½ inches. These modifications lowered the center of gravity, improving the mowing capability of the Cub.
The Lo-Boy version of the Cub was replaced in 1969 by the 154 Lo-Boy, which had a body style similar to the smaller Cub Cadet garden tractor. Also made were 185 and 184 Lo-Boy models, which were increased power variations of the 154 Lo-Boy. These numbered versions received many upgrades and improvements when compared with the Cub Lo-Boy.
International Harvester also built Cubs for Europe at a factory in St. Dizier, France starting in 1955. The tractors were affectionately dubbed the French Cub. The French version became the Super Cub with a more powerful engine in 1958 until production ended in 1964. IH may have also unofficially built some Super Cubs at their factory in Louisville.
IH ended production of the Cub at the Louisville, Kentucky plant in 1981. Over 245,000 Cubs were manufactured between 1947 to 1981, making the Cub arguably the most popular small tractor in history.

Hiu Lui Ng

Hiu Lui Ng, a.k.a. Jason Ng, was a 34 year old New Yorker who died on August 5 or 6, 2008 in the custody of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The editors of "The New York Times" condemned the death, writing that Mr. Ng "paid the ultimate price for overstaying a visa, and getting lost in a sprawling system that some have likened to the gulag." 
Ng came to New York from Hong Kong in 1992 at age 17. He went to college, became a computer engineer, married a United States citizen, and fathered two American born sons. He entered the United States legally but had long overstayed his visa. The government rejected his pleas for political asylum. He missed a court date in 2001 when the order was sent to a nonexistent address, and the judge ordered him deported when he did not show up at the hearing. His wife, a naturalized citizen, had petitioned to get him legal residency, but he was seized at his final green card interview on July 19, 2007 on the old deportation order.
While in immigration detention, Ng grew frail and complained for months of excruciating back pain. Officials at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island said it was all an act and denied him an independent medical evaluation. Lawyers finally persuaded a judge to insist on suitable medical treatment for Ng by petitioning for habeas corpus. When he finally saw a doctor, the diagnosis was terminal cancer and a broken spine. He died five days later. The State Medical Examiners office later declared that he died due to complications of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma - liver cancer. His lawyers demanded a criminal investigation in a letter to federal and state prosecutors in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, and the Department of Homeland Security. An inquiry determined that when Ng told them he was too weak to proceed from his cell under his own power, guards would drag him along the floor.
Prompted by the death, Congressman José Enrique Serrano wrote in an August 13, 2008 letter to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement: "there is a certain standard we should live up to for everyone we have detained and it is outrageous that anyone would be treated in such a fashion while in your custody." Members of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation requested a Homeland Security investigation into the death.
In response to the case of Ng and a "Washington Post" article that identified 30 questionable deaths out of a total of 83 detainee deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency custody between March 2003 (when the agency was created) and March 2008, Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced the Detainee Basic Medical Bill (HR. 5950) in the House and Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) introduced the bill (S. 3005) in the Senate. The bill requires "the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish procedures for the timely and effective delivery of medical and mental health care to all immigration detainees in custody, and for other purposes." The bills did not survive past committee.

Camoflauge and Fatboi created underground classics and the summer sex anthem "Cut Friends" in 2001 under Universal Records. Camoflauge was killed in 2003 leaving a dark cloud on Fatboi's career being that he was an in-house producer at Pure Pain Records. After a brief incarceration, Fatboi bounced back in 2006 with super producer Shawty Redd producing hits "Let's Make A Movie" and "Drifter", to be featured on his upcoming Universal Motown release later this year. Also, he is known for his heavy drum and bass lines and melodic synth sounds. His production signature is some rapid snares and a voice in the beginning of his music saying "Look at Fatboi!"
DJ Lights Out quote:
“Fatboi is one of the hardest producers in the south. A lot of beats that people credit Shawty Redd for, Fat Boi was actually the man behind them. Definitely someone to look out for in 2009.”

Rustic furniture

Rustic furniture is furniture employing sticks, twigs or logs for a natural look. The term "rustic" is derived from National Park Service rustic style of architecture. Many companies, artists and craftspeople make rustic furniture in a variety of styles and with a variety of historical and contemporary influences.
History.
The rustic furniture movement developed during the mid- to late-1800s. Rustic furniture was originally made from whatever natural materials were in greatest supply, and often by poor people as items of trade for food or cash. The style is associated with the Great Depression and other hard times in America; however, it is also associated with the Great Camps built by wealthy Americans in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, of which the most familiar modern form is the Adirondack chair. Various rustic styles reflect the personality of their maker, with techniques such as chip carving, silver or gold brushwork, milk paint, peeled bark and other decorative enhancements. Many different wood species were used including willow, hickory, mountain laurel, and Alaska cedar. In the American South, palm fronds were occasionally employed. Historical examples of rustic furniture may be found in museums and antique shops, although fine historical pieces are rare outside a museum setting. One showcase for this style of furniture is the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York. The New York State Museum is home to: "Rustic Furniture: The Clarence O. Nichols Collection". Typical items of rustic furniture include chairs, love seats, tables, desks, smoking stands (often with a cabin on top), clocks, chest of drawers, rockers, coat racks, mirror frames and lamps.
Construction.
There are two basic types of rustic-furniture construction: bentwood (sticks are harvested fresh or steamed to make them supple, then bent into a variety of structures and decorative shapes) and twig work (sticks – straight, curved or forked – are assembled into structures and decorative shapes within a structure). Sometimes both types are used in the same piece. Some rustic furniture makers use mortice and tenon construction; others simply nail or screw members together. Dan Mack (Warwick, New York) is a well-known furniture maker who has authored several books on the subject. Ralph Kyloe has written books on rustic furniture and related topics. Present-day manufacturers of rustic furniture may also craft architectural details such as bridges, porches, banisters, stairs, tables, chandeliers and complete works of rustic architecture, like mountain laurel handrail.

Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978

The Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978 was a parliamentary by-election held on 13 April 1978 for the British House of Commons constituency of Glasgow Garscadden, in the north west periphery of the City of Glasgow.
It was won by Donald Dewar of the Labour Party. It was important in that it was widely seen as halting the Scottish National Party (SNP) tide in the 1970s.
Previous Member of Parliament.
The by-election was caused by the death of William Watson Small (19 October 1909 – 18 January 1978) who was a Labour Party politician from Scotland.
Small was an engineer. He was an Ayrshire County Councillor from 1945 to 1951 and an active member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, serving on its national committee from 1955 to 1957 and as president of the union's West Ayrshire district.
At the 1959 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Glasgow Scotstoun. At the February 1974 election he was elected for Glasgow Garscadden which was largely the same constituency under a new name. He held that seat until his death.
Small never held ministerial office, but served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Power from 1964.
Candidates.
Six candidates were nominated for the by-election.
The Labour candidate was Donald Campbell Dewar. He had worked as a solicitor in Glasgow before being elected at the age of 28 in the 1966 general election to Westminster to represent the marginal constituency of Aberdeen South. In his maiden speech in the Commons Dewar railed against a proposed increase on potato tax. This was his first notable success - the tax was repealed in 1967. That year he was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Education Secretary Anthony Crosland, who Dewar later confessed to never really establishing a rapport with. He held that position until 1969. In April 1968 he was proposed for a Minister of State position by Roy Jenkins but nothing came of it. He lost his seat to Ian Sproat at the 1970 general election.
Dewar later went on to become Secretary of State for Scotland, and the first First Minister of Scotland.
Representing the Scottish National Party (SNP) was Keith S. Bovey. He had previously contested the neighbouring seat of Glasgow Hillhead in February 1974 and Garscadden in the October 1974 general election. In that contest the SNP replaced the Conservative Party as the runners up to Labour in Glasgow Garscadden. He was also a senior figure in CND.
Bovey went on to contest Glasgow Hillhead in 1983, as well as Monklands West in the 1987 and 1992 general elections.
The Conservative nominee was Iain M. Lawson. He contested Dumbarton for the Tories in 1983. Later he was the SNP candidate for Stirling in 1987 and for Paisley South in the Paisley South by-election, 1990 and the 1992 general election.
Mrs S. Farrell represented the Scottish Labour Party, which was a short lived breakaway party from the Labour Party. She did not contest any other parliamentary election.
Sammy Barr was the Communist candidate. He contested Glasgow Garscadden in February 1974 and 1979, as well as at this by-election.
The Socialist Workers Party stood Peter Porteous, who did not contest any other parliamentary election.
Political context.
The by-election was important as it was the first Westminster by-election in Scotland to take place since the October 1974 general election, a lengthy gap. The SNP was widely seen as being on a rise, doing well at the 1977 district council elections.
Although the by-election saw a significant swing from Labour to SNP, because the SNP failed to take the seat it was seen as a defeat for them. Labour did even better, and the SNP worse, shortly after this, in the 1978 regional elections, and Westminster by-elections in Hamilton and Berwick and East Lothian.

Colegio Americano de Puebla

The Puebla American School Foundation () is a private school serving students in kindergarten through grade 12 in Puebla, Mexico. The school offers both the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the local BUAP (Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla) for the upper school.For elementary and middle school students, the Primary Years Programme and Middle Years Programme are offered. The school is well known around the city and Mexico alike for its prestigious Model United Nations, PASMUN.
History.
Founded in 1942, by Mrs. Anne Jenkins with the purpose of providing an education for the sons of American doctors living in Puebla City, the American School originally started giving classes in a spare garage that was used as a classroom. In 1943, the school formally opened to the public, this time occupying a rented house as the campus. The school was now attended by Mexican students wishing to receive a bilingual education as well as the previous Americans. Under the Leadership of Prof. J. L. Burleson as principal, the school periodically increased the number of enrolled students, changing locations several times in order to accommodate the growing number of members. By 1946, with the new Prof. H. Stephen Stockmeyer as principal, there were 150 students. By 1949, the La Paz Campus, which still stands today as the seat for the administrative and high school buildings, finished construction. At this time, there were 400 students enrolled in the school. Passing through several principals and a steady rise in the number of students, the American school of Puebla was forced to undergo construction in order to have more classrooms. Eventually, a new campus was needed and, thanks to a donation from Mr. William O. Jenkins, was established in 1965 in Las Animas, the current location of the Elementary School and Kindergarten. Due to the constant growth of the school, in 1975, the Huexotitla campus was bought from another school, and, after facing renovation served the school as well. Today it is the seat of the Junior high. In 2006, Dr. Chaffee retired after 36 years of service to the School as Superintendent. Today Dr. Galicia is the Superintendent.
Curriculum.
In 1995, the school associated with the International Baccalaureate Organization. By 2006, the School was authorized to teach the three IBO programs: the Primary Years Programme, the Middle Years Programme, and the Diploma Programme. The American School of Puebla was the first school in the City of Puebla and only fifth in the country to be authorized to teach all three IB programs.

Andrew Wheating

Andrew "Andy" Wheating is an American middle-distance track athlete. Wheating competed for the United States in the men's 800 m at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, and in the 1500 at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He is a professional runner for Nike.
Personal.
Wheating was born in 1987, the son of Justin and Betsy Wheating. His father, born in South Africa, was a field hockey player.
High school.
Wheating originally played soccer in high school. Wheating ran two seasons of cross country and one season of track during his stay at Kimball Union Academy. During his first season of track in his senior year, he burst onto the track scene, ranking fourth nationally with a time of 3:54.28 in the 1500 meters. He led the nation with a 14:55.28 indoor 5000 meter time. His school coach was Buzz Morrison. Wheating became one of the four incoming freshman at the University of Oregon that ranked top ten nationally in the 1500 m.
College career.
Wheating attended the University of Oregon in Eugene; his major was sociology. During his first year of track during the 2006–2007 season, Wheating ran the 800 m for the first time, and led the Ducks in the 800 with a time of 1:50.17. He got points in Pac-10 competition and was part of three relays that were all top five in school history. In addition, he was ranked seventh nationally in the 1500 metres with a time of 3:45.17. Wheating skipped his freshman year of cross country, making 2007 his first season. He was on the All-Pac-10 Second Team for finishing top fourteen in league competition. 
During his second season of track in his sophomore year, Wheating became one of the leaders in both the 800 and 1500 nationally. He won eleven straight races in the 800 m races before losing by .01s to Jacob Hernandez in the NCAA Division I national championship. He also excelled in the 1500, clocking a time of 3:38.60, good enough for sixth all time on the University of Oregon list. His time in the 1500 was an NCAA best in 2008, but chose to compete in the 800 instead in both NCAA Nationals and the Olympic Trials. His time of 1:45.03 at the Olympic Trials was good for second on the all-time Univ. of Oregon 800 metres list. He was the NCAA champion in the 800 in both 2009 and 2010. In winning the 1500 at the 2010 NCAA championship he became the first Division I man to win both the 800 and 1500 in the same season since fellow Duck Joaquim Cruz in 1984.
2008 Olympic Trials & Games.
At the 2008 Olympic Trials, Wheating ran a personal best time of 1:45.03, finishing in second place behind Nick Symmonds and earning a spot on the US Olympic Team. His somewhat unexpected qualification was the middle of the Oregon Sweep. In Beijing, he finished fourth in his qualifying heat and failed to advance to the semifinals.
Professional.
On July 16, 2010, Wheating improved on his personal best in the 800 m with a time of 1:44.62. Six days later, on July 22, Wheating improved on his personal best in the 1500 m with a time of 3:30.90. That was nearly seven seconds better than his previous best and the fourth-best mark in U.S. history.
Return To KUA.
On December 3, 2012, Andrew finally returned to his true home of Kimball Union Academy. Greeted by smiles and cookies. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Andy said he has "never been happier since finding true calling.

Chocolate News

Chocolate News was a satirical news show hosted and head written by David Alan Grier in 2008 with an emphasis on African American culture. The show aired on Wednesday nights at 10:30 PM on Comedy Central as a lead-in to their other news satire programs, "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and "The Colbert Report". The show also aired in Canada on The Comedy Network. On March 10, 2009 a Comedy Central representative confirmed that "Chocolate News" would not be renewed for a second season.
Format.
"Chocolate News" aired satirical pieces and sketches about current events and news stories. The show satirized these stories with a focus on how Grier thinks typical African Americans view them. In an interview with the New York Times, Grier asked "Are you laughing with me because you get the joke, or am I giving you license to laugh at me in a derogatory, dehumanizing way?" When the series was first pitched to studio executives at NBC, they were initially reluctant to produce and develop a pilot for the show due to the negative racial connotations associated with the term "Chocolate", It was only with the intervention of actors Martin Sheen and William Shatner that the studio decided to proceed with the pilot and eventually to commission the show.
Sketches were directed by Rusty Cundieff, who directed most of the sketches on Dave Chappelle's Chappelle's Show.

Russian monitor Rusalka

Rusalka (, "Mermaid"), was an ironclad monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1860s.
Design and description.
"Rusalka" was long at the waterline. She had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship was designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . Her crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877.
The ship had two simple horizontal direct-acting steam engines, each driving a single propeller. The engines were designed to produce a total of using steam provided by two coal firedrectangular fire-tube boilers, but only achieved and a speed of approximately during "Rusalka"s sea trials. She carried a maximum of of coal for her boilers.
"Rusalka" was initially armed with a pair of rifled Model 1867 guns in the forward gun turret and a pair of smoothbore Rodman guns in the aft turret. The Rodman guns were replaced by a pair of Obukhov rifled guns in 1871 and all of the nine-inch guns were replaced in their turn by longer, more powerful nine-inch Obukhov guns in 1878–79. No light guns for use against torpedo boats are known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when she received 3 four-pounder guns mounted on the turret tops as well as a variety of smaller guns that included Engström quick-firing (QF) guns, Nordenfelt guns, single-barreled QF Hotchkiss guns and QF Hotchkiss revolving cannon.
The ship had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to at the bow and at the stern. The armor was backed by of teak. The circular turrets were protected by armor thick and the walls of the ship's oval conning tower were also 4.5 inches thick. Her deck was thick amidships, but reduced to at the ends of the ship.
Construction and service.
"Rusalka", named after the mythological creature was ordered on 25 January 1865 and construction began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 at the cost of 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that she had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking. "Rusalka" served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.
Sinking.
"Rusalka", under the command of Captain 2nd Rank V. Kh. Ienish sailed from Reval (Tallinn) harbor at 08:30 on 7 September 1893, bound for Helsingfors (Helsinki). She was escorted by the gunboat "Tucha" (, "Cloud") under Captain 2nd Rank N. M. Lushkov. Several hours after their departure the weather deteriorated into a storm, with gale force winds and rain; "Tucha" lost her charge from sight around noon, but sailed on and arrived safely at Helsingfors.
No trace of the monitor was found until the corpse of a sailor in a dinghy and a few lifebuoys washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare. Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting "Rusalka" go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with the monitor. The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused "Rusalka" to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy. Whatever the cause, "Rusalka" obviously broached and sank with the loss of all 177 members of her crew.
Monument.
On 7 September 1902, the ninth anniversary of the loss of the ship, a monument to the "Rusalka" was erected in Tallinn. Sculpted by Amandus Adamson, it takes the form of a bronze angel standing on a granite pedestal.
Discovery.
The wreck of the "Rusalka" was claimed to have been found by divers of the Soviet EPRON salvage agency in 1932, but they made no attempt to salvage it. EPRON's location does not match that of the ship as discovered in 2003.
In the spring of 2003 the Estonian Maritime Museum and the commercial diving company "Tuukritööde OÜ" launched a joint project of finding "Rusalka" which had sunk 110 years earlier. On 22 July 2003 the wreck of the "Russalka" was located in the Gulf of Finland, south of Helsinki, by the museum's research vessel "Mare". Two days later, deep divers Kaido Peremees and Indrek Ostrat more precisely located and videoed the wreck. Most unusually, the wreck is in a near-vertical position; following her sinking, the vessel plunged, bow first, directly downward into the muddy bottom of the gulf, and is buried in the bottom to almost half her length. The divers saw the stern of the lost vessel rising 108 feet (33 meters) above the sea bed and her rudder turned to starboard.
The wreck is generally intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out of the ship. The vertical position of the wreck has led to a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that "Rusalka" was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain decided to make a turn, possibly to return to Reval, and capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.

Epiphysiodesis

Epiphysiodesis is a pediatric surgical procedure in which the epiphyseal (growth) plate of a bone is either fused temporarily or permanently to delay growth of a long bone. This procedure is often used to slow or halt the growth of a morphologically normal leg to allow a shorter leg to grow to a matching length.
Limitations.
The procedure must be performed for an appropriate duration during the patient's adolescent growth phase so that the limbs are near-equal in length by the end of skeletal growth. Poor timing can lead to a length mismatch, resulting in poor outcomes and significant patient morbidity.

Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa

Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa is a local university in the Philippines.
History.
On May 29, 1991, the Municipal Council of Muntinlupa passed Resolution No. 91-191 and Resolution No. 91-192 officially creating a government-run college, which gave rise to the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC). Housed in the Pedro E. Diaz High School in Alabang, Muntinlupa, the college started with 309 students.
With the increase in the number of enrollees, MPC moved to another temporary location on the second floor of the Contessa Building in Poblacion, where all offices and classrooms were air-conditioned. At this time MPC established linkages with the Commission on Higher Education for the development of quality education.
In March 1998, MPC realized its dream of moving from the compact Contessa Building to its own permanent two-storey building, which was erected at the Muntinlupa National High School Compound in the NBP Reservation Area.
In 2002, the construction of the Academic Building was completed with the third and fourth floors that house the library, auditorium and additional classrooms. A year later, by virtue of City Ordinance No. 03-089, MPC became a university and acquired its present name.
Admission requirements.
Special programs.

Unexpectedly, Colleen arrives because she was able to travel by bus to Atlanta and get a flight from there. Also arriving at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is Liz's family, including her brother Mitch who has "Trauma Induced Nivea Aphasia" which means that his memory is stuck on December 7, 1985, and he believes that he is still 17 years old, when he is actually 40. Jack's mother immediately dislikes the Lemons due to their constant optimism and happiness. Colleen sets out to show Jack that they're just as screwed up as their relationship is. Jack, Colleen and the Lemons spend the day together and eventually end up going to dinner with each other. At the dinner, Colleen comments that it appears that Liz is the "favorite" child leading Mitch to reveal that his parents, Dick and Margaret, took him to see "The Goonies" in 1985 when they should have been watching Liz at her football game. Liz then accidentally reveals to Mitch that he is in fact 40 years old. The Lemons then spiral into a drunken argument, achieving Colleen's plan.
Meanwhile, the cast and writers of "TGS" are preparing their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because he is unable to attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires the cast and writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.
The episode ends with the "TGS" cast and crew celebrating Christmas with each other and while at the dinner with the Lemons who are still arguing Jack says to Colleen "Merry Christmas Mother" revealing that he's happy to see the Lemons aren't so perfect after all.
Production.
The storyline in this episode, which features Tracy having to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor alcohol levels in his sweat due to a driving under the influence arrest, is based on events which actually happened to actor Tracy Morgan, who portrays Tracy Jordan. Morgan has twice been arrested for drunk driving: once in December 2005 and once in November 2006. He was sentenced to 36 months probation, fined US$390, and mandated to attend an alcohol education program at the 2005 arrest. As a result of the 2006 arrest, Morgan was fined US$1000 and had his drivers license suspended for six months. Morgan was also ordered to wear a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM), "an ankle bracelet worn to test for alcohol vapors that come out of the skin".
NBC billed this episode on its press releases as "Episode 209". The episode had been unofficially titled "Ludachristmas", until it was confirmed by the second season DVD. Similarly, the following episode also remains unnamed and is officially known as "Episode 210".
Kay Cannon, a writer for "30 Rock", appears in this episode as a Human Table at the Ludachristmas party. Cannon previously appeared as an unnamed wife character in "Fireworks", an episode of the first season. Cannon co-wrote "The Head and the Hair", an episode of the first season, and "Somebody to Love", an episode of the second season. Both episodes were co-written with the series creator, Tina Fey.
Reception.
The episode brought in an average 5.6 million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, achieving a 2.8/7 in the key 18–49 year old demographic. The 2.8 refers to 2.8% of all people of ages 18–49 years old, and the 7 refers to 7% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast. It ranked second place in the 18–49 demographic and tied with CBS's "" episode "Lying Down With Dogs" for first place among men aged 18–49.
Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote that "it's hard to make a 'true meaning of Christmas' story seem fresh. That's why this week's Kenneth/No LudaChristmas bit was a bit lame, in my opinion", although he did say "the A story Jack and Liz's respective families fared a bit better". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that this episode was "a modern, irreverent look at name="ts"></ref> Jeff Labrecque of "Entertainment Weekly" thought that Buck Henry and Andy Richter were both "destined to play" their roles. He also wrote that "[Elaine Stritch wasn't as brilliant as she's been in previous appearances, but she's always welcome, simply because her character riles Jack." Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode "had all the trimmings for a holiday classic, though it fell just shy of that pantheon." He added that "this may not have been the "30 Rock" holiday classic people were hoping for, but it was a solid, funny episode nonetheless." Canning rated this episode 8 out of 10.
Elaine Stritch was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for this episode.

Acneiform eruption

Acneiform eruption refers to a group of dermatoses including acne vulgaris, rosacea, folliculitis, and perioral dermatitis. Restated, acneiform eruptions are follicular eruptions characterized by papules and pustules resembling acne.
The term "acneiform", literally, refers to an appearance similar to acne.
The terminology used in this field can be complex, and occasionally contradictory. Some sources consider acne vulgaris part of the differential diagnosis for an acneiform eruption. Other sources classified acne vulgaris under acneiform eruption. MeSH explicitly excludes perioral dermatitis from the category of "acneiform eruptions", though it does group acneiform eruptions and perioral dermatitis together under "facial dermatoses".

The Timan Ridge ( – "Timansky Kryazh") is a highland in the far north of European Russia. Most of the Timan Ridge is situated in the Komi Republic, but the northernmost part is in Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Arkhangelsk Oblast. The highest point in the Timan Ridge is Chetlassky Kamen ( AMSL).
The Timan Ridge is situated west of the northern Ural Mountains, and is a part of the East European Plain. It lies west of the Pechora River, and divides the eastern and western parts of the North Russian Lowlands. The Timan Ridge ends at the Barents Sea in the north. 
The Timan Ridge, which lies within the taiga and tundra belts, is characterized by a mountainous hill terrain, grinded and formed by the ice during the Ice Ages. Several rivers have their sources in the Timan Ridge; the most important being the Izhma (a tributary of the Pechora), the Mezen, and the Vychegda (a tributary of the Northern Dvina).
The largest town in the otherwise sparsely populated Timan Ridge is Ukhta, founded in the 1930s in order to open up the Timan Ridge for extraction of raw materials. There are numerous mineral deposits in the Timan Ridge − such as natural gas, petroleum, bauxite and titanium.

Dhammadharini Vihara

Dhammadharini Vihara was a Buddhist monastic retreat (vihara) for women in the Niles District of Fremont, California. Dhammadharini opened its doors in August 2005, with room for three resident nuns. In 2009, it was replaced by the permanent Aranya Bodhi ("Awakening Forest Hermitage") in Jenner and a part-time "urban" residence called "Bodhi House," in Fremont. The name, "Dhammadharini," is interpreted as, a "holder" or "upholder" (feminine form) of the Buddhadhamma as a "flowing" or "streaming" reality, teaching and practice. A "Vihara" is a monastic residence, refuge and center of practice." 
Dhammadharini is most notable as the first Theravada monastery for women in the Western United States. Women's Buddhist monasteries are rare. When Dhammadharini was founded, it became the third in the entire United States. A focus of Dhammadharini Foundation's mission is to support bhikkhunis, fully ordained Buddhist nuns. The Vihara observed the Theravada (mostly southern Asia) Thai Forest Tradition, including annual Vassa. The Abbess and founder, Ayya Tathaaloka, entered monastic life at age 19. She studied in several Buddhist traditions, as well as with her mentor, Ajahn Maha Prasert of the Thai Forest Tradition. She welcomed bhikkhunis and Vihara visitors from other traditions and now welcomes them at Aranya Bodhi. Dhammadharini was home to several renunciates (women training for ordination), as well as their teacher, Ayya Tathaaloka. The physical building was a small, leased condominium, paid for by the supporting Dhammadharini Foundation. Vihara residents relied on the support of the lay community, often walking the neighborhood for almsmeals and accepting what food was offered. The supporting community provided the rent, as well as other requisites described in the Vinaya. The Vihara offered Dhamma teachings, Sutta discussions and the opportunity for individually arranged lay retreat.

Haslingden Canal

The Haslingden Canal was a proposed canal link between the Bury arm of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal in Greater Manchester, England, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Accrington, England, passing through Haslingden. Authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1794, the canal was not built.
The proposed canal would have been broad gauge, in length, and would have used an inclined plane in place of locks.
History.
The Leeds and Liverpool Canal had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1770, and by 1777, a long section at the eastern end from Leeds to Gargrave was open, as was another section at the western end from Wigan to Liverpool. There was then a pause until 1790, when work began again on the middle section, but its precise route was still under discussion. At the time, the Rochdale Canal was being promoted, which would provide an alternative crossing of the Pennines, and some of the shareholders were suggesting that the central section was therefore not necessary, and that the canal should be re-routed to serve towns in East Lancashire. In addition, the Lancaster Canal was being promoted, the southern section of which would cut across the route of the Leeds and Liverpool on its way from Preston to Westhoughton, while the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal were promoting an extension westwards from Bolton to Red Moss, to the south of Horwich, which would only be successful if the Leeds and Liverpool would connect to it. The Leeds and Liverpool instructed their engineers, Robert Whitworth and Joseph Priestley, to survey a branch to Red Moss.
There were suggestions that the Leeds and Liverpool should be linked to the Rochdale by building a branch between Burnley and Todmorden, and an increasing number of shareholders were convinced that the canal should be routed further east. Whitworth and Priestley presented a report, which outlined a plan to re-route the Newburgh to Bamber Bridge section through Duxbury, Red Moss, where there would be a junction with the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal, Westhoughton, Hindley and Platt Bridge, where it would join the River Douglas Navigation. The disadvantage of the route was the need for locks to raise the level by to reach Red Moss, and a longer route via Burnley, Accrington and Blackburn was also considered. It was longer, but all on one level, and avoided the water supply problems likely with the Red Moss route.
In 1792, the Manchester Bolton & Bury company proposed extending their Bury Branch to Rochdale, but agreed to drop the plan if the Leeds and Liverpool would build their line via Red Moss. The Leeds and Liverpool decided that a link to the Rochdale Canal would be better than an extension of the Bury Branch, and approved the East Lancashire diversion via Red Moss in February 1792. A bill to authorise it was presented to Parliament in 1793, but was defeated by the combined opposition of the Lancaster Canal and the Duke of Bridgewater.
At this point, the Haslingden Canal was proposed, as an additional link between the Manchester Bury and Bolton at Bury and the Leeds and Liverpool at Church, near Accrington. Engineers from both canals had decided it was feasible, and William Bennet had worked on the detailed design. It would be long, and have to rise by to reach the summit at Haslingden, which was an expanding manufacturing centre. An Act of Parliament was obtained by the promoters in April 1794, which failed to mention a junction with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, even the Leeds and Liverpool believed there would be one. There were severe restrictions on water supply and locks, and if agreement could not be reached with three-quarters of the millers and factories affected, changes in level were to be achieved by "rollers, racks, inclined planes, or any other works, engines or machinery, as a substitute for locks." The company had powers to raise £47,000 by issuing shares, and an additional £40,000 if required, either by issuing more shares or by mortgaging the tolls.
There was an attempt in July 1794 to engage millowners in a discussion about how alternatives to locks might work, but the project appears to have faded away after that. In 1797, the company was would up, and the Red Moss scheme was also abandoned at the same time. Hadfield and Biddle have suggested that the scheme might have been a political move, rather than a genuine proposal. In 1805, the Leeds and Liverpool decided to press ahead with the line to Red Moss, but reported that the Manchester Bolton & Bury were no longer ready to do so, although that company kept no record of the event. In 1810, common sense prevailed, and the Leeds and Liverpool agreed to share the southern end of the Lancaster Canal between Johnson's Hillock and Kirkless, near Wigan. Concessions on tolls agreed between the companies meant that a link to the Manchester Bolton & Bury was unlikely to be built.

Thelda Williams

Thelda Williams is an American politician, former interim mayor of and current councilwoman in the city of Phoenix, Arizona.
Williams, who had served on the Phoenix city council since 1989, was selected by the council to serve as an interim mayor of the city on March 29, 1994, following the resignation of former mayor Paul Johnson. Johnson, who was announcing his candidacy for the office of governor, was forced to resign his position due to state law prohibiting current officeholders from seeking another office except in the last year of their term. Coincidentally, Johnson had first been elevated to the office of mayor under similar circumstances when former mayor Terry Goddard had resigned his office to run for governor in 1990.
Williams chose not to seek election to the office of mayor during the 1994 special election, and resumed her duties as councilwoman on November 3, 1994. Williams chose to challenge the new incumbent Skip Rimsza for the office during the regular elections in 1995 but was defeated; having not run for reelection in her council seat, she left the city council in 1996. Williams ran for a new term in 2007 and was elected to a four-year term on the Phoenix city council on September 11, 2007. Williams was elected to another four-year term in 2011.

Brown-headed spider monkey

The brown-headed spider monkey ("Ateles fusciceps fusciceps "), is a critically endangered subspecies of the black-headed spider monkey, a type of New World monkey, found in northwestern Ecuador.
Its type locality is at 1500 m in the Hacienda Chinipamba, Imbabura Province in North-West Ecuador. Some authorities, such as Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), do not recognize the black-headed spider monkey as a distinct species and so treat the brown-headed spider monkey as a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey.
The brown-headed spider monkey lives in tropical and subtropical humid forests that are between above sea level. It lives in population densities of 1.2 monkeys per square kilometer. It has a black or brown body and a brown head, while the Colombian spider monkey ("A. f. rufiventris") is entirely black with some white on its chin.

Annie M. P. Smithson

Annie Mary Patricia Smithson (26 September 1873 – 21 February 1948) was an Irish novelist, poet and Nationalist.
Smithson was born into a Protestant family in Sandymount, Dublin. She was christened Margaret Anne Jane, but took the names Anne Mary Patricia on her conversion to Catholicism. Her mother and father were first cousins and her father died when she was young. About 1881 her mother married her second husband, Peter Longshaw, who owned a chemical factory in Warrington in Lancashire. Smithson disliked her stepfather and referred to him always as Mr Longshaw. There were five children of the second marriage.
Smithson abandoned her ambition to become a journalist in order to train as a nurse and a midwife. She trained in London and Edinburgh, before returning to Dublin in 1900. In 1901 she took up a post as district nurse in Millton, Co. Down. There she fell in love with her colleague Dr James Manton, a married man. Deciding that a relationship was impossible, she left Millton in 1906. They kept up a correspondence until her conversion, when she burnt his letters.
She converted to Catholicism in March 1907 and became a fervent Republican and Nationalist. She became a member of Cumann na mBan and campaigned for Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election.
She took the Republican side in the Irish Civil War and nursed participants in the siege at Moran's Hotel. In 1922 she was imprisoned by Free State forces and was rescued from Mullingar prison by Linda Kearns McWhinney and Muriel MacSwiney, posing as a Red Cross delegation. Her political views led to her resignation from the Queen's Nurses Committee and a move into private nursing. In 1924 she wrote a series of articles on child welfare work for the "Evening Mail" newspaper, based on her work in tenements in the Dublin Liberties, one of the poorest areas of the city, where she continued to work until 1929.
She was Secretary and Organiser of the Irish Nurses Organisation from 1929 to 1942. She wrote for the "Irish Nurses' Magazine" and edited the "Irish Nurses Union Gazette".
In 1917 she published her first novel, "Her Irish Heritage", which became a best-seller. It was dedicated to those who died in the Easter Rising of 1916. In all, she published twenty novels and two short story collections. Other successful novels included "By Strange Paths" and "The Walk of a Queen". Many of her works are highly romantic and draw on her own life experiences, with nationalism and Catholicism featuring as recurrent themes. In 1944 she published her autobiography, "Myself - and Others".
From 1932 onwards she shared a house in Rathmines, Dublin with her stepsister and her stepsister's family. She died of heart failure at 12 Richmond Hill, Dublin and was buried in Whitechurch, County Dublin.
Her novels feature in Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa. Between 1989 and 1990 the Mercier Press reprinted several of her works.

Ludwig Merzbacher

Ludwig Merzbacher (February 9, 1875 – 1942) was a German-Argentine neuropathologist and psychiatrist born in Florence, Italy.
In 1900 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Strassburg, afterwards remaining in Strassburg as an assistant at the physiological institute. Later he worked at psychiatric clinics in Freiburg (1902–04) and Heidelberg (1904–06), obtaining his habilitation for psychiatry in 1906 at the University of Tübingen. 
From 1906 until 1910 he worked at the psychiatric clinic in Tübingen, where he was an assistant to Robert Gaupp (1870–1953). During this time period, he also spent several months in Munich, conducting research in the laboratory of Alois Alzheimer (1864-1915). Here he performed in-depth analysis on the reaction patterns of scavenger cells (reactive microglia).
In 1910 Merzbacher moved to Argentina, where he was appointed head of the laboratory in the psychiatric clinic at Buenos Aires. From 1914 to 1919 he was in charge of the department of pathological anatomy at the "Clínica Modelö", and beginning in 1924, was chief physician at the "German hospital" in Buenos Aires.
He is remembered for his pathological studies of a dysmyelinating central nervous system disorder that is now referred to as "Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease" (PMD). This eponymous disease is named along with German balneologist Friedrich Christoph Pelizaeus (1851–1942). Merzbacher described his research of the disorder in a 1910 paper titled "Eine eigenartige familiärhereditäre Erkrankungform".

Zhongshan Park (Beijing)

The Zhongshan Park (Chinese: 中山公园/中山公園), is a former imperial garden and now a public park that lies just southwest of the Forbidden City in the Dongcheng District of central Beijing. 
Of all the gardens and parks surrounding the Forbidden City, such as the Beihai and Jingshan, Zhongshan is arguably the most centrally located of them all. The Zhongshan Park houses numerous pavilions, gardens, and imperial temples such as the Altar of Earth and Harvests or "Altar of Land and Grain" in some translations (Shejitan, 社稷坛), which was built in 1421 by the Yongle Emperor, and it symmetrically opposite the Imperial Ancestral Temple, and is where the emperors of Ming and Qing dynasties made offerings to the gods of earth and agriculture. The altar consists of a square terrace in the centre of the park. 
By 1914, the altar grounds had become a public park known as the "Central Park". That park was then further renamed in 1928 after Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan Park), in memory of China's first revolutionary political leader who helped bring about the first republic era in 1911, which is what the park is known as today. Many parks in China during that period also took on this name (see Zhongshan Park).
The Zhongshan Park includes various halls and pavilions built for the members of the imperial family, stone archways and a greenhouse which houses fresh flowers on display all year round. The greenhouse includes 39 varieties of tulips presented to the park in 1977 by the Princess of Holland.

Lake Tshangalele

Lake Tshangalele, also known as Lake Lufira or Mwadingusha Reservoir, is an artificial lake in the south-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located about 20 km east of the city of Likasi in the old province of Katanga. It lies at about 1,100 m above sea-level in a large depression surrounded by low mountains. It was created by a dam built on the Lufira River near Mwadingusha in 1926 to provide hydro-electric power. The area of open water is about 362.5 km2. During the wettest months of February and March, the area flooded reaches a maximum of 440 km2. The lake is shallow with a mean depth of only 2.6 m.
The lake holds a variety of fish including longfin tilapia ("Oreochromis macrochir"), redbelly tilapia ("Tilapia zillii"), thinface cichlid ("Serranochromis angusticeps") and North African catfish ("Clarias gariepinus"). It supports an important commercial fishery with the tilapias the main species caught. Surrounding the lake, there are extensive swamps where "Typha" and "Cyperus" grow. The region is rich in birdlife such as the Lake Lufira Weaver ("Ploceus ruweti") which is endemic to the area. The lake was declared a Biosphere Reserve in 1982 and is classed as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

Lee Sheriden

Lee Sheriden (born Roger Pritchard, 11 April 1949, Horfield, Bristol) is a British singer/songwriter and musical director, best known as a member of pop group Brotherhood of Man.
Early career.
As a child, Roger Pritchard learned the piano and later took up the guitar when he joined his first group at the age of 14. This group appeared on a television talent show but he soon found his way into other groups. After he left school he became a resident musician at the "Top Rank" club in Bristol (now renamed "The Works") for four years. In the early 1970s he embarked on a career as a songwriter. This brought him to the attention of Tony Hiller, who was looking for songwriters for his publishing company. Sheriden signed up with Tony Hiller Music and soon after Hiller, aware that Sheriden could also sing, asked him to be a part of the new Brotherhood of Man line-up.
Sheriden agreed and along with Martin Lee and Nicky Stevens, appeared on various television and radio shows. While Sheriden released a solo single in January 1973 called "Sweetest Tasting Candy Sugar", Hiller began composing songs with Sheriden and Lee with the view to putting together an album.
In 1973 the group released two singles "Happy Ever After" and "Our World of Love", but neither charted. In late 1973 they were joined by singer Sandra Stevens and the now four-piece group secured a record deal with the Pye spin-off Dawn Records. Sheriden along with Hiller wrote the first single "When Love Catches Up on You", but it was the second release "Lady" which gained them attention by becoming a hit in Europe.
Success in Europe.
With an album completed and released before the end of 1974, the group scored their next big hit with "Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby". According to Sheriden, during writing sessions for their second album, he came up with a song called "Save Your Kisses for Me", which the others rejected initially. He then presented it to them again as Hiller was looking for a song to enter in the following year's . This time they went with it and after some rewriting the song won the contest in 1976. It went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest and became a No. 1 in many countries, selling over a million copies in the UK alone.
The writing team of Sheriden, Hiller and Lee continued for the next few years, writing hit singles and albums for the group. Sheriden himself also acted as Musical Director on the recordings, as he later recalled; "It was my job as musical director to go home and sit down and write the score. there were no computers and no synthesizers in those days, you had to do it the old-fashioned way and write out all the music for the orchestra." Sheriden would then spend the day in the studio working with the musicians before the singers would come in later in the evening. "They'd been in bed all day while I'd been working, but the idea is the voices would be warmer, you can sing better at night". Two more UK #1s followed in the form of "Angelo" (1977) and "Figaro" (1978).
As a songwriter, Sheriden received three Ivor Novello Awards. In 1981, after his career wound down, he left the band and studied for a Degree in Music. He was replaced by Barry Upton in 1982, but it was just two years before the band split completely.
In 1986, Sheriden agreed to reunite with Martin Lee, Sandra Stevens and Nicky Stevens and the group were again touring. The line-up still continues to this day and the group appear regularly on television around Europe as well as performing in concert. On 23 March 2007 Sheriden took part in a charity concert as a solo act. After the show he stated that it was the only time he'd performed solo on stage.
Personal life.
Sheriden is married with two daughters.
At the time of his Eurovision wins he was still living in Ashley Down in Bristol but moved to Hertfordshire the following year. He currently lives with his wife in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="18924918" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18924918" title="Oldham by-election, 1899">
Oldham by-election, 1899

The Oldham by-election of 1899 occurred in the summer of that year, and involved a by-election to fill both seats in the two-member Oldham Parliamentary borough. The block voting method allowed each elector to vote for two candidates. The election resulted in the Liberal Party winning both seats from the Conservatives who had previously held them; however the election is principally notable for being the first to be fought by future Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
Cause.
At the beginning of 1899, the two Members of Parliament for Oldham were Robert Ascroft and James Oswald. However, Oswald had been chronically ill for many months and had been absent from his Parliamentary duties and his constituency; he had indicated that he would not seek re-election and left a resignation note with the Conservative Party and instructed them to use it if they thought it expedient. Ascroft was an active Parliamentarian, but was struck down with pneumonia at his home in Croydon on Monday 12 June, becoming partially unconscious. Over the next few days his condition did not improve, and by Sunday 18 June there was said to be "very little hope". He died on the afternoon of 19 June.
Ascroft's sudden death created an opportunity for the Conservative Party to use Oswald's resignation note and hold a double by-election, but the party delayed the decision until Ascroft's funeral on Friday 23 June. It was later observed that Ascroft was very popular in the town but had not maintained a group of election campaign workers, presumably hoping that his personal support would be enough. The forcing of a by-election therefore caught Oldham Conservatives unawares. Nevertheless on Monday 26 June Oswald's resignation note was sent in, and in consequence he was appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead as a way of resigning his seat.
Candidates.
Before his illness, Ascroft had already invited Winston Churchill to the House of Commons to ask him to replace Oswald and run as the second candidate at the next election. The date of the meeting had been fixed for some time when Churchill noticed in the newspapers that Ascroft had died. The Conservative Party officers met in Oldham on the evening of 23 June as arranged to hear from Churchill, and unanimously adopted him as the party's candidate for the single by-election to replace Ascroft. The meeting then decided to leave the question of a second candidate to another meeting on the following night. Churchill was principally known as the son of Lord Randolph Churchill, a senior Conservative politician who had died four years earlier; although only 24, he had begun a journalistic career as a war correspondent with the "Morning Post". According to one observer, society then knew Churchill as "a brilliant and irrepressible talker".
The second Conservative candidate turned out to be James Mawdsley, who was secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, an unusual case of a Conservative who was an active trade unionist. The choice of Mawdsley as Conservative candidate had been kept secret and surprised several Conservatives who were not in the very small meeting at which the candidates were adopted. There was some discussion of which of the two very different Conservative candidates, the aristocrat or the labour representative, would be more popular in Oldham.
Only one name was initially put forward for the Liberal Party selection, that of Alfred Emmott; however by the time the selection meeting took place on the evening of Monday 26 June it was clear that there would be a double vacancy and Emmott was adopted together with Walter Runciman. Emmott had been a member of Oldham corporation for nearly twenty years and was the town's Mayor in 1891–92; he had been invited, but had declined, the offer of the Liberal candidacy in 1886. Runciman was the 28-year-old son of a shipping magnate, with whom he shared a name.
Campaign.
The writ for a new election for both seats was moved in the House of Commons by the Conservative chief whip William Walrond on Tuesday 27 June. Polling day was set for Thursday 6 July.
As the previous election had been close, the by-election campaign was an intense one in which the candidates addressed meetings "at breakfast time, during the dinner hour, and in the evening". One of the main campaign issues was the Clerical Tithes Bill, which the Conservative-dominated government was promoting; the Bill gave additional help to Church of England clergy and to Church schools. Oldham included many non-conformists who were opposed to the Bill. When the issue of the Bill was raised, the Liberal candidates opposed it, arguing that Parliament was not the place to discuss matters of faith; Churchill initially supported it on the basis that legislation was needed to maintain law and order. A Protestant delegation representing several organisations was pleased with the pledge to support the Bill and strongly endorsed Churchill and Mawdsley. However, when Churchill (who later admitted that he knew nothing of the issue) found out how unpopular the Bill was, he declared in a speech three days before polling day that he would have voted against it in accordance with the wishes of his constituents. 
Churchill made a campaigning visit to Hollinwood, then known as a strongly anti-Conservative area, as his father had done in previous elections; his appearance prompted a heckler to declare "Eh, lad, thou art a chip of t'owd block". On 3 July the two Conservative candidates received a delegation on Women's suffrage, to which Churchill declared himself opposed, saying that it would lessen the respect for women "which all men very rightly have". Mawdsley, however, declared his support.
The presence of trade unionist James Mawdsley as a Conservative candidate caused some degree of protest. The Royton branch of his union passed (by 107 to 54 votes) a motion protesting at his candidature, and Mawdsley was asked why he had not come forward as a Labour candidate when invited to in 1895. Mawdsley replied that there had been a decision to run two candidates: one being Liberal-Labour and the other (himself) a Conservative-Labour candidate. He further said that he would support a Liberal-Labour candidate. The Independent Labour Party, despite not standing a candidate, held a meeting calling on working men to free themselves from both established parties. It was reported that the Conservatives accepted Mawdsley as a candidate on the assumption that if elected, he would be allowed to express his own views on trade union issues.
Result.
On polling day, the Conservatives were said to have been outnumbered by Liberals in the number of carriages conveying voters to the polls by 130 to 90. Lady Randolph Churchill turned up in a striking blue dress and sunshade. Churchill himself tried to obtain a motor car from Coventry to bring voters to the polls, but it broke down at Stafford and never arrived. Polling closed at 8 PM.
Shortly after 11 PM the result was announced from the town hall.
Aftermath.
The loss of both seats caused some recriminations in Conservative circles. Henry Howorth, in a letter to "The Times", took it as an object lesson that "playing at pitch and toss" with Conservative principles would not lead to a victory and that it was better that the party went into opposition than "surrender to every Socialistic demand".
Winston Churchill had impressed as an election candidate, being described as "working like a Trojan". However "The Times" correspondent felt that his speeches concentrated more on good phrases than on good arguments and that his popularity was superficial.

Dan Norman

Daniel Edmund Norman (born January 11, 1955 in Los Angeles, California) is a former right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Mets (1977–80) and Montreal Expos (1982). His professional career started in the Cincinnati Reds organization but he never played a major league game for the Reds.
Cincinnati Reds.
After playing at Barstow College, Norman was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 15th round of the 1974 amateur draft. He was the 357th overall selection.
After signing with the Reds, Norman joined the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League, the Reds' rookie league affiliate. One of his teammates on the Mustangs was the Reds 5th round draft choice, left fielder Steve Henderson, whose career often intersected Norman's. In 68 games for the Mustangs in 1974, Norman put up an impressive batting average of .297 and a slugging percentage of .441.
In 1975, Norman was promoted to the Reds' class A affiliate, the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League. Playing again alongside Henderson, Norman played 129 games with a batting average of .273 and a slugging percentage of .393.
In 1976, Norman was promoted to the Reds' class AA affiliate, the Trois-Rivières (Three Rivers) Aigles of the Eastern League. There (once again playing alongside Henderson) Norman played 134 games, repeating his batting average from 1975 of .273, and putting up a slugging percentage of .454.
This earned Norman a promotion to the Reds' AAA affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association for the 1977 season. Through June 15, 1977, Norman, again playing alongside Henderson, played 60 games for the Indians, with a batting average of .249 and a slugging percentage of .411. On June 15, 1977, Norman and Henderson were traded from the Reds to the New York Mets, along with infielder Doug Flynn and pitcher Pat Zachry in exchange for star pitcher Tom Seaver. Met fans still refer to events of that night as "The Midnight Massacre", mourning the loss of both Hall of Fame pitcher Seaver and home run leader Dave Kingman in trades that night.
New York Mets.
Although Henderson was immediately promoted to the Mets major league team, Norman was sent to the Mets AAA affiliate, the Tidewater Tides of the International League. In 80 games with the Tides Norman posted a batting average of .264, and on-base percentage of .344 and a slugging percentage of .435. Norman was called up to the Mets late in the season, making his Major League debut with the Mets on September 27, 1977 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In total he played 7 games for the Mets in 1977, getting 4 hits in 16 at-bats for a .250 batting average. He also drew 4 walks, giving him an on-base percentage of .400.
Norman spent the 1978 and 1979 seasons alternating between Tidewater and the Mets. In 1978 he played 19 games for the Mets, getting his first Major League home run, and posting a batting average of .266, an on-base percentage of .284 and a slugging percentage of .484. In 1979 he played 44 games with the Mets, with a batting average of .245, an on-base percentage of .311 and a slugging percentage of .373.
1980 was Norman's only complete season in the Major Leagues. He played in 69 games for the Mets, but his batting average was a poor .185. With just 2 home runs and 6 walks, both his on-base percentage and slugging percentage were under .300. He was demoted back to Tidewater for the 1981 season.
Norman played 40 games for Tidewater in 1981, with a batting average of .247. On May 29, 1981 he was traded along with pitcher Jeff Reardon to the Montreal Expos in exchange for right fielder Ellis Valentine.
Montreal Expos.
Norman spent the latter part of the 1981 season playing for the Montreal Expos AAA affiliate, the Denver Bears of the American Association. He played in 73 games for Denver with 11 home runs, a batting average of .272, an on-base percentage of .348 and a slugging percentage of .490. 
In 1982 Norman split his time between the Expos Major League team and their new AAA affiliate, the Wichita Aeros. He played in 53 games for the Expos, getting 66 at-bats. With a batting average of just .212, that was Norman's last season in the Major Leagues. He continued to bounce around the minor leagues through the 1987 season, ending his professional career at age 32.

An invest in meteorology (short for "investigation" or "to investigate", alternatively written INVEST) is a designated area of disturbed weather that is being monitored for tropical cyclone development. Invests are designated by three separate forecast centers: the National Hurricane Center, Central Pacific Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The designation of a system as an invest does not necessarily correspond to any particular likelihood of development of the system into a tropical cyclone. 
Designation.
Invests are designated by three separate forecast centers: the National Hurricane Center, Central Pacific Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The designation of a system as an invest does not necessarily correspond to any particular likelihood of development of the system into a tropical cyclone. Invests are numbered from 90 to 99, followed by L in the Atlantic, E and C in the East and Central Pacific respectively, or W in the West Pacific; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issues unofficial warnings for the Australian cyclone region, designating tropical invests with the "S" suffix when they form west of 135°E, and the "P" suffix when they form east of 135°E. Invests in the North Indian Ocean cyclone basin are also labelled by the JTWC, and are suffixed with "A" if they form in the Arabian Sea and with "B" if they form in the Bay of Bengal. Numbers are rotated within the season and are re-used as necessary (the next invest after 99 would be numbered 90). If the system develops into a tropical cyclone, it is reclassified as the next name/number on the list.

Papal election, 1280–81

The papal election from September 22, 1280 to February 22, 1281 elected Simon de Brion, who took the name Pope Martin IV, as the successor to Pope Nicholas III.
The protracted election is unique due to the violent removal of two cardinals—Matteo Orsini and Giordano Orsini—by the magistrates of Viterbo on the charges that they were "impeding" the election. Only a decade earlier, the magistrates of Viterbo had intervened in the papal election, 1268–1271 by removing the roof tiles of the Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo to speed up another deadlocked contest. The expulsion of the Orsini and the subsequent election of Simon was due to the influence of Charles I of Naples ("Charles of Anjou"), who was present at Viterbo for the election.
Context.
The previous meeting of the cardinals, the papal election, 1277, had dragged on for six months as the six cardinal electors (the fewest in the history of the Roman Catholic Church), were evenly divided between the Roman and Angevin factions. The aged Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was elected Pope Nicholas III, to the dissatisfaction of Charles I of Naples, whom the three French cardinals supported.
Previously, Pope Clement IV had crowned Charles I the King of Naples and Sicily (previously a papal fief), but had failed to sufficiently stack the College of Cardinals with like-minded cardinals. Following Clement's death, the papal election, 1268–1271, was the longest in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, eventually electing outsider Teobaldo Visconti as Pope Gregory X, who concerned his papacy with little more than the advocacy of the Crusades (having been elected while not a cardinal on the Crusades). Although Gregory X had issued a papal bull "Ubi Periculum" (1274), mandating the stricture of the papal conclave to accelerate disputed papal elections, the bull was not in force at the time of this election, having been revoked by Pope John XXI.
Proceedings.
From the start of the conclave, the anti-Angevin faction—mostly created cardinals by Nicholas III, who controlled many key positions in the College and included three Orsini cardinals, had consolidated themselves as an unbreakable voting block.
The breakthrough in the deadlock came when Charles I replaced Orso Orsini, the "podestà" of Viterbo, with Riccardello Annibaldi, who proceeded to burst into the election and arrest and remove the Orsini cardinals, allowing the pro-Angevin faction and the Aldobrandeschi partisans to push through the election of Simon de Brion, the favored candidate of Charles, as Pope Martin IV. Giordano, the leader of the anti-French faction, and his nephew Matteo, were imprisoned, actions that ensured that the new French pope would find no welcome in returning to Rome.
Aftermath.
The imprisonment of the cardinals caused an interdict to be placed on the city of Viterbo; as a result of the interdict, and of the hostility of the city of Rome to a French pontiff, Martin IV moved to Orvieto, where he was crowned on March 23. Among the first acts of Martin IV were to remove from prominent positions the Orsini cardinal-nephews of his predecessor, Nicholas III, and to replace them with French and pro-French candidates.
Martin IV remained dependent on Charles throughout his papacy; soon after his coronation, on 29 April he named Charles a Roman Senator and assisted in his attempts to restore the Latin Empire, including through the excommunication of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. The latter act resulted in the undoing of the fragile union of East and West brokered at the Council of Lyons in 1274. Martin IV's support of Charles continued after the Sicilian Vespers, when Martin IV excommunicated Peter III of Aragon, recently elected by the Sicilians as king, and further declared null his kingship in Aragon and ordered a crusade against him, which resulted in the ensuing War of the Sicilian Vespers.
The first seven cardinals appointed by Martin IV were French, but the fact that Martin IV's death coincided with that of Charles I inevitably began to weaken the French influence.

The Czech Republic competed at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 for the third and so far, last time, held in Moscow, Russia. It had been rumoured that, due to two poor placings for the country in 2007 and 2008, coming last and second last, Česká televize (ČT), the Czech broadcaster would withdraw, however the broadcaster confirmed their participation at the 2009 contest. The song did not progress from the first semi-final of the competition, finishing last once more with 0 points.
Selection.
ČT decided to internally select the third Czech entry for Eurovision, after the multi-artist national final, "EuroSong", failed to qualify Czech Republic to the final. Gipsy.cz, who had previously taken part both the 2007 and 2008 Czech national finals, was chosen by ČT to represent the country in Moscow.
The Czech audience will be given a choice of two songs to select the one which will represent their country in Moscow. It is yet unclear how the voting will be conducted, but it has been announce by the broadcaster that it will take place between 1 and 14 March. A press conference where all the details will be revealed will take place on 16 February. The winning song was officially presented on 21 March during the ČT Anděl Music Awards. It was Aven Romale by Gipsy CZ 
At Eurovision.
Since the Czech Republic is not one of the "Big Four" and is not the host of the 2009 contest, it will have to compete in one of the two semi-finals. At the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January, it was decided that the country would compete in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009. ČT have announced it will broadcast only the first semi final and the final of the contest, not broadcasting the second semi-final. Gipsy. performed second in the first semifinal. It got no points and placed last. "Aven Romale" is the sixteenth song getting zero points.

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease, also called early-onset Alzheimer's, or early-onset AD, is the term used for cases of Alzheimer's disease diagnosed before the age of 65. It is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's, accounting for only 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases. Approximately 13% of the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's are Familial Alzheimer's disease, where a genetic predisposition leads to the disease. The other incidences of early onset Alzheimer's, however, share the same traits as the 'late onset' form commonly referred to as "Alzheimer's disease", and little is understood about how it starts.
Non-Familial early onset Alzheimer's can develop in people who are in their thirties or forties, but that is extremely rare. The majority of people with early-onset Alzheimer's are in their fifties or early sixties.
History of Alzheimer's disease.
The symptoms of the disease as a distinct nosologic entity were first identified by Emil Kraepelin, and the characteristic neuropathology was first observed by Alois Alzheimer in 1906. In this sense, the disease was co-discovered by Kraepelin and Alzheimer, who worked in Kraepelin's laboratory. Because of the overwhelming importance Kraepelin attached to finding the neuropathological basis of psychiatric disorders, Kraepelin made the decision that the disease would bear Alzheimer's name.
Familial Alzheimer's disease.
Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) or Early onset Familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD) is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's disease that usually strikes earlier in life, defined as before the age of 65 (usually between 50 and 65 years of age, but can be as early as 15) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, identified by genetics and other characteristics such as the age of onset. It accounts for approximately half the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Familial AD requires the patient to have at least one first degree relative with a history of AD. Non-familial cases of AD are referred to as "sporadic" AD, where genetic risk factors are minor or unclear.
While early-onset familial AD is estimated to account for only 0.035 of total Alzheimer's disease, it has presented a useful model in studying various aspects of the disorder. Currently, the early-onset familial AD gene mutations guide the vast majority of animal model based therapeutic discovery and development for AD.
Clinical features.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and usually occurs in old age. It is invariably fatal, generally within ten years of the first signs. Early signs of AD include unusual memory loss, particularly in remembering recent events and the names of people and things, logopenic primary progressive aphasia. As the disease progresses the patient exhibits more serious problems, becoming subject to mood swings and unable to perform complex activities such as driving. In the latter stages they forget how to do simple things such as brushing their hair and then require full-time care.
Histologically, familial AD is practically indistinguishable from other forms of the disease. Deposits of amyloid can be seen in sections of brain tissue. This amyloid protein forms plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that progress through the brain. Very rarely the plaque may be unique, or uncharacteristic of AD; this can happen when there is a mutation in one of the genes that creates a functional, but malformed, protein instead of the ineffective gene products that usually result from mutations.
Genetics.
Familial Alzheimer disease is caused by a mutation in one of at least 3 genes: presenilin 1, presenilin 2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Other gene mutations are in study.
PSEN1 - Presenilin 1.
The presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1 located on chromosome 14) was identified by Sherrington (1995) and multiple mutations have been identified. Mutations in this gene cause familial Alzheimer's type 3 with certainty and usually under 50 years old. This protein has been identified as part of the enzymatic complex that cleaves amyloid beta peptide from APP (see below).
The gene contains 14 exons, and the coding portion is estimated at 60 kb, as reported by Rogaev (1997) and Del-Favero (1999). The protein the gene codes for (PS1) is an integral membrane protein. As stated by Ikeuchi (2002) it cleaves the protein Notch1 so is thought by Koizumi (2001) to have a role in somitogenesis in the embryo. It also has an action on an amyloid precursor protein, which gives its probable role in the pathogenesis of FAD. Homologs of PS1 have been found in plants, invertebrates and other vertebrates.
Some of the mutations in the gene, of which there are over 90, include: His163Arg, Ala246Glu, Leu286Val and Cys410Tyr. Most display complete penetrance, but a common mutation is Glu318Gly and this predisposes individuals to familial Alzheimer disease, with a study by Taddei (2002) finding an incidence of 8.7% in patients with familial AD.
PSEN2 - Presenilin 2.
The presenilin 2 gene (PSEN2) is very similar in structure and function to PSEN1. It is located on chromosome 1 (1q31-q42), and mutations in this gene cause type 4 FAD. The gene was identified by Rudolph Tanzi and Jerry Schellenberg in 1995. A subsequent study by Kovacs (1996) showed that PS1 and PS2 proteins are expressed in similar amounts, and in the same organelles as each other, in mammalian neuronal cells. Levy-Lahad (1996) determined that PSEN2 contained 12 exons, 10 of which were coding exons, and that the primary transcript encodes a 448 amino acid polypeptide with 67% homology to PS1. This protein has been identified as part of the enzymatic complex that cleaves amyloid beta peptide from APP (see below).
The mutations have not been studied as much as PSEN1, but distinct allelic variants have been identified. These include Asn141Ile, which has been identified by first by Rudolph Tanzi and Jerry Schellenberg in Volga German families with familial Alzheimer disease (Levy-Lahad et al. Nature, 1995). One of these studies by Nochlin (1998) found severe amyloid angiopathy in the affected individuals in a family. This phenotype may be explained by a study by Tomita (1997) suggesting that the Asn141Ile mutation alters amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism causing an increased rate of protein deposition into plaques.
Other allelic variants are Met239Val which was identified in an Italian pedigree by Rogaev (1995) who also suggested early on that the gene may be similar to PSEN1, and an Asp439Ala mutation in exon 12 of the gene which is suggest by Lleo (2001) to change the endoproteolytic processing of the PS2.
APP – Amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein.
Mutations to the amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP) located on the long arm of chromosome 21 (21q21.3) causes familial Alzheimer disease.
Pathophysiology.
Following cleavage by β-secretase, APP is cleaved by a membrane-bound protein complex called γ-secretase to generate Aβ. Presenilins 1 and 2 are the enzymatic centers of this complex along with nicastrin, Aph1, and PEN-2. Alpha-secretase cleavage of APP, which precludes the production of Aβ, is the most common processing event for APP. 21 allelic mutations have been discovered in the APP gene. These guarantee onset of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease and all occur in the region of the APP gene that encodes the Aβ domain.
Genetic testing.
Genetic testing is available for symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic relatives.
Impact of Early-onset Alzheimer's.
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease can have devastating effects on the careers, caretakers and family members of patients.
As many patients are in the age range common to those raising children, patients' children who are not full grown suffer physically and emotionally as their parents are no longer able to care for them.
Those who are working lose their ability to perform their jobs competently, and are forced into early retirement. When this can be predicted, employees must discuss their future with their employers and the loss of skills they expect to face.
Those who are forced to retire early may not have access to the full range of benefits available to those who retire at the minimum age set by the government.
With some jobs, a mistake may have devastating consequences on a large number of people, and cases have been reported in which a person with Early-onset Alzheimer's who is unaware of their condition has caused distress.
People with Alzheimer's may also lose their ability to take care of their own needs, such as money management.

Utah State Route 151

State Route 151 (SR-151), sometimes known as the South Jordan Parkway, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah connecting SR-154 and South Jordan to I-15 and Sandy. The route spans in southern Salt Lake County. The route was formed in 1987 as a connection between SR-68 and I-15, including a proposed stretch of road between 1300 West and 1000 West. The state extended maintenance of the road to SR-154 in 2001.
Route description.
The highway begins at the intersection of SR-154 (Bangerter Highway) and 10400 South in South Jordan. Heading east on the latter, a four-lane road, the road shifts slightly to the north immediately past the intersection. At 3200 West the road loses one lane in each direction. The route continues east and intersects with several local roads before reaching SR-68 (Redwood Road), where the route widens to four lanes again. Past 1300 West, the highway begins to dip southeast and gains a fixed center median. After passing Mulligan's South golf course and crossing the Jordan River and Jordan River Parkway trail, it straightens out to the east and becomes 10600 South while entering Sandy. Right before reaching I-15, the road passes under Union Pacific and UTA's "FrontRunner" railroad bridges. The highway crosses over I-15 and terminates at a single-point urban interchange serving the freeway at exit 293.
History.
State Route 151 was formed in 1987 as a link between SR-68 and I-15. The state would build a road in between 1300 West and 1000 West that would connect 10400 South and 10600 South. In 1992, Sandy requested the state to assume jurisdiction of 10600 South from I-15 eastward to SR-71. The Utah Department of Transportation approved the measure assuming all conditions were met; however, the eastward extension never occurred to SR-151. In 2001, another stretch of proposed roadway was added to the state highway system, from SR-68 west to SR-154.

The Witching Hour (DC Comics)

The Witching Hour was an American comic book horror anthology published by DC Comics from 1969 to 1978.
Publication history.
The series was published for 85 issues from February–March 1969 to October 1978. Its tagline was "It's 12 o'clock... The Witching Hour!" and was changed to "It's midnight..." from issue #13 onwards. The series was originally edited by Dick Giordano, who was replaced by Murray Boltinoff with issue #14. Nick Cardy was the cover artist for "The Witching Hour" for issues #1-6, 11-12, 15-16, 18-52, and 60. Stories in the comic were "hosted" and introduced by three witches, based on "Macbeth's" Weird Sisters: Morded, Mildred, and Cynthia. The witches defined the archetypal Maiden/Mother/Crone—in reverse order—triumvirate of womanhood. A prototype version of the extraterrestrial Psions appeared in issue #13 (February–March 1971).
After "The Witching Hour'"s cancellation as a result of the "DC Implosion", the title was merged with "The Unexpected", until issue #209. The witches were later revived—along with the hosts of the companion series "House of Secrets" and "House of Mystery" as important characters in Neil Gaiman's "The Sandman".
Vertigo limited series.
Vertigo published an unrelated "The Witching Hour" limited series by writer Jeph Loeb and artists Chris Bachalo and Art Thibert in 1999-2000.
2013 one-shot.
"The Witching Hour" title was revived for a one-shot anthology by Vertigo in 2013.

Minnie White

Minnie White was a Storyville brothel proprietor in the early part of the twentieth century. She operated out of a large mansion at 221 North Basin Street, in New Orleans, Louisiana, between 1907 and 1917. For most or all of that time, she co-owned the structure with another madam, Jessie Brown. A 1911-12 edition of the "Storyville Blue Book" indicates that the phone number of White's establishment was 1663 Main.
Many of White's charges were advertised as talented singers of bawdy ballads in addition to their regular duties as prostitutes. A photograph by E. J. Bellocq (circa 1912) of one of her girls, one Marguerite Griffin, is frequently reproduced in texts about Storyville.

GSN Radio

Game Show Network Radio was an interactive internet radio game show that originally aired live on GSN.com from August 18, 2008 to November 13, 2009, hosted by husband and wife team Bob Goen and Marianne Curan. Other co-hosts filled in when one of them was unavailable. The four-hour program featured interactive games that listeners played to win cash and other prizes. The show aired from 1–5 P.M. Eastern every Monday through Friday afternoon.
Format and rules.
"GSN Radio" was an internet radio game show in which home listeners are the contestants. Listeners anywhere in the world of age 21 or older could enter the contest by using the network's website or dialing a phone number, both of which were methods free of charge. If an entry was selected to participate in the game, the contestant was called on his telephone. The contestant then, either alone or with an opponent, played live on-air. A contestant may enter 10 times via telephone and 25 times on the internet per each 24-hour period. One week after the original 24-hour period in which an entry was submitted, that entry was cleared from the queue, and any entrants who wished to play more games are required to re-enter.
Some special games (occasionally referred to as Marquis Games) required that listeners register specifically for them on the "GSN Radio" website. For these games, a contestant may also enter 25 times each 24-hour period. These entries were not grouped with the entries of the regular games. All entries were cleared from the queue after the game was declared won (or over). Any entrants who wished to play another special game were required to re-enter.
Regardless of the method of entry, each entry had an equal chance of being selected. An entry did not necessarily guarantee an opportunity to play on the show.
Games.
"GSN Radio" featured various minigames that were played throughout the program. The rewards for the games were usually prizes of $100 in cash, although some games had potential payouts of $200, $1,000 and $2,500. Imagination Games partnered with GSN to bring some of their original and licensed games to the radio format.
In a situation where a tie needed to be broken, a question related to the game was posed. The first contestant to yell out his name wase given a chance to answer. If his answer was correct, he would be declared the winner. If he was incorrect, his opponent won by default.
During its 15 month run, 33 games were played in rotation on "GSN Radio".
Other features.
Outside of the traditional mini-game shows, "GSN Radio" often featured other segments.
Competitions.
Since November 6, 2008 to the cancellation of the program, in addition to the regular on-air games, "GSN Radio" sponsored two other competitions offering cash.
Guest appearances.
Often in conjunction with games on the show, celebrities \appeared to participate in the program. Such instances include "Jeopardy!" champion Ken Jennings guesting on October 31, 2008 to play a special trivia challenge and Howie Mandel appearing on December 5, 2008 to play a special version of "Would You Rather?". Other actors appeared to ask questions in the Ultimate Trivia game related to their shows, such as John O'Hurley asking questions about "Seinfeld" as J. Peterman and Kate Flannery asking questions about "The Office".
Syndication and "The Best of GSN Radio".
When "GSN Radio" was not live, "The Best of GSN Radio" was streamed on the show's website. The program continuously featured repeat airings of past games once played live. This program was also aired on terrestrial radio stations.
Condensed versions of "The Best of GSN Radio" were syndicated to stations in North America for airings on Saturdays and Sundays. "The Best Of" was also available for syndication to dozens of other stations through a division of Radio America.

Sabudana khichadi is an Indian dish made from soaked Sabudana (pearl tapioca). It is typically prepared in parts of Western India such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, & Maharashtra. In major towns like Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Bhopal and Nagpur, it is available as street food and is widely eaten throughout the year. It is the dish of choice when an individual observes a "fast" during Shivratri, Navratri, or a similar Hindu religious occasion. 
Recipe.
Pearl tapioca (Sabudana) is soaked for a while, and is then fried with cumin seeds, salt, red chili powder, green chillies and other optional ingredients such as fried peanuts. It is usually garnished with coriander leaves.
Nutrition.
Sago is nearly pure carbohydrate and has very little protein, vitamins, or minerals. The addition of Peanuts to Sabudana Khichadi adds to the protein content, making it a more balanced meal. It has a high calorific content, due to the quantity of starch and fat present.

Manila (album)

Manila is the second album by Australian rock group Paul Kelly and the Dots and was originally released in August 1982 by Mushroom Records and re-released in 1990. The group travelled to The Philippines capital to record "Manila" during July and August 1981 with Kelly and Chris Thompson producing. Line-up changes and Kelly having his jaw broken in an assault had delayed the album's release by a year. The album contains the singles, "Clean this House", and "Alive and Well" but neither album nor singles had any chart success. All tracks were written, or co-written, by Kelly, including two with guitarist Chris Langman.
Background.
Paul Kelly and the Dots had released their debut album "Talk" in March 1981, which had peaked at #38 on the National albums charts, but its third single "Lowdown" released in May had no chart success. Considerable line-up changes had occurred within the Dots since its 1978 formation in Melbourne. The band that travelled to The Philippines in July 1981 with Kelly was Tony Thornton on drums, Alan Brooker on bass guitar, Tim Brosnan on guitar and Michael Holmes on guitar. After returning to Australia, the band became involved in Gillian Armstrong's 1982 film "Starstruck" which starred Jo Kennedy. Paul Kelly and the Dots supplied "Rocking Institution" for the soundtrack and Kelly added to the score. Acting in a minor role in "Starstruck" was Kaarin Fairfax, who later became Kelly's second wife. Kelly had replaced Holmes with Maurice Frawley on guitar and Thornton with Huk Treloar on drums. Whilst in Melbourne Kelly was assaulted and had his jaw broken. The single "Clean this House" was released in April, and "Alive and Well" in July, but neither album nor singles had any chart success. The line-up changes and Kelly's broken jaw had delayed the release of "Manila" until August 1982. The Dots were disbanded and the Paul Kelly Band was formed in 1983, Kelly's next album was the solo release "Post" which was recorded after he had relocated to Sydney by January 1985.
Kelly later said of the album, "I was heavily under the influence of "Sandinista!", the Clash album, at the time. "Sandinista!" has this kind of 3D thing on it, which I was trying to get on record, but it was my first effort at production so it didn't turn out that great."

The Railway Resource Centre (RRC) is a collection of material on Australian railways. It is managed by Australian Railway Historical Society New South Wales Division with the participation and support of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. The collection houses the thousands of documents, books, periodicals, photographs and slides that the Society has acquired over many years. It is constantly being added to by deliberate acquisition, through donations and bequests from Society members and others. 
A continuing project is being undertaken to digitise as much of the collection as possible and much is now available from the intranet terminals on site. The RRC is located at Singleton House (named in honour of Foundation Member Cyril Singleton) 67 Renwick Street, Redfern, NSW. The Public Reading Room, named in honour of another foundation member, Mal Park, is open every Tuesday and on the first four Saturdays of each month. Assistance is provided by volunteer Research Officers. This service is available to the general public for private research purposes only. Because of the limited time available on these days, all commercial requests, together with requests by the public for extensive research by the RRC, are only handled through a Research Services Facility. Because the collection contains much information that is not available from any other source, the RRC is able to provide research facilities for most general and commercial enquiries regarding Australia’s railways.

38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16

The 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16 ( Siege Howitzer Model 16) was a superheavy siege howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I.
History and Design.
Two howitzers were initially ordered and both 'Barbara' and 'Gudrun', as they were nicknamed, were delivered in time to participate in the South Tyrol offensive of May 1916. They were very successful and the Austro-Hungarians ordered another fourteen howitzers and two spare barrels, although only eight of these were delivered before the end of the war.
The design was based on a scaled-up Škoda 30.5 cm Mörser M. 16 design, which sped things up considerably. The howitzer was transported in four loads, the barrel, mount and one for each half of the firing, or bedding, platform. Each load was carried by an eight-wheeled electric-powered trailer with the electricity provided by a Daimler Artillerie-Generatorzugwagen (Artillery Generator truck) M. 16, designed by Ferdinand Porsche. The 6-cylinder, , 20.32 liter gasoline engine powered two electric generators which fed electric motors in each wheel of the trailer and the rear wheels of the truck. Top speed was 14 kilometers per hour. The solid rubber tires could be removed and the trucks could tow their trailers on the rails. For longer distances they could be towed by ordinary locomotives.
Combat use.
A 52 cubic meter pit had to be excavated to hold the firing platform which took eight to twenty hours, depending on soil conditions. The bedding halves then were winched into position on rails and jacked down into the pit. The carriage was then mounted on the bedding and the barrel mated to it. All this took six to eight hours to prepare for firing. A small tilting crane was mounted on the left side of the turntable to move shells from their transport carts to the loading tray. It was also used to assemble the loading tray and to change the breech. The howitzer could only be loaded at 11° elevation because the shells had to be rammed by a hand-powered winch with pushrod. The eight later weapons used the same carriage as the 24 cm Kanone M. 16; it had trunnion mounts for both types and the gun used the forward mounts while the howitzer used the rear ones.
The fate of these weapons is unclear. None were put into service by the Nazis after the Anschluss, possibly because of a lack of ammunition, and it is not certain that Romania actually used their weapon during World War II. Howitzer No. 6 survives in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna, Austria, while 'Gudrun', Howitzer No. 2 is in Bucharest, in the National Military Museum, Romania.

Intel AMT versions

Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is hardware-based technology built into PCs with Intel vPro technology. AMT is designed to help sys-admins remotely manage and secure PCs out-of-band when PC power is off, the operating system (OS) is unavailable (hung, crashed, corrupted, missing), software management agents are missing, or hardware (such as a hard disk drive or memory) has failed.
Versions.
Intel AMT is built into a small secondary processor located on the motherboard. This OOB controller has embedded firmware that runs on the Manageability Engine (ME), a separate small ARC architecture processor built into the northbridge (or network card for AMT 1.0) of the motherboard. The AMT firmware is stored in the same SPI flash memory component used to store the BIOS and is generally updated along with the BIOS. FWH (Firmware Hub) or LPC firmware storage is not supported for AMT.
In general, an AMT version can be updated in software to the next minor version. New major releases of Intel AMT are built into a new chipset, and are updated through new hardware.
Comparison of AMT versions.
The following is a comparison of the various features supported by each version of Intel AMT

Eligible bachelor

An eligible bachelor is a bachelor considered to be a particularly desirable potential husband, usually due to wealth, or social status. 
In the United Kingdom, the heir to the throne or someone close in succession is often considered to be the nation's, or the world's most eligible bachelor, due to their social status, as has happened with Prince Charles and Prince William. 
Jane Austen's novels are often concerned with the heroine's relationship with an eligible bachelor. Jane Austen's "Emma" particularly concerns a woman's attempt to obtain a husband for her friend by embellishing the truth. The gentleman in that case sees it as an example of the matchmaker's creativity and falls in love with her.
Homosexuals as "apparent" eligible bachelors.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Rock Hudson was hailed as an eligible bachelor. In the past, if a man chose to remain an eligible bachelor for long he may have been suspected of being gay, and have been referred to euphemistically as a "confirmed bachelor" a role closeted gay men may have played. The term 'confirmed bachelor' has fallen from common usage, as past life patterns involving marriage, divorce and prolonged bachelorhood have been altered for men since the advent of the sexual revolution and the marriage strike.
Sociology.
Robin Lakoff argues that the term indicates an inequality between men and women, as an "eligible bachelor" chooses to be a bachelor, whereas an "eligible spinster" does not have a choice. Lakoff believes this use of language fosters, and grows from, sexual discrimination. Lakoff states "women are given their identity in our society by virtue of their relationship with men, and not vice versa."

History of the Puritans

The history of the Puritans can be traced back to the first Vestments Controversy in the reign of Edward VI, the formation of an identifiable Puritan movement in the 1560s and ends in a decline in the mid-18th century. It is a complex evolution, with the situation of the Puritans as a religious group in England changing almost decade by decade, as a consequence both of political shifts in their relationship to the state and the Church of England, and of changing views of Puritans, both clergy and laity. It can not easily summarised, since the dramatic events of the 1640s, sometimes called the "Puritan Revolution", have complex roots, any more than the term "Puritan" can be given a useful and precise definition outside the particular historical context. The Puritan's main purpose was to purify the Church of England and to make England a more religious country.

<doc id="18925692" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18925692" title="Zar, Azerbaijan">
Zar, Azerbaijan

Zar (, Tsar, also spelled Tzar or Car, ) is a village in the Kalbajar Rayon of Azerbaijan, currently under the control of the unrecognized Nagorno Karabakh Republic.
Etymology.
Armenian architectural historian Samvel Karapetyan has written that name Zar is the Turkish pronunciation of the settlement's Armenian name "Tsar" which, due to its size, was still being referred to as "Metzn Tzar" (Great Tzar) as late as the eighteenth century.
A popular Azeri legend gives an alternative origin. A poor young man named Zasa once lived in this village. He was in love with a girl named Nasy whose parents did not approve of their relationship. Zasa then decided to ask Nadir Shah for help. He planted a watermelon in a jar with a narrow neck. The surprised shah liked it and ordered Nasy to be given to Zasa. However, as soon as Nadir Shah left town, Nasy's family went to Zasa's house, killed him and threw his body into a well. After that, Zasa's mother wept for many days. The name Zar was said to have be derived from this legend because the Azerbaijani word "zarıldamaq" (zaryldamag) translates as "to sob."
History.
Zar's history goes back to the early medieval period, when it was the administrative center of the Artsakh province's canton of Tsar (which, until the eleventh to twelfth centuries, went by the name of Vaykunik'). In the fourteenth century, the Armenian Dop'ian family established themselves in Tsar and remained there until their fortresses were devastated by the invasions of Tamerlane. But the Armenian lords were able to recover by the fifteenth century, when Tsar was made the center for the Armenian "meliks" of Upper Khachen. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the town was enclosed by a line of walls and other defensive fortifications. In the 1730s and 1750s, a large number of Turkic tribes and Kurds from Iran established themselves in Tsar and subsequently renamed the village Zar. In the early nineteenth century, the village was attacked and pillaged by the armies of the Ottoman Empire.
Despite its ruinous state, in the late 1890s the scholar-bishop Makar Barkhudaryants was able to travel to Tsar and photograph the ruins of the monastery of the Holy Virgin (built in 1225), the chapels of Sts. Sargis and Grigor (built in 1274) and other medieval-era monuments (largely dating to the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries).
Karapetyan has written that the Armenian monuments in Tsar (monasteries, churches and cemeteries) started to be destroyed by Kurds at the end of the nineteenth century, and that the destruction continued on a larger scale during the Soviet period and especially during the 1940s and 1950s. In particular, he documented that a school built in Zar in the 1950s was constructed using stones taken from the fourteenth century Getamijo Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Virgin of the Confluence) monastery that had stood at the edge of Tzar: he identified 133 carved or inscribed stone fragments reused within the walls of the school.
The village fell under the control of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic in 1993.

Danny Boone

Daniel Hugh Boone (born January 14, 1954) is a former professional baseball pitcher. He pitched parts of three seasons in Major League Baseball, appearing in 1981, 1982, and 1990. He is probably best known for the eight-year gap between his major league stints, and the improbable comeback that led him to his time with the Baltimore Orioles in 1990.
Draft history.
Coming out of Cal State Fullerton, Boone was selected in the 2nd round of the 1976 Major League Baseball Draft by the then-California Angels. This was actually the fifth time Boone had been drafted, as he had been selected after each of his four years in college as well as the secondary phase draft in January 1976. It was also the third time he was drafted by the Angels, who selected him in both 1973 and 1974, but he only signed after this draft.
NL career.
Boone's early promise went unfulfilled for several years, as he washed out of the Angels' system when he was released at the end of spring training in 1980. He was signed just three days later by the San Diego Padres, where he made his major league debut the following April. Boone pitched in 37 games for the Padres in 1981, winning 1 game, losing none, and collecting two saves with a decent 2.84 ERA.
Boone began the next season with the Padres as well, but pitched sparingly, making only 10 appearances over the first two months of the season. On June 8, he was traded to the Houston Astros for infielder Joe Pittman, and after a handful of appearances in June was returned to the minor leagues. After a September call-up, he started the 1983 season back in the minors, and was released in June.
MLB Comeback.
Boone signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, spending about a year in their farm system before being released once again. For the next five years, he disappeared off the radar of American professional baseball.
Then, in 1989, a new league started that gave Boone a new lease on his career: the Senior Professional Baseball Association. Boone signed on with the Bradenton Explorers, where he showed off a new pitch in his arsenal: the knuckleball. He pitched well enough for them (4-3, 3.16 ERA) to get a contract offer from the Orioles, and in September 1990 he was back in the majors. He pitched in four games, including his first-ever major league start against the Cleveland Indians on September 30, in which he did not receive a decision.
Boone's comeback drew some attention, and he even was accorded "Rookie Prospect" status in the 1991 Score baseball card set at the age of 36. However, his first major league start also turned out to be his last major league appearance, as he did not make the Orioles team that spring, and after a second stint with the Explorers Boone's career was well and truly over.

Single-page application

A single-page application (SPA), also known as single-page interface (SPI), is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application.
In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in HTML5) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.
The term single-page application was coined by Steve Yen in 2005, though the concept was discussed at least as early as 2003 and Stuart (stunix) Morris wrote the Self-Contained website at http://slashdotslash.com with the same goals and functions in 2002.
Technical approaches.
There are various techniques available that enable the browser to retain a single page even when the application requires server communication.
JavaScript Frameworks.
Web browser JavaScript frameworks, such as AngularJS and React have adopted SPA principles. AngularJS is a fully client-side library. AngularJS's templating is based on bidirectional data binding. Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes. The html template is compiled in the browser. The compilation step creates pure html, upon which the browser re-renders into the live view. The step is repeated for subsequent page views. In traditional server-side html programming, concepts such as controller and model interact within a server process to produce new html views. In the AngularJS framework, the controller and model state are maintained within the client browser. Therefore new pages are generated without any interaction with a server.
AJAX.
The most prominent technique currently being used is Ajax. Predominantly using the XMLHttpRequest object from JavaScript, other AJAX approaches include using IFRAME or script HTML elements. Popular libraries like jQuery, that normalize AJAX behavior across browsers from different manufacturers, have further popularized the AJAX technique.
Browser plugins.
Asynchronous calls to the server may also be achieved using browser plug-in technologies such as Silverlight, Flash, HTML5 Socket or Java applets.
Data transport (XML, JSON and AJAX).
Requests to the server typically result in either raw data (e.g. XML or JSON), or new HTML being returned. In the case where HTML is returned by the server, JavaScript on the client updates a partial area of the DOM (Document Object Model). When raw data is returned, often a client-side JavaScript XML / (XSL) process ( and in case of JSON a template ) is used to translate the raw data into HTML, which is then used to update a partial area of the DOM.
Thin server architecture.
An SPA moves logic from the server to the client. This results in the role of the web server evolving into a pure data API or web service. This architectural shift has, in some circles, been coined "Thin Server Architecture" to highlight that complexity has been moved from the server to the client, with the argument that this ultimately reduces overall complexity of the system.
Thick stateful server architecture.
The server keeps the necessary state in memory of the client state of the page. In this way, when any request hits the server (usually user actions), the server sends the appropriate HTML and/or JavaScript with the concrete changes to bring the client to the new desired state (usually adding/deleting/updating a part of the client DOM). At the same time the state in server is updated. Most of the logic is executed in server and HTML is usually also rendered in server. In some ways the server simulates a web browser, receiving events and performing delta changes in server state which are automatically propagated to client. This approach needs more server memory and server processing, but the advantage is a simplified development model because a) the application is usually fully coded in server, b) data and UI state in server are shared in the same memory space with no need of custom client/server communication bridges.
Thick stateless server architecture.
Is a variant of the stateful server approach, in this case the client page sends the necessary data of the current state to the server usually through AJAX requests, the server with this data is able to reconstruct in some way the client state of the page part going to be modified and generate the necessary data or code, for instance as JavaScript code, returned to the client to bring it to a new state usually modifying the page DOM tree according to the action which motivated the request. The stateless variant of the thick server architecture requires more data sent to server and may require more computational resources per request to reconstruct partially or fully the client page state in server, in the same time this approach is more easily scalable because there is no per client page data kept in server and therefore AJAX requests can be dispatched to different server nodes with no need of session data sharing or server affinity.
Running locally.
Some SPAs may be executed from a local file using the file URI scheme. This gives users the ability to download the SPA from a server and run the file from a local storage device, without depending on server connectivity. If such an SPA wants to store and update data, it must be self-modifying. That is, the SPA must be capable of writing itself to disk, including a representation of the state that is to be persisted. These applications benefit from advances available with HTML5, particularly Web Storage.
Challenges with the SPA model.
Because the SPA is an evolution away from the stateless page-redraw model that browsers were originally designed for, some new challenges have emerged. Each of these problems has an effective solution with:
Search engine optimization.
Because of the lack of JavaScript execution on crawlers of all popular Web search engines, SEO (Search engine optimization) has historically presented a problem for public facing websites wishing to adopt the SPA model.
Google currently crawls URLs containing hash fragments starting with #!. This allows the use of hash fragments within the single URL of an SPA. Special behavior must be implemented by the SPA site to allow extraction of relevant metadata by the search engine's crawler. For search engines that do not support this URL hash scheme, the hashed URLs of the SPA remain invisible.
Alternatively, applications may render the first page load on the server and subsequent page updates on the client. This is traditionally difficult, because the rendering code might need to be written in a different language or framework on the server and in the client. Using logic-less templates, cross-compiling from one language to another, or using the same language on the server and the client may help to increase the amount of code that can be shared.
One way to increase the amount of code that can be shared between servers and clients is to use a logic-less template language like Mustache or Handlebars. Such templates can be rendered from different host languages, such as Ruby on the server and JavaScript in the client. However, merely sharing templates typically requires duplication of business logic used to choose the correct templates and populate them with data. Rendering from templates may have negative performance effects when only updating a small portion of the page—such as the value of a text input within a large template. Replacing an entire template might also disturb a user's selection or cursor position, where updating only the changed value might not. To avoid these problems, applications can use UI data bindings or granular DOM manipulation to only update the appropriate parts of the page instead of re-rendering entire templates.
Another approach used by server centric web frameworks like the Java based ItsNat is to render any hypertext in server using the same language and templating technology. In this approach the server knows with precision the DOM state in client, any big or small page update required is performed generating in server, and transported by AJAX, the exact JavaScript code to bring the client page to the new state executing DOM methods. Developers can decide which page states must be crawlable by web spiders for SEO and be able to generate the required state in load time generating plain HTML instead of JavaScript. In case of ItsNat framework this is automatic because ItsNat keeps the client DOM tree in server as a Java W3C DOM tree, rendering of this DOM tree in server generates plain HTML in load time and JavaScript DOM actions for AJAX requests. This duality is very important for SEO because developers can build with the same Java code and pure HTML based templating the desired DOM state in server, on page load time conventional HTML is generated by ItsNat making this DOM state SEO compatible. As of version 1.3 ItsNat provides a new stateless mode, client DOM is not kept in server because in stateless mode client DOM state is partially or fully reconstructed in server when processing any AJAX request based on required data sent by client informing of the current DOM state; the stateless mode may be also SEO compatible because SEO compatibility happens in load time of the initial page not affected by stateful or stateless modes.
Because SEO compatibility is not trivial in SPAs, it's worth noting that SPAs are commonly not used in a context where search engine indexing is either a requirement, or desirable. Use cases include applications that surface private data hidden behind an authentication system. In the cases where these applications are consumer products, often a classic "page redraw" model is used for the applications landing page and marketing site, which provides enough meta data for the application to appear as a hit in a search engine query. Blogs, support forums, and other traditional page redraw artifacts often sit around the SPA that can seed search engines with relevant terms.
Browser history.
With an SPA being, by definition, "a single page", the model breaks the browser's design for page history navigation using the Forward/Back buttons. This presents a usability impediment when a user presses the back button, expecting the previous screen state within the SPA, but instead the application's single page unloads and the previous page in the browser's history is presented.
The traditional solution for SPA's has been to change the browser URL's hash fragment identifier in accord with the current screen state. This can be achieved with JavaScript, and causes URL history events to be built up within the browser. As long as the SPA is capable of resurrecting the same screen state from information contained within the URL hash, the expected back button behavior is retained.
To further address this issue, the HTML5 specification has introduced pushState and replaceState providing programmatic access to the actual URL and browser history.
Page lifecycle.
An SPA is fully loaded in the initial page load and then page regions are replaced or updated with new page fragments loaded from the server on demand. To avoid excessive downloading of unused features, an SPA will often progressively download more features as they become required, either small fragments of the page, or complete screen modules.
In this way an analogy exists between "states" in an SPA and "pages" in a traditional web site. Because "state navigation" in the same page is analogous to page navigation, in theory any page based web site could be converted to single-page replacing in the same page only the changed parts result of comparing consecutive pages in a non-SPA.
The SPA approach on the web is similar to the Single Document Interface (SDI) presentation technique popular in native desktop applications.

Robert Nason Beck

Robert Nason Beck (26 March 1928 in San Angelo, Texas – 6 August 2008 in Chicago, Illinois) was an American scientist and a pioneer in the field of nuclear medicine. Part of a University of Chicago team, he was the first to propose, in 1961, the use of the radioisotope technetium-99m to detect disease using Positron Emission Tomography, a technique that is presently used an estimated 20 million times a year throughout the world. Beck also helped develop collimators for sharpening the images produced by gamma-ray scanners, and was referred to as 'Mr. Collimator' by colleagues.
Career.
Beck attended Angelo State University for a year before joining the United States Navy in 1946, where he worked as an electronics technician. Upon his discharge, Beck enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he earned a B.A. in 1954 and a B.S. in mathematics in 1955.
Beck was appointed chief scientist and director of Argonne Cancer Research Hospital (ACRH) in 1957. In 1977, he was named director of ACRH's successor, Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute. In 1986, he founded and directed the Center for Imaging Science shared between the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.
Beck also served as a professor of radiology at the University of Chicago until his retirement in 1998. During his life, Beck published nearly 250 scientific papers and served on several task forces, in the field, especially for the Society of Nuclear Medicine and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Personal life.
Beck's mother was a member of the Comanche tribe, accounting for Beck's long term interest in American Indian matters: he was, for example, one of the earliest members of the National Museum of the American Indian. Robert Beck married Ariadne Plumis in 1958, and they celebrated their 50th anniversary shortly before his death.
He died after a several-year battle with myelodysplastic syndrome, a form of leukemia.

UC San Diego Tritons

The UC San Diego Tritons are the athletic sports team for the University of California, San Diego. UC San Diego has 23 varsity sports teams and offers student participation in a wide range of sports including swimming, water polo, soccer, volleyball, crew, track and field, fencing, basketball, golf, cross country, softball, baseball, and tennis. UC San Diego participates at the NCAA's Division II (DII) level in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA), although water polo, fencing, and men's volleyball compete at the Division I level. Since their move to Division II starting in the 2000-01 season, UCSD has placed in the top 5 in the Division II NACDA Directors' Cup standings five times, including two 2nd place finishes.
Boosters.
UC San Diego recognizes two external organizations of athletic boosters: the Triton Athletic Associates is a booster group of parents, alumni and friends who have each donated between US$50 and $2,500; and the UCSD Athletic Board is made up of donors who have given US$10,000 or more to athletic programs. On campus, booster groups comprise the UCSD Pep Band, the Triton Tide (a student booster club), the UCSD Cheerleaders, the Triton Twirl Flag Squad and the UCSD Dance Team. King Triton occasionally appears as a costumed character mascot. Further opportunities for athletic involvement are available to students interested in team staffing and management.
Football.
UC San Diego has not fielded a football team except in Fall 1968 when a newly formed pigskin organization turned in a winless season and then folded for lack of interest. Since then, the subject of bringing NCAA football back to UC San Diego has been a recurring topic. Tom Ham, a local restaurateur and a supporter of UCSD football since the 1960s, has said that UCSD would have no future in San Diego without "big-time" football. Proponents of a major football team have projected benefits that include greater school spirit and a more well-rounded school experience for students as well as enhancing the school's national profile. Opposition to "big-time" football comes from a wide range of school faculty and administrators such Daniel Wulbert, a provost at Revelle College, who says that any boost to school spirit wouldn't be worth the sacrifice, and that he wants UC San Diego to "have a life for reasons other than watching hired athletes come and play." It's acknowledged by both sides that adding an 80- to 100-man football team would not only cost some US$1–1.5M annually, but that the initial outlay in equipment and facilities would be in the tens of millions. Furthermore, in order to comply with Title IX's requirement for equal sports opportunities for both sexes, some three women's teams (80-100 athletes) would have to be added, or three existing men's teams disbanded. Without the expense of football, UC San Diego has been characterized as having "the best all-around program, with the most success by the most student-athletes" in San Diego.
Potential move to Division I.
In 2011, UCSD considered elevating its athletics to Division I for all sports. They were looking to join the Big West Conference. However, there were several problems. After the Big West added the University of Hawaii in 2010, they would have 10 teams, meaning any extra member would require more conference games in basketball, upsetting the current schedule balance. In addition, in order to meet the minimum Division I scholarship requirements, the student body would need to vote for a fee increase sometime during the 2011-2012 academic year. After the Big West elected not to invite UCSD to the Big West in May 2011, plans have been put on hold and UCSD remains a Division II team. However, a student-led movement has resulted in a vote on a fee increase for UCSD students in the hopes to enhance the school's chances of becoming a Division I school. In March 2012, the UCSD student body rejected an increase in activity fees to support the move to Division I. The vote fell 11,407 to 6,470 (51% of the student body voted). It means UCSD will remain at the Division II level for the foreseeable future.

Triton Robotix.
Though not technically a sports team, the UCSD Triton Robotix organization designed and built a 120 lb BattleBot. The robot competed at the BattleBots event in Vallejo, California late April 2009. The competition was recorded and was to be aired on CBS College Sports in August 2009. However, there were licensing and advertisement issues that ultimately lead CBS to cancel the show before it aired. Now, footage of the 2009 Championship is due to air on FOX.
In Fall 2009, Triton Robotix merged to become a part of ASME UC San Diego. They worked on building a brand new 120 lb combat robot dubbed Kraken to compete in Robogames. They ultimately placed 5th out of 21 entries.

Robert S. Wood

Robert S. Wood (born December 25, 1936) has had a career in the dual areas of state and religion, both as a leader and advisor to senior civilian and military officials of the United States Government in the area of National security affairs, and as a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
Personal life.
The youngest of four children, Wood was born in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Blanche and John Albert (Jack) Wood. He was baptized as a child, received the Aaronic priesthood in his youth, and the Melchizedek priesthood as a young man. He was selected as a delegate from Idaho to the international YMCA Centennial Conference, traveling from Canada, through the Panama Canal, and throughout Europe.
After high school, Wood began studies at Stanford University, where he met Dixie Leigh Jones. He served in the French Mission from 1957 to 1959, and when he returned to the United States to complete his degree in history, he and Dixie began dating. He recalls, “Probably the most significant question she asked after we had been dating for a while was when she looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘Robert, are you going to stay active?’ ” His answer was clear, and they were married in the Idaho Falls Temple on 27 March 1961.
At Stanford, Wood became interested in international affairs, particularly European affairs. While he was writing his honors thesis he came across the book, "A World Restored", by Henry Kissinger. Because of the impact the book had on him, he applied to Harvard, to study at the school where Kissinger was teaching.
The Woods are the parents of four daughters and the grandparents of thirteen grandchildren. According to Wood, “Two things explain our family … First, Heavenly Father just sent us four terrific kids. And second, their mother … I would never have been able to do anything that I’ve done professionally or in the Church had I not married the right woman who asked the question, ‘Are you going to stay active?’”
National Security Affairs.
Wood was the holder of the Chester W. Nimitz Chair of National Security at the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where he also served as Dean of the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group, and Dean (later, Dean Emeritus) of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies, a focal point of strategic and campaign thought in the naval services and a major research group in the national security field.
As part of his responsibilities at the Naval War College, and to the larger military and civilian infrastructure, he has directed war gaming, research, and analysis, for decision makers at the senior levels of the U.S. government, earning his reputation as one of the world's leading authorities on gaming and simulations as an aid to decision-making. After serving as Dean of the Naval War College Strategy Department from 1980-1983 Wood was appointed as Dean of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies in 1983. During his time in this position, the four elements of the Center - wargaming, advanced research, the Strategic Studies Group, and the Naval War College Press-- "were integrated to become the Chief of Naval Operations's think tank of first resort." During this period, in his capacity as Director of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies, he oversaw the largest gaming series in U.S. history, "The Global War Games" which included hundreds of senior military and civilian leaders who came together for a two- to three-week period to explore conflict and crisis scenarios, and to explore alternative strategies, policies, and operational plans. During the course of his career he has provided advice on a number of occasions to the White House, the Congress, and the Department of Defense, and represent the United States in meetings with Soviet and British officials during the Cold War.
Wood received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford University and master's and Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University. In addition to teaching the Naval War College, Wood has held faculty positions at Harvard University, Bentley College, the University of Virginia, the University of Tilburg and the University of Groningen. Additionally, he has served as visiting professor and lecturer at many prominent universities and institutions at home and abroad, and has been a frequent lecturer at the National Defense University and at all of the U.S. Military Senior Service Schools, the NATO Defense College, and the Federal Executive Institute. He has also authored, co-authored, edited, or contributed to 21 other books and numerous articles on public affairs, executive development, international affairs, and national security policy.
LDS Church service.
From 1957 to 1959, Wood served as a missionary in the church's French Mission. Prior to his call as a general authority, his other church leadership positions included area seventy, regional representative, stake president, and bishop. In April 1999, he was appointed as a general authority, serving in the Second Quorum of the Seventy, at the church's general conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. His assignments included being sent to South America, where he was responsible for overseeing social, humanitarian and ecclesiastical affairs for Northern Brazil.
In 2009, Wood was called as president of the Boston Massachusetts Temple, succeeding Kenneth G. Hutchins. His wife, Dixie Jones Wood, served as Temple matron.
Wood has represented the LDS Church in many interfaith organizations and events, including the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Religious Advisory Committee.
Views.
Wood's career, both in church and state, was based on his strong belief that the United States was the model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state — no state run or state established church — was good for both the church and the state, allowing a variety of religions to flourish. Speaking at the Toronto based Center for New Religions, Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a "remarkable religiosity" in the United States that isn't present in other industrialized nations.
Wood believes that the U.S. operates on "a sort of civic religion," which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who "expects better of us." Beyond that, individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience. He calls this approach the "genius of religious sentiment in the United States."

Donna Noble

Donna Noble is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". Portrayed by British actress and comedian Catherine Tate, she is a companion of the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). Originally appearing in the closing scene of the show's 2006 series and as a special guest star in its following Christmas special, "The Runaway Bride", Tate was not expected to reprise her role as Donna. For the programme's third series (2007), the Doctor travelled alongside medical student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). However, Tate expressed interest in returning to the role, and returned to play Donna for the duration of the fourth series in 2008, and in a subsequent 2009-10 Christmas and New Year's special.
Within the series' narrative, Donna begins as an outspoken mid-30s Londoner, a temp worker from Chiswick whose view of the universe is small in scope. Although she at first finds alien time traveller the Doctor terrifying, their initial encounter leaves her unsatisfied, and she decides to travel alongside him when the next opportunity arises. It is Donna who ultimately saves the universe in the fourth series' conclusion, although tragically at the cost of the memories of her travels with the Doctor. In a contrast to the Tenth Doctor's prior companions, who both harboured romantic feelings for him, Donna and the Doctor shared a strictly friendly relationship, and she does not feel the need to prove herself to travel with the Doctor; the Doctor refers to her as his "best mate".
Appearances.
Television.
Donna Noble makes her first appearance, credited as "The Bride", in the closing scenes of 2006 series finale "Doomsday"; she appears in a wedding dress, outraged to be inexplicably aboard the Doctor's TARDIS. The scene was kept a secret until broadcast, filmed with minimal crew, and was a humorous juxtaposition to the sad farewell the Doctor shared with companion Rose (Billie Piper) moments prior. Donna's story is picked up in 2006 Christmas special "The Runaway Bride". Donna is a temporary secretary at HC Clements in London, a security firm which, unknown to her, is a front organization for the alien-investigating Torchwood Institute. Her parents are Geoff (Howard Attfield) and Sylvia Noble (Jacqueline King). Donna discovers that she is a pawn in a scheme of the Empress (Sarah Parish) of the alien Racnoss, having been manipulated by her fiancé, Lance (Don Gilet). When the Doctor unleashes his fury upon the Racnoss, Donna snaps him out of it and together, they escape before the Torchwood facility floods. Donna is upset, having lost her job and her fiancé, and declines the Doctor's offer to become his companion, though she advises he find one. Donna does not appear in the 2007 series, but the character Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) appears in 2007 Christmas special "Voyage of the Damned"; in the 2008 series, he is introduced properly as Donna's grandfather, following the death of actor Howard Attfield.
In the series four opener "Partners in Crime" (2008), Donna has become dissatisfied with regular life and more interested in the bigger picture. When both are investigating the alien connection to Adipose Industries' Miss Foster (Sarah Lancashire), she and the Doctor are re-united, and she joins him in the TARDIS as a regular companion. In "The Fires of Pompeii", Donna shows her compassion when she argues and convinces the Doctor to save a family from the Pompeii eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In "Planet of the Ood", Donna and the Doctor go to the Ood-Sphere and Donna defends the Ood from the abuses they suffer at the hands of humans. In the two-parter "The Sontaran Stratagem" and "The Poison Sky", Donna meets former companion Martha Jones who works for UNIT and together they stop the Sontarans from using ATMOS to choke the world. In "The Doctor's Daughter", it is Donna who names the eponymous character "Jenny" (Georgia Moffett) and subsequently convinces the Doctor to accept Jenny. The Doctor and Donna meet Agatha Christie (Fenella Woolgar) in "The Unicorn and the Wasp" and have to solve their very own murder mystery. The two-parter episodes of "Silence in the Library" and "Forest of the Dead" introduces River Song and the Doctor accidentally shoves Donna into a cyberworld while attempting to keep her safe from the Vashta Nerada. "Midnight" gives Donna a break with a spa day while the Doctor has the most terrifying bus ride of his life. The episode "Turn Left" features a parallel universe wherein Donna never met the Doctor; consequently, the Doctor died and the world comes to an end much sooner. In finale episodes "The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End", Donna touches the Doctor's energised severed hand and is imbued with the totality of his knowledge, using which, she is able to stop Davros (Julian Bleach) and his plan to destroy reality. However, because her mind cannot handle the knowledge, the Doctor is forced to wipe her memory of him and hope that they never meet again, lest she remember and her mind "burn up". Donna reappears in the two-part "The End of Time" (2009–10). Early in the story, she buys her grandfather a book written by the episode's villain, which the Doctor takes to mean that the "DoctorDonna" is still trying to subconsciously lend a hand. When every member of the human race (apart from herself and Wilf) becomes a clone of the Doctor's nemesis the Master (John Simm), Donna's memories are nearly restored; however, a fail-safe installed by the Doctor protects her. In the story's concluding moments, Donna marries new fiancé Shaun Temple (Karl Collins), becoming Donna Temple-Noble; the Doctor anonymously delivers her a winning lottery ticket to ensure her financial future, having borrowed the purchase price from Donna's late father in the past.
Literature.
Outside of the television series, Donna appears in some of the BBC Books New Series Adventures novels, alongside the Tenth Doctor, in stories set in-between episodes of series four. Donna first appears in "Ghosts of India" by Mark Morris, "The Doctor Trap" by Simon Messingham and "Shining Darkness" by Mark Michalowski in September 2008. She makes a fourth and final appearance in the novels in "Beautiful Chaos" by Gary Russell in December 2008; subsequent Tenth Doctor novels in the New Series Adventures range feature the Doctor travelling alone. Despite the few novel appearance, Donna does feature in a number of "Doctor Who" short stories, in "Doctor Who Annual" 2009, and "The Doctor Who Storybook" in 2007 and 2009, as well as one online short story appearance "The Lonely Computer" (the events of which are briefly alluded to in the episode "The Unicorn and the Wasp"). The character also features prominently in comic books and comic strips featured in "Doctor Who Magazine", the younger-audience "Doctor Who Adventures" and "", online comic book features, comics featured in the "Annual" and "Storybook", as well as two arcs of American comic book company IDW Publishing's "Doctor Who" ongoing series.
Audio drama.
Donna also appears in three original audiobooks published by BBC Books: "Pest Control" (May 2008), "The Forever Trap" (October 2008) and "The Nemonite Invasion" (February 2009).
Casting.
As indicated by David Tennant in his series two video diary (included in the DVD box set), the casting of Catherine Tate was kept secret; her scene in "Doomsday" was filmed with minimal crew. His series three video diary mentions that this instance was one of the few occasions where the element of surprise was successfully maintained without it being revealed in advance by the media. Tate became the first guest star to be named in the show's opening credits, which has since become common practice in the show's specials. Her character was considered by the production team to have companion status long before the announcement of the character's return.
Executive producer Russell T Davies at one time dismissed Donna's potential as an ongoing companion due to her abrasive personality, saying that "she'd get on your nerves". In fact, the character was not originally scheduled to return at all. In Davies' original conception of the fourth season, it was one-off character Elton Pope (Marc Warren) from 2006's "Love & Monsters" who was to become the Tenth Doctor's last ongoing companion. Donna did not even appear in his original conception of reunion episode "The Stolen Earth", despite planned reappearances from Martha, Captain Jack (Barrowman), Sarah Jane (Sladen), Rose (Piper) and Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), as well as Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and the cast of spin-off series "Torchwood". Later still, Davies had intended the series four companion to be "Penny", a Northern woman with whom the Doctor would share a romantic attraction; actor David Jason might have played the character's father. After a conversation between Catherine Tate and the BBC's Jane Tranter, in which Tate expressed an interest in returning, Davies rewrote season four to feature Donna instead.
Tate looked to her own full-time casting as a "gamble" on the part of executive producer Russell T Davies; Tate attributes this to being "known, by the vast majority of people, for wearing wigs and comedy teeth" (in her sketch comedy "The Catherine Tate Show"). The actress was grateful to Davies for casting her, and joked about the prominence eventually afforded her character: " "For one brief moment I was the most important woman in the whole of the universe." Ben Rawson-Jones attributes success to the natural progression of her character, her boisterous personality being toned down for her first 2008 appearance, "Partners in Crime".
Reception.
In their review of the fourth series, Digital Spy opined "At the core was Catherine Tate's excellent performance as Donna Noble, epitomising the intricate fusion of fun, adventure, sadness and a desire to belong." Digital Spy noted that fans initially worried about Tate's full-time casting, as she is known for her role as a comedian and comic actor. They attributed the character's success to the modification of the much more brash and boisterous character she appeared to be in "The Runaway Bride". The character's comedic elements continued ("the occasional... misfire") in the form of her tendency to shout, but Digital Spy was praising of many of the character's comedic moments. They praised, moreso, Tate's crying scenes "The Fires of Pompeii", which "gave the visually impressive episode much-needed depth", as well as her sensitivity and emotionality at the mistreatment of the alien "Ood" in "Planet of the Ood". Cult Editor Ben Rawson-Jones also praised the character's "tragic" scenes, such as losing her fake children and ideal man in "Forest of the Dead", and the "emotional wringer" of Donna-centric episode "Turn Left". Donna was voted the second best companion of all time in Doctor Who Magazine Issue 414.

Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992

Yugoslavia participated for the last time in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992. Yugoslavia decided their entrant for the contest through a national final, "Jugovizija 1992", where it was decided that Extra Nena, with the song "Ljubim te pesmama", would sing for Yugoslavia at Eurovision 1992.
The winning song was chosen by an expert jury.
After the contest, United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 (adopted May 30, 1992) placed sanctions on SFR Yugoslavia, which included a ban on its participation in international contests and cultural events (such as the ESC). Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia then appeared independently beginning with the 1993 contest, Macedonia joined the 1998 contest and Serbia and Montenegro were allowed to participate once again in 2002.
National final.
The national final was held on 28 March 1992 in the TV Center in Belgrade. Artists from Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina competed. There were twenty songs competing in the national final.
Members of the jury were: I - Enes Bajramović, II - Vojkan Borisavljević, III - Ivan Vitalić, IV - Zoran Danilović, V - Feti Dautović, VI - Dušan Živić, VII - Stevan Zarić, VIII - Ivana Jeftić, IX - Andjelko Maletić, X - Brano Mališić, XI - Miroslav Maraus, XII - Vesna Mulić, XIII - Lola Novaković, XIV - Dejan Perišić, XV - Sonja Spasić
At Eurovision.
Extra Nena performed 20th on the night of the contest, following Italy and preceding Norway. The song received 44 points at the close of the voting, placing 13th in a field of 23.

Rejuvelac

Rejuvelac is a non-alcoholic fermented liquid made from sprouted grains. Because it is fermented, Rejuvelac contains beneficial bacteria and active enzymes, and thus it is reported to improve digestion of food. Rejuvelac can be drunk as a digestive aid or used as a starter culture for other fermented foods such as raw nut and seed yoghurts, cheeses, sauces and Essene Breads. Rejuvelac is prepared using whole wheat, oats, rye, quinoa, barley, millet, buckwheat, rice and other types of grain. Rejuvelac is cloudy, with the colour of pale straw. It has a flavour that is lemony, sharp and slightly tangy, with a mild earthy aroma.
Rejuvelac is a raw food made by sprouting a grain, soaking the sprouted grain in water for about two days at room temperature, and then reserving the liquid. A second batch can be made from the same sprouts, this time requiring only about one day to ferment. A third batch is possible but the flavor may be disagreeable. The spent sprouted grains are usually discarded. (Preferably via composting or feeding to small animals.)
It was invented by Ann Wigmore and it mimics the recipe for Borş.

Glen Iris Inn

The Glen Iris Inn, William Pryor Letchworth's former home, is located on the top of a cliff overlooking Middle Falls in Letchworth State Park, New York State, USA. William Letchworth found the day-to-day operations of business burdensome and so sought refuge from the business world and decided to build a home; he settled on the location while as a tourist gazing at the view in what the Seneca Indians called the Sehgahunda Valley through which the Genesee River flowed. In 1859 he purchased his first tract of land near Portage Falls. 
Letchworth hired noted landscape architect William Webster to design the grounds of the estate, which Letchworth named Glen Iris after the Greek goddess of rainbows. Webster and some special guests would eventually plant huge varieties of differing trees and flowering bushes throughout the park, including white and red pines, oaks, and dogwoods.

Mimosa Public School

Mimosa Public School, is a school located in Frenchs Forest Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is a co-educational Public school operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training with students from years K to 6. Students at the school come from the suburbs of Belrose, Davidson, Frenchs Forest in Northern Beaches region of Sydney.
History.
Mimosa Public School was originally to be called Sorlie Public School after George Sorlie, an idealistic developer of land in the district. With the growth of the Belrose area in the 1960s, the New South Wales Department of Education made the decision to have a new area school alongside Frenchs Forest, Belrose and Wakehurst Public Schools. Construction commenced in 1969 for an anticipated 1970 opening. On 27 November 1969 the P&C Association of the proposed "Sorlie Public School" met along with the Principal-elect, Keith Archbold, at Wakehurst Public School to initiate plans for opening the school. It was at this meeting that school uniforms were decided upon, however it was also felt that the name was not well chosen, and alternatives were proposed by a "Renaming" Committee. At the next P&C meeting on 19 January 1970, the members forwarded their name nomination, "Birralee", to the Geographic names board; this was later rejected on grounds that it was already in use by another school. It was also at this meeting that the Principal announced that a High School would be built on the land adjacent to the school, with construction commencing in 1972. This would later become Davidson High School.
The School opened on 27 January 1970, however the school was still incomplete and under construction and the first 184 enrolled students took classes at Wakehurst Public School. By late 1970, with the first stage finished, the school population had grown to over 300. The renaming committee also had advised that the school would no longer be called "Sorlie", but had difficulty deciding upon a new name after previous suggestions, "Blackbutts" and "Mimosa" were rejected by the Department of Education. However, at the December 1970 P&C meeting, the Principal announced that the school would officially be known as Mimosa Public School, which was later approved by the Minister for Education and Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Sir Charles Cutler.
In 1971 the school uniforms were worn for the first time, consisting of the chosen school colours of Green and Gold and Gordon Tartan. In early 1972, following months of effort, the design of the school crest and the school motto ""Growth and Integrity"" were presented and accepted at the May P&C meeting. In 1973, with the construction of Davidson High continuing, several classes were relocated to Mimosa, and stayed until 1974.
The subject of a new school, named Kambora Public School, was proposed in order to take the influx of students into local area schools at the time, with Mimosa's population peaking at 1130 students by 1979. Initially, Kambora was to have been opened by 1976, but was delayed until 1979.
In April 1982, after an extraordinary meeting of the P&C, the Mimosa Concert Band was established along with a Band Committee to support band-related activities.
In 1993 Mimosa received the Director General's Award for excellence in the Performing arts, recognising the school's achievements in music, dance and drama.

<doc id="18926269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18926269" title="Hodgdon Powder Company">
Hodgdon Powder Company

The Hodgdon Powder Company began in 1952 as B.E. Hodgdon, Inc., and has become a major distributor of smokeless powder for the ammunition industry, as well as for individuals who load their own ammunition by hand. The company's corporate office and manufacturing facilities are located in Kansas, USA. Hodgdon acquired IMR Powder Company in 2003. Winchester branded reloading powders have been licensed to Hodgdon since March 2006. Together these product lines make Hodgdon one of the largest distributors of gunpowder in the world.
Background.
In the opening days of World War II, a chemist friend of Bruce E. Hodgdon was casually reminiscing about World War I. He mentioned the quantities of surplus smokeless powder the military had dumped at sea after the war; and speculated how useful that would have been to handloaders struggling through the Great Depression. He anticipated a similar surplus powder situation might occur after World War II. Hodgdon began investigating availability of surplus powder when the war ended; and sales to handloaders began in 1946. One of the first powders he found was 4895 used for loading .30-06 Springfield service ammunition. In 1947, he began acquisition of 80 tons of spherical powder salvaged from disassembled .303 British military rifle cartridges manufactured in the United States. By 1949, he was marketing the powder as BL type C. The C was to indicate the powder burned "cooler" than traditional Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powders. In 1949, he began acquisition of powder salvaged from disassembled Oerlikon 20mm cannon cartridges. This powder resembled IMR 4350 in appearance, and with a slower burning rate, was initially marketed as "4350 Data", and later as 4831.
United States powder manufacturers had discontinued production of sporting ammunition during World War II; and after the war attempted to exercise greater product safety control by emphasizing sales of loaded ammunition rather than resuming production of handloading components. A common approach to product safety involved offering ammunition safe for use in the oldest or weakest firearm chambered for that cartridge. Owners of stronger firearms found and experimented with Hodgdon's previously unknown powders to achieve ballistics superior to available factory ammunition for older cartridges like the 7.92x57mm Mauser. Long-range shooters found 4831 was superior to previously available powders for high-capacity bottle-necked cases.
History.
United States powder manufacturers resumed powder sales of one-pound (454 gram) canisters after observing Hodgdon's successful sales to handloaders. DuPont resumed retail distribution of their pre-war nitrocellulose Improved Military Rifle (IMR) series; and Hercules Powder Company resumed production of six of their pre-war double-base powders. Hodgdon Powder Company began using an H-prefix to differentiate powders distributed by Hodgdon from competitors. Surplus Vulcan cannon spherical powder was distributed as H870 beginning in 1959.
All of the surplus BL type C had been sold by 1961. Olin Corporation had manufactured the powder as 846, and continued production for loading 7.62x51mm NATO cartridges. Hodgdon began marketing post-war production as spherical BL-C lot no. 2, or BL-C(2). Olin began retail distribution of Winchester-Western ball powders for pistol and shotgun loading in 1960; and Winchester-Western rifle ball powders followed in 1968. Hodgdon distributed spherical powders HS-5 and HS-6 for shotguns and H110, H335, H380, H414, and H450 for rifles.
DuPont added IMR 4895 to their retail distribution line in 1962, and added IMR 4831 in 1973 when supplies of surplus H4831 were exhausted. Hodgdon then acquired newly manufactured H4831 from Nobel Enterprises in Scotland. The Nobel formulations offer similar ballistic performance, but substitute centralite deterrent coatings for dinitrotoluene used in United States formulations. Handloaders were advised H-prefix powders were not the same as IMR-prefix powders of the same number. Hodgdon distributed H4198 and H4227 similar to IMR powders distributed by DuPont.
Modern black powder substitutes.
Hodgdon's product line includes Pyrodex and Triple Seven, which are modern substitutes for black powder and intended for use in muzzleloaders and certain antique firearms. Consequences of black powder's easy ignition by sparks or static electricity make manufacture and storage hazardous. The sole factory of the United States' largest 20th-century black powder manufacturer was closed by an accidental explosion as 1970 legislation established new regulations discouraging merchants from stocking black powder for sale. Future historical re-enactments with replica firearms appeared doubtful until Hodgdon introduced black powder substitute "Pyrodex" in 1975 with black powder combustion characteristics and smokeless powder safety.

Allen Bares

Allen Ray Bares, Sr. (September 24, 1936 – August 14, 2008) was a Lafayette lawyer who served as a conservative Democrat in both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature between 1972 and 1992. He is particularly remembered for his strong support of the pro-life cause and the Boy Scouts of America. He was the State Senate President from 1988 to 1990, during the first half of the administration of former Governor Buddy Roemer, a Democrat who turned Republican in 1991. Senators removed Bares as president in 1990 in a rare show of opposition to the governor.
Early years, education, law practice.
Born to John and Oneida Bares (pronounced BAH REZ), Bares was reared in the LeBlanc community in Vermilion Parish. He graduated in 1954 from Erath High School in Erath, where he played all sports, served as senior class president, and was a member of the chorus and parliamentary teams, both of which secured statewide recognition. He then graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, from which he procured his Bachelor of Arts and law degrees, the latter in 1960. He was a member of Sigma Nu at LSU and served as the fraternity president in 1957. He thereafter helped to establish a Sigma Nu chapter at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Bares was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Louisiana National Guard. He served six months of active duty at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
Bares began his legal career in Abbeville, the seat of Vermilion Parish, as an associate of J.E. Kibbee. In 1961, he moved to Lafayette as an associate general counsel with All American Insurance Company. He organized Val-u Investment Corporation and served as its vice president and general counsel. He practiced law for nearly a half century, most recently with the Oliver and Way firm of Lafayette. He was a lobbyist after he left the Senate.
Legislative service.
In 1972, Bares was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. He was unopposed in 1975. In 1979, he was elevated to the State Senate for the District 23 seat (Lafayette and Acadia parishes) vacated by Edgar G. "Sonny" Mouton, Jr., of Lafayette, who instead ran unsuccessfully for governor. In that campaign, under the new nonpartisan blanket primary, Bares defeated Democrat Pat Juneau, 54-46 percent in the general election, popularly called the runoff. Eliminated in the primary was Dud Lastrapes, who became the mayor of Lafayette the following year. Bares served in the Senate for twelve years until he was unseated in the 1991 general election by the Republican J. Lomax Jordan, also a Lafayette attorney. The seat was subsequently held by the Republicans Michael J. Michot and Page Cortez.
Roemer selected Bares as Senate President in 1988 though Sydney B. Nelson of Shreveport had actively sought the position and had urged Bares to run for the lesser position of Senate pro-tem. In Louisiana, the Senate president is normally chosen by the governor, but legislators in 1990 returned Nunez to the presidency in a slap at Roemer. The resolution to replace Bares with Nunez, authored by later U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, was twenty-eight to twenty-one. Roemer referred to the removal of Bares as an example of "what's wrong with this state."
Bares' obituary describes him as "a passionate leader in the pro-life movement authored historic legislation to protect the precious lives of the unborn in Louisiana." In 1991, Bares authored a measure in the Senate, co-sponsored in the House by Representative Sam H. Theriot of Abbeville, which would have outlawed most abortions in Louisiana, including impregnations which resulted from incest. The legislature approved the bill, but it was vetoed by Governor Roemer on the grounds that it went beyond the scope of the United States Supreme Court decision "Roe v. Wade". Such feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women, subsequently headed by the Louisiana native Kim Gandy, formerly of Bossier City, successfully targeted Bares and a pro-life House member, fellow Democrat Carl Newton Gunter, Jr., of Rapides Parish, for defeat. The controversy worked to Jordan's advantage though he too took the pro-life position. In the end, Bares and Gunter were defeated in what Louisiana feminists hailed as a great success.
Bares led Jordan in the 1991 primary with 13,409 votes (40 percent) to 9,313 ballots (28 percent). Two other Republicans, Carl W. Tritschler (born February 16, 1964) and Max A. Menard received a critical 6,713 (20 percent) and 3,921 votes (12 percent), respectively. The three Republican candidates, in what was otherwise a heavily Democratic year in Louisiana politics, polled a combined 60 percent in the state Senate primary. In the runoff, technically the general election on November 16, 1991, Jordan received 22,224 (60 percent) to Bares' 14,730 (again 40 percent). In that same election, Edwin W. Edwards returned for a fourth nonconsecutive term as governor in the showdown with former Ku Klux Klan figure David Duke.
A reformer in the legislature, Bares served as national vice president of the Education Commission of the States from 1985 to 1986. He championed tort reform and was a lead author of the 1987 Workman's Compensation Reform Act. Bares was president of the Louisiana Chapter of the Association of French Speaking Legislators and a supporter of the interest group, the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, or CODOFIL. In 1991, the nation of France awarded Bares the Medal of Merit to recognize his efforts to preserve the French language and culture in Louisiana. He grew up speaking French and did not learn English until he entered elementary school. On two occasions, Bares, as state senator, accompanied Governor Roemer on trips to France and to Japan.
Civic leadership.
Bares was active in the Kiwanis Club, Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, and St. Pius X Catholic Church. He was the first elected president of Our Lady of Fatima Church. He was president of the Evangeline Area Boy Scouts Council located at 2266 South College Road in Lafayette. He received the Silver Beaver Award from the Scouts in 2000. He was an avid horseman, hunter, fisherman, and golfer.
Bares died of a stroke in Lafayette. He was survived by his wife of 50+ years, the former Elizabeth "Betty" Jeanne Baquet; eight children, Camille Massie, Jude Bares, M.D., Jeannine Martin, John Bares, Michelle Tober, Jacques Bares, Allen Bares, II, and Elizabeth Mackie; nineteen grandchildren; a sister, Agnes B. Richard, and two brothers, Eno Bares and Emery Bares. A mass of Christian burial was held on August 18 at St. Pius X Church in Lafayette. Entombment was in the Calvary Cemetery Mausoleum.
In 2002, Bares was inducted into the "Living Legends" section of the Acadian Museum in Erath.

Captaincy General of Yucatán

The Captaincy General of Yucatán () was an administrative district of colonial Spain, created in 1617 to provide more autonomy for the Yucatán Peninsula, previously ruled directly by a simple governor under the jurisdiction of Audiencia of Mexico. Its creation was part of the, ultimately futile, Habsburg attempt in the late 16th century to prevent incursion into the Caribbean by foreign powers, which also involved the establishment of Captaincies General in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and neighboring Guatemala. With the addition of the title of captain general to the governor of Yucatán, the province gained greater autonomy in administration and military matters. Unlike in most areas of Spanish America, no formal "corregidores" were used in Yucatán, and instead the governor-captain general relied on other subordinate officials to handle the oversight of local districts. The Captaincy General remained part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, with the viceroy retaining the right to oversee the province's governance, when it was deemed necessary, and the Audiencia of Mexico taking judicial cases in appeal. The province and captaincy general covered the territory that today are the States of Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, Yucatán, and nominally the northern areas of Petén and Belize.
Law IV ("Que el Governador de Yucatan guarde las ordenes del Virrey de Nueva España") of Title I ("De los Terminos, Division, y Agregación de las Governaciones") of Book V of the "Recopilación de Leyes de Indias" of 1680 reproduces the November 2, 1627 royal decree ("real cédula") of Philip V, which established the nature of the relationship between the Governor of Yucatán and the Viceroy of New Spain: "It is convenient that the governors and captain generals of the Province of Yucatán, precisely and in a timely manner fulfill the orders that the viceroys of New Spain give them. And we order that the governors obey them and fulfill them."
In 1786, as part of the Bourbon Reforms the Spanish Crown established an Intendancy of Yucatán covering the same area as the Province. The intendancy took control of government and military finances and had broad powers to promote the local economy.

Despite scoring 7-tries in only 9-games Bell retired from rugby league at the age of only 20. He was released from his South Sydney contract to return to the North Coast of NSW in 2005 after not adjusting to life in Sydney and becoming homesick.
In this time Bell developed a cult following among rugby league fans because of his tiny frame and his skinny (even relative to his body) legs. At 65 kg Bell was even smaller than Preston Campbell (74 kg), another Aboriginal player famed for his slight frame. His ability to tackle players twice his size was seen as a throwback to the days of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons.

Effects of the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane in Florida

The effects of the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane in Florida produced significant flooding, damage to vegetation, and beach erosion in the Miami metropolitan area. After forming off West Africa on September 2, the storm moved on a parabolic path that brought it through The Bahamas as a Category 5 hurricane on September 16, eventually striking South Florida near the city of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the following day. The hurricane later crossed the state, entered the Gulf of Mexico near Naples less than 24 hours later, and went on to strike Louisiana before dissipating on September 21.
The hurricane was the fourth strongest to strike the United States, in Florida second only to Hurricane Andrew by maximum sustained winds. The hurricane produced heavy rainfall of up to , exacerbating existing flood conditions across all of southernmost Florida. High waves pounded the southeast coast, heavily damaging beachfront structures, washing out much of the coastal highway, and piling deep sand drifts on nearby grounds. In the Everglades, many cattle were drowned and the dike on Lake Okeechobee nearly overtopped. Off the west coast, the storm caused a ship to get lost and another to sink. In all, the storm claimed 17 lives and caused $31.6 million in damage.
Preparations.
On the evening of September 15, the U.S. Weather Bureau expected the storm to recurve, precipitating a possible landfall between
Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. As a precautionary measure, small watercraft between Jupiter, Florida, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, were advised to remain in port. Early on September 16, the forecast was revised, and hurricane warnings were issued for the Florida east coast from Titusville to Fort Lauderdale, later to be expanded to Miami. As the hurricane approached Northern commercial flights were grounded, and 1,500 National Guard troops were readied for mobilization if “deemed necessary” by Florida Governor Millard Caldwell. 4,700 persons in Broward County moved into shelters established by the Red Cross, while up to 15,000 people evacuated the flood-prone Lake Okeechobee region. In all, more than 40,000 people statewide moved into shelters established by the Red Cross. Military aircraft were flown to safer locations, in some cases four days or more in advance. Hotels in the threatened area filled quickly due to fears of a disaster similar to the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane; at Melbourne and Cocoa no vacant hotels were left for evacuees. During the storm, the MacArthur, North Bay (now Kennedy), and Venetian Causeways in Miami were closed to traffic. At Lake Worth alone, 1,800 people sheltered in nine official shelters during the storm.
Impact.
The storm killed only 17 people in Florida, many fewer than the size and intensity of the storm suggested, largely due to improved warnings and preparations, as well as more stringent construction standards, since the 1920s. Another contributing factor was the track of the storm, which, passing near Fort Lauderdale, placed the smaller communities of northern Broward and southern Palm Beach counties—Pompano Beach, Deerfield Beach, Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and the present-day sites of Coral Springs and Tamarac—rather than the major cities Fort Lauderdale and Miami, in the northern semicircle of the hurricane, where the strongest winds were likely to be found given the westward movement of the storm. The abandonment of frail concrete blocks, a staple of homes destroyed by the 1926 Miami hurricane, in favor of new layer techniques and tie-downs under the Depression-era South Florida Building Code was credited with reducing wind damage. Local radio stations also disseminated statewide weather advisories in advance, leaving residents well warned.
Even so, extensive damage resulted from heavy rainfall before and during the storm. The region had been inundated by spring rains several months previous, and in July, two months before the September storm struck, the Everglades Drainage District convened a series of emergency sessions to address flooding in the saturated area. By the time the storm arrived, the entire region was saturated and partly flooded. The combined flooding from the September storm and a later hurricane in October was among the worst in southern Florida's history, even spurring the creation of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District along with a plan for new flood-control levees and canals.
Broward County.
Upon making its first U.S. landfall, the storm produced wind gusts estimated at up to in Fort Lauderdale., The calm eye passed between Pompano Beach and Biscayne Park, lasting about an hour at Fort Lauderdale between 1630 and 1745 UTC, although estimates of the time of the lull in winds varied; one source claimed hurricane-force winds as early as 1705 UTC. The lowest barometric pressure in the Fort Lauderdale area was 950.8 mb (28.08 inHg) and was declared the official minimum pressure in the city, though not the lowest recorded in the storm over Florida. Intense wind gusts unroofed hundreds of homes and apartments in the Hollywood–Fort Lauderdale area, and reportedly “few utility poles were left standing, many having been snapped like toohpicks by the gusts.” The winds blew down a large radio-transmission tower in Fort Lauderdale. Yet while Fort Lauderdale suffered the majority of losses, this was because the strongest winds affected smaller communities to the north.
Significant coastal flooding and beach erosion affected the county. In Fort Lauderdale, the New River overflowed its banks and submerged downtown streets, and according to the local newspaper at the time, “whitecaps broke on East Las Olas Boulevard a mile (1.6 km) inland.” Tides reached at Hillsboro Inlet and along the coast from Fort Lauderdale northward. At Port Everglades, which reported 6.5-ft (2-m) tides, two freighters were unmoored; high tides carved a channel deep and rendered a nearby road impassable while nearly reopening New River Inlet, which had silted over and never re-emerged since the 1935 Yankee hurricane. High tides tore away a 150-foot-wide (45.7-m) strip of shoreline at Deerfield Beach, destroying six homes, and at Dania Beach half the oceanfront park was covered by sand. Even five days after the storm, the municipal beach at Pompano Beach was still largely flooded, with most shrubbery annihilated and leaves having been plastered by the wind to the walls of buildings; the bridge over the Hillsboro Inlet was also blocked by floodwaters.
As it crossed South Florida at about , the storm dropped several inches of rain on the county, peaking at over west of Fort Lauderdale. The town of Davie, having lost 35,000 "citrus" trees to floodwaters in preceding months, suffered devastating losses to groves and vegetable beds. In all of Broward County, not a single vegetable bed remained unscathed, delaying the expected October planting season.
Palm Beach County.
Although it was north of the strongest winds, West Palm Beach was battered by conditions equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane; at Morrison Field, at 1515 UTC on September 17 a three-cup anemometer measured sustained winds from the north-northeast of before losing two of its cups. In spite of the winds, wind-caused structural damage in the county was generally minor. At Lake Worth, while most buildings were materially damaged, only 10% were severely so, mostly when asphalt shingles were blown off, and few roofs suffered integral damage.
In Delray Beach, which remained outside the eye, stranded residents on the barrier island cut through downed vegetation to reach their homes. At the Boca Raton Army Air Field, the destruction of barracks during the storm forced soldiers into safer administrative and radar-training buildings. In all, on base the hurricane destroyed 150 barracks, supply houses, warehouses, the post stockade, the fire station, and the theater and mess buildings; many of the destroyed structures were frail and temporary. Losses as lately reported were 1947 US$4,500,000, hastening existing plans to close the base by November 30, 1947. At Hillsboro Beach homes suffered roof and window damage but survived; at West Palm Beach, 40% of the initial 1947 US$1,500,000 in damages was related to roof damage.
Many communities reported significant tree damage. Roads in the town of Gulf Stream were nearly blocked due to fallen trees. In Delray Beach, 50% of the trees were said to have been prostrated, while the city of West Palm Beach—about north of the center—estimated that 30,000 of the 300,000 municipal trees in the city were ruined, in most cases having been snapped or twisted rather than uprooted. The gustiness of the winds, which, according to visual estimates in West Palm Beach, dropped to about 0030 UTC on September 18 before rising again briefly to just before 0500 UTC, was believed to have been partially responsible for the breaking of so many trees.
In the county, high tides washed out much of State Highway A1A between Palm Beach and Boynton Beach, as well as at Delray Beach and Briny Breezes. Between Sloans Curve and the Lake Worth Municipal Casino Building, of the beachfront highway were left barren, as “just an empty strip of beach...as though no road existed there.” The historic casino building itself, built in 1922, was unroofed, its dance floor flooded, and itself condemned, later to be rebuilt after the storm. The tides also destroyed a famed local pavilion at Delray Beach. Many fine mansions were severely damaged, with one split in two as its foundation collapsed. In addition to high tides, the storm produced up to in the county at Twenty Mile Bend.
Dade County.
In northern Dade County, being south of the eye, damage was considered minimal and confined mainly to oceanfront structures, plate-glass windows, electrical lines, and vegetation, although large waves piled sand deep in oceanfront streets and tides in northern Biscayne Bay ran above normal. Strong winds unroofed the 11,000-seat Hialeah race track, damaging its barns and paddocks and leaving many of its famed flamingos missing. Miami Beach suffered the greatest losses in the county, estimated at 1947 US$4,000,000, as many of the 334 resort hotels as well as homes and apartments were battered by waves. There, a three-to-four-ft-deep (0.9-to-1.2-m) layer of sand covered many oceanfront grounds, and nearby neighborhoods on the Venetian Islands, like Belle Isle, were flooded to a depth of several feet.
In Miami after the hurricane, the city manager claimed of city streets were flooded out, while in Miami Springs half the homes were flooded.
Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.
On Lake Okeechobee, concerns about disastrous flooding were heightened by memories of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane on the south shore and of the 1926 Miami hurricane at Moore Haven. As of September 16, one day before the hurricane struck South Florida, the lake level was reported to be —already above government-mandated safe levels. At 1800 UTC on September 17, the water level between Clewiston and Lake Harbor rose within of overtopping the 31-ft-tall (9.5-m) Herbert Hoover Dike. During the storm, tides peaked at on the north shore of the lake and on the south shore at Clewiston and Moore Haven, nearly overrunning the Herbert Hoover Dike that surrounded the lake. However, due to revamped improvements in the dike, the storm caused only minor damage, and the dike prevented a repeat of the flooding of 1926 and 1928, in which over 2,500 people drowned.
Nevertheless, floodwaters in the Everglades region resulted in significant losses to cattle, and hundreds of small block homes in the agricultural districts were blown off their foundations. Much of the marshy country was waterlogged during and after the storm. Widespread rains of – affected the Glades region of Palm Beach County. Vegetable beds were flooded in up to several feet of water, while rural canals overflowed their banks and spilled into the Everglades. After the storm, heavy rains caused one 150-ft-long (45.7-m) section of the Herbert Hoover Dike to collapse near Canal Point, leaving 700 cattle stranded and 1,800 planted acres submerged. Floodwaters submerged Conners Highway in 30 locations and swept across a 3,000-ft (914.6-m) section, combining with debris to obstruct motorists.
West coast and Florida Panhandle.
On the west coast of the state, the hurricane produced sustained winds of at Naples, but the anemometer was obstructed from measuring the strongest winds. An hour later, the eye was reported as having passed overhead between 0200 and 0300 UTC, but the change in wind direction, from north to south via west, led contemporary meteorologists to conclude that the center of the eye passed just to the north, near Bonita Springs, leaving Naples in the southern semicircle of the storm. Damage in the Fort Myers–Punta Gorda area was described as being heavy, and the Coast Guard station at Sanibel Island Light was inundated by floodwaters to a depth of . Tides at Everglades City peaked at , forcing residents into attics and flooding local streets. However, the Tampa Bay area, being north of the eye, had less damage due to offshore winds forcing tides below normal. Rainfall in the region peaked at at Bonita Springs and at Fort Myers.
In Fort Myers, hundreds of trees were prostrated and the city left without power. In Saint Petersburg, citywide urban trolley service was disrupted for 15 hours due to the concurrence of the storm with a walk-out strike, but service resumed the day the storm passed into the Gulf of Mexico, in spite of debris blocking many tracks that made operations adverse. Throughout Pinellas County, an estimated 75% of the local "citrus" crop was lost, mainly due to bruised fruit, but otherwise overall damage in the groves was negligible, except that done to ornamental vegetation. In nearby Tampa, peak wind gusts at the Weather Bureau office were estimated at after wind instruments lost power, and the general impact in Pinellas County was minor, consisting of roofs blown from small buildings, boats damaged, roofing shingles scattered, and trees and power lines felled.
During the storm, two vessels, the schooner "Pilar" and the 35-ft (10.7-m) fishing vessel "Virginia", with a total combined crew of nine people, went missing; as of September 18, contact had been established with the former and the crew declared safe, but the remaining vessel, with a crew of two, had not been accounted for. Additionally, six Cuban schooners carrying 150 crew members in all sheltered off Anclote Key late on September 17 and rode out the storm. However, another Cuban vessel, the "Antonio Cerdedo," foundered and sank off Fort Myers with a loss of seven of her crew members.
An outer rainband of the storm produced an F3 tornado, wide, that struck Apalachicola at 0530 UTC on September 19, destroying 24 homes and partially damaging 31. Two people were killed, 15 were seriously injured, and 85 suffered minor injuries.
Aftermath.
In the state, the storm caused 1947 US$31.8 million in damages, nearly 65% of them property- and crop-related. 205 homes were destroyed and 10,543 severely damaged. Of the 17 deaths in the state, six were indirectly attributable to the storm.

He came to the plate a grand total of 7 times with no hits or walks.
While Firova was a student at Refugio High School, he sustained a serious hand injury, accidentally cutting off one of his fingers while cleaning a band saw in shop class. Despite this, he earned a two-year baseball scholarship at Bee County College. After that, he played baseball at Pan American College, where he earned his degree, and was subsequently drafted by the Mariners.
Firova currently serves as the manager of Vaqueros Laguna in the Mexican League. He began managing in the Mexican League in 1993, and was named that league's Manager of the Year in 2000.

Rudolph Gerken

Rudolph Aloysius Gerken (March 7, 1887—March 2, 1943) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Santa Fe from 1933 until his death.
Biography.
Rudolph Gerken was born in Dyersville, Iowa, as the sixth of the seven children of William and Elizabeth (née Sudmeier) Gerken. However, in 1889, his mother died and William then married Carolina Wuebbelt, with whom he had six more children. Raised on a farm, Gerken studied at Pio Nono College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana. He moved to Texas, where he taught in Scotland public schools from 1910 to 1912.
Gerken later decided, through the encouragement of Bishop Joseph Lynch, to embark on an ecclesiastical career whilst teaching at the University of Dallas; his brother Leo also became a priest. He studied theology at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, where he also taught languages, before being ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Lynch on June 10, 1917. He then served as pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Abilene (1917–1919) and of St. Rita’s Church in Ranger (1919–1926), and was made dean and consultor of the Diocese of Dallas in 1924.
On August 25, 1926, Gerken was appointed the first Bishop of Amarillo, Texas by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on April 26, 1927 from Bishop Lynch, with Bishops Christopher Byrne and Francis Kelley serving as co-consecrators, in Sacred Heart Cathedral. He assumed as his episcopal motto, "Not me but you, O Lord." During his tenure in Amarillo, Gerken oversaw the construction of thirty-five churches and founded Price Memorial College, of which he was also president.
He was later named the seventh Archbishop of Santa Fe, New Mexico on June 2, 1933. As Archbishop, Gerken established another diocese and several parishes, sought to provide relief to American prisoners of war in Japan during World War II, and presided over the marriage of actress Jane Wyatt and Edgar Ward in 1935.
The Archbishop, after suffering a stroke that left his right side paralyzed, died at St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, only five days shy of his fifty-sixth birthday.
He was a Rotarian and was known to quote Aristotle and St. Francis of Assisi.

All Systems Go 3

All Systems Go 3 is a compilation album by the San Diego, California rock band Rocket from the Crypt, released by Vagrant Records and Swami Records August 28, 2008, nearly three years following the band's breakup. It collects songs recorded from 1997 to 2000 on 8-track in the band's practice space. Many of the tracks were previously unreleased and became available for the first time on this album. "All Systems Go 3" includes contributions from original drummer Atom Willard as well as Chris Prescott and Tony DiPrima, both of whom filled in after Willard left the group in 1999.
Singer/guitarist John Reis describes the album as "violent, aggressive and thuggish stuff and to me sounds much better now in retrospect than when we originally were recording these demos...Thematically, musically, etc. it's all very period to an undocumented part of the bands history...I really believe if the band was still around, we would make a record at least sonically similar to ASG 3."
The album is the third in the band's series of rarities compilations, the first having been released in 1993 and the second in 1999. A fourth and final installment is being prepared and will consist of a CD/DVD combination package.

<doc id="18926528" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18926528" title="AXXo">
AXXo

aXXo is the Internet alias of an individual who became popular for releasing commercial DVD movies on the Internet as free downloads. The resulting files can in turn be easily distributed through the Internet and be viewed instantly on a computer.
aXXo files are popular among the file sharing community using peer-to-peer file sharing protocols such as BitTorrent. Eric Garland, the CEO of download-tracking firm BigChampagne, found that 33.5% of movies downloaded, during a random sampling, were aXXo torrents. The aXXo files gained popularity because aXXo produces files of comparatively small size, with a consistent file format. File sizes are approximately 700 MB – the same size as a compact disc. Because of aXXo's reputation for re-encoded quality, the aXXo name is sometimes faked as an identifying source by a variety of imitators.
Identity.
In a purported interview of a person claiming to be aXXo, he described himself as a single individual who has been ripping DVDs since he was a teenager.
Imitators.
Due to its popularity in the file sharing subculture, the pseudonym aXXo is falsely assumed by a variety of individuals and groups to mimic the source identity as a disguise for their own uploads on file sharing websites. A portion of such decoys is made available by a range of companies in the field of copyright enforcement, such as BayTSP, MediaDefender, or MediaSentry, with the aim of suing to make a profit. These faked files, or groups of files, would normally contain useless or potentially malicious data. The type of maliciously fake files include RAR format files that require the users to download a trojan disguised as a codec needed to view associated AVI format files. Other fake files encourage the users to register on dubious websites or require the users install the DomPlayer software. Fake files may also contain malware with the capability to send the IP address of the user's computer to a private server.
For years aXXo has been warning followers to “beware of bogus sites and lamers” in the .NFO files which accompany his torrents.
History.
The aXXo name first appeared in November 2005 on the message board "Darkside_RG".
In November 2007, aXXo deleted all of his files released after September 7, 2006 from The Pirate Bay, protesting that the site would allow harassing comments to be added to his torrents by "possible members of MPAA". While past aXXo torrents remained available on other torrent sites, uploads of new aXXo files stopped on November 11, 2007. After an absence of four months aXXo returned to uploading, starting with the movie "I Am Legend" on March 9, 2008.
On December 15, 2008, aXXo's thousandth movie upload, a copy of the Kiefer Sutherland horror film "Mirrors", appeared on an Internet forum for the Darkside Release Group.
On March 11, 2009, aXXo stopped uploading new files after releasing "". For a while he logged into Mininova until the site switched to only hosting torrents that were Content Distribution free or torrents with no copyrights.
On April 19, 2009 aXXo made his last known comment on message board "Darkside_RG", in response to rumors that he had stopped posting on Darkside_RG. He states: ""I can only say a big thank you for your appreciation mates, hope you all enjoy the darkside as much as you can My home is my beloved Darkside and as I've said so many times before on each of my torrents... Be aware of bogus sites and lamers See ya.""
Release information.
aXXo converted commercial DVD movies into approximately 700 MB .avi files which were then used to create a .torrent file that were uploaded to Bittorrent Trackers allowing the movie to be downloaded. On file sharing websites, aXXo files attracted a large following, with over a million users downloading aXXo files each month. Files released by aXXo followed the naming convention "Name.Of.Moviename="torrentfreak_April2007"/> where "DvDrip[Eng" implied it was ripped from an English-language disc and "avi" referred to the resulting file format. The video was encoded according to the MPEG-4 ASP standard, compatible with the Xvid codec. The aXXo postings also carried a .nfo file about the movie and an attached text file that states, in part: "Be aware of bogus sites and lamers, download your aXXo files from aXXo accounts. Enjoy!"

Akanthosuchus

Akanthosuchus (meaning "spine crocodile," in reference to its armor) is an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian, possibly an alligatorine. Its fossils are found in the Paleocene-age Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, USA. It is known from a partial skeleton and isolated bony armor. Its armor was distinctive, with spike-shaped and blade-shaped pieces, and it is the only known crocodilian with a combination of both.
History and description.
"Akanthosuchus" is based on NMMNH NP-139, a partial skeleton lacking the skull. The specimen was found in a concretionary sandstone lens with the anterior portion eroding out. It was discovered in Torrejon Wash, northwestern Sandoval County, New Mexico. The hind legs, numerous back, hip, and tail vertebrae (28), and armor (about 200 scutes) were the primary elements preserved. F. Michael O'Neill "et al." described the genus in 1981. The type species is "A. langstoni", honoring paleontologist Wann Langston, Jr., known for his work on fossil crocodilians.
"Akanthosuchus" was a moderately sized crocodilian. The thigh bone of NMMNH NP-139 was long, and the shin was long. However, this specimen may not have been fully grown. Based on growth rings, Hill and Lucas suggest that it was no younger than eight years old when it died. The tail may have been relatively short, given the reduction of bony projections on known tail vertebrae. The armor was unusual in having elongate spikes or broad blades. Its scutes came in four basic types: square (13%, keeled or unkeeled), oval (27%, keeled), bladed (<1%, similar to oval but with a much exaggerated triangular keel), and spiked (60%, square-based, conical and blunt). The spikes were nearly as tall as the base of their scutes were long, rising up to . They contacted only one other scute each, and may have been arranged in paired sets down the midline of the back and tail, and along the sides of the animal. Single rows of paired oval scutes may have filled in between the spiked rows. The bladed scutes, an extreme of the oval scute form, may have been found at the ends of the oval scute rows. The square scutes may have been restricted to one area, such as the neck and shoulders, or they may represent the belly armor. 
Spiked and bladed scutes are not unknown among crocodilians, although no other known crocodilian had or has both. O'Neill and colleagues compared "Akanthosuchus" to "Pinacosuchus", a crocodylomorph with spiked scutes known from the Late Cretaceous North Horn Formation of Utah, but it differed from "Akanthosuchus" in several ways: it was much smaller (three to four times smaller than NMMNH NP-139), it had less derived vertebrae, and it lacked bladed scutes.
Classification.
O'Neill "et al." suggested that "Akanthosuchus" was an alligatorine, based on the characteristics of a partial lower jaw bone (retroarticular). They considered the possibility that "Akanthosuchus" is a postcranial skeleton of either "Ceratosuchus" or "Navajosuchus", contemporaneous crocodilians known primarily from skulls, but elected to name a new genus instead. More recently, Hill and Lucas, using a cladistic analysis, rejected the hypothesis that "Akanthosuchus" is the same as either "Ceratosuchus" or "Navajosuchus", and found that "Akanthosuchus" is an alligatoroid. It tended to sort out with alligatorines, but Hill and Lucas found that this was weakly supported in their analysis.
Distribution.
NMMNH NP-139 came from the upper part of the Torrejonian portion of the Nacimiento Formation. Later work identified "Akanthosuchus langstoni" from the older Puercan-age portion of the Nacimiento Formation as well, which gives the genus a range including much of the Nacimiento Formation, deposited between approximately 64.5 and 61.0 million years ago. A scute and femur from the De-Na-Zin Member of the late Campanian-age (Late Cretaceous) Kirtland Formation are similar to the corresponding elements of "Akanthosuchus", but cannot be conclusively assigned to the genus at this time. This material is also from the San Juan Basin.
Paleobiology.
The Nacimiento Formation is interpreted as having had a fluvial and lacustrine depositional setting. O'Neill "et al." interpreted "Akanthosuchus" as either a terrestrial crocodilian or a specialized, modestly sized, heavily armored aquatic crocodilian.

Aktiogavialis

Aktiogavialis is an extinct genus of crocodylian from the Oligocene epoch some 30 million years ago. Only one species in the genus, "Aktiogavialis puertoricensis", has been described so far.
As a typical gavialoid, "Aktiogavialis" followed the standard crocodilian body plan. An elongated, squat quadrupedal body terminated in a long, laterally flattened tail at one end, and a specialized, narrow snout at the other. As with the other members of its family, the snout of "Aktiogavialis" was extremely long and narrow, tapering into a thin structure past the eye sockets. Based on the fragmentary remains recovered, the species was differentiated from other members of its family by unique positioning and geometry of its skull elements. Phylogenetic analysis indicates its closest relatives were the extinct gavials "Gryposuchus" and "Siquisiquesuchus".
The type species of the genus, "A. puertoricensis", was described in 2007. The holotype, designated UPRMP 3094, was discovered in Puerto Rican deposits dating from the Oligocene epoch some 30 million years old. The deposits, part of the San Sebastián Formation along the Río Guatemala in Puerto Rico, have been an adequate supply of other crocodylian fossils. "Aktiogavialis" remains recovered were extremely fragmentary, consisting of an incomplete skull featuring elements of the braincase and other scattered cranial elements.
Marine sediments and nanofossils form part of the deposits where the specimen was found, indicating a marine distribution for ". puertoricensis". This is in contrast with the living gavialoids, which reside entirely in the freshwater rivers of South Asia. While fossils found in prehistoric deltaic sediments possibly have been washed onto the delta from inland sources, the "Aktiogavialis" specimen found so far was from a location that had essentially been islandic. This has led to conclusions that gavialoids were partially or primarily saltwater reptiles prior to the evolution of the group's one or two extant species.
The genus' name, "Aktiogavialis", is derived from the Greek words "aktios" (river) and "gavialis" (gavial). This roughly translates to "shore gavial", referring to its rather estuarine distribution. The specific name "puertoricensis" means "from Puerto Rico", in reference to the specimen's country of origin.

Aldabrachampsus is an extinct genus of crocodylian. A horned crocodile, its incomplete remains were found on Aldabra Atoll in the western Indian Ocean. It was small (perhaps long) and lived during the Pleistocene.

Alligatorellus is a genus of atoposaurid crocodyliform found in France that was related to "Atoposaurus".
A skeleton of "Alligatorellus" has also been found in the Solnhofen Limestone of Kelheim, Germany. The limestone was deposited in a marine environment and the individual may have washed into a lagoon where it was fossilized. Remains of four crinoids that lived in the lagoon are found in the same block as the skeleton. The skeleton includes osteoderms and limb bones, which are three-dimensionally preserved. The German skeleton shows more details of atoposaurid anatomy than most fossils, as other atoposaurid remains are compressed flat.

"A paintenense" is likely to be closely related to the family Goniopholididae and not a member of the Atoposauridae. Another species, "A. depereti", was named in 1915, but has since been reassigned to its own genus, "Montsecosuchus".

Le Fanu House

Le Fanu House is a large Federation Queen Anne style single-storey home located in Salvado Street, Cottesloe, Western Australia. It was built circa 1893, and is regarded as an example of a grand beachside home but is now a near-ruin.
History.
Banksia (later Le Fanu) was built as a private residence for Henry Diggins Holmes, his wife Marion and their three children, at the corner of Salvado Road and Marine Parade, close to the dunes of Cottesloe Beach. Homes was appointed General Manager of the Bank of Western Australia in 1890. 
In 1898 and 1900, substantial additions and alterations designed by architect Percy William Harrison were undertaken and it was sold in 1945 to the Perth Diocesan Trustees and renamed after then Archbishop of Perth, Henry Frewen Le Fanu. It became a private residence again in 1973, when the property was purchased by Mrs Fenwick (now Mrs Drake Brockman).
Architecture.
According to Aussie Heritage, the House was originally known as "Banksia", and was built as the private residence of Henry Diggins Holmes and his wife Marion. "Large residence of dressed limestone, now roofed in asbestos. Gables on all four sides have Tudor details. On south-east is a bay window with conical turret topped with elegant finial. Surrounding verandahs supported on simple square timber posts. Garden enclosed by limestone wall. There is a lower floor on north side." 
The House is described as being in Federation Style, with a Queen Anne turret, in an otherwise Romanesque form.
Heritage value.
Le Fanu House was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 12 May 1975 and permanetly listed on the Register of the National Estate on 28 September 1982. The building(s) were also included on the Town of Cottesloe's Municipal Inventory on 30 September 1995 and were permanently listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 7 January 2000 by the Heritage Council of Western Australia.
Present state.
A story in Post Newspapers in January 2008 described the House as "crumbling into ruins". The 17-room house "...is probably the most expensive chunk of real estate in Cottesloe - but it has serious complications," the story said. "It has the highest possible heritage listing - and presents an expensive challenge for any new owner because it cannot be demolished." The House has an asbestos roof, rotten roof timbers, crumbling bricks and collapsing limestone walls.
Ownership and sale.
In August 2008 the House was listed for sale by the owners, Francis Margaret Drake-Brockman, for a reputed asking price of $10 million. In September 2010 the Town of Cottesloe granted approval for the current owners, S. Wyatt and S. Gibson, to undertake extensive alterations and additions to the 17-room house, at an estimated cost of $6 million, to enable it to be restored for residential use. The proposed renovations include the demolition of four rooms, a northern verandah enclosed after World War II and a post WWII ablution block. The construction of an underground car park beneath the demolition area. The restoration of the ballroom, dining room and study, with the kitchen being partially demolished and adapted as a guest suite. A large self-contained house will be built behind the existing dwelling. The works are being undertaken by Zorzi Builders, under the supervision of heritage architects, Hocking Planning and Architecture.

Hrushovski construction

In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the Hrushovski construction generalizes the Fraïssé limit by working with a notion of "strong substructure" formula_1 rather than formula_2. It can be thought of as a kind of "model-theoretic forcing", where a (usually) stable structure is created, called the "generic". The specifics of formula_1 determine various properties of the generic, with its geometric properties being of particular interest. It was initially used by Ehud Hrushovski to generate a stable structure with an "exotic" geometry, thereby refuting Zil'ber's Conjecture.
Three conjectures.
The initial applications of the Hrushovski construction refuted two conjectures and answered a third question in the negative. Specifically, we have:
The construction.
Let "L" be a finite relational language. Fix C a class of "finite" "L"-structures which are closed under isomorphisms and
substructures. We want to strengthen the notion of substructure; let
formula_1 be a relation on pairs from C satisfying:
An embedding formula_22 is "strong" if formula_23.
We also want the pair (C, formula_1) to satisfy the "amalgamation property": if formula_25 then there is a formula_26
so that each formula_27 embeds strongly into formula_28 with the same image for
formula_29. 
For infinite formula_28, and formula_12, we say formula_32 iff formula_33 for
formula_34, formula_35. For any formula_36, the
"closure" of formula_29 (in formula_28), formula_39 is the smallest superset of formula_29
satisfying formula_41. 
Definition A countable structure formula_42 is a (C, formula_1)-generic if:
Theorem If (C, formula_1) has the amalgamation property, then there is a unique (C, formula_1)-generic.
The existence proof proceeds in imitation of the existence proof for
Fraïssé limits. The uniqueness proof comes from an easy back and forth
argument.

His father was Áed mac Eochada (died 839) who killed his own brother Muiredach mac Eochada (died 839), King of Ulaid. However Áed was killed that same year by his nephew, Matudán mac Muiredaig (died 857) who became King of Ulaid. Matudán was succeeded by a member of the rival Dal nAraide sept, Lethlobar mac Loingsig (died 873). Ainbíth may have been recognized as heir for we find him commanding the forces of Ulaid in 864. In that year the high king Áed Findliath (died 879) of the northern Ui Neill and his ally Flann mac Conaing of Brega (died 868) inflicted a heavy defeat on the Ulaid.
Ainbíth became king in 873 upon the death of the aged Lethlobar and the annals record that he waged war with his neighbors. In 878 the Ulaid killed Cummascach mac Muiredaig, King of the Uí Cremthainn (a tribe of the Airgialla in eastern County Fermanagh and northern County Monaghan). In 882 the Ualid fought a skirmish with the Conaille Muirtheimne (located in Dundalk area of County Louth). Ainbíth was slain along with his ally Conallán mac Máele Dúin, king of Coba (the Uí Echach Cobo of west County Down).
His son Fiachnae mac Ainbítha (died 886) was also a King of Ulaid.

Honeymoon (1959 film)

Honeymoon (), also shown as The Lovers of Teruel in the United States, is a 1959 film by the British director-writer Michael Powell based in part on the ballet "El Amor Brujo" by Gregorio Martínez Sierra. The film stars Anthony Steel, Ludmilla Tchérina and Spanish ballet dancer Antonio, and features Léonide Massine.
The film is something of a travelogue around Spain with dance interludes, mainly set to the repeated theme of "The Honeymoon Song" by Mikis Theodorakis. Performed in the film by Marino Marini and his quartet, it was subsequently recorded by many performers, including The Beatles.
Plot.
Ballet dancer Anna Cato (Ludmilla Tchérina) has just given up the ballet to marry Australian farmer Kit Kelly (Anthony Steel). They are touring Spain in their open top Bentley for their honeymoon before going to live on the sheep station that Kit runs in Australia.
An American car races past them at high speed but it soon has to stop to change a burst tyre. The car is driven by the famous Spanish dancer Antonio and his wife Rosita Candelas (Rosita Sergova). They are a fiery couple, always arguing and when Antonio goes down to a stream to wash up after changing the tyre, Rosita drives away without him. Antonio, stranded in the middle of nowhere, starts dancing down the road in his well-known "Zapateado".
Kit and Anna drive by and offer Antonio a lift. They drive in to the "Tavern del Toro", where Antonio is known, and start to eat a wonderful breakfast. Antonio thinks he has seen Anna before but she says that this is her first trip to Spain. One old lady pushes forward her daughter who she wants to dance for Antonio. Lucia (Carmen Rojas) dances the "El Macarona" flamenco but then Antonio asks the musicians to play "El Taranto" to really see what she can do.
Rosita turns up at the end of the flamenco and another argument ensues, so Kit and Anna slip away. After a delightful meal they retire to their room where Anna does her best to distract Kit from his book on "Fertility and Animal Breeding". Next day, after a bit more travelling around, Kit and Anna enter a bar – only to find Antonio is already there. They are introduced to the "cocktail set" and discover who Antonio is.
Anna goes to Antonio's studio where they are rehearsing his new dance, "Los amantes de Teruel" (The Lovers of Teruel), as a classical ballet but with a Spanish style. When Anna makes some suggestions to help the "pas de deux" Antonio realises she is a dancer and at last discovers who she really is. As Anna dances with Antonio neither are aware that Kit has come to the studio and is watching, not very pleased that his wife is dancing again.
Kit and Anna travel south to see the painting "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz" by El Greco. Kit declares that that is how Antonio's ballet should be staged. They then visit the Mosque at Córdoba and other places.
Early the next morning Kit goes off to help a breeder of bulls with his round-up and Anna is taken to the Alhambra at Granada by Antonio. They dance around the palace in a light hearted flirtation and Anna declares that she really has given up the ballet and is willing to settle down with Kit. Antonio isn't so sure. When they go to join Kit there is a mild confrontation between Kit and Antonio. The film is building up to the two men representing Don Diego and Don Pedro, competing for the attentions of Doña Isabel in the story of "Les amantes de Teruel" which will be the finalé of the film.
Kit and Anna go to see a performance of "El Amor Brujo" (Bewitched Love). The story is that of a girl whose lover had died but who now haunts her and prevents her from getting on with her life and her new lover. The lead roles are danced by Antonio and Rosita, with a cameo from Léonide Massine as the ghost – Massine was over sixty years old at the time – and Lucia as the girl's friend who tries to lure the ghost away. The restored version contains the full ballet, a mixture of classical ballet and flamenco style.
The next night, in Teruel, the guide (the voice of Michael Powell) explains the legend of the lovers of Teruel to Kit and Anna as they stand on the terrace looking at the statues. But Anna falls ill and develops a fever. In her fevered imagination she hallucinates the story of the Lovers of Teruel as a great ballet, with herself dancing the part of Doña Isabel and Antonio as Don Diego, her lover. Again a mix of classical ballet and Spanish style, with Antonio in Moorish make-up. The restoration contains the full ballet to the music of Manuel de Falla. The final funeral has the echoes of the El Greco painting the couple saw earlier.
The next morning Antonio comes to visit Anna, now in hospital with Kit by her side. We learn that Anna and Kit will be off to Australia in a few days and Kit thinks that at last they have seen the last of Antonio. But no, he tells them he is starting a world tour!
Cast.
Cast notes:
Music.
Music used in "Luna de miel" includes:
Production.
After his partnership with Emeric Pressburger ended, Michael Powell looked around for other projects and was enticed to Spain to make a film that, it was hoped, would do for flamenco and Spanish ballet what "The Red Shoes" had done for ballet. There were many problems during the production, mainly due to the lack of available finances. In one non-fiscal incident, Powell's car was stolen and as the thieves were chased they crashed the car and died in the crash.
Awards and honours.
At the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, "Luna de miel" won the Technical Grand Prize. Also, director Michael Powell was nominated for the Golden Palm Award.
Subsequent history.
Ludmilla Tchérina liked the final ballet, "Los Amantes de Teruel", so much that she incorporated it into her regular stage performances. With the help of director Raymond Rouleau, it was turned into a film "Les Amants de Teruel" (1962).
The film was cut for television in the UK, and this version was the only one available for many years. The cuts were mainly to some of the extended dance sequences, leaving it as little more than a travelogue. This led to the film getting a bad reputation.
The film was fully restored from its original elements by Charles Doble of Somerset, and the restored film had its first public screening at the San Sebastián Film Festival in 2002 in the presence of Rosita Sergova, one of the stars of the film. It was first shown in the UK in Ashbrittle, Somerset on 21 June 2003.

1987 Australian Drivers' Championship

The 1987 Australian Drivers' Championship was a CAMS sanctioned national motor racing title contested over a single race for Australian Formula 2 racing cars. The race, billed as the "Australia Cup for the 1987 CAMS Gold Star", was staged at the Adelaide Street Circuit in South Australia on Friday, 13 November 1987. This was the first year that the championship had been restricted to Australian Formula 2 cars and is the only year to date in which the title has been awarded on the results of a single race rather than a series of races.
David Brabham won the race after a remarkable drive from grid position 38 after poor qualifying caused by missing almost all of practice with carburettor and electrical problems.
While Brabham picked his way through the field the battle for the race saw Rohan Onslow and Mark McLaughlin take the lead after polesitter Arthur Abrahams was left on the grid with a failed ignition ballast restrictor. McLaughlin led for much of the race but his Elfin slowed near the end of the race and was swamped by Onslow then Brabham. With two laps remaining Brabham caught and past Onlow and pulled away for a 1.7 second victory.
Ian Richards and John Wise fought over fourth for much of the event but Wise slowed near the end of the race with Shane Flynn taking fifth ahead of Chris Hocking.

Hamburg (barque)

Hamburg was a three masted barque built in 1886 at Hantsport, Nova Scotia. She was the largest three masted barque ever built in Canada .
Background.
"Hamburg" was one of the last of over a hundred large sailing vessels built by the Churchill family of Hantsport, led by Ezra Churchill. The barque was named after Hamburg, Germany, continuing a Churchill family tradition of naming ships after ports where they often sought cargoes.
Career.
The barque's captain for almost her entire career was Andrew B. Coldwell. "Hamburg" worked mostly Atlantic trades but also made several long Pacific voyages, rounded Cape Horn many times and made one circumnavigation of the world in 1891. She called at her namesake port of Hamburg, Germany in 1895. She was converted to a gypsum barge in 1908 and served 17 years carrying gypsum under tow from the Minas Basin to New York. Her working career ended in 1925 when she was beached at Summerville, Hants County, Nova Scotia, just across and downriver from the site of her launch at Hantsport. In 1936, her massive wooden hull was burned to the waterline, leaving her lower hull partially covered and preserved in river silt.
Legacy.
"Hamburg's" surviving hull offers a rare surviving example of the structure of a wooden sailing ship from Canada's Golden Age of Sail. The vessel's history is presented at the nearby Avon River Shipbuilding Museum at Newport Landing and at the Churchill House Marine Memorial Room in Hantsport. A lower mast from "Hamburg" is preserved at the Age of Sail Heritage Centre in Port Greville, Nova Scotia while one of her massive iron bollards is on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="18926807" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18926807" title="Lian Heng">
Lian Heng

Lian Heng (; 1878–1936) was a Chinese historian, author, political activist and poet from Taiwan. Heng dedicated his life to the creation and spread of a unified and strong Taiwanese cultural identity through his historical research and works of poetry. He is most famous for having written the "General History of Taiwan (臺灣通史)", widely considered the first history of the island. Lian is also known for being the grandfather of Lien Chan, former Chairman of the Kuomintang.
Early life.
Lian Heng was born on February 17, 1878 in Tai'nan, Taiwan. Lian grew up in a prosperous merchant family, the third son of Lien Yung-ch'ang. Lian's ancestors originated from the city of Lung Chi in the Fujian Province. The family had moved to Taiwan at the end of the Ming Dynasty as they were adamantly opposed to Manchu intrusions into China and the later foreign Qing. Born to a well-off family, Lian received an education in traditional Chinese fashion, learning Chinese characters, poetry, and the Confucian Classics. Lian gained an early interest in Chinese and Taiwanese culture and history from stories told him by his father and private tutors. With this exceptional schooling, Lian quickly developed into a young scholar-poet.
Life under Japanese Rule.
Lian Heng was 17 when Taiwan came under Japanese Imperial rule as a result of the Qing defeat in the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. The island falling to Japanese control in the following Treaty of Shimonoseki and the death of his father in the same year had a great effect on Lian. Lian felt as little connection to the foreign Qing China as he did to the new Japanese Empire, and he soon began research on the ancient history of China.
In 1895, Lian traveled to his ancestral home of Fujien Province to conduct research, in particular on the works of the poet Du Fu. Two years later in 1897, Lian's studies led him to Shanghai a hub of progressive thought and western ideas. Due to illnesses and death in the family, he returned to Taiwan, where he began to create a genealogical record of the Lian family.
Life and Work.
On returning to Taiwan in 1898, Lian Heng married Lady Shen Ao and continued his studies of Chinese classics, history, and the Japanese language. In 1899 Lian was recruited as editor-in chief by the Tai-nan News Daily. Working as a journalist, Lien was exposed to the ideas of nationalism, and wrote articles and poems on his disillusionment with the Qing's backward policies and inaction.
In 1905 Lian and his family moved to Xiamen where he formed his own newspaper, the Fuchien Daily. Lian and other intellectuals such as Lo Hsiu-hui and Hu Tien-p'eng wrote articles supporting the Tongmenghui and other Anti-Manchu revolutionary causes. As a result of his revolutionary activities, the government deemed his newspaper a radical threat to the Qing. Feeling disheartened with the political situation in China, Lian and his family returned once again to Taiwan.
Back in Taiwan, Lian devoted himself to the cause of writing the history of Taiwan. Through his studies of mainland Chinese history and culture, Lian realized that the Taiwanese must also awaken in themselves a love for their own distinct heritage, language, and nationalism in order to withstand foreign oppression. Lian searched the island for archaeological and written remains of the earliest settlers of the island in order to gather information. Lian also became involved in Taiwanese political movements such as the Assimilation Society and Taiwanese Cultural Association. On moving to Taichung in 1908, Lian was offered a job as editor for the Taiwan Daily. With the help of fellow intellectuals, scholars, and writers such as Liang Ch'i-ch'ao, Hung Hsu, and Lin Hsien-ta'ng Lian gathered necessary primary sources.
General History of Taiwan.
In 1921, Lian Heng published the "Taiwan T'ung-shih" General History of Taiwan covering Taiwanese history from the Sui Dynasty up until the Japanese occupation. The work was a culmination of Lian's extensive research and the most comprehensive collection of Taiwanese history up until that time.
The work begins with the poignant line, "A country may be destroyed, but never its history".
Lian divided the General History of Taiwan into three sections: 1. The Annals 2. The Records and 3. The Biographies. The scope of Lian's work was immense, covering subjects spanning from historic migrations of Han Chinese from the mainland to Taiwan, famous women of the island, the reign of Koxinga, pirates, and the common people. At the beginning and end of each section, Lian gives his own analysis and interpretation on the topic, modeling the style used by Sima Qian on his Records of the Grand Historian. Lian used the General History of Taiwan as a way to interpret historical events and their importance in the formation of a national Taiwanese identity.
Death and Legacy.
After completion of the General History of Taiwan, Lian Heng continued to encourage Taiwanese nationalism through political activism, poetry, and journalism. Lian died in 1936 at fifty-eight years of age.
Lian's poems and historical works inspire in the Taiwanese a national sense of culture and spirit. His General History of Taiwan is to this day a remarkable view into the island's rich and diverse history. His poems and works were also later compiled into a collection in 1992 called the "Lien Ya-t'ang hsien-sheng ch'uan-chi".

USS City of South Haven (ID-2527)

USS "City of South Haven" (ID-2527) was a transport ship for the United States Navy at the close of World War I. Before the war, she was a passenger steamship that sailed as SS "City of South Haven" on the Great Lakes. In post-war civilian service she operated as SS "City of Miami" between Florida and Cuba before returning to the Great Lakes as SS "E.G. Crosby". She was scrapped in 1942 following a fire.
Construction.
SS "City of South Haven" was built in 1903 by Craig Shipbuilding of Toledo, Ohio for Dunkley-Williams and Company of South Haven, Michigan. She was sold to the Chicago and South Haven Steamship Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1906. "City of South Haven" operated commercially on the Great Lakes, primarily Lake Michigan, until early 1918.
World War I.
The United States Navy purchased SS "City of South Haven" on 19 April 1918 at Manistee, Michigan. She underwent a conversion into naval service at Kraft Shipyard and Dry Dock Company of Chicago, Illinois. USS "City of South Haven" was commissioned on 9 November 1918, two days before the Armistice that ended World War I. Commanded by Lieutenant Commander A. C. Wilvers of the United States Naval Reserve Force, she left Chicago on 29 November and arrived in Boston, Massachusetts on 13 December. Boston was to be her final stop for fitting en route to Europe and cross-channel transport. However, with the end of hostilities USS "City of South Haven" was no longer needed and placed on the sale list. She was sold to the Goodrich Transit Company of Chicago and struck from the Navy List on 27 September 1919. Her decommissioning took place on 3 December and she was latter delivered to her new owners.
Post-war service.
Following her brief stint in the Navy, SS "City of South Haven" would change names and ownership a number of times before finally returning to the Great Lakes. Goodrich Transit sold her in 1919 to J.G. Crosby of Chicago. J.G. Crosby in turn sold her to the Havana-American Steamship Company of Miami, Florida on 3 February 1920. Her name was then changed to SS "City of Miami" and she was resold on 21 May to A.O. Anderson and Company of Miami. During this period she would operate between Florida and Cuba. "City of Miami" returned to her former owners on 17 June 1920 when she was again sold to the Havana-American Steamship Company. The United States Marshals Service next sold her to the O'Brien Brothers Towing Company of Miami on 6 November 1922. Ten days later "City of Miami" was sold to the Havana Navigation Corporation of Miami. The following year she was sold to the Crosby Transportation Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and renamed SS "E. G. Crosby". This sale would return her to the Great Lakes. In 1924, she would be sold for the final time to the Wisconsin and Michigan Transportation Company of Milwaukee. She was laid up in 1931 and suffered massive fire damage in a boneyard at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin on 3 December 1935. As a result, she was scrapped in 1942.

Postville Raid

The Postville Raid was a raid at the Agriprocessors Inc. kosher slaughterhouse and meat packing plant in Postville, Iowa, USA, on May 12, 2008, executed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division of the Department of Homeland Security together with other agencies. The raid was the largest single raid of a workplace in U.S. history until that date, and resulted in nearly 400 arrests of immigrant workers with false identity papers who were charged with identity theft, document fraud, use of stolen social security numbers, and related offenses. Some 300 workers were convicted on document fraud charges within four days. The majority served a five-month prison sentence before being deported.
Several employees and lower and middle level managers were indicted on charges of conspiracy to harbor illegal immigrants, aggravated identity theft, and child labor violations among others and were convicted, serving prison sentences between 60 days and 41 months. Neither the owner, Aaron Rubashkin, nor his sons Sholom and Heshy Rubashkin, who were in charge of the management of Agriprocessors, were convicted of immigration and labor law violations. Financial irregularities brought to light by the raid and subsequent investigations led to a conviction of the plant's chief executive Sholom Rubashkin on bank fraud and related charges. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison, and his trial on immigration charges was canceled.
The raid.
With helicopters, buses and vans, hundreds of federal officials from the ICE together with agents and officers of other federal, state, and local agencies, raided the meat packing plant in the morning hours of 12 May 2008, seizing company records and arresting 389 individuals. According to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Iowa, those arrested included “290 Guatemalans, 93 Mexicans, 2 Israelis and 4 Ukrainians”. Eighteen were juveniles.
According to a retired federal agent, a raid on Agriprocessors expected to lead to the arrest of about 100 illegal workers mostly from Eastern Europe was planned in 2000, and canceled at the last moment over political concerns. The 2008 raid was planned for months. An affidavit the Homeland Security Department filed in court before the raid cited “...the issuance of 697 criminal complaints and arrest warrants against persons believed to be current employees,” and to have acted criminally. The affidavit cited unnamed sources who alleged that the company employed 15 year old children, that supervisors helped cash checks for workers with false documents, and pressured workers without documents to purchase vehicles and register them in other names. It also cited a case in which a supervisor blindfolded a Guatemalan worker and allegedly struck him with a meat hook, causing no serious injury. Sources quoted in the affidavit and application for search warrant also alleged the existence of a methamphetamine laboratory at the slaughterhouse, and that employees carried weapons to work. Later press reports do not indicate that a methamphetamine laboratory was found during the search. 
The arrested workers were taken to a nearby fairground, the National Cattle Congress in Waterloo, Iowa, where they were charged with aggravated identity theft, a criminal offense that carries a mandatory two years sentence, and briefed on their rights and options. The immigrant workers, most of them without prior criminal records, were offered a plea agreement in exchange for a guilty plea to lesser charges. 297 accepted the agreement and pleaded guilty to document fraud. In an expedited procedure known as “fast track”, hearings were scheduled over the course of the following three days, in which the judges took guilty pleas from the defendants, who were bound by handcuffs at the wrists as well as chains from their upper torso to their ankles, in groups of ten, and sentenced them immediately, five at a time. Most of the workers were sentenced to five months in prison and were deported afterwards. Before this raid, undocumented people who had no prior records were usually not criminally charged in the aftermath of a raid, and were instantly deported on civil immigration violations. Forty-one of those arrested were allowed to remain in the USA, being granted a special visa, known as U-visa, for those who suffered violent abuse.
In a decision issued on May 4, 2009 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal prosecutors have inappropriately used aggravated identity theft laws to prosecute undocumented workers. According to the ruling, a prosecutor must be able to show that immigrants knowingly used identification that actually belonged to another person, not merely that they were using fake documents, as in the case of the Postville detainees.
The Rubashkin family, ultra-Orthodox Jews of the Lubavitcher hasidic movement, who owned and operated Agriprocessors, has denied any knowledge of criminal activity. Aaron Rubashkin, the owner of the company said that he had no idea that his workers were illegal and that they had produced what appeared to be legitimate work documents. Getzel Rubashkin, one of his grandsons who worked at the plant, was reported as saying: “Obviously some of the people here were presenting false documents. Immigration authorities somehow picked it up and they did what they are supposed to do, they came and picked them up. God bless them for it.” 
According to the ICE, costs of the raid totaled $5,211,092 as of August 21, 2008, not including costs associated with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Department of Labor or local Postville authorities.
The majority of the arrested workers were Mayan indigenous peoples from Guatemala. Four of the workers were Ukrainian and 93 were Mexican.
Sexual Harassment Allegations.
The June 25, 2013 edition of the television documentary-news program "Frontline" ran a segment on sexual harassment of undocumented female workers employed in agricultural operations in the U.S. According to this documentary segment, undocumented female workers have continually been subjected to verbal and physical sexual harassment, up to and including forcible rape. This problem has reportedly been endemic for decades in agribusiness sectors which employ large numbers of seasonal workers. Supervisory personnel, usually themselves Hispanic as are the victims, rely on fear of both loss of employment and deportation as well as on ignorance of potential sources of help in order to take sexual advantage of unwilling undocumented female workers with impunity. Victims, seeing law enforcement personnel as the people who will arrest and deport them, do not tend to report these incidents. Some of the victims are only in their mid-teens. The documentary claimed that this sort of thing had been going on in a particularly vicious fashion at the Agriprocessors plant in Postville. When the plant was raided by ICE, there was apparently no organized effort by authorities to investigate such allegations. The documentary also pointed out that although there have been some limited successful civil lawsuits against employers for sexual harassment of employees by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there have as of yet been no criminal prosecutions of actual perpetrators. This lack of prosecution includes cases in which numerous different women have provided complaints, including for actual rape, against a specific supervisor.
Impact.
The raid had a significant impact on the Postville community. The town, with a census population of only 2,273, lost a large percentage of its population due to the arrests. As a result of the difficulties Agriprocessors faced after the raid, the plant stopped slaughtering cattle in October 2008, and filed for bankruptcy on November 5, 2008. The City Council declared Postville a humanitarian and economic disaster area, but federal officials said the town didn't qualify for help. Agriprocessors was bought at auction in July 2009 and has resumed production under the new name “Agri Star” on a lower scale. 
Several Agriprocessors employees and managers were indicted on charges of conspiracy to harbor illegal immigrants and were convicted, whereas related charges brought against the owner, Aaron Rubashkin, and his son and CEO of the company, Sholom Rubashkin, were dismissed. However, the financial irregularities that were brought to light by the raid and subsequent investigations led to a $35 million bank fraud charge against the plant's top manager Sholom Rubashkin, who was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison.
Indictments and convictions.
Guerrero-Espinoza and De La Rosa-Loera.
<onlyinclude>On July 3, 2008, Juan Carlos Guerrero-Espinoza, supervisor of the beef kill department and three other departments, and Martin De La Rosa-Loera, supervisor of the poultry kill department and three other departments, were arrested at the Agriprocessors plant. They were charged with aiding and abetting the possession and use of fraudulent identity documents, and encouraging aliens to illegally reside in the United States. Guerrero-Espinoza was also charged with aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft.
In late August 2008, Guerrero-Espinoza reached a deal with federal prosecutors and was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison. The plea deal allowed him to avoid deportation and for his wife and children to return to the US following his prison term. The sentence included a two-year mandatory ruling for aggravated identity theft.
After the ruling of the Supreme Court issued on May 4, 2009 ("Flores-Figueroa v. United States", 556 U.S. 2 ___ (2009) (Docket number 08-108, R055)), he made a request for the reduction of his sentence. Aggravated identity theft charges had formerly been dismissed against human resources employee Laura Althouse, supervisor Brent Beebe and CEO Sholom Rubashkin, the motion contended.
In late February 2009, De La Rosa-Loera was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison.
Both Guerrero-Espinoza and De La Rosa-Loera, after being released from jail, have gone back to work at the meatpacking plant under the new ownership.
Aaron Rubashkin, Sholom Rubashkin, Billmeyer, Althouse, and Freund.
In September 2008 Aaron Rubashkin, his son Sholom Rubashkin, as well as the company's human resources manager, Elizabeth Billmeyer, and two office employees, Laura Althouse and Karina Freund, were charged for child labor violations. State child labor charges against Aaron Rubashkin were dropped, and he was never charged federally.
In October 2008, Althouse pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens and one count of aggravated identity theft. She was sentenced to two years federal probation, Freund to one year of probation. Billmeyer was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release for harboring undocumented aliens and accepting counterfeit resident alien cards. After she agreed to plead guilty to state child labor charges under an agreement with the state, her sentence was reduced to eight months. Former human resources assistant Penny Hanson was sentenced to two years probation on January 7, 2010. State child law charges are still pending against former Agriprocessors supervisor Jeff Heasley, who had his case separated from the other defendants.
On October 30, 2008, Sholom Rubashkin was arrested and charged with conspiracy to harbor undocumented aliens for profit, aiding and abetting document fraud, and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft. He was released on conditions that he wear a GPS ankle bracelet, limit his travel to the Northern District of Iowa, surrender his passport and his wife′s passport, and provide a $1 million appearance bond with $500,000 to be secured. On November 14, 2008, he was arrested again on a charge of a $35 million bank fraud. 
Beebe.
On November 21, 2008, Sholom Rubashkin, Brent Beebe, one of two operations managers at the Agriprocessors plant, poultry managers Hosam Amara and Zeev Levi, and human resources employee Karina Freund were indicted with charges including conspiracy, harboring illegal aliens, aggravated identity theft, document fraud and bank fraud. Beebe pleaded guilty in January 2010 to conspiracy to commit document fraud as part of a plea agreement with the government. In the plea, Beebe admitted that he conspired with former vice president Sholom Rubashkin and others a week before the May 12, 2008 immigration raid at the plant to buy fake identification documents for 19 employees. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison on May 26, 2010. The charges against Freund were dismissed.
Meltzer.
On May 26, 2010, Mitch Meltzer, the plant′s former head accountant, was sentenced to 41 months in prison after his conviction on a federal conspiracy charge. In late September 2009, he admitted that he conspired with others to make false statements to a bank and that he signed false financial records that were used to mislead the banks. In addition to the prison term, Meltzer was ordered to pay $26.9 million in restitution. Meltzer had been hired by the meat plant′s new owner after having been dismissed by Agriprocessors′ government-appointed trustee, and remained at the company for several months after he pleaded guilty to financial fraud.
Amara and Levi.
Amara and Levi fled the USA. Amara was arrested in Israel on March 31, 2011. After unsuccessful appeals to avoid extradition from Israel, Amara was returned to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for trial on May 3, 2013. He pleaded not guilty. He faced 25 counts related to harboring workers who were in the country illegally and two counts related to document fraud for conspiring to provide false immigration papers. His trial was set for July 1, 2013, but delayed until August 19 by U.S. Magistrate Jon Scoles. On August 29, 2013, Amara signed a plea deal, admitting that he "conspired with Agriprocessors CEO Sholom Rubashkin and other executives for at least five years before the raid to harbor immigrants 'knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact' they had come to the U.S. illegally." He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to harbor undocumented immigrants for profit, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, though federal sentencing guidelines will likely call for a shorter term. The other counts in the indictment will be dismissed.
Levi, who supposedly fled to Naharia, Israel, has not been found by authorities to date, and is currently on Homeland Security's "Most Wanted" list. 
Sholom Rubashkin.
On November 12, 2009, Sholom Rubashkin was convicted in federal court on 86 charges of financial fraud, including bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and money laundering. On June 22, 2010, he was sentenced to serve 27 years in prison and to make $27 million in restitution.
On November 23, 2009, Sholom Rubashkin′s second federal trial on 72 immigration charges was canceled. After winning the financial fraud conviction, federal prosecutors dismissed all immigration-related charges against him. In its motion to dismiss, the U.S. Attorneys Office said any conviction on the immigration charges would have no impact upon his sentence, writing, "dismissal will avoid an extended and expensive trial, conserve limited resources, and lessen the inconvenience to witnesses." Without that trial, it is unlikely that much of the immigration-related evidence gathered at the Agriprocessors site following the raid, or much of the key witness testimony, will ever be publicly revealed.
On June 7, 2010, Sholom Rubashkin was acquitted in state court of knowingly hiring 29 underage workers at the plant. 
Garcia.
On June 30, 2010, Alvaro Julian Garcia Jr., aged 73, was sentenced to 60 days in jail followed by two years of supervised release, for having registered vehicles that were sold to undocumented workers in Postville between 2004 and 2006 as part of a vehicle title scheme.</onlyinclude>
Reactions.
The raid has received wide national publicity. Lawmakers and labor union representatives criticized the Bush administration as disproportionately targeting workers instead of employers. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Agriprocessors′ workers and community leaders in Postville, and Congressional hearings were held before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, which split largely across party lines in its reaction to the events of the raid. Jewish organizations, reacting to the raid as well as to earlier criticism of Agriprocessors′ labor practices and slaughter methods, addressed questions of Jewish ethics, stressing the importance of the commandments (Hebrew: mitzvot) concerning the relationship between human beings (Hebrew: mitzvot ben adam l'havero), alongside those between human beings and God (Hebrew: mitzvot ben adam l'makom).
On the day of the raid, up to 200 protesters had gathered at National Cattle Congress in Waterloo and later held a vigil outside its gates on behalf of the detainees. On July 27, 2008, a rally organized by St. Bridget′s Catholic Church in Postville, Jewish Community Action of Saint Paul, Minnesota, and the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs of Chicago was held in Postville to protest working conditions in the plant, and to call for Congressional legislation to give legal status to illegal immigrants. About 1,000 people, including Catholic clergy members, rabbis and Jewish activists, and Hispanic immigrants held an interfaith service at St. Bridget′s Catholic Church, and marched through the center of town to the entrance of the meatpacking plant. 
The first anniversary of the raid was marked by a prayer vigil followed by a procession to the National Cattle Congress grounds on May 11, 2009 in Waterloo, on May 12, a prayer service and vigil at St. Bridget′s Catholic Church, followed by a procession to Agriprocessors, took place in Postville. Both events were attended by representatives of Christian and Jewish faiths, who demonstrated their solidarity and spoke out for immigration reform. Prayer vigils were also held on the second anniversary of the raid in Waterloo and Postville. 
In “response to the humanitarian and economic disaster” created by the raid, the “Postville Response Coalition”, composed of community organizations, the faith community, and city and county government officials, was founded in November 2008 to help individuals and families. It was dissolved on March 31, 2010, after the meatpacking plant had reopened under new ownership and the community began to recover from the raid and the subsequent closure of the plant. A new organization called “Postville First” was created through the impetus of the “Postville Response Coalition”.
Reactions of political figures.
Zoe Lofgren, Democratic member of the House of Representatives who chairs the House Judiciary Committee′s immigration panel, criticized the raid for the treatment of the workers during the raid itself, for subsequent “coercion” of guilty pleas, and for targeting workers rather than employers. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has criticized the three-day series of court hearings in the aftermath of the raid, and has published a copy of a “script” that attorneys were given to use in discussing possible plea agreements with their clients. Officials from the office of United States Attorney Matt Dummermuth, whose staff assisted in the preparation of the documents used in the hearings, have defended the proceedings. Bob Teig, a spokesman for Dummermuth′s office, noted that the scripts were used only to ensure that the individuals being charged with crimes “...were fully advised of their rights and fully understood the consequences of their decisions to plead guilty.”
Also, the raid and prosecutions took place while investigations of the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the Department of Labor (DOL) for possible violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act against Agriprocessors were underway. Concern was voiced, that the ICE raid may have had an impact on the ability of the Department of Labor to conduct its investigation of the workplace, and that workers able to assist in the investigation or victims of possible violations may have been among those arrested. According to Democratic Representative from Iowa Bruce Braley, ICE claimed to have “fully coordinated its activities with other Federal agencies, including the Department of Labor prior to the May 12 operation at the Agriprocessors facility”, whereas the Department of Labor stated in a letter of July 3, that, “‘the raid occurred without the prior knowledge or participation of the Wage and Hour Division’ and that, ‘no advance notice was given to WHD or any other Department of Labor agency prior to the raid’. In addition, the DOL letter states that the May 12 enforcement action ‘changes the complexion of WHD’s investigation of Agriprocessors.’”
Iowa Governor Chet Culver criticised Agriprocessors in a guest editorial on August 24, 2008, comparing it to Upton Sinclair′s 1906 novel "The Jungle": “Alarming information about working conditions at the Postville plant ... brought to national attention by the raid forces me to believe that, in contrast to our state’s overall economic-development strategy, this company’s owners have deliberately chosen to take the low road in its business practices.” One day later, then presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke out against Agriprocessors' managers, without mentioning Agriprocessors by name though, while campaigning in Iowa. During Obama′s first year as president, raids on workplaces have been reduced, but deportations of illegal immigrants have increased by nearly 10 percent from the last year of the Bush presidency.
Reactions of Jewish organizations.
Several Jewish organizations had voiced concern about Agriprocessors′ meat products meeting ethical standards of kashrut ever since the first criticisms of its slaughtering methods and working conditions were made public, the former by the animal rights organization PETA, brought to the attention of the general public by the "New York Times", in November 2004, and the latter by the Jewish newspaper "The Forward" in 2006. As a result of it, an ethical certification for kosher products, Heksher Tzedek (English: ethical certification), introduced by Rabbi Morris Allen, was endorsed in 2007 by the Rabbinical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis.
After the raid, Modern Orthodox rabbis met in Los Angeles on May 18, 2008 to discuss creating a heksher (English: kosher certification) for ethical issues.
The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the Rabbinical Assembly on May 22, 2008 issued a statement, requesting “that consumers of kosher meat evaluate whether it is appropriate to buy and eat meat products produced by the Rubashkin’s label”, adding that “the allegations about the terrible treatment of workers employed by Rubashkin’s have shocked and appalled members of the Conservative movement as well as all people of conscience. As kashrut seeks to diminish animal suffering and offer a humane method of slaughter, it is bitterly ironic that a plant producing kosher meat be guilty of inflicting any kind of human suffering.” On May 23, 2008, the Jewish Labor Committee went further and “urged consumers of kosher meat products to seek alternatives to the Rubashkin labels” until Agriprocessors lives up “to the responsibilities of corporate citizenship, ends its campaign of worker abuse, and respects the rights of its employees including their legal right to union representation.” The liberal orthodox Jewish organisation Uri L'Tzedek, (English: awaken to justice), founded in 2007, called for a boycott of Agriprocessors′ products, which it lifted six weeks later, after Agriprocessors had appointed a former U.S. attorney as compliance officer and had promised changes in their treatment of workers, even though the management had not been replaced, contrary to the announcement made by the plant′s owner immediately after the raid. In September 2008, when the first criminal charges had been brought against Agriprocessors′ owner and managers, the Orthodox Union, the leading kosher certifier in the United States, threatened to withdraw its certification from the products of Agriprocessors, unless the company puts a new management in place,
Ultra-Orthodox organizations did not take part in the discussion over ethical issues raised by the raid. After Sholom Rubashkin′s arrest, Orthodox rabbis showed their solidarity, but, according to the "Forward", “most of the [ultra-]Orthodox rabbis who are supporting Rubashkin ... had never considered providing support to the immigrant workers. But Rabbi Shea Hecht, a Chabad rabbi ... said he wished he had done more in the raid′s immediate aftermath.”

Sky Academy

Sky Academy is the title given to guitar innovator Uli Jon Roth's tuition seminars and concerts. 
Sky Academy was first established in May 2006, at the Ralph Freud Theater at the University Campus of Los Angeles.
Uli teaches a holistic approach to music making, which comprises lectures, master classes, concentration exercises and special concerts. The teaching emphasis is on awakening and strengthening the students' musical potential and on showing ways of how to connect more deeply with music. This is achieved largely through heightening the general musical awareness level and also by broadening the overall musical and artistic horizon of the students. Uli is seen as an inspired teacher who mainly teaches by opening up new vistas of inspiration. His teaching approach encourages the creative, artistic aspects of music making, and even embraces metaphysical subjects such as inspiration, but at the same time it doesn't neglect the importance of craftsmanship.
Guest teachers or speakers are another important part of Sky Academy.
Usually they tend to share the stage with Roth while he interviews them. 
So far these have included: Anrew Shulman (Principal Cellist Los Angeles Philharmonic, LA Chamber Orchestra & Conductor) - subjects: Cello, stringed instruments, conducting orchestras 
Robby Krieger (The Doors) Subject: song-writing & Q&A 
Bruce Dukhov (concert master of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra)- subject: Violin playing, Bach Partita
Ben Woods (Flametal) - Flamenco guitar and dance 
Further guest speakers have been Michael-Angelo Batio, Joe Stump, Vernon Reid, Gilby Clarke, Leon Hendrix. 
Sky Academy 2006 included three extensive concerts which took place during the course of the 5-day seminar. They were designed to invoke the spirit of musical freedom and featured many special guests, apart from Uli's band.
Stage guests included Warren De Martini, Don Dokken, Tony Franklin, Rob Pagliari, Chris Poland, Kofi Baker, Chris Impellitteri, Jeff Scott Soto, Francis Buchholz and Robby Krieger. 
In August 2007 Uli held a further 2 Sky Academy concerts and seminar at the Hollywood MI with Paul Gilbert, Michael Angelo Batio, Ule Ritgen, George Bellas, Roy Z, Robby Krieger, Mark Boals and Johnny Hiland. 
The first international Sky Academy was in July 2008, as part of the G-TARanaki Guitar Festival in New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand. A different format to the US Sky Academy saw Uli giving three workshops at regional high schools in Waitara, Inglewood and Opunake with guests Gilby Clarke and Vernon Reid. Uli then headlined the TSB Stadium with his Sky Of Avalon band featuring a guesting Alex Skolnick.
A third Sky Academy US seminar was held again in Los Angeles in September 2008, followed by Sky Academy Arizona and Nordenham (Germany). Guests at the concerts included Doug Aldrich and Chris Caffery.

Guillem de Balaun

Guillem or Guilhem de Balaun (fl. bef. 1223) was the castellan of Balazuc and a troubadour from the region around Montpellier. In his "vida", which has the characteristics of a "razo" because it sets the background for the song "Lo vers mou mercejan vas vos", he is described as "learned" ("adretz"). 
"Vida".
His "vida" is long and detailed, narrating the Guillem's love story. Guillem fell in love with Guilhelma, wife of Peire, lord of Jaujac (Javiac). He sang and talked for her and she said and did all that would please him. Guillem's friend, the troubadour Peire de Barjac, also loved a lady of Jaujac, Vierneta (or Uiernetta), probably the historical Vierna d'Anduza, wife of Raimon I of Gauges. He served her as a knight and she gave him all the love he wanted. Eventually Vierneta dismissed him on bad terms. He wandered about in a doleful with Guillem consoling him and promising to reconcil him to Vierneta when he next returned to see Guilhelma. After a long time he returned, did reconcile Peire and Vierneta, and gave Peire more joy than he had felt even when he first won his lady. 
In order to test whether or not the joy of recovering a lady was greater than that of winning her, Guillem acted as though he were very angry with her. He ceased to discuss her or hear her discussed, to send her messages, or to visit her region. She sent him pleading messengers and letters of love, but he refused to receive them, "foolishly" in the eyes of his biographer. On hearing this, Guilhelma was saddened and sent messengers to determine in what way she could make amends. Guillem did not receive the messengers kindly and sent them back with word that her fault was unpardonable. At this she stopped sending him messages and fell into deep sadness; Guillem began to doubt the wisdom of his test. So he travelled to Jaujac by horse, on pretense of a pilgrimage, and stayed in a burgher's house. At night he was visited by Guilhelma and her lady-in-waiting, but when Guilhelma tried to kiss him he beat her until she fled the house. At this she resolved never to see him again. 
Guillem then repented of his stupidity and went to the castle asking for a pardon so that he could explain why he had been so foolish, but Guilhelma rather had him thrown out. For the next year she refused to see him or hear about him, and he composed her a song begging forgiveness. He had the poem brought to her by "Bernart d'Anduza" (Bernard VII of Anduze, died 1223), an honoured baron of the region and a mutual friend. Bernard begged her to pardon him and to take revenge on him and she relented. She agreed to pardon him if he would pull out the fingernail of his longest finger and bring it to her.

Tourism in Gabon

Gabon's tourist industry is underdeveloped. Despite this, attractions include beaches, ocean and inland fishing facilities, the falls on the Ogooué River, and the Crystal Mountains. Tourists also come to see the famous hospital founded by Dr. Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné. Hunting is legal in specific areas from December to September.
History.
Until recently, tourism has been neglected, replaced by the export of raw materials such as oil and wood. In 2000, however, the Gabonese government worked on developing the sector by developing luxury and niche tourism, such as bush expeditions or safari trips. The previous December, a postgraduate certificate in tourism was launched at the University of Libreville. The only thing that stops Gabon from success is corruption. The Guardian Book of Statistics rates Gabon as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. 
On September 4, 2002, Gabonese president Omar Bongo announced that his country would set aside 10 percent of its land for a national park system. Previously, it had no organization of national parks, working with The Wildlife Conservation Society on conservation issues. Currently, the system comprises over , surpassed only by Costa Rica in the percentage on land area, though in the latter's case the area of conservation is much smaller. These new parks are being developed for ecotourism, as an economic alternative to exploiting Gabon’s forests for lumber. The project was applauded by Dr. Steven Sanderson, president and CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, as "one of the most courageous conservation acts in the last 20 years."
Attractions.
National parks.
Gabon's 13 national parks range from regions along its coastline, where hippopotamuses play on untouched beaches, to forest clearings home to "naive" gorillas.
Statistics.
In 2000, there were about 2,450 hotel rooms. Roughly 155,000 tourists arrived that year, and tourism receipts totaled about $7 million. The year before, 120,000 foreigners arrived, with only 1 percent coming for tourism, and it accounted for between one and three percent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). A visitor is required to have a passport and visa, except if they are from France, Germany, or several African countries. They are also to provide evidence of yellow fever vaccination. The US Department of State estimated the average daily cost of staying in Gabon's capital of Libreville at $182 per day as of 2002, with expenses elsewhere in the country as low as $70 per day.

It was designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #336 on January 1, 1988.
Designed by S. Charles Lee, and built by Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, the building opened on December 8, 1928. 
The building was the first location of Motion Picture Association of America, Central Casting, the Hays Office, and The Ben Hecht Company. Hollywood Billiards, Hollywood's oldest pool hall, was located in the lower basement of the building. Over the years its tenants have also included Toppy's (a corner coffee shop), Newman Drug Co., Rexall, Bargain Saver, Hollywood Rehearsal Studios, Studio 9, Rock City Arcade, and Cosmopolitan Book Depository.
By the 1970s, the building was being used to produce pornography and was slowly converted in individual rehearsal studios as the area where the building was located became increasingly crime-ridden and dangerous. The building was used in "Double Indemnity", "Ruthless People", and "Hollywood Shuffle" and was a regular shooting location for numerous TV productions. It was also used as a rehearsal studio for such bands as Guns N' Roses and White Zombie. 
The building was heavily damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake and was vacant for several years. It has since been renovated, and its tenants as of 2013 included the local offices of Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell.
