Vilhelm Lundstrøm

Vilhelm Lundstrøm (1893, Copenhagen – 1950) was one of Denmark's most successful modernist painters. It was he who introduced French cubism to Denmark.
He was educated at the Royal Danish Academy of Art where he studied under Rostrup Böyesen.
Lundstrøm spent an extended period in France in the 1920s where he was influenced by Braque, Picasso and Cézanne. 
He is remembered for his geometric still lifes with oranges, his cubistic scenes with nudes and his paintings of bottles, flasks and jugs. His style was characterised by clear, bright lines and few colours.
In his later years, Lundstrøm adapted his style to looser modern art with contrasts in colors and form.

Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony

Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony, Duke of Saxony () (9 December 1896, Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony – 14 June 1971, Neckarhausen, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany) was a member of the Saxon Royal Family. Ernst Heinrich was the youngest son of the last Saxon monarch Frederick Augustus III and his wife Archduchess Luise of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. From 1923 through 1945 Ernst Heinrich was Administrative Chief of the association „"House of Wettin – Albertinische Linie e.V.“".
Life.
Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony spent his childhood in Dresden, Pillnitz, and Moritzburg under the parenting of his father. The loss of his mother, who left the family permanently in 1902, affected his father and siblings very deeply, according to their own statements. Ernst Heinrich, who was only six at the time, was possibly the child who felt this loss most.
World War I.
When World War I broke out, Ernest Heinrich was First lieutenant in the 1st Royal Saxon Leib-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 100. In September 1914 as, he became Batman in the General Kommando of XIX (2nd Royal Saxon) Corps at Reims and Lille. He did his Abitur during a four-month leave in 1916, then took part in the Battle of the Somme as a member of the staff of the 24th Reserve Division. On 30 August 1916, Ernst Heinrich received the Military Order of St. Henry for merit.
In the spring of 1917 he took over the leadership of the 9th Company of Reserve-Infantry Regiment No. 104 in Berezhany (in eastern Galicia). He was in the hospital for two months in 1917, after which he commanded the 9th Battery of Artillery Regiment No. 115 in the area around Ypres.
Beginning in May 1918, he led the 1st Squadron of Mounted Guard Regiments in Stary Bychow at Dnieper in Russia, and in August of the same year, he was in charge of the Saxon troops in Dorpat, Reval and Finland. In November and December 1918, Ernst Heinrich oversaw the return of Saxon troops to Germany.
1920s.
In 1919 and 1920, Ernst Heinrich learned to administer a manor in Silesia. During the Kapp Putsch in March 1920, he acted as a liaison between the putschists in Berlin and the Reichswehr in Wrocław. After the failure of the putsch, he moved to Munich, where he joined the circle around the former Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria. He married on 12 April 1921 in the Nymphenburg Palace to Sophie (14 February 1902 – 24 May 1941), a sister of Grand Duchess Charlotte or Luxembourg. This was considered a happy marriage; they had three sons.
Ernst Heinrich did not particilate in the Beer Hall Putsch on 8 and 9 November 1923 in Munich. He rejected the Nazi ideology consistently and distanced himself from Hitler and Ludendorff. At his father's request, he took over the function of head of the administratieon of the association "House of Wettin — Albertinische Linie e.V." His father also gave him power of attorney to negotiate with the Free State of Saxony about the future use of the manors owned by the Wettin family and their art collection. On 25 June 1925, a treaty was signed between the Free State and its former ruling dynasty, regulating the relation between the House of Wettin and the Free State, within the context of the law on the subject of 9 July 1924.
In subsequent years, Ernst Heinrich, who was an avid art lover, made several trips to Egypt with his wife and children. In 1928/29, he was approached by Gustav Stresemann of the DVP (the German People's Party), who wanted Ernst Heinrich to stand as a candidate for the federal presidency. Ernst Heinrich conisidered this a hopeless undertaking and declined.
Nazi era.
Ernst Heinrich opposed the Nazis after they formed a government on 30 January 1933. However, he failed to read the political situation correctly. He believed that Hitler could be stopped by the conservative political opposition and in the spring of 1933, he joined the Stahlhelm, hoping he could escape the influence of the Nazis. On 1 July 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives, he was arrested. He was interned in the concentration camp in Hohnstein for five days.
After his release, Ernst Heinrich retired to Moritzburg Castle in Saxony. He was an avid hunter and had to keep in touch with Nazi leaders such as Hermann Göring, who, as Master of the Hunt, was interested in the forests owned by the Wettins, and Martin Mutschmann, the Nazi governor of Saxony. In 1938, he received King Carol II of Romania in his castle, and in 1939 he had extensive political discussions with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who had been mayor of Leipzig and was later active in the German resistance. A few weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Ernst Heinrich was drafted into the Abwehr group IV in Dresden.
In 1943, he openly expressed doubts that the death of his brother Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony had been an accident. The Gestapo then arrested and questioned him. However, there were no further personal consequences, as the Nazis were still reluctant to confront a member of a former royal family.
Ernst Heinrich was an admirer of the art of Käthe Kollwitz. After she lost her home when Berlin was bombed in 1943, he invited her to move to Moritzburg, where she lived and worked at the "Rudenhof" in the immediate vicinity of the castle, until she died in April 1945.
In February 1945, nearby Dresden was bombed. In March 1945, Ernst Heinrich fled to Sigmaringen to escape the advancing Red Army. Before he left, Ernst Heinrich and his sons buried most of their valuables in 40 crates in the Königswald forest. Most of this treasure was found by the Red Army and carried off to the Soviet Union. However, three crates full of treasure were rediscovered in 1995.
After the war.
In 1947, Ernst Heinrich married the actress Virginia Dulon (1910–2002), who styled herself "Princess Virginia of Saxony" after her marriage. Later that year, he purchased the Coolamber estate in Lismacaffrey, County Westmeath in Ireland and moved there with his second wife and his sons from his first marriage. After some initial difficulties, he became a successful farmer and learned to appreciate his new home and its people and culture.
He died in Neckarhausen while visiting Germany in 1971. After 1945, he never saw his native Saxony again.
Marriages and issue.
Ernst Heinrich was first married to Princess Sophie of Luxembourg, sixth and youngest daughter of William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and his wife Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, on 12 April 1921 at Schloss Hohenburg. Ernst Heinrich and Sophie had three sons:
Sophie died on 24 May 1941 in Munich of pneumonia. Following her death, Ernst Heinrich married morganatically Virginia Dulon on 28 June 1947 in Paris. This marriage was without issue.

Erik S. Kristensen

Erik S. Kristensen (March 15, 1972 – June 28, 2005) was a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy SEALs who was killed in action during Operation Red Wings. He and several other SEALs set off as part of a search and rescue mission, hoping to assist a four man SEAL team that was engaged in a firefight with Taliban fighters.
Biography.
Kristensen was born into a military family. His father, Edward Kristensen, is a career officer in the United States Navy who rose to the rank of Rear Admiral. As his father was in the military, Erik traveled widely with his family as a child, living in such places as Japan, Guam and Washington, D.C., among others.
Erik Kristensen graduated from Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C. in 1990, and continued his education at Phillips Academy (Andover, Massachusetts) before moving on to the United States Naval Academy where he majored in English. After graduation in 1995, he was commissioned an Ensign and served in the engineering department of the USS "Chandler" in Everett, Washington. He attended the Graduate Institute at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, while he taught English at the U.S. Naval Academy. He left both his graduate studies and teaching at the Academy to pursue Navy SEAL training. At age 27, he was the oldest in his class to graduate from the program, and his dream of becoming a Navy SEAL was realized.
Operation Red Wings.
On June 28, 2005, SEAL Team 10 was assigned to a mission to kill or capture Ahmad Shah (nom de guerre Mohammad Ismail), a high-ranking Taliban leader responsible for Taliban operations in eastern Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush mountains.
The SEAL team was made up of Matthew Axelson, Danny Dietz, 
Marcus Luttrell, and Michael P. Murphy. Luttrell and Axelson were the team's snipers; Dietz was the communications officer and Murphy the team leader. The four SEALs stumbled upon local Taliban forces and within an hour, they were engaged in an intense gun battle against a force of more than 150 enemy fighters. Murphy risked his life to get off an emergency message to his command. Of the four-man team, only Luttrell would survive.
Upon hearing the cry for help a MH-47 Chinook helicopter was dispatched with a force consisting of SEALs including Kristensen and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment "Nightstalkers" to rescue the team, but the helicopter was shot down by an RPG; all 16 men on board the Chinook including Kristensen were killed. The battle was later called "the worst single day loss of life for Naval Special Warfare personnel since World War II." In interviews, the Taliban leader Ahmad Shah maintained that his forces had set a trap for the American forces: "We certainly know that when the American army comes under pressure and they get hit, they will try to help their friends. It is the law of the battlefield."
Posthumous.
Days after Kristensen's death was announced, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger released a statement stating his deepest condolences to his family and friends and announcing that flags at the California State Capitol would be flown at half-staff in his honor.
Kristensen's funeral mass (Mass of Christian Burial) was performed on July 19, 2005. His mother told the press her son would be buried in his Birkenstock sandals. He is interred at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery.
Erik Kristensen Eye Street Klassic.
A charity, the LCDR Erik S. Kristensen '90, USN, Memorial Scholarship Fund, was created in Kristensen's honor after his death. The fund seeks to assist a Gonzaga College High School student whose family serves in the U.S. armed forces. The Erik Kristensen Eye Street Klassic is held annually to raise money for the scholarship fund.
In media.
In the 2013 film "Lone Survivor", Kristensen is portrayed by actor Eric Bana.

Lentera Timur is the thirteenth studio album by Malaysian pop singer-songwriter Dato' Siti Nurhaliza which is released on December 26, 2008, just four years after 2004 Asian Tsunami. It is the most anticipated album since her last traditional album, "Sanggar Mustika", which was released in 2002. The album is set to sell more than 100,000 copies.
Background.
"Lentera Timur" contains eleven songs using composers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The production of the album has started since 2006, but due to lacking in materials the album has since been put on hold. With the help of MACP, Siti gathered enough materials from composers like Pak Ngah, M. Nasir, Adnan Abu Hassan, just to name a few, to produce a traditional contemporary album, "Lentera Timur".
Track listing.
The album was previously rumoured to contain twelve or more songs. When the album was released, however, one song composed by Radhi (OAG), Langit Masih Cerah didn't make it to the final cut. Aidit Alfian also confirmed his track didn't make to the final cut.

The film's official trailer was released on November 6, 2010. It was released both in theaters and video-on-demand on May 6, 2011 in the United States. The movie centers around Joanna (Keira Knightley) and Michael Reed (Sam Worthington), a successful and happy couple. They are moving along in their lives together until Joanna meets Laura (Eva Mendes), the stunningly beautiful work colleague whom Michael never mentioned. While Michael is away with Laura on a business trip, Joanna runs into an old but never quite forgotten love, Alex (Guillaume Canet). As the night progresses and temptation increases, each must confront who they really are.
Plot.
Joanna is a writer who is married to Michael, a commercial real estate agent. They live in New York. The film begins with Joanna and Michael attending a party with Michael's colleagues. Joanna notices Michael spending most of his time chatting with the beautiful Laura, one of his colleagues, whom he has never mentioned to her before. She suspects him of having an affair and confronts him when they return home. They argue but reconcile later in the night. 
Michael leaves for Philadelphia the next morning with associates Laura and Andy for a business trip. Joanna goes out for coffee and bumps into Alex, an old love. They meet later that day for a drink, eventually ending up having dinner with Sandra and Truman, friends of Alex. In the conversations while having dinner, the film then reveals the history behind Joanna and Alex and the nature of her relationship with Michael. Joanna met Alex four years ago in Paris while she was working on a story. She has never told Michael about Alex.
Joanna and Alex return to friend Andy's apartment, where they discuss their previous romance. It is revealed that they were together during the period Joanna and Michael briefly broke off their relationship. Joanna then goes out to walk Andy's dog Lucy; Alex forgets the keys when he comes down to greet her, and they are locked outside. They then go to a party where Sandra and Truman are at, with the dog. There, they grow even closer and passionately kiss in the elevator. They return to Alex's hotel room after the party. Joanna refuses to have sex with Alex. Instead, they spend the night together embracing in bed.
Joanna and Alex's night together are interspersed with scenes of Michael and Laura on their business trip. After dinner with their client, Laura invites Michael out for more drinks, which he accepts. Their conversations at the hotel bar reveal that Michael has never cheated on his wife. They then proceed to the hotel pool, where they swim in their underwear. They continue to talk about infidelity, which further tempts Michael. They return to her room and have sex.
The next morning, Michael tries to speak to Laura about what had happened but is unable to. He also discovers a note written by Joanna slipped into his clothes where she confirmed her confidence in his honesty. Fraught with guilt, he leaves Philadelphia early, leaving Laura and Andy alone for the presentation to their clients. Joanna and Alex have a passionate farewell. Alex leaves New York broken-hearted. 
Michael comes home early to find Joanna in tears. They make plans for the day, trying to resume their normal lives. They embrace, and Michael tells Joanna he loves her and notices Joanna's shoes left over there that were worn the night before. Joanna is puzzled by this sudden show of affection coupled with Michael's early return. Michael then notices that Joanna is wearing her best underwear, which she had not removed after last night. As Joanna prepares to speak, the film cuts to black.
Production.
The film was shot during late 2008 in New York, with large portions filmed in SoHo, Manhattan.
Reception.
The film currently holds a 50% rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes out of 56 reviews, with the consensus being: ""Last Night" doesn't opt for easy answers, but the framework and characters overall are too slight and plain to be compelling."
"The Guardian" has given the film three stars out of five. Peter Bradshaw wrote: "This is a talky film, and arguably a little exasperating, but it is targeted at grownups, and addresses the grown-up issue of monogamy: is this institution a natural state which lovers should strive for, or a wholly artificial state created to protect us from the pain and loss that must always follow from acting on our desires? Not a perfect film, but an interesting one."

Reception.
Critical response.
The song has received mixed to positive response from critics and fans. Newsroom gave the song 4 out of 5 stars and wrote "30 Days is sure to fill the dance floor with its echoing beats. The chorus makes you want to throw your arms up and there's a brilliant drum fill after each verse which one music journalist said sounds like "A potato being thrown in a bin". The vocals are shared evenly between the girls and sound moody, although they've been edited a bit too much and some emotion and personality has gone. It's a shame because we know all the girls are great vocalists". Steroboard.com agreed writing "this track would have been perfect for the ‘On Your Radar’ album as it carries on the same dance feel the album had. ’30 Days’ is a very catchy track and has a very chart-friendly and club feel to it. It certainly seems that The Saturdays are trying to break away from the clean cut pop image that they burst onto the scene with; however I think the new dance sound with a touch of pop sound suits them". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated the single 4 out of 5 stars, writing a positive review about its "blend of plinky synths", "rumbling electro beats" and "addictive chorus" which is "cooler than a blast of Listerine."

These Thousand Hills

These Thousand Hills is a 1959 Western film starring Patricia Owens, Alfred Hayes and Richard Egan, and based on the novel of the same name by A. B. Guthrie Jr.. It was directed by Richard Fleischer.
The movie stars Don Murray as Lat Evans, a sheltered rancher brought up under the stern gaze of his Bible-thumping father. Lat heads off into the world intent upon making his fortune, and befriends Tom (Stuart Whitman) on the cattle-herding trail. Eventually his friendship with Tom is tested in the fire of his craving for wealth and respectability, and he spurns the devoted love of Callie, a dancehall girl (Lee Remick) from whom he borrows money to buy a ranch, in favor of a conservative society woman, Joyce (Patricia Owens). Ultimately, Lat is faced with a choice between his ambitions and his loyalty to his old friends.
Plot.
Albert Gallatin "Lat" Evans (Don Murray), an earnest young cowboy determined to better his situation, wins a job with a cattle drive by busting a wild horse. Befriended by cowhand Tom Ping (Stuart Whitman}, Lat fantasizes about owning his own ranch and being rich one day, unlike his father, who died "broke, a failure." When the drive reaches a small Wyoming town, the cowboys congregate at the saloon, where Jehu (Richard Egan), an unscrupulous rancher, proposes racing one of their horses against his swift steed. Lat accepts the challenge, and is in the lead when his opponent throws a blanket at his face, causing Lat to lose his balance and fall from his horse. Marshal Conrad (Albert Dekker), the town's upstanding banker, intervenes, however, and declares Lat the winner. 
That night, Tom and Lat celebrate with saloon girls Jen (Jean Willes) and Callie (Lee Remick). With their winnings, they decide to leave the cattle drive and hunt wolves for their hides. After bidding his cowhand friends goodbye, Lat, feeling melancholy, gets drunk and visits Callie. When Lat recalls a traumatic incident from his childhood in which his father beat him for being alone with a girl in the woodshed, Callie feels empathy. 
Restless and impatient to become successful, Lat asks Conrad for a loan to buy a ranch. After Conrad turns him down, Callie gives Lat her life savings to buy a piece of land, which he then uses as collateral for a loan from Conrad to purchase a herd of cattle. Lat makes Tom a partner in the venture, and after a hard winter, Lat prospers while the other ranchers falter, since he grew hay in the low lands to feed hay to the cattle in the winter. 
As his fortunes improve, Lat begins to shun Callie for Conrad's niece Joyce (Patricia Owens). When Tom tells Lat that he plans to marry Jen, Lat questions his decision and calls Jen a tramp, causing Tom to angrily renounce their partnership.
One night, while Lat is dining at Conrad's, the banker proposes that he enter politics by running for the school board. Meanwhile, Callie, who has baked a cake for Lat, anxiously awaits his arrival, and when Jehu appears instead, she fights off his crude advances. After dinner, Joyce invites Lat to call on her if he is reputable. Lat goes to Callie's house and informs her that there is no place in his life for her. Soon after, Lat and Joyce are married and start a family. Jehu and Callie become lovers.
When Lat decides to run for U.S. Senator, he is visited by Jehu and rancher Frank Chanault (Tom Greenway), who use the promise of their votes to coerce him into joining a group of rancher vigilantes on the trail of some horse thieves. The ranchers corner the thieves at their mountain hideout, and after a gun battle, the two surviving rustlers surrender, and Lat is shocked to discover that Tom is one of them. After Tom confesses, he accuses Lat of worshiping the tin god of money. Jehu sentences Tom to hang, and when Lat protests that he be allowed to stand trial, Jehu knocks him unconscious and then hangs Tom. 
Riddled with remorse, Lat returns home and Joyce hands him a distress note from Callie. Although Joyce jealousy forbids Lat to see Callie, Lat contends that he owes her a debt and proceeds to her house. There, Lat learns from her servant Happy (Ken Renard) that Jehu has savagely beaten Callie. Outraged, Lat goes in search of Jehu. After finding Jehu at the saloon, the two begin to fight and their brawl spills onto the street as the townsfolk watch in consternation. Pulling a rifle from a saddle, Jehu aims it at Lat just as a gunshot fired by Callie rings out, killing Jehu. Later, at home, Joyce forgives Lat, and when he informs her that he intends to testify at Callie's trial, she graciously gives her consent.
Reception.
New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther was critical: "Under Richard Fleischer's direction, (cast members) dutifully lend their hands to this prettily garbed and scenic sermon, in which no one in Hollywood could deeply believe."

St. Blasius Church, Shanklin

St. Blasius Church, Shanklin is a parish church in the Church of England located in Shanklin, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church is medieval but was largely rebuilt in 1859. 
It is also known as Shanklin Old Church. The bell ropes hang down into the nave, so the ringers can be seen by the congregation.
It stands at the southern end of the parish at the angle made by the roads to Wroxall and Ventnor. It has been so altered and added to that it is now of little interest. Originally it must have been of the usual aisleless type of manorial chapel—an oblong structure with nave and chancel in one line; and so it remained till 1852, when transepts were added, the church lengthened westward and a bell turret formed at the intersection of the roofs. A lych-gate with clock and bell was put up as a memorial to Mr. White-Popham. There is a good Renaissance oak chest, apparently brought from elsewhere. There are memorial tablets to members of the Hill and Popham families. The registers date from 1717.
Organ.
The pipe organ dates from 1874 by the builder Forster and Andrews. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Settlement (Croatia)

The territory of Croatia is divided by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics into small settlements, in Croatian naselje (singular; pl. naselja). They indicate existing or former human settlement. Individual settlements are by and large referred to as "selo" (village), and are not necessarily incorporated places. Rather, the administrative units are cities () and municipalities (), which are composed of one or more "naselje". , there are 6,749 "naselja" in Croatia.
The Constitution of Croatia allows a "naselje" or a part thereof to form some form of local government. This form of local government is typically used to subdivide the city settlements; a city usually includes an eponymous large settlement which in turn consists of several units named "gradska četvrt" ("city district") and/or "mjesni odbor" ("local committee").

Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology

Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology concerns the costs and benefits of physiological process that can be deployed and selected in regard to whether they will increase or not an animal’s survival and biological fitness. Variably deployable physiological processes relate mostly to processes that defend or clear infections as these are optional while also having high costs and circumstance linked benefits. They include immune system responses, fever, antioxidants and the plasma level of iron. Notable determining factors are life history stage, and resource availability.
Immunity.
Activating the immune system has the present and future benefit of clearing infections, but it is also both expensive in regard to present high metabolic energy consumption, and in the risk of resulting in a future immune related disorder. Therefore, an adaptive advantage exists if an animal can control its deployment in regard to actuary-like evaluations of future benefits and costs as to its biological fitness. In many circumstances, such trade-off calculations explain why immune responses are suppressed and infections are tolerated. Circumstances where immunity is not activated due to lack of an actuarial benefit include:
Fever.
Cost benefit trade-off actuary issues apply to the antibacterial and antiviral effects of fever (increased body temperature). Fever has the future benefit of clearing infections since it reduces the replication of bacteria and viruses. But it also has great present metabolic (BMR) cost, and the risk of hyperpyrexia. Where it is achieved internally, each degree raise in blood temperature, raises BMR by 10–15%. 90% of the total cost of fighting pneumonia, goes, for example, on energy devoted to raising body temperature. During sepsis, the resulting fever can raise BMR by 55%—and cause a 15% to 30% loss of body mass. Circumstances in which fever deployment is not selected or is reduced include:
Antioxidants.
Antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C, Vitamin E, and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) can protect against reactive oxygen species that damage DNA, proteins and lipids, and result in cell senescence and death. A cost exists in creating or obtaining these antioxidants. This creates a conflict between the biological fitness benefits of future survival compared with the use of these antioxidants to advantage present reproductive success. In some birds, antioxidants are diverted from maintaining the body to reproduction for this reason with the result that they have accelerated senescence Related to this, birds can show their biological capacity to afford the cost of diverting antioxidants (such as carotenoids) in the form of pigments into plumage as a costly signal.
Hypoferremia.
Iron is vital to biological processes, not only of a host, but also to bacteria infecting the host. A biological fitness advantage can exist for hosts to reduce the availability of iron within itself to such bacteria (hypoferremia), even though this happens at a cost of the host impairing itself with anemia. The potential benefits of such self impairment is illustrated by the paradoxical effect that providing iron supplements to those with iron deficiency (which interferes with its antibacterial action) can result in an individual being cured of anemia but having increased bacterial illness.

Church of St. Saviour-on-the-Cliff, Shanklin

The Church of St. Saviour-on-the-Cliff, Shanklin is a Grade II Listed parish church in the Church of England located in Shanklin, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church dates from 1869 to 1905 and was designed by the architect Thomas Hellyer.
The Foundation stone was laid on Ascension Day 1867.
The first phase comprising the Nave, Chancel, Vestry, and Organ Chamber was completed at a cost of £2,789. Bishop Vincent William Ryan, the first Bishop of Mauritius, consecrated it on 7 May 1869. 
The present Pulpit dates from 1903 and was designed and carved by Miss Editha Plowden. The original pulpit was taken to St John's Church, Bournemouth where it can still be seen today.
The South aisle and Porch were added in 1871 and the North aisle and Church Hall in 1876. 
The Baptistry and the proposed Narthex in 1883 were added in 1905 and was the last of the major building work to take place.
The church, rather surprisingly, survived the war years with only a few windows being damaged. The damage to these windows can still be seen in the East window of the Memorial Chapel and the West windows at the back of the church. Damage to one of the Baptistry windows is also visible.
The Chancel Arch contains the only example of Victorian painted text work in the church.
" Draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith" (Hebrews 10 22).
The true glory of St Saviour's can be seen on the interior which has been richly and generously furnished over the years. The full scale of Hellyer's church in the Early English style can be appreciated by standing at the entrance to the Galilee Porch and looking towards the High Altar.
The Tower and Bells.
In 1883 the Vicar, the Revd Charles I Burland, announced that it was proposed to
complete St Saviours by the addition of "a heaven-pointing Tower with its suitable furniture of pealing bells"
By early 1887 the tower and spire were completed and the peal of eight bells 
was installed the following year. The bells were manufactured by Mears and Stainbank of Whitechapel of London. Their total weight is some 75 cwt, with the Tenor alone weighing 18 cwt.
Sadly the initial optimism which greeted this project has not been sustained. By 1900
the tower and spire were shrouded in scaffolding to enable repairs to take place. 
The bells were hung too high and this along with the unsteady structure, led to the bells 
being chimed rather than rung from 1925 to 1985. In 1985 the pinnacles were removed at the junction of the tower, and following a structural report that the tower was indeed safe, much hard work started clearing sixty years of debris. By the 1980s the bells were in a very sorry state. They had hung still in a salt laden air for a century. No less than 56 bags of pigeon guano were removed from the tower and it was obvious that if the bells were to have a long term future, a lot of hard work would have to be done. After 8 years of tireless fundraising, the bells were taken out of the tower to be restored with brand new headstocks, stays, wheels, clappers, pulleys and ball but hung in original frame.
Organ.
The pipe organ dates from 1874 by the builder J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. The organ is located in the chancel to the north side. It also has two keyboard manuals and 4 composite pedals. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

UnFreedom Day

UnFreedom Day is an unofficial South African holiday or day of mourning that is marked every year on 27 April.
UnFreedom Day is planned to coincide with the official South African holiday called Freedom Day, an annual celebration of South Africa's first non-racial democratic elections of 1994.
UnFreedom Day was started by Abahlali baseMjondolo in Durban and has become a day of education in which films, discussions and performances play a major role. The theme of the day is to demonstrate that the poor are still not free in South Africa. Abahlali use the day to celebrate the growing strength of the movement's struggle. 
Abahlali baseMjondolo now also marks the day in Cape Town and other communities and social movements such as some Anti-Eviction Campaign communities have participated in UnFreedom Day with Abahlali baseMjondolo and have also begun marking UnFreedom Day in their own communities.
Repression.
In 2009 the South African police initially tried to ban the UnFreedom Day event held by Abahlali baseMjondolo, together with the Anti-Eviction Campaign, the Landless People's Movement, the Rural Network and the eMacambini Anti-Removal Committee (all of these movements supported the No Land! No House! No Vote! campaign) in the Kennedy Road settlement in Durban. However the police ban was seen off, those who had been arrested were released and the event went ahead with a police helicopter circling low above the assembly. A number of popular musical groups performed at the event including the Dlamini King Brothers.

Fifth National Government of New Zealand

The Fifth National Government of New Zealand is the current government of New Zealand. It is led by Prime Minister John Key.
After the 2008 general election the National Party and its allies were able to form a government, taking over from Helen Clark's Fifth Labour Government. It was subsequently reformed after the 2011 general election with a reduced number of seats. The Government has confidence and supply agreements with the Act, United Future and Māori Parties, which gives the Government a significant majority on major legislation. The National Party also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Green Party after the 2008 election, but lapsed and not renewed in 2011.
Significant policies.
Economic.
The Government was elected in the context of the late 2000s recession.
Local government.
In 2009 and 2010, the Government merged four city councils, three district councils and the Auckland Regional Council into one unitary "Super City". The Government's action differed from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance.
In March 2010, the Government removed the Environment Canterbury's Councillors and replaced them with appointed commissioners. The elections in 2010 of Environment Canterbury councillors which were pending in 2013 were postponed to ensure a Water Management Plan for Canterbury would be created.
History.
Formation.
The 2008 election saw the Fifth National Government elected to power with 44.93 per cent of the popular vote, ending nine years of Labour government. National formed a minority government with confidence-and-supply support from the ACT, United Future and Māori parties. The Governor-General swore Key in as New Zealand's 38th Prime Minister on 19 November 2008.
2011 election.
The 2011 election saw the Fifth National Government reform again with National in government with confidence-and-supply from the ACT, United Future and Maori parties, but with a reduced share of the votes and share of the seats in the House of Representatives.
The National Party increased its share of the party vote to 47.3 percent, but only increased one seat to 59 due to a reduced wasted vote (down to 3.4 percent from 6.5 percent in 2008), largely stemmed from the return of the New Zealand First party to Parliament after a one term absence. National's increased share of votes however largely came at the expense of other support parties, which saw decreases in vote share and seats. ACT only gained a third of its 2008 vote with 1.07 percent, reducing its seats from five to just one, while the defection of Hone Harawira to form the Mana Party saw the Maori Party's share of vote split, reducing the party to 1.43 percent and reducing the number of seats to three. The United Future Party saw its party vote drop by a quarter to 0.60 percent, but retained its single seat. The reformed Government therefore held 50.41 percent of the party vote and 64 of the 121 seats in Parliament.

In about 1000 acres of cultivable land, rice, areca nut, coconut, pulses and cashew nut are cultivated. In addition to this plantain cocoa, pepper, pineapple, vegetable and root vegetable are grown as interim crop.
There is a Housing Colony in this village. Due to inadequacy of land the tendency to level cultivable land for construction purposes is increasing. The changes in the field of construction are notable. Most of the newly constructed buildings are having concrete roof. Money from the Gulf countries has been a contributory factor in this change. Due to availability of water, Educational and Transport facilities more people are being attracted to this village.
The people of this village, which is the confluence of diverse religions and languages have succeeded to adapt to changes of the age despite keying up their tradition and culture. Radical changes have occurred in food and housing habits and costume of the people living here. Though Malayalam is the major language spoken, there are many who communicate in Kannada and Thulu.

It is not is alignment with the church (as is normal with such structures) as it was built with the assumption there would be a further extension to the church (which was never built) to bring it into alignment. The wood used reputedly came from H.M.S. Thunderer which fought at the Battle of Trafalgar.
Organ.
The pipe organ dates from 1911 by the builder Norman and Beard. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Bhadu (festival)

Bhadu is the social festival of South Bengal. The festival starts from the first day of Bhadro, the fifth month in Bengali Calendar and continues till the end of the month.
It has its origins in the story of a princess called Bhadravati (Bhadresvari) of Panchakote who committed suicide. Bhadravati's devotees make an image of her and sing and dance before it throughout the month. On the last day of Bhadra, they gather on the river bank and immerse the image in the water. Songs, mainly focussing on marriage, form the main attraction of the festival in which both professional groups and amateurs take part. Celebrations include fairs and cultural programmes.
Location.
Bhadu festival is mostly celebrated in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and Bardhaman districts of West Bengal.
Folklore.
Bhadu was an orphan found by the chief (mukhya) of Lada village. Raja Nilmoni Singh Deo of Kashipur in whose kingdom Ladha is located has just introduced a new strain of rice—Bhaduyi—for cultivation in Kashipur is fond of touring the kingdom in a disguise along with his minister, Dhruvachand, to see if his subjects are in favor of the new crop. In the course of his travels he hears that the chief of Lada village has a daughter who is the living embodiment of goddess Lakshmi. He decides to see her in person. He disguised as a Sanskrit pundit (scholar) and was wonderstruck by her beauty and grace and decides to adopt her as his daughter. However, her father, the village chief, will not let her go away and the king decides to let Bhadu stay in the village. He decides to provide her the benefits of a royal princess. Dhruvachand stays behind to oversee her education. Bhadu's new identity, as a royal princess, is kept secret. Bhadu is very popular among the village people because she works actively for their betterment. Then she meets Anjan, son of the doctor (kaviraj) in the neighbouring village. They fall in love, much to the dismay of Dhruvachand. In the meantime the British imprison the king because of his active involvement in the popular uprising of 1857. He is, however, later released. When he hears about Bhadu's involvement with Anjan, he orders the latter's capture and secret imprisonment. Bhadu is heartbroken and, together with two of her companions, travels across the kingdom singing songs at the gates of various forts in which Anjan may be imprisoned, hoping that he will recognize her voice and respond. The king relents and Anjan is released, but by then Bhadu has disappeared. Her companions report that one morning she seemed to fade away, merging with the sky. Village women continue to sing the songs that Bhadu first sang in the fruitless search for her lover.
Songs.
Bhadu gaan, an inseparable part of Bhadu festival reflects the colours of rural society. It used to be very popular in Burdwan, Bankura and Midnapore. But in Birbhum the existence of this unique genre is being threatened by the rising popularity of cinema and television.
Bhadu songs are composed extemporaneously and sung on each night of the festival, depicts the Goddesses as young girls. They describe Bhadu and tell in loving detail how they will be entertained. Since Bhadu is unmarried, her songs are sung mostly by unmarried girls. Dancing and playing drums accompanies Bhadu.

Objects in mirror are closer than they appear

The phrase "objects in (the) mirror are closer than they appear" is a safety warning that is required to be engraved on passenger side mirrors of motor vehicles in the USA and Canada. Similar messages may appear in other countries, such as Korea and India. It is present because while these mirrors' convexity gives them a useful field of view, it also makes objects appear smaller. Since smaller-appearing objects seem farther away than they actually are, a driver might make a maneuver such as a lane change assuming an adjacent vehicle is a safe distance behind, when in fact it is quite a bit closer. The warning serves as a reminder to the driver of this potential problem. 
In popular culture.
Despite its origin as a utilitarian safety warning, the phrase has become a well known catch phrase that has been used for many other purposes. Some of them are:

Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund, Whitwell

The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund, Whitwell is a parish church in the Church of England located in Whitwell on the Isle of Wight.
History.
The church is medieval.
The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund in Whitwell is located on rising ground at the South end of the village and adjoins the rectory.
Various parts of the church date back to different centuries. Various portions of the church were constructed in the 12th, 13th 15th and 16th centuries. However, the church has some more modern parts as well.
The church consists of a nave which has a south aisle of three bays, a chancel with south aisle in alignment with the east wall, a western tower and a south porch. Looking at the church, it is evident that the original church did not have aisles, and had a narrow chancel, divided by an arch. A narrow south aisle was added in the 13th century which was later widened in the 16th century. When the church was originally formed, it was of two separate manorial chapels, each with a different dedication. The dividing wall was finally removed between the two in the 16th century, at around the same time the tower was added. The early chapel was dedicated to St. Radegund, and belonging to the parish of Gatcombe, the later chapel to St. Mary. The thirteenth-century south aisle with its chancel was added as a chapel-of-ease to Godshill. The south pillar of the chancel arch is made of a short column and a huge capital. The pulpit and the communion table in the south chancel are Jacobean. The church bell now at the west end of the middle aisle is sixteenth-century. The bells and clock were installed after the death of William Spindler who passed them on to the church, and is now buried in its graveyard. All the bells have the inscription "Cast by John Warner and Sons London 1889". In 2009 the bells underwent a refurbishment by Whitechapel Bell Foundry at a cost of more than £30,000. The refurbishment came along with the 120th anniversary of their installation in 1889. The refurbishment was commemorated in the well dressing celebrations that occur annually in the Summer.
On Monday 16 April 2007 Whitwell's post office re-opened inside the church's bell tower. Although other Post Offices have been relocated to new locations on the grounds of local church's, it is the first of its kind in the country to be located inside the church. The idea to locate the new post office inside the church came from the church's vicar, after no other suitable location was found. After the Post Office's relocation into the church proved a success, the island's Rural Community Council (RRC) have stated they would like to see the model applied elsewhere where village amenities are under threat. Although the post office was hoped to also boost attendance numbers at Sunday church services, this has not happened, and the average congregation size remains at only 23.
Organ.
The pipe organ dates from 1860 by the builder Bevington, but has undergone renovation and extension by Harrison and Harrison in 1899. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

St Nicholas Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne

St Nicholas Hospital is an NHS psychiatric hospital located in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, UK. The entrance is located on Jubilee Road. The buildings range from Victorian-era to modern facilities and occupies 12 hectares of land.
History.
In the 1850s Newcastle upon Tyne's hospitals for mentally ill patients were overcrowding; a new asylum was promised in Coxlodge, where a farmstead known as Dodd's Farm had been purchased. In 1864 initial plans were drawn up, and William Lambie Moffatt was mentioned as an architect. It opened as Newcastle upon Tyne Borough Lunatic Asylum in July 1869. In 1882 it changed its name to Newcastle upon Tyne City Lunatic Asylum.
In 1884 permission was granted to extend the hospital, and the East and West Pavilions were completed in 1887. The asylum steadily grew, with more buildings were erected. During the First World War the patients were evacuated and the hospital became Northumberland No1 War Hospital for wounded soldiers, who were brought there by train. In 1921 it became an asylum again. In 1948 the National Health Service took over the hospital and changed the name to St Nicholas Hospital.
Recent history.
In 2004 a new clinic was built, the Bamburgh Clinic, costing a total of £22.024 million. Work started in November 2004 and was completed in April 2006. The brownfield site was previously a fish factory.
The site is bordered by residential properties, a Northumberland Wildlife Trust wildlife centre and office, and a Royal Mail postal depot.
In 2009 the renovation of the Victorian hospital building was nominated for the Best Design in the Community Benefit category of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors North-East Renaissance Awards. It is one of eight short-listed from 20 entries. The building housing the Greentrees unit and the Lennox Ward, cost around £8 million.
Jubilee Theatre.
The hospital also includes the Jubilee Theatre, a theatre which opened in 1899. Currently the theatre is primarily used by two groups: Juniper Productions (founded 1998) a drama group for sufferers of mental health difficulties, and since 1992 an external theatre company, First Act Theatre.

<doc id="20693870" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20693870" title="United States presidential election in Florida, 2008">
United States presidential election in Florida, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in Florida took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 27 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Florida was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama by a 2.8% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a toss-up, or swing state, as it was heavily targeted by both campaigns. Despite the fact that polls showed McCain in the lead throughout much of 2008, Obama took the momentum in the two months before Election Day. Obama ended up winning the state with 51% of the vote, including wins in four counties that Bush won in 2004.
Campaign.
Republican George W. Bush of Texas carried The Sunshine State by a convincing margin of 5% in 2004 against Democrat John Kerry, a much greater margin than in 2000 when Bush controversially won the state's 25 electoral votes against Democrat Al Gore of Tennessee by 537 votes.
Early polls showed Barack Obama faring poorly in Florida. Barack Obama did not campaign there during the primary season and argued against seating its delegates for the Democratic convention, generating unfavorable media attention. Moreover, Florida's demographics did not favor him. A haven for retirees, Florida lacked many of the younger voters who passionately supported the Democratic nominee. Thus, in early 2008, opinion polling showed Republican John McCain leading most polls, sometimes by double-digits.
Near the end of September, however, when the financial crisis of 2008 became a more potent election issue, Obama proceeded to take the lead in most of the polls. Florida was especially hard hit by the economic shock. It was a hotspot of new homebuilding and suffered tremendously from the subprime lending collapse. In addition, the state was full of retirees depending on 401ks; these were badly hurt by the stock market's fall.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations which made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
The 3 poll averages showed McCain leading throughout most of the presidential election season, until the very last month of October. The final 3 polls had Obama leading 49% to 48% with undecided voters to decide the election.
Fundraising.
McCain raised $14,826,093. Obama raised $19,963,592.
Advertising and visits.
Obama and his interest groups spent $36,990,591 in the state. McCain and his interest groups spent $17,133,501. The Democratic ticket visited the state 12 times to the Republicans' 11 times.
Analysis.
Obama won the state and its 27 electoral votes on Election Day by a margin of about 2.82%. Obama held a consistent lead for most of the night as returns came in, but the networks avoided calling the state for Obama until the conservative northwestern portion, most of which is in the Central Time Zone, began reporting its returns.
Obama's win in the state can be attributed to, according to exit polling, winning 96% of the African-American vote, 57% of Latino voters, and 52% among Independents.
Big wins in the Orlando and Tampa Bay areas, where George W. Bush won in 2004, contributed to Obama's victory. In the former, Obama carried Orange County (which includes Orlando) by 19 points - the best margin for a Democratic candidate in 64 years. Before Al Gore and John Kerry narrowly won it, Orange County hadn't supported a Democratic presidential nominee since Franklin D. Roosevelt's last run for president in 1944. Obama also carried Osceola County near Orlando by a 20-point margin (Bush won it in 2004 52%-47%). His strong performance in Central Florida more than likely helped the Democrats win two U.S. House seats in that region.
In the Tampa Bay region, Obama carried Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, by a 7-point margin. Obama also won Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, by a 53%-45% margin. Bush had narrowly carried the county by about 0.1% in 2004.
Like most Democratic candidates, Obama dominated South Florida, winning Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties by comfortable margins. The vote from Miami-Dade came in very late in the evening, stopping the major networks from calling the state for Obama earlier in the evening, although Obama maintained a lead of at least 200,000 votes from the moment polls closed in the state.
On the other hand, John McCain kept the state relatively close, losing by far less than his national average. In northern Florida, a Republican stronghold, McCain won the majority of counties by double-digit landslides. Along the panhandle, McCain routinely took over 70% of the vote. Obama won only a handful of counties - most home to major colleges. Moreover, McCain improved on George Bush's performance in large parts of northern Florida - something he achieved in very few other areas of the country. Obama's sole accomplishment involved Duval County (Jacksonville), where he narrowed George Bush's 61,580-vote victory to a far smaller 7,919 margin. Duval County has only supported a Democrat for president once since 1952, when Jimmy Carter carried it in 1976.
In addition, McCain was able to do well along the I-4 corridor in central Florida. This heavily populated, "swingy" region often determines which candidate wins in Florida's statewide elections. In 2008, the Republican candidate won the majority of counties, including heavily populated areas such as Brevard County. However, McCain's poor showing in Orlando severely hurt his position in central Florida.
Democrats also picked up two seats from Florida in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrat Alan Grayson defeated incumbent Republican Ric Keller for Florida's 8th Congressional District seat while Democrat Suzanne Kosmas ousted incumbent Republican Tom Feeney for Florida's 24th Congressional District seat. Republicans, however, were successful at winning back Republican Mark Foley's old congressional seat in Florida's 16th Congressional District seat when Tom Rooney defeated Democratic incumbent Tim Mahoney by a comfortable margin. At the state level, Democrats picked up two seats in the Florida House of Representatives as well.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Despite the fact that Barack Obama won the popular vote and the state’s 27 electoral votes, John McCain carried 15 congressional districts in Florida, including one district occupied by a Democrat. Obama carried 10 congressional districts including three districts occupied by Republicans.
Electors.
Technically the voters of Florida cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Florida is allocated 27 electors because it has 25 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 27 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 27 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 27 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden

Brand X (The X-Files)

"Brand X" is the eighteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on April 16, 2000. It was written by Steven Maeda and Greg Walker and directed by Kim Manners. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. "Brand X" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.8, being watched by 10.81 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is horrified when the witness who was due to testify against the Morley cigarette company dies mysteriously. After being called into assist, Mulder and Scully soon discover that a new brand of cigarette has a dangerous secret.
Inspired by the 1999 film "The Insider", "Brand X" was written by Maeda and Walker to be an exploration of the corporate evil inside the cigarette industry. The scenes featuring shots of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors. In one particular scene, over 3,000 live insects were used. Those scenes took up to a full day to film.
Plot.
In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is charged with guarding the life of Dr. James Scobie, a former researcher who is testifying against his former employer, the Morley tobacco corporation. Prior to his trial, Scobie develops a cough, but shrugs it off. In the morning, Skinner and Scobie's wife find his body on the bathroom floor, with his face ripped away.
Morley has created a form of "super-tobacco", which is inhabited by a genetically engineered tobacco beetle whose eggs can survive the process of cigarette manufacturing and are released in the smoke of the cigarettes. The cigarettes were tested on a range of subjects by Scobie and his colleague, Dr. Peter Voss. Of the four human test subjects, chain smoker Darryl Weaver is the only surviving participant. Prior to his death, Scobie agreed to give Weaver an unlimited supply of cigarettes in exchange for his silence; he subsequently pressures Voss into honoring his "arrangement" with Scobie.
A chain of victims soon succumb to the eggs contained in the toxic smoke, all of whom are found with their bodies covered in the tobacco beetles. While interviewing Weaver, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is exposed to the smoke, later coughing up blood and needing his lungs invasively cleared as the beetles begin to hatch.
Voss, who had until now been hiding behind his legal advisor, has a change of heart upon hearing of Mulder’s condition and tells Skinner of the aforementioned testing. Skinner goes to Weaver’s apartment after getting his name from Dr. Voss and finds a man tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth. When Skinner removes the gauze wrapper around the man’s mouth, the man chokes and beetles begin crawling from his mouth. At the hospital, Mulder is in grave danger due to the beetle eggs now hatching in his lungs, and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) attempts to find a way to save him, because he is now "too weak for thoracic surgery."
Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver attempts to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light one of the toxic cigarettes. As Weaver attempts to leave the building, Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette to the floor and Skinner dramatically snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder’s life. She is correct in her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drove him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. However, upon some chiding by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.
Production.
Writing.
Originally, the premise of the episode was supposed to be about "the horrifying aspects of over-eating". However, since the previous episode "Hungry" had dealt with similar themes, the writing staff decided to take the conceit in a different direction and examine the "corporate evil that populates the cigarette industry". The episode's writers, Steven Maeda and Greg Walker, were both admitted fans of the "The Insider", a 1999 film that examines the tobacco industry, and so the two decided to create an episode with a similar feel. Marc Shapiro, in his book "All Things: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 6", noted that the episode was "literally, torn from the headlines"—a rare occurrence for an "X-Files" episode.
Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were busy adding the finishing touches to their own episodes—"Hollywood A.D." and "all things", respectively—the writers struggled with a way to create a convincing story, but not force Mulder and Scully to be in every scene. The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to get sick in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, "Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time. It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be in a lot of different locations."
Filming.
In order to match the episode's theme of smoking, production designer Corey Kaplan was tasked with creating an overall yellow and brown color scheme for the episode. In this manner, each scene was given "a perpetually smoky look". Kaplan, who had worked together with episode director Kim Manners, had the idea to "enhance" Morley Cigarette's corporate offices with "long hallways and sets heavy on texture and grit" in order to compliment the aforementioned color scheme.
The scenes featuring shots of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors. In particular, during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead, over 3,000 live bugs were shot crawling on the body of Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because "bugs don't take directions very well, so you pretty much have to wait until they decided to get it right." Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and "dummy bugs".
Reception.
"Brand X" first aired in the United States on April 16, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.8, with a 10 share, meaning that roughly 6.8 percent of all television-equipped households, and 10 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 10.81 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on July 16, 2000 and received 0.75 million viewers, making it the most watched episode that week. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "Tonight the terror is inside. Deep inside."
Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a moderately positive review. He wrote that "this wasn't the most riveting X-File I've ever seen and there wasn't a tremendous amount of heart-pounding tension from beginning to end [...] but that didn't bother me. Sometimes, just being entertained is enough." Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris concluded that the episode was "not the series' most exciting episode, but a solid story with interesting characters used well in the service of the plot" Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying "'Brand X' benefits from a certain unpredictability in its plot and characters. The menace is unusual, and imaginatively conceived. The tobacco company and its employees display a degree of complexity, rather than merely serving as one-dimensional villains in a public-health morality play." Gareth Wigmore of "TV Zone" gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Wigmore noted that a "freshness surrounds the whole episode, presumably a result of the writing". 
Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "C". He called it a "hodge-podge of various elements that have worked in the past but feel beyond tired now". He was largely critical of the episode's story, which he felt was a rip-off of "The Insider", as well as the make-up effects for the episode, which he called "fairly fake" looking. VanDerWerff, however, was complimentary towards Tobin Bell's performance, calling him "charismatic and interesting", as well as the fact that he plays "a great schemer". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Tobacco beetles, dismembered noses and some really bad second-hand smoke permeate this installment, but it gets snuffed out with a lazy payoff." Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite praising the plot, writing "it's a great premise, with lots of gore and larvae", the two lament its loss in direction: "halfway through, once the episode reveals what its concept is, the story is left with nowhere to go."

Ethel Hays

Ethel Hays (March 13, 1892 – March 19, 1989) was an American syndicated cartoonist specializing in flapper-themed comic strips in the 1920s and 1930s. She drew in art deco style. In the later part of her career, during the 1940s and 1950s, she became one of the country's most accomplished children's book illustrators.
Biography.
Early training.
Hays was born on March 13, 1892 in Billings, Montana, where she was raised. After high school, where she was an illustrator for the school newspaper, she attended the Los Angeles School of Art and Design and then the Art Students League of New York. She won a scholarship to the Académie Julian in Paris, but the start of World War I derailed her studies there. At the time, Hays was on course to become a fine arts painter. 
She learned, in her words, “how to paint pretty pictures—never dreaming that I was no pretty picture painter.” During World War I, she took on the task of teaching painting to convalescing soldiers in Army hospitals. After encountering a group of students much more interested in learning cartooning instead, she determined to learn that subject herself. She enrolled in the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course and, "keeping a couple of lessons ahead," was able to instruct her class. In this environment, her style of drawing pretty women met with great approval.
Newspaper comics and illustrations.
This experience with comic art changed the course of her career. Hays was subsequently offered work as a staff illustrator for the "Cleveland Press", a job procured for her by the designer of the correspondence course himself, Charles N. Landon. Soon after, Landon would be touting Ethel Hays as among the "former students who are now successful comic strip artists" in his magazine ads of the 1920s.
Hays' first work at the "Cleveland Press" was for a trendy feature called "Vic and Ethel", which consisted of flapper-themed satire and social commentary—including stories of "steeple-climbing and swimming in ice-filled lakes" and interviews with visiting celebrities — accompanied by Hays's cartoons. Her first comic strip for Newspaper Enterprise Association was derived from that feature and was called simply "Ethel". Here Hays continued to chronicle the era when women "bobbed their hair and took up active sports." Even at the beginning of her career, Hays' style was "already polished and breathtakingly lovely."
Hays also drew the noted one-panel cartoon series "Flapper Fanny Says", also for NEA and starting in about 1924, with a Sunday page following in 1928. In this panel, which featured a flapper illustration and a witticism, Hays "moved away from the fancy style of Nell Brinkley, drawing sleeker women with short hair—some even wearing pants." Her panel inspired competition for a time from Faith Burrows' similarly-themed "Flapper Filosofy" from the rival King Features Syndicate.
Ethel Hays was married in 1925 to W.C. Simms of Kansas City, Missouri (she continued to use her maiden name in signing her art throughout her career). By 1928 she was a mother. After she had her second child, she found the daily workload becoming too heavy, and she turned "Flapper Fanny Says" over to promising newcomer Gladys Parker around 1931. Between 1931 and 1936, however, Hays did find time to illustrate at least 17 stories by noted and prolific author Ellis Parker Butler that were distributed to newspapers. Hays continued to produce a variety of other work for NEA, including full-page illustrations and montages for "Every Week" magazine, a Sunday newspaper supplement. Her final comic strip for NEA was "Marianne", beginning around February 1936, which ran weekly. Comic strip historian Allan Holtz wrote, ""While the art was vintage Hays, the gags were strictly jokebook material. You could tell her heart was no longer in it."" Her final installment ran on December 26, 1937, though the strip continued without her for another year or two.
Transition to children's book illustration.
In 1938–1940, Hays worked for the "Christian Science Monitor", drawing cartoons to accompany a series of poems called "Manly Manners." An instructional children's book collecting the feature was published. During this time her work was also featured on a twelve-month calendar (1939). These painted illustrations of children at play presaged in style and content the work of the next stage of her career.
Hays had created art for books early in her professional career. Leaving newspaper comic strips behind, she began to work more extensively for children's book publishers, illustrating a variety of nursery rhymes, Christmas stories and alphabet books. Some of her more notable art was "Raggedy Ann and Andy" material for the Saalfield Publishing Company of Akron Ohio. Saalfield had secured the license from the Johnny Gruelle Company in 1944 to produce "Raggedy Ann" storybooks, coloring books, paper dolls and booklets. Most of the artwork fell to Hays, ""whose exuberant, curvilinear style perfectly captured the whimsy and energy of Gruelle's characters"". Having been trained in painting, she was well-suited for this type of full-color artwork.
In the 1930s and 1940s, Hays illustrated "Puzzle Pages" for the publisher McCormick-Mathers of Wichita, Kansas. "Puzzle Pages" has been described as "a reading seatwork series" for schoolchildren. The workbook pages included sections for reading and writing, as well as words and pictures for cut-and-paste activities. Students might do coloring in Hays' illustrations. The copyright on the series was renewed until at least the 1970s.
Assessment and legacy.
Ethel Hays has been called "one of the more successful women cartoonists of the 1920s." Comics historian Trina Robbins wrote that Hays was "without a doubt the most brilliant of the women cartoonists influenced by Nell Brinkley." Russell Patterson and John Held, Jr. have also been numbered among her early influences. The artist Roy Crane was influenced by Hays, especially in the drawing of beautiful women. Hays' ubiquitous newspaper illustrations helped promote the idea of the 1920s and 1930s fashion style known as the flapper.
She continued to produce newspaper and book illustrations for many years. One source says she retired from commercial art in the 1950s, while at least one other references work into the 1960s. She died in 1989, aged 97.

The Words (book)

The Words () is Jean-Paul Sartre's 1963 autobiography.
Structure and presentation.
The text is divided into two near-equal parts entitled 'Reading' and 'Writing'. However, according to Philippe Lejeune, these two parts are only a façade and are not relevant to the chronological progression of the work. He considers the text to instead be divided into five parts which he calls 'acts':
The first title which Sartre thought of was "Jean sans terre".
Reception.
The book, consisting of Sartre distancing himself from writing and making his farewells to literature was very successful for the author and was hailed nearly unanimously as a "literary success". In November of the same year, 1964, he refused the Nobel Prize for Literature awarded for his work, described as "rich in ideas and filled with the spirit of freedom and the quest for truth, has exerted a far-reaching influence on our age."

Phillip Collins Ltd v Davis

Phillip Collins Ltd v Davis 3 All ER 808 is an English unjust enrichment case, which gives a good example of a restitution claim and the change of position defence.
Facts.
Phil Collins released "Serious Hits… Live!" with 15 tracks in 1990. Rahmlee Davis and Louis Satterfield were musicians who played in five of them and got royalties from the album sales. In 1997, Collins said they had been mistakenly overpaid. They had been paid as if they had performed on all fifteen tracks, but they had only performed on five, so had been paid three times what was due. To reverse this alleged unjust enrichment, Collins proposed to set off the overpaid royalties on future royalties. Davis and Satterfield argued back they were entitled to royalties without the pro rata reduction, and raised both estoppel and change of position defences.
Judgment.
Jonathan Parker J held Collins had overpaid Davis and Satterfield and he was entitled to set future royalties off against half of the sums overpaid. He said the overpayment was a mistake of fact, because Collins thought they had played in all 15 tracks. Collins was not estopped from maintaining there was overpayment of royalties because there was never any assumption between the parties that Davis and Satterfield would get royalties for all 15 tracks and there was no acquiescence in the assumption. Overpayment was not acquiescence. There was no evidence Davis and Satterfield ever thought they were entitled. The overpayments did not amount to representations that they were (so no estoppel by representation). But the fact of overpayment did result in a general change of position on Davis and Satterfield’s part. It increased their level of outgoings. However, the defence of change of position was not an “all or nothing” doctrine and, in this case, it would be fair to allow the defence to cover one half of the overpayments ("Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd" 2 AC 548 applied). Finally, if Collins had made a claim to recover the overpayments his claim would have been statute barred under the Limitation Act 1980, s.5 because it was six years. But here it was not a return of overpayments, only an equitable set off against future royalties.
The following is an excerpt about the change of position defence at work.

St. John's Church, Wroxall

St. John's Church, Wroxall is a parish church in the Church of England located in Wroxall, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church dates from 1875 to 1877 by the architect T. R. Saunders. The tower was added in 1911.
Its consecration service was performed by the Archdeacon of Winchester on 21 December 1877. The church consisted of a chancel, nave, organ chamber, south porch and a small western belfry housing one bell, and provided seating for 130.
The stone excavated during the construction of the nearby Ventnor railway tunnel provided the building material. This kept down costs but it has since proved to be of poor quality and the building is in constant need of refacing.
Organ.
The organ was built by A. Hunter and Sons. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<doc id="20693967" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20693967" title="Łucja Frey">
Łucja Frey

Łucja Frey or Łucja Frey-Gottesman (November 3, 1889 in Lwów – 1942?) was a Polish physician and neurologist, known for describing the syndrome later named after her. Łucja Frey was one of the first female academic neurologists in Europe. She perished during the Holocaust in 1942 in Lwów ghetto aged 53.
Life.
Łucja Frey was born on November 3, 1889 in Lwów, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, as the daughter of the building contractor Szymon Symcha Frey and his wife, Dina (née Weinreb) Frey and her family were Jewish. She attended a Christian elementary school between 1896 and 1900. She graduated from Franciszek-Józef secondary school as an extern pupil in 1907. After graduation she studied mathematics and philosophy under professor Marian Smoluchowski (1872-1917). She was a student of the faculty of philosophy from 1907 to 1912, but after five years she moved to Warsaw and began studying medicine.
Frey studied medicine from 1918 to 1923 and received her medical diploma on June 2, 1923. Her studies were interrupted for one year because of the Polish–Ukrainian War.
After graduation she continued her work as a senior assistant to professor Kazimierz Orzechowski (1878–1942) in his Warsaw neurological clinic. At the end of 1928 she left Warsaw to go back to Lwów, and married a lawyer named Mordechai (Marek) Gottesman (1887 in Komarno – 1941?). From May 1929 she was working at the neurological clinic in Lwów on Rappaporta Street as a deputy senior consultant. She gave birth to her daughter, Danuta, in 1930.
After the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 19, 1939 and the subsequent occupation of Lwów, Mark Gottesman was accused of counter-revolutionary activities and was arrested by the NKVD; nothing is known about him after this point. In 1941, under the German occupation of Lwów, Łucja Frey was resettled to the ghetto and forced to work in Ghettopoliklinik in Zamarstynowska 112. She was probably murdered together with her patients during liquidation of the ghetto in August 1942 or shortly after deportation to Belzec extermination camp. No evidence exists, that she, or any of her relatives, survived.
There are many uncertainties about her life. According to Yad Vashem testimony of Hedwa Balat, Frey's sister-in-law, Łucja and Marek had a son named Jakub, born in 1919. However, no other sources support this thesis and Frey's biographer finds it very unlikely.
Recognition.
Until 2004, only short biographic articles about Łucja Frey's life existed: in Polish, Swedish, and English. These publications repeated fragmentary and scarce facts from Eufemiusz Herman's classic monograph about Polish neurologists. New facts about her tragic life were published in Mirjam Moltrecht's biography. However, Frey's name is often omitted or misspelled (as "Lucy" or "Lucie") in many textbooks and dictionaries. Dates of birth and death of Austrian physican and physiologist Maximilian Ruppert Franz von Frey (1852-1932) were sometimes mistakenly given as hers.
Works.
Frey's publication about auriculotemporal nerve syndrome, now widely known as "Frey's syndrome" ("zespół Łucji Frey" in Polish), was published in 1923, first in Polish journal "Polska Gazeta Lekarska", and later that year in renowned French journal "Revue Neurologique". It was not the very first description of this constellation of symptoms. Frey's predecessors were Kastremsky (1740), Duphenix (1757), Barthez (1806), Dupuy (1816), Brown-Sequard (1849), Baillarger (1853), Henle (1855), Berard (1855), Bergounhioux (1859), Rouyer (1859), Botkin (1875), Parkes Weber (1897), New and Bozer (1922) and Lipsztat (1922). Interestingly, both Brown-Sequard and Henle reported their own symptoms. All these observations lack a wide view of the anatomy, pathology and exact mechanism of gustatory sweating. Łucja Frey's article "Przypadek zespołu nerwu usznoskroniowego" ("Le Syndrome du Nerf Auriculo-Temporal") is considered to be the first such description of the phenomenon. Frey was first to recognize this syndrome as a disorder of both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations.
The eponym "Frey syndrome" was introduced to medical literature by Henryk Higier in 1926 and in 1932 by Bassoe. In recognition of earlier descriptions of this syndrome, it is also sometimes called Baillarger's syndrome, Frey-Baillarger syndrome or Dupuy syndrome.
Besides this important work, Frey published papers on the effects of vegetable poisons on spinal cord degeneration, brain stem topography, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Charcot joints, aneurysms of the plexus of the medulla, cysts of brain ventricles, clivus tumors, frontal lobe tumors and retrosplenial tumors.

St. James' Church, Yarmouth

St. James' Church, Yarmouth is a parish church in the Church of England located in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church dates is medieval but little remains. Rebuilding began in 1635. 
There is a monument to the seventeenth-century admiral Sir Robert Holmes who based his operations at Yarmouth. He obtained it in a raid on a French ship, when he seized an unfinished statue of Louis XIV of France and forced the sculptor to finish it with his own head rather than the king's.
It consists of nave with north and south aisles, a chancel and a western tower. The original church was said by local tradition to have been at the east end of the town, and its foundations were visible in the old churchyard in 1845. Destroyed by the French in their raid of 1377, it is said to have been rebuilt on the present site only to be again reduced to a ruin in 1543. At the beginning of the 17th century it was practically rebuilt, and reconsecrated by John Davenant the Bishop of Salisbury on 11 March 1626. The chancel, which had a polygonal roof with enriched bosses at the intersection of the ribs, was lengthened 12 ft. in 1889.

Entombment of Christ

The entombment of Christ, that is to say the burial of Jesus Christ, occurred after his death by crucifixion, when, according to the gospel accounts, he was placed in a tomb by Joseph of Arimathea.
Biblical accounts.
The earliest Christian writings are the epistles of St Paul: he makes a passing reference to Jesus having been buried, but provides no details. The next generation of writings are the four canonical gospels, all of which conclude with an extended narrative of the Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening. All four state that, on the evening of the Crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body, and, after Pilate granted his request, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb. There are significant differences between the four accounts, recording the evolution of the tradition from the earliest gospel (that of Mark to the last (the Gospel of John). 
In the gospel of Mark, usually regarded as the earliest of the gospels, Joseph of Arimathea is not necessarily a follower of Jesus, but a pious Jew who wished to ensure that the body was buried in accordance with Jewish law, according to which bodies could not be left exposed overnight. (The Jewish historian Josephus, writing at about the time of Jesus, describes how the Jews regarded this law as so important that even the bodies of crucified criminals would be taken down and buried before sunset). In Mark, Joseph of Arimathea acts out of concern for the observance of Jewish law and burial customs. In Matthew 27:57, Joseph is said to be a disciple of Jesus. Modern scholarship tends to see the gospel accounts as contradictory, and finds the Mark portrayal more probable.
In Mark, also, Joseph does only the bare minimum needed for observance of the law, wrapping the body in a cloth, with no mention of washing or anointing it. This explains why Mark has an earlier story, prior to the Crucifixion, a the woman who pours perfume over Jesus (Mark 14:3-9): Jesus is thereby prepared for burial even before his death. The last of the gospels, John, differs from Mark on this point, depicting Joseph as a disciple who gives Jesus an honourable burial.
John records that Joseph was assisted in the burial process by Nicodemus, who brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes and included these spices in the burial cloth according to Jewish customs. Matthew 27:66 mentions that they "made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard."
Historicity.
N. T. Wright notes that the burial of Christ is part of the earliest gospel traditions. John Dominic Crossan, however, suggests that Jesus' body was eaten by dogs as it hung on the cross so that there was nothing left to bury. 
Theological significance.
Paul the Apostle includes the burial in his statement of the gospel in verses 3 and 4 of 1 Corinthians 15: "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures" (KJV). This appears to be an early pre-Pauline credal statement.
The burial of Christ is specifically mentioned in the Apostles' Creed, where it says that Jesus was "crucified, dead, and buried." The Heidelberg Catechism asks "Why was he buried?" and gives the answer "His burial testified that He had really died."
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that, "It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the tomb, reveals God's great sabbath rest after the fulfillment of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe" and that "Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today."
Depiction in art.
The Entombment of Christ has been a popular subject in art, being developed in Western Europe in the 10th century. It appears in cycles of the "Life of Christ", where it follows the Deposition of Christ or the Lamentation of Christ. Since the Renaissance, it has sometimes been combined or conflated with one of these.
Notable individual works with articles include:
Use in hymnody.
The Af­ri­can-Amer­i­can spir­it­u­al "Were you there?" has the line "Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?" while the Christmas carol "We Three Kings" includes the :
<poem>
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.
</poem>
John Wilbur Chapman's hymn "One Day" interprets the burial of Christ by saying "Buried, He carried my sins far away."

Kanden Kadhalai

Kanden Kadhalai (English: "I Saw My Love") is a 2009 Indian Tamil romantic comedy film directed by R. Kannan of "Jayamkondaan" fame. 
Background.
The film, a remake of the 2007 Hindi blockbuster "Jab We Met" by Imtiaz Ali, stars Bharath and Tamannaah in the lead roles, originally played by Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor. The film released on 30 October 2009 to mainly positive reviews.
Plot.
Shakthivel (Bharath) is the son of a wealthy industrialist and the managing director of Rajasekar Industries. His mother Kamala is suing the company because Shakthi insulted her for having an affair with the company auditor. To add to that, the girl he loved got married to someone else. Disgusted with life, he gets up and walks aimlessly, taking a bus to the Chennai Railway Station. There he boards the Pandian Express at night without a ticket and sits in gloom. Anjali (Tamannaah) is a college student who is going to her hometown Theni for vacation. Anjali is bubbly and talkative and thoroughly irritates Shakthi. She tells him of her plans to elope with her lover Gautham. At night, Shakthi leaves the train. Anjali wakes up to find him gone. Seeing him sitting on the platform, she gets off the train to bring him back. As a result she misses the train. She tells Shakthi that it is his responsibility to take her back to the train. Annoyed, he takes her to the next station so that she can board the train and leaves her. Anjali again misses the train. While she is waiting for a taxi to reach the next station, some gangsters chase her, but she runs into Shakthi who fights them off.
Anjali tells Shakthi that it was his responsibility to take her safely home to Theni. They go to a hotel and Anjali tells him to burn the photo of his lover. He does so and feels better. They flee the hotel in the middle of the night and board a bus. While travelling, they become good friends. They reach Theni, where Anjali insists that he meet her family. Anjali's grandfather (Ravichandran) tells him to stay with them for a couple of days. Unable to refuse, Shakthi accepts and enjoys a few days with her family who treat him as an honored guest. Anjali tries to get him to forge a relationship with her cousin Roja (Sapan Saran). Meanwhile, Anjali tells Shakthi that her family is trying to get her hitched to her uncle Mokkai Raasu (Santhanam) and asks him for ideas to escape. Anjali behaves in such a way around Shakthi while Raasu is present, that Raasu believes that they are lovers. When marriage between Anjali and Raasu is fixed, Anjali takes Shakthi and runs away. Her family believes that they have eloped together. Shakthi takes Anjali to Ooty and bids her good luck. They part ways.
Shakthi returns to Chennai with a fresh outlook on life and makes several changes to his company. He resolves his issues with his mother and the shares of his company rise.
One day, he releases a new product by the name Anjali. Roja sees the ad on TV and informs her family. Anjali's family meet Shakthi. Anjali's father (Nizhalgal Ravi) begs Shakthi to tell him of Anjali's whereabouts. Shakthi is shocked to learn that Anjali has not contacted them in 9 months. He promises them that he will come to Theni in ten days with Anjali. Shakthi travels to Ooty the same day and meets with Gautham (Munna). Goutham tells him that he turned out Anjali when she met him because he was more interested in completing his dream first. Shakthi admonishes him and leaves, his heart full of worry. He searches for Anjali in Ooty, notifying the police and some friends. He finally locates Anjali working as a school teacher in Connore.
Shakthi is shocked to see the talkative and bubbly Anjali as a sad and quiet girl. Shakthi resolves to make her happy again. After some convincing, Anjali agrees to return to her family. Before they leave, Gautham comes and apologizes to Anjali. Anjali refuses to accept Gautham into her life again, but Shakthi convinces her otherwise. The three of them travel to Theni, where Anjali's family forgive her. However, they mistake Shakthi to be Anjali's lover and make wedding plans for Anjali and Shakthi. Gautham is furious and Shakthi tells Anjali that she has to clear the confusion. Anjali tries but finds in her heart some kind of mental block. Finally, Gautham asks Shakthi to leave, without Anjali's knowledge, saying that while he is here Gautham and Anjali cannot get married. Shakthi agrees and boards a train to Chennai. But Anjali realises at this point that she loves Shakthi, and not Gautham. She runs to the station and meets Shakthi and confesses her love to him. Shakthi joyfully accepts and Gautham leaves. Shakthi and Anjali return to her family to be married.
Production.
Initially the remake had Dhanush and Trisha Krishnan in the lead. But Shriya Saran had replaced Trisha opposite Dhanush. Later both the lead actors opted out and were replaced by Bharath and Tamannaah. Date problems were cited as the reason behind these changes.
Critical reception.
The mainly positive reviews from the critics stated that the film was able to recreate the same magic it delivered in the original "Jab We Met". Indiaglitz, while stating this, commented that Tamannaah was the backbone of the whole movie and she emotes to her best. Behindwoods mentioned that the chemistry of the lead pair (which is the moving force of the film) worked well and that Tamanna and Bharath looked fresh and different in their roles. Sify and Nowrunning.com both reviewed that the movie was a cute love story and is definitely worth a watch.
"Kanden Kadhalai" received mixed response from the audience and was a moderate performer at the box office.
Home video.
Moser Baer Home entertainment released the movie on DVD in India
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was released on 14 August 2009. Vidyasagar was the music director. It was released by Imtiaz Ali. The two mega-hit numbers were "Suthudhu Suthudhu" and "Ododi Poren."

Charley Barden

Charley Barden (dates unknown) was a British cyclist whose fame and looks led to his being mobbed wherever he went. He twice came second in the world professional sprint championship and held the English title and several records. His career was ruined after he alleged that other riders rode dangerously and killed another rider.
Background.
Charley Barden was born in Canterbury in 1874. In 1881, he was living in the Brough of Chelsea and in 1891, in Kensal Rise. (Census) He may have grown up in the riverside town of Maldon, Essex. He started racing when he was 14 and moved to London. There he joined the Polytechnic cycling club in the city centre, making friends with one of the stars of the day, Bert Harris of Leicester. The two eventually toured Europe together to ride tournaments.
A year later Barden moved to the club at Catford, then in countryside south of the city. The Catford club held races in the streets of the village and built a track reputed to be the fastest in Europe. It was there that Barden's talent was notice and developed.
Racing.
In 1895 Barden rode at Catford against Jimmy Michael of Wales, who won the world's first motor-paced championship that year in Cologne. The occasion - which prompted tales of doping and fixing of races - was the so-called Chain Match. Riders who used Simpson chains were contracted to ride against those who didn't, to prove which design was superior.
Such races were held at different venues and, while most accounts say it was Catford, others say Germany. All the accounts say that Barden and Michael were pitched in a five-mile race in front of a crowd of about 15,000. They start with Michael taking a drink from his coach and manager, Choppy Warburton and end with his riding poorly to his falling off his bike, remounting and setting off in the wrong direction. 
Michael's strange behaviour led him to accuse Warburton of doping him. Barden, too, later made accusations of race-fixing and they were to ruin his career in Britain.
Barden rode the world professional track championship at Copenhagen in 1896 and Glasgow in 1897, finishing second on both occasions. His fame and looks drew huge crowds at velodromes and he was mobbed by fans wherever he went. He was English champion in 1896 and broke records from 440 yards to 10 miles.
He married his first wife, Mary, in 1897 and, by 1911, had 5 children - 2 of whom had died by then. (Census)
Accusations and downfall.
Barden's friend and his colleague in tournaments across Europe, Bert Harris, was the first English sprint champion. In one meeting in Australia he won £800 at a time a skilled worker in England earned £85 a year. Three years after his national championship, and with his career starting to fade, he rode at a meeting on the track at Aston, Birmingham on Easter Monday, 1897. He crashed in the 10-mile race, hit his head on the cement track and died on 21 April after not regaining consciousness.
Barden accused the others in the race of making him fall, cutting away his front wheel through their riding so he would not win. The National Cyclists Union held an inquiry and Barden made himself more unpopular by accusing the witnesses of "out and out lies". The issue split fans of cycling but race promoters were more united and Barden found it harder to get engagements.
He could still race on the continent and he moved to Paris. He lived there until 1899, then returned to Britain and retired. He died in 1962.Leicester.
Retirement.
Barden joined the Merchant Navy, sailing on a troop ship to the Boer War. He moved to Leicester, where Bert Harris had lived, and married a girl in the city. He opened a shop in Saffron Lane, Leicester, where a cycle track was later built, then worked at Bentley Engineering in the city. He joined the Working Men's Club but rarely spoke of his career.

Restitution in English law

Restitution in English law is a remedy which aims to restore to an innocent person the gains which someone else has. Restitution, which focuses on gains, is meant to be the counterpart of compensation, which focuses on losses. In English law you may seek restitution from another person's unjust enrichment at your expense, or restitution in the case of certain wrongs (breach of fiduciary duty, some contracts, some torts) where one falls into a category that the law recognises as creating a legitimate interest over the growth of another's assets.
Restitution for unjust enrichment.
Restitution, where a gain is taken away, is the standard remedy for unjust enrichment, where someone has made a gain at the expense of another person, and the law recognises no relevant defence.
Restitution for wrongs.
Restitution for wrongs refers to a remedy where a gain can be taken away (or 'stripped', 'disgorged', etc) from a defendant who has committed a wrong, either a tort, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of confidence.

EMacambini

eMacambini is a rural area in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa which is mostly populated by members of the Macambini clan. It is near Mandeni on the Zululand coast, just north of Durban and close to the new King Shaka International Airport. 
Threatened Eviction.
In November 2008, the community of eMacambini held a 5,000 strong march of about 10 km to protest the proposed AmaZulu World development to be built by Ruwaad Holdings from Dubai. Earlier in the year, Ruwaad signed a memorandum of understanding with KZN Premier S’bu Ndebele. The planned R44m development by Ruwaad will occupy 16,500ha. In addition to the AmaZulu World Theme Park, plans include the largest shopping centre in Africa, a game reserve, six golf courses, residential facilities, sports fields and a statue of Shaka at the Thukela river mouth. To achieve this, the proposed development necessitates that the eMacambini community is going to be displaced from their rural land and rehoused on less land in a suburban township. If the plan goes ahead, 29 schools, 300 churches, three clinics and brand-new RDP houses will be demolished. Especially relevant to the community would be the demolishing of ancestral graves. In all, between 20,000 and 50,000 people in the region will be forcibly removed. 
Protest.
On the 4th of December 2008, the eMacambini community blockaded the N2 and R102 freeways to protest S'bu Ndebele's non-reply to their memorandum handed over in a previous march. Police responded with rubber bullets injuring about 50 people and arresting 10. There were reports that many shot were innocent bystanders pulled out of their homes. There are also reports that many of the 10 people arrested were refused medical treatment. Police have justified their actions by claiming that residents threw stones at oncoming cars. 
Support.
The community is working closely with The Poor People's Alliance and has also lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission and as of December 2008 has planned to challenge the legality of the proposed development. 
On 16 January 2008 the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions in Geneva issued an open letter to S'bu Ndebele strongly condemning the proposed evictions and the violent police response to protests against it.

Robert Chandler (September 25, 1928 – December 11, 2008) was an American television executive who helped create and oversee the television newsmagazine "60 Minutes" during his 22-year tenure at CBS News.
He was born Robert Zuckerkandle in Brooklyn, New York on September 25, 1928, one of two sons of Louis and Minnie Gurin Zuckerkandle. Chandler was used by him as a pen name before he had his name legally changed. He attended the City College of New York, where he was the editor of the college newspaper and met his future wife, the former Eleanor Reiff. He graduated from CCNY in 1949 with a degree in economics.
Chandler was hired by "Variety" as a music reporter, where he worked for several years, interrupted by service in the United States Army in Germany from 1951 to 1953, after which he covered radio and television upon his return. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired him in 1961 to serve as publicity director for its television division.
In 1963, Chandler was hired by CBS News as its director of information services. He later served as vice president in charge of public affairs broadcasts, where he was an advocate of implementing Don Hewitt's proposed "60 Minutes" format, in which several standalone segments would be broadcast rather than the standard documentary format in which the same subject was covered for the entire hour. The first broadcast of "60 Minutes" was on September 24, 1968. During the 1970s, Chandler approved the program's stories and finances, and helped bring Andy Rooney to the program. Don Hewitt credited Chandler for his role in the program, stating that "In my more than half a century at CBS News, I don't recall anyone having a better fix on what 60 Minutes should be than Bob Chandler". Chandler was named vice president for administration and assistant to the president of CBS News in 1975.
While with CBS News, he was responsible for production of "The People of South Vietnam: How They Feel About the War", a March 1967 documentary that he wrote and co-produced; "1966 National Driver’s Test" in May 1966, for which he was executive producer; and the December 1971 Emmy Award-nominated "CBS Reports: Under Surveillance" on U.S. government surveillance of dissenters, which he produced.
As director of operations for the CBS News Election Unit, Chandler was one of the creators of the CBS News Poll, which became the "New York Times"-CBS News Poll after a partner ship was established with the newspaper in 1976. Chandler retired from the CBS network in 1985. in his role with the News Election Unit, Chandler served as the CBS News member of the Board of Managers of the News Election Service, a joint organization of network and wire services that jointly monitored election results in the 1968 United States Presidential Election. He was co-executive producer of CBS News election night coverage in 1970 and 1972, and supervised the CBS News 1974 election night coverage in 1974.
He later worked for NBC News and was executive producer of the 1990 PBS documentary "Learning in America: Schools That Work".
Chandler died at age 80 on December 11, 2008 of heart failure at his home in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

Kira Maria Asenina of Bulgaria

Kira Maria Asenina () was a Bulgarian princess and empress consort (tsarina), second wife of George I of Bulgaria. She was the daughter of tsar Mitso Asen of Bulgaria and his wife Maria. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.
History.
Through her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Irene Komnene of Epirus. She was also the sister of tsar Ivan Asen III, who seized the Bulgarian throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.
She married the Bulgaro-Cuman nobleman George Terter in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, Maria, and sent her and their son, Theodore Svetoslav, as hostages to the Byzantine Empire. He was accordingly made a "despotēs", the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of "despoina".
Ivan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled Tarnovo in 1280 and escaped to the Byzantine Empire. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new "tsarina".
However, she was very unpopular in Tarnovo, because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in Constantinople. According to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. Patriarch Yoakim of Bulgaria threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the Byzantine Empire and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.
Children.
According to Georgius Pachymeres Ana Terter, wife of Serbian king Stefan Uroš II Milutin, was the daughter of Kira Maria and George Terter.

Background.
Peter Tidemand Malling was born in Strømsø (now part of Drammen), in Buskerud County, Norway. His parents were Michael Malling (1776–1834) and Maren Elisabeth Klein (1777–1856). After schooling at Strømsø, Malling went to grammar school in Drammen.
Malling apprenticed with Carl F. Rode, the first book printer in Drammen. In 1827, he traveled to Amsterdam, where his mother had family, and was employed by a larger printer. In 1829 he was employed as a factor for T. Winther printing-lithographic institution in Christiania.

Operation Vrbas '92

Operation Vrbas 92 () was a military offensive undertaken by the Army of Republika Srpska ("Vojska Republike Srpske" – VRS) in June–October 1992, during the Bosnian War. Objective of the operation was destruction of a salient around the town of Jajce in central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held by combined forces of the Croatian Defence Council ("Hrvatsko vijeće obrane" – HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ("Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine" – ARBiH). Intensity of fighting varied considerably and involved several major VRS offensive efforts interspersed by relative lulls in fighting. On 29 October, the VRS successfully captured Jajce.
The fighting improved safety of VRS lines of communication south of Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka, while producing approximately 40,000 refugees. The ARBiH and the HVO deployed in Jajce suffered not only from numerical and firepower inferiority to the VRS, but also from inadequate staff work, compounded by lack of coordination between separate command and control structures maintained by the two forces throughout the battle. The defence of Jajce also suffered from worsening Croat–Bosniak relations and skirmishes between the ARBiH and the HVO along the resupply route to Jajce. Ultimately, the outcome of the battle itself added fuel to the conflict spiraling towards the Croat–Bosniak War. The VRS saw the cracking of the ARBiH–HVO alliance as a very significant outcome of the operation.
Background.
As the Yugoslav People's Army ("Jugoslovenska narodna armija" – JNA) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan, aimed at implementation of a ceasefire to allow negotiations of a political settlement there, the JNA was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army and later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska ("Vojska Republike Srpske" – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. On 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.
The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ("Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine" – ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council ("Hrvatsko vijeće obrane" – HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the Croatian Army ("Hrvatska vojska" – HV), which occasionally supported HVO operations. In late April, the VRS was able to deploy 200,000 troops, hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces ("Hrvatske obrambene snage" – HOS) could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons, while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100,000 troops, small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons. Arming of the various forces was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991. By mid-May 1992, the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Even though the Graz agreement, negotiated by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed cessation of hostilities between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Timeline.
While the fighting related to Operation Corridor 92 was still in progress, the VRS prepared to attack and destroy a salient around the town of Jajce in central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held jointly by the HVO and the ARBiH. The salient threatened Bosnian Serb lines of communication south of VRS-held Banja Luka and contained two hydroelectric power plants critical for electrical supply of Banja Luka region. The salient was held by between 3,400 and 5,500 HVO and ARBiH troops manning strong fortifications in difficult terrain. The VRS committed 7,000–8,000 troops of the 30th Infantry Division of the 1st Krajina Corps to the offensive codenamed Operation Vrbas '92. The 30th Division was under command of Colonel Stanislav Galić, until he was replaced by Colonel Dragan Marčetić in early September. The VRS troops included the 1st, 11th and 17th Light Infantry Brigades and 1st Mixed Antitank Artillery Battalion. Besides the numerical superiority, the VRS held a clear advantage in armour, deploying 20–30 tanks and adding 30–50 heavy artillery pieces to the force. Defence of Jajce was organised at municipal crisis headquarters level by mayor Midhat Karadžić, while the HVO force in Jajce was commanded by Stjepan Blažević.
Initial combat.
The Jajce salient was supported via a road running through a narrow corridor to the town of Travnik. In July, the VRS attempted to cut the supply corridor and isolate Jajce from Travnik before any effort was made to capture the salient, but the attacks failed to accomplish any significant headway. This prompted the VRS to switch to a gradual advance along three separate axes converging on Jajce directly instead. The move was designed to minimize VRS casualties and allow a systematic elimination of HVO and ARBiH defences around the town. ARBiH-HVO successfully defended Jajce from the VRS, in part thanks to the area's mountainous surroundings. In the same month, feuding between the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) over political control began and the HVO forcibly disbanded the Bosniak-led war presidency in Jajce in exchange for one that was pro-Croat.
The VRS launched the first major attack along the western approach to Jajce in mid-August. The attack pushed through the town's defences and the VRS arrived to within of Jajce. After this breakthrough, the frontline stabilised for nearly a month before the VRS made another push towards Jajce. The advance came from the southwest of the town and the defenders were pushed back to within from the town. In order to relieve Jajce, the ARBiH and the HVO launched a joint attack north of Bugojno and Novi Travnik against a flank of the VRS force attacking Jajce, but the offensive failed—gaining no ground at all and hardly making any impact on the VRS deployments around Jajce. The VRS continued shelling Jajce and started small-scale airstrikes in the area. That led the United Nations (UN) to declare the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysis concluded that it is possible that the failure of the ARBiH–HVO counterattack prompted the HVO to agree on a truce with the VRS on 9 October. Besides a ceasefire, the agreement promised the Bosnian Serbs unrestricted power supply from the hydroelectric power plants in Jajce salient. The agreement was signed by Mate Boban, president of the self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, and Radovan Karadžić, president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, and the ARBiH took no part.
The final attack.
The distrust generated by the separate agreement was compounded by deteriorating relations between the ARBiH and the HVO in the area of nearby town of Prozor, and Novi Travnik in late summer. The strained relations escalated rapidly and led to an armed clash between the two forces in Novi Travnik on 18 October. Low-scale conflicts spread in the region, and the two forces engaged each other along the supply route to Jajce three days later, on 21 October, as a result of an ARBiH roadblock set up the previous day on authority of the "Coordinating Committee for the Protection of Muslims" rather than the ARBiH command. Just as the roadblock was dismantled, a new skirmish occurred in the town of Vitez the following day. The developments also meant that supply of ammunition for Jajce defenders was unable to move further than Prozor, and prompted the commander of the HVO Central Bosnia Operational Zone Colonel Tihomir Blaškić to consider pulling a part of the HVO troops from Jajce to reopen the Jajce–Prozor route. Blaškić's position was weakened by the HVO headquarters since 18 October, when a quarter of heavy weapons at his disposal were removed to Čapljina, ahead of HV's Operation Vlaštica aimed at Dubrovnik hinterland. The overall poor situation culminated in the Battle of Prozor fought between the HVO and the ARBiH. The battle began on 23 October, just after the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) managed to calm the situation in Vitez and Novi Travnik. End of fighting in and around Prozor was arranged on 26 October, coming into effect two days later.
The VRS seized the opportunity to launch a fresh advance towards Jajce amid ARBiH–HVO clashes, attacking along three axes towards the town on 25 October. Putting their conflict aside, the HVO and the ARBiH deployed in Jajce fought back for four days before the VRS entered the town on 29 October. As the VRS capture of the town appeared inevitable, the defending force pulled out. After capture, Serbian radio and television declared Jajce a "liberated town" and a part of "the free Serbian republic".
Aftermath.
After the VRS entered Jajce, the HVO and the ARBiH pulled out from the remainder of the salient towards Travnik. They were joined by the civilian population of Jajce, forming a 40,000-strong column of refugees that stretched and among which thousands were vulnerable to VRS sniping and shelling. Upon their arrival in Travnik, the refugees were attended to by the UNHCR staff assisted by the UNPROFOR troops. Approximately 20,000 Bosniak refugees from Jajce were resettled in central Bosnia and Herzegovina providing manpower for several new ARBiH brigades. Croat refugees headed toward Croatia due to rising tensions in central Bosnia and Herzegovina and overcrowding in Travnik. By November the pre-war population of Jajce had shrunken from 45,000 to just several thousand. Bosniaks had previously accounted for 39 percent of the population, Croats 35 percent, and Serbs 19 percent.
While the conflict between the HVO and the ARBiH contributed to weakening of defence of Jajce, the military superiority of the VRS was the principal cause of its successful conclusion of Operation Vrbas '92. Besides the advantage in troop size and firepower, VRS staff work and planning was significantly superior to the organisational efforts of the defenders of Jajce. The principal problem for the defence of Jajce was that the town was defended by two separate command structures, one having authority over ARBiH troops and the other over HVO units.
Humanitarian workers and foreign military observers had suspicions that Croatian defense abandoned Jajce and further territories lost in the Operation Corridor 92 to VRS in exchange for the Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied that, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an agreement to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka reached in October by Franjo Tuđman, president of Croatia, and Dobrica Ćosić, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also been a part of the Vance plan accepted by Croatia and Yugoslavia in late 1991 though.
It is unclear who pulled out of Jajce first and it remains a point of "mutual recrimination". Bosniaks complained that the HVO was to blame for loss of Jajce since its units were the first to pull out when the VRS entered the town. Conversely, the Bosnian Croat leader, Božo Raić, publicly complained about the ARBiH conduct in the central Bosnia and Herzegovina, blaming extremists among the ARBiH personnel for hindering resupply of Jajce. His stance was reflected in Croatian daily "Večernji list". The newspaper assumed a confrontational position regarding Bosniaks, while trying to make clear that not all of the Bosniak leadership were enemies of Croats. The Croat–Bosniak relations gradually deteriorated and culminated into Croat–Bosniak War by 1993. In October 1993, VRS Major General Momir Talić, in command of the 1st Krajina Corps during Operation Vrbas '92, said that the capture of Jajce was the first step in dismantling of the alliance between the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks. The Croat–Bosniak rift would not be mended before the Washington Agreement signed in March 1994, but not completely. After the HVO recaptured Jajce in HV-led Operation Mistral in 13 September 1995, the town was Croatised, and Bosniak refugees were not allowed to return. By 1998, most Croat refugees had returned to Jajce, while only 5,000 Bosniaks did so.
In 2008, the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina indicted two members of the VRS for war crimes committed against Bosniaks in September 1992, citing the killing of 23 Bosniak civilians and wounding of a number of others. In 2010, the Prosecutor's Office began an investigation against seven members of the ARBiH, HVO, and Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) on suspicions they committed war crimes between 27 May and 29 October 1992 against 35 Serb civilians including the murder of at least 15.

Flora and fauna.
Most of the native flora and fauna of Vattavada have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the north east, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park to the north, the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south and the proposed Palani Hills National Park to the east. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including Nilgiri Thar, the Grizzled Giant Squirrel, the Nilgiri Wood-pigeon, Elephant, the Gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the Sambar, and the Neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years). and special thing is it center for Munnar , Kodaikanal and marayur

Mongolian Revolution of 1911

The Mongolian Revolution of 1911 (Mongolian National Liberation Revolution) occurred when the region of Outer Mongolia declared its independence from the Manchu Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution. A combination of factors including economic hardship and failure to resist Western imperialism led many in China to be unhappy with the Qing government. When a new program to colonize Mongolia with Han Chinese and assimilate the natives was unveiled, it was met with resistance that resulted in a relatively bloodless separation from the Qing Empire. Many Barga and Southern Mongolian chieftains assisted in the revolution and became the revolution leaders. All Barga, Dariganga, Khovd, Huvsgul region, 26 hoshuns of Ili region (Dzungarian Oirads), 24 hoshuns from Upper Mongolian 29 hosnuns, 35 hoshuns from the Southern Mongolian 49 hosnuns sent statements to join Central Mongolia.
The setting of Outer Mongolia.
By the early 20th century, Mongolia was impoverished. Repercussions from the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) were primarily responsible for this economic deterioration. Loss of tax revenue from south China during the rebellion and expenses for its suppression had depleted the Qing treasury. Silver, rather than livestock as was the custom, became the primary medium for paying taxes. The major source of silver for Mongolians was from loans borrowed from Chinese merchants. These loans, transacted at crippling interest rates, were repaid in livestock, which was then exported to China. The result was a catastrophic decline in the size of the herds upon which the livelihood of Mongolians depended.
A disintegrating economy, growing debt, and increasing tax demands were ingredients of social and political unrest in Mongolia. However, it was Qing plans for the transformation of Outer Mongolia that produced the impetus for rebellion.
The “New Administration”.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1911) was founded by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today Northeast China (also known as Manchuria). They were certainly not the first non-Han people to rule all of China, but the fate of these previous dynasties had always been the same: they invaded; they governed; they intermarried; and eventually they merged, more or less becoming Chinese themselves. Attempts were made to keep the Manchu strain ethnically pure, although these efforts proved fruitless. The early Manchu rulers enacted various laws to isolate Manchuria from China proper (Eighteen Provinces) and Mongolia. They did the same for the Mongols: Han Chinese were prohibited from entering Mongolia and Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden from speaking the Chinese language or intermarrying with the Chinese. While over time enforcement waned, the laws still remained on the books, receiving at least token observance.
Western imperialism in China during the latter part of the 19th century changed political priorities in China. The Qing defeat by the Japanese in 1895 (First Sino-Japanese War), followed shortly afterwards by the German seizure of Shantung and the "scramble for concessions" that followed dramatically proved the inadequacy of previous Qing efforts to resist the West. The Boxer Rebellion, and particularly Japan’s victory over Russia in 1905, were widely interpreted in China as the triumph of constitutionalism over autocracy. It was then that far-reaching economic, political, and military reforms, known as the “New Administration” ("Xin zheng"), were ordered.
In Outer Mongolia, however, the New Administration was accented rather differently. The aim was not simply modernization, as it was in Han Chinese territories, but cultural assimilation. Russia’s occupation of the Liaodong Peninsula in 1898 and then of Northern Manchuria in 1900 excited the Qing government's fears of a larger Russian design on the entire northern frontier of their empire. The Qing rulers believed that survival of their state as an integral entity depended on the effectiveness of their frontier serving as a protective “shield” (in the language of the time) for China proper. To accomplish this, the peoples inhabiting this region would have to become Chinese.
Between 1901 and 1910, therefore, the Qing government inaugurated an expansive plan for Chinese colonization of the frontier and reorganization of its native governments (though the colonization of lands in Inner Mongolia by the Chinese has started much earlier). A decree in 1910 abrogating the old prohibitions against Chinese settling in Outer Mongolia, Chinese and Mongols intermarrying, and Mongols using the Chinese language was the final step toward dismantling that wall of isolation that the Manchus had erected centuries earlier. 
In early 1910 the Qing government appointed Sando (or Sandowa), a Manchu himself and former deputy lieutenant governor of Guihwa, as viceroy of Mongolia in the capital city of Urga (modern Ulan Bator), to implement the New Administration. He immediately set about organizing twenty offices to oversee such matters as the military, taxation, police, government and commerce. Plans were made for the colonization of Mongolia with Chinese farmers. In January 1911 a Lieutenant Colonel Tang Zaili arrived to supervise the organization of a Mongolian army, half of which was to consist of Mongolian herdsmen. A 400-room barracks was erected near Urga. The Mongolians saw in all this a threat to their very survival. Their desperation was echoed in a petition to the Qing government: “Among the many directives repeatedly issued, there is not one which benefits the Mongolians. Consequently, we all desire that we be allowed to live according to our ancient ways.” The arrogance and brutality of Tang Zaili’s staff and military escort did not help.
Mongolian resistance.
No more than a month after Sando’s arrival, a brawl broke out between some intoxicated lamas (Buddhist priests) and Chinese at a Chinese carpentry shop in Urga. Such incidents were not unknown in the past, but they had been firmly suppressed by Qing officials. This one developed differently. When Sando arrived at Gandan Monastery, the principal monastery in the city, to make arrests, the lamas pelted him and his troops with stones, forcing them to withdraw. Sando demanded that the Jebstundamba Khutuktu (variously spelled), the spiritual leader in Urga of the Mongolians, surrender a particular lama believed to be the ringleader of the incident. The Khutuktu refused and Sando fined him. In response, the Mongolians petitioned the Qing government to remove Sando, but without success.
Other incidents followed, all underscoring the diminished authority of Sando: A minor noble, Togtokh Taij, with a small band, had with the connivance of local Mongolian officials plundered several Chinese merchant shops in eastern Mongolia. Sando dispatched two detachments of soldiers to capture Togtokh. They were led into a trap by their Mongolian guide; most were killed. Mongolian princes resisted providing soldiers for Sando’s army. And the prince of the khoshuun which Togtokh had raided refused Sando’s demand to pay compensation to the plundered Chinese merchants.
The decision for independence.
By the spring of 1911, some prominent Mongolian nobles including Prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence. The Khutukhtu consented. To avoid suspicion, he used as a pretext the occasion of a religious festival, at which time the assembled leaders would discuss the need to reapportion taxes among the khoshuuns. The meeting occurred on July 10 and the Mongolians discussed whether it would be better to submit to or resist the will of the Qings. The assembly became deadlocked, some arguing for complete, others for partial, resistance. Eighteen nobles decided to take matters into their hands. Meeting secretly in the hills outside of Urga, they decided that Mongolia must declare its independence. They then persuaded the Khutuktu to send a delegation of three prominent representatives—a secular noble, an ecclesiastic, and a lay official from Inner Mongolia—to Russia for assistance. The particular composition of the delegation—a noble, a cleric, and a commoner—may have been intended to invest the mission with a sense of national consensus.
The delegation to St. Petersburg brought with it a letter signed in the name of the Khutuktu and the “four khans of Khalkha.” It asked for assistance against the Chinese, including arms, and implied that Russian troops would be needed against a Chinese unit which the Mongolians believed was at that moment advancing into Mongolia. To coax a commitment, the Mongols promised economic concessions in return. The letter itself was unclear as to the specific type of relationship the Mongols wished to establish with Russia. Russia wanted to include Outer Mongolia in its sphere of influence and as a buffer state offering protection from China and Japan, but never planned to make it a part of her empire. The Russian government decided to support, by diplomatic rather than by military means, not full independence for Mongolia, but autonomy within the Qing empire. It did, however, increase its consular guard in Urga to protect the returning delegation.
The Russian minister in Beijing was then instructed to inform the Qing government that the Mongols had sent a delegation to St. Petersburg complaining of Chinese immigration, military build-up, and administrative reorganization. He stated that Russia could not but be concerned about these developments, in view of the common boundary shared with Khalkha, and cautioned that China would have to bear the consequences if this warning were ignored.
Independence.
On learning of the Mongolian mission to Russia, the Qing government instructed Sando to investigate. Sando immediately summoned the head of the Khutukhtu’s ecclesiastical administration ("Ikh shav’"), the Erdene Shanzav, and demanded an explanation. The Erdene Shanzav, pleading that he had not been involved, revealed the entire plot. Sando then demanded that the Khutuktu withdraw his request for Russian troops. The Khutuktu agreed, provided that Sando dismantle the New Administration. Sando cabled to Beijing for instructions, and was told that parts of the New Administration could be delayed.
The moment was ripe for conciliation. Sando chose to bully instead. He ordered the princes in Urga to sign a statement that only a few individuals had been responsible for the appeal to Russia. The princes did give such a declaration, but only orally. Sando then ordered the Mongolians to have no further contact with the Russian consulate, threatening in case of disobedience to bring an additional 500 troops to Urga and to arm the Chinese population in the city. He posted sentries around the Khutuktu’s palace with orders to bar Russian visitors. And he sent a contingent of troops to the Russian-Mongolian border to intercept the Mongolian delegation to Russia on its return.
Events of seismic proportions were then taking place in China proper. On October 10 there was an uprising in Wuchang and a revolution against the minority ruling class had begun. One province after another declared its independence from the Qing authority. Believing that his position was untenable, Sando wired the Beijing government asking for permission to resign, but his request was denied. In the meantime, the Mongolian delegation to Russia secretly returned, and reported the results of its trip to a group of princes and lamas. They composed a joint memorial to the Khutukhtu asking what Mongolia should do in lieu of the provincial uprisings. He advised that Mongolians form a state of their own.
Buoyed by the Khutuktu’s support and by the impending collapse of the Qing Dynasty, the Provisional Government of Khalkha was formed, headed by some prominent Khalkha nobles. On November 28, the government ordered all four provinces ("aimag") of Khalkha to mobilize a thousand soldiers each. Almost immediately 500 men from the neighboring khoshuuns had gathered in Urga. Two days later, Sando received a letter, signed in the name of the nobles and lamas of Khalkha, stating that they had heard of a secessionist movement in China, and that Chinese troops of the “revolutionary party” were preparing to march on Urga from Inner Mongolia. The letter went on to state that, in view of the benefit obtained by the Khalkhas from the Qing in the past, the Khutuktu had ordered the mobilization of 4000 troops to advance on Beijing to defend the Emperor. Sando was asked to provide these men with provisions and arms. He was given three hours to reply. No reply came. Abandoning this thin deception, a delegation of nobles and lamas visited the amban’s office, and informed him of their decision to declare independence and to install the Khutuktu as emperor. Sando pleaded with the delegation. He admitted that what had come to pass was the result of his own folly, and he promised to recommend full autonomy for Mongolia, but not independence. The delegation curtly replied that it had come simply to deliver a message, not to debate it. Sando was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours.
There was little Sando could do. He had only 150 troops, who in any event were in a refractory mood because of arrears in back pay. On the following day, his soldiers were disarmed by Mongolian militiamen, as well as Russian Cossacks of the consular convoy under command of Grigory Semyonov, future Ataman. Sando and his staff moved into the compound of the Russian consulate for their own safety.
On 30 November, 1911 the Mongols established Temporary Government of 
Khalkha.On December 5, Sando left Mongolia with Russian escort. Chinese authority in the rest of the country collapsed quickly after that. Later that month or in January 1912 (sources differ) the Military Governor of Uliastai in western Mongolia, his staff and military guards, peacefully departed under the protection of Cossack troops. The Deputy Military Governor of Khovd, however, decided to resist, hoping for reinforcements from Xinjiang. The troops came too late: the town was surrounded by Mongolian troops, reinforcement detachment was crushed. In August 1912, his stronghold was overcome by Mongolian troops, and he and his staff were escorted out of the country by Cossacks.
On December 1, the Provisional Government of Khalkha issued a general proclamation announcing the end of Qing rule and the establishment of a theocracy under the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. At the end of the month, on December 29, the Khutuktu was formally installed as the "Bodg Khaan" ("Great Khan", or "Emperor") of the new Mongolian state. This ushered in Bogd Khaan era, 1911-1919.
The Mongolian revolution was for the most part an orderly transference of power. Its relatively peaceful character was due to the realism of Qing authorities in Mongolia, and in no small part to the presence of Russian troops, who provided protection for these authorities and Chinese troops.
Role of Russia.
The role of the Russians in this revolution (and later in the revolution of 1921) has been controversial. Chinese historians especially have often explained the events of 1911 as the product of "Tsarist provocations and manipulations". This conclusion however contradicts with archival materials from Russia and Mongolia. The movement for independence in Outer Mongolia was to a large extent the reaction to the new Qing policies aimed at assimilating the Mongols by Han Chinese. Russian imperial government preferred to see Outer Mongolia as a buffer state against Chinese and Japanese influences on the Russian borders in Siberia, a dependent state or autonomy of China. The revolution also reflected a growing sense of nationalism on the part of the Mongolians, and their desire to form a nation state, political and social forces that were at work in China at that time as well.

Rosedale Park, Detroit

Rosedale Park is a historic district located in Detroit, Michigan. It is roughly bounded by Fenkell, Outer Drive, Grand River Avenue, Southfield Freeway, Glastonbury Street, Lyndon Street and Westwood Drive. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The Rosedale Park district has the largest number of individual properties of any district nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan, with 1533.
The district contains primarily brick houses, and was largely developed from the late 1920s through the 1940s.
History.
The land on which Rosedale Park sits was originally deeded in 1835 to Otis C. Freeman and George Bellamy as two 80-acre (32 ha) parcels. Over time, these parcels were subdivided until in 1916 the Rosedale Park Land Development Company purchased and platted a large portion of what was to become the Rosedale Park Historic District. This development company platted other projects in addition to Rosedale Park, most notably the North Rosedale Park neighborhood directly across Grand River Avenue. The company considered the location amenable to development because of its proximity to Grand River Avenue, a direct link to downtown Detroit, and the contemporaneous construction of Outer Drive.
Interest in the new subdivision was immediate, and in 1917, the Rosedale Park Land Development Company platted an addition to the original area. However, the actual construction in the neighborhood was slow—from 1917 until the end of World War I, only 15 houses had been constructed. However, construction soon blossomed, and in 1921 a third addition was platted. The city of Detroit annexed the subdivision in 1926, bringing water and sewer to the neighborhood and making the area more attractive.
Compared with other contemporary neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse Pointes, Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and upper-middle class status of the original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in the booming automobile industry.
With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, building in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there was a house on nearly every lot in the neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association.
Description.
The Rosedale Park Historic District is residential in character. Primary streets run north-south, and major stone piers mark the primary entrances into the neighborhood. Traffic islands are placed in the center of many of the streets. Oak and maple trees, some planted in the 1910s and 1920s, line the streets.
Private architects were only rarely engaged in Rosedale Park construction. Instead, buyers gained inspiration from mass-produced pattern books and house plans, or worked with construction companies to choose plans from their standard offerings. Between 1917 and 1955, houses were built in a multitude of styles, including English Tudor Revival, Arts and Crafts, Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial, American Foursquare, Prairie, French Renaissance, Ranch, Garrison Colonial, Cape Cod and International style. However, an English country esthetic seems to have been encouraged (although not mandated) by the developers, and this seems to have influenced the renaming of many of the subdivision's streets, such as Glastonbury and Warwick, to names reflective of Merry Old England. Later houses built in the less prosperous late 1930s and early 1940s are less elaborate Colonial and Ranch styles, but even these tend to have Tudor Revival elements.
Education.
Residents are zoned to Detroit Public Schools,
For elementary school most areas are zoned to Gompers K-8 School in Brightmoor while some are zoned to Cooke Elementary School. All residents are zoned to Gompers K-8 for middle school and Frank Cody High School for high school.
The current Gompers Elementary-Middle School, serving Grades PreK-8, opened in 2011. The two story, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified facility replaced the Gompers, Harding, and Vetal schools and was built on the Harding site for $21.4 million. It has an elementary wing and a middle school wing. The central administration suite, gymnasium, and multi-purpose room are between the two wings.
Previously Vetal K-8 served portions of Rosedale Park for elementary school, and Vetal and Murphy served portions of Rosedale Park for middle school. At one time residents of Rosedale Park were zoned to Redford High School.

Harry Pruett

Harry George Pruett, born in Bristol in 1890 and died at Clifton, Bristol on 22 January 1948, was a cricketer who played two first-class matches for Somerset, one in 1921 and the other in 1926.
Pruett batted at No 11 in both Somerset innings of the match against Derbyshire at Bath, and was out for a duck both times. He did not bowl in this match, which Somerset won. Almost five years later, he had been promoted to No 10 for his second match, against Yorkshire at Huddersfield, and responded with five in the first innings and two in the second as Somerset lost the match heavily. He also bowled nine overs in Yorkshire's only innings, not taking a wicket and conceding 49 runs.
Cricket websites agree that he bowled left-handed, but do not indicate a style: there is no information on whether he batted right or left-handed.

Its auditions were held in various cities of India, like Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bangalore and Chandigarh. Following mob violence during Delhi auditions, roadies from Delhi and Mumbai were shortlisted through online auditions, followed by a Group Discussion and Interview. This is the first time in "MTV Roadies" history that Nikhil Chinnappa was replaced by Raghu's identical twin brother, Rajiv Laxman.
Roop Bhinder and Palak Johal returned as All-Stars for Roadies X - Battle for Glory. While Bhinder finished in 11th place Johal won the season.
Roadies' Selection.
Overall Count :
Journey.
Episode 1.
The first episode of the journey for the selected 20 roadies was aired on 10 January 2009. After brief introductions and partying for a while, the roadies are accosted to a place where a 'Vote-Out Stage' is set up. Rannvijay arrives and addresses them and suddenly Raghu emerges from behind Rannvijay and announces that there is going to be no vote-out. He further adds that only 10 roadies rightfully deserve to continue the journey and the remaining roadies have to prove themselves in order to continue the journey. Raghu names Devarshi, Samrat, Paulami, Kiri, Gurmeet, Tamanna, Natasha, Pradeep, Roop and Varisha as the 'safe contestants'. The other 10 roadies are told that they will be divided into two teams and perform a task to prove themselves worthy to be on the journey.
Suzanna, Sufi, Sandeep, Bobby and Nauman make up the yellow team and Ankur, Sonia, Neha, Vicky and Bhanu form the green team. The task is to cross an obstacle course and devour as many parathas as they can in 20 minutes. The catch is that they have to perform as a team with their hand and legs tied to each other. The yellow team wins by a margin of 21 to 19. The green team members are eliminated from the show but Rannvijay announces that a vote-out will take place to eliminate a roadie from the yellow team. In the vote-out,Sufi is eliminated from the show.
Episode 2.
The remaining fourteen roadies begin their journey in episode after being flagged off by previous season finalist Nihal. The journey begins for as they travel from Manesar to Pushkar on their Karizmas. Before leaving for Pushkar, they are also divided into 2 gangs, The "Blue gang" and "the Red gang". The red gang name their team ""Brats"" and consists of Suzanna, Bobby, Natasha, Kiri, Sandeep, Roop and Pradeep. While the Blue gang name their team ""Om Blues"" and consists of Paulami, Varisha, Tamanna, Devarshi, Nauman, Gurmeet and Samrat.
In a departure from previous season, they are told that they will take part in task as gangs, and thus will earn money and immunity for their respective teams or gangs. The first Money Task takes them to the Pushkar Mela where they need to collect as much cattle dung as they could. In the Immunity task, the girls get tested on their Hindi vocabulary. While the correct answer by the girls wins some points for their respective teams, the wrong answer penalises the guys with the guys getting hit between their legs. "Om Blues" loses the immunity task and in the voteout there is a tie between Varisha and Paulomi. For the tiebreaker, the "Brats" participate in a vote out to eliminate either of Varisha and Paulami. In the resulting tiebreaker vote-out, Varisha is eliminated from the show.
Episode 3.
The episode starts with Tamanna blaming Gurmeet for Varisha's vote-out. This creates friction between both of them. Next day, the roadies are told to perform a popular classical folk-dance of Rajasthan - Kalbelia and Kachchi-Ghodi as their next money task. They are supposed to perform the dance in front of a live audience. Rannvijay informs the roadies, that in accordance with the local tradition, if the audience does not like the performance, then they will fling their shoes on the contestants to express their displeasure. The "Brats" win the money task again and their account is credited with Rs. 30,000 taking the total amount of their team to Rs. 80,000.
The episode starts with the two teams receiving a scroll telling them to choose two members from their team who they wish to eliminate. The Brats choose Kiri and Suzzana while the Om Blues decide on Samrat and Paulomee. But at the site of immunity task when Rannvijay asks the Om Blues, Palak nominates Dev and Tamanna. The task is a tight rope race in a Best-of-3 contest. Dev and Tamanna win the task and they get to choose two members from their team who will be voted against in the vote-out in addition to Kiri and Suzzana. At the vote-out Tamanna and Dev choose Palak and Samrat and in the vote-out Palak is eliminated. As the Om Blues were left with just five members and the Brats had seven, so to even it out one member of the Brats had to switch to the Om Blues. In the resulting vote Bobby, Kiri and Suzzana each get three votes and finally Om Blues choose Kiri to join them.
Episode 4.
In this episode the roadies head towards Mount Abu. Here, the roadies are provided with a sumptuous meal and soon after their lunch, Rannvijay emerges to announce that this is going to be their next money task. He asks each gang to select 4 roadies from their teams who will be fed laxative tablets. The task is to see which team can hold out the longest without relieving themselves. For each hour they hold out, their team gets Rs. 25,000. Brats selected Pradeep, Roop, Natasha and Bobby, whereas Om Blues select all the four boys among them, i.e. Samrat, Nauman, Kiri and Devarshi. After holding out for two hours, Bobby rushes to the loo and thus Om Blues win their first money task.
The Immunity task of the episode was "Pot Balancing Race", for which each gang is asked to select "the least deserving roadie among them". In this task, the participants have to balance 3 earthen pots on their head in race to the finish line. Brats picks Bobby and Om Blues selects Paulami for the task. Paulami defeats Bobby in both the races and is declared a winner. However, as a twist to the tale, Paulami and all members of Brats (except Bobby) get immunity. In the vote out, Nauman is eliminated.
Episode 5.
The episode starts with the roadies heading towards Gandhinagar. On their way to Gandhinagar, Bobby meets with an accident and gets injured. As they reach Gandhinagar, the roadies are told that they have to camp and live in tents. The roadies are then taken to a poolside where they are told that they notice a pool table immersed in a swimming pool. Rannvijay announces that for their next money task they have to play pool while holding their breath inside the water. Bobby backs out of the task due to her injuries. Om Blues win this task and pocket Rs. 70,000 in this task, taking their total earnings to Rs.120,000.
At night, the roadies have a surprise Q & A session in which each roadie gets to ask another roadie an anonymous question. This session builds up more friction and animosity amongst the roadies. Next morning, the roadies leave for Varsoda which is the location of their next immunity task. Here, they are taken to a palace which is allegedly haunted. Both the gangs are asked to explore the place where to their surprise they find Raghu and Rajeev sitting in two separate rooms as they enter.
The twins assign the teams their new immunity task, that of selecting one member from their respective teams to be shut inside a casket, the catch being that the person who is shut inside the casket is immediately eliminated while his remaining gang members attain immunity. The gang which does this task fastest attains immunity. Devarshi of "Om blues" volunteers to enter the casket without any opposition from his team-mates, while the Brats bully and force Bobby to enter the casket citing her injury. A very reluctant Bobby initially refuses, but finally gives in and enters the casket. The rest of the roadies of Om Blues are relieved that they don't have to enter the casket, and they come out of the room immediately, and thus winning the immunity.
Raghu and Rajiv (cousin), surprised by the Devarshi's willingness to be eliminated, give him a severe tongue-lashing for being so stupid, and send him off the show. However Raghu, reprimands the "Brats" for bullying Bobby into getting into the casket and in a twist to the tale award her with immunity. They also give her the power to choose two people from her gang who will get to be immune from the vote-out along with her. Bobby chooses Sandeep and Pradeep to be immune from vote-out. In the vote-out, Roop is eliminated. This was a shock since Roop was supposed to be the mastermind. It turned out that Samrat along with Suzzana and Natasha has masterminded Roop's vote out.
Episode 6.
After Roop's vote-out, roadies travel to Silvassa. Here, they are taken to a tribal hamlet where Rannvijay and Raghu greet the roadies. After a traditional tribal dance performance, Raghu announces that from this point onwards each roadie is independent and the gangs would cease to exist. For their immunity task, the Roadies are asked to wrestle in a traditional wrestling ring (Akhara). There would be two bouts, one for girls and the second for guys. To eliminate an opponent, one would have to push them out of the ring, and the last man standing would be the winner. Raghu also announces that the boy and the girl who win the immunity task will also get a chance to win Rs 2lac cash which the "Gangs" had accumulated so far.
Samrat fights off Sandeep while Kiri wrestles Pradeep. Samrat eliminates Sandeep and while Pradeep and Kiri were wrestling each other Samrat manages to shove them out of the ring, thereby winning immunity. Among the girls, Bobby excuses herself from the fight citing her injury which leaves 4 girls to wrestle each other. Suzanna chases Paulomi out of the ring. Then the fight turns ugly with Tamanna and Natasha accusing each other of tugging at each other's clothes off. Eventually, Natasha wins the immunity task.
Next day Raghu announces that there will be a contest between Samrat and Natasha to decide on who gets the Rs 2 Lac cash. However, Raghu introduces a twist by announcing that though the winner of this task may win the Prize money but he/she will have to forego the immunity. The task is an Archery task where the participants have to shoot at a rotating target. Neither Natasha or Samrat are able to hit the target, wherein Raghu gives other Roadies a go at the target. The other Roadies too fail to hit the target and hence the prize money in the "roadies account" is reset to zero. The Roadies then proceed for the vote-out where, Suzanna gets voted-out with a margin of 5-3 against Sandeep.
Episode 7.

The roadies get an envelope saying "open at your own risk". Inside that envelope it said that "you will experience hell in your next vote out". The next day, the roadies go to a theme park for their immunity task. The task is that they have to drink a milkshake and ride in the Claw, an intense ride, as many times as they can without throwing up. Nauman wins the task and gets the immunity. At the vote out, everyone votes Gurmeet out. It turns out that the hell that the roadies would experience is that the person who gets voted out, will actually be safe and that person could choose anyone who they want to get eliminated. Gurmeet eliminates Sufi.

Roadies reach their next destination Coffs Harbour. For their money task roadies have to save goals in ice hockey. The roadies win 1,40,000 rupees in this money task. This was the last money task of the season and the total prize money was declared to be INR 3,62,000.
The roadies then have to collect flags when chased by cowboys in horses with lasos. This is their immunity task. They have to stop collecting if the laso falls on them. Nauman collects 7 flags. Palak & Paulami collect 5 each. Natasha collects 6. So Nauman wins the immunity.
At vote out these is a tie between Palak & Paulami. So cards are shuffled by a professional & roadies select their vote again. This time Natasha gets 2 votes, so she is voted out.
Finally, Nauman, Palak and Paulami are top 3 roadies who make it to final destination of Australia: Sydney

Paulomi completed this task in 1 minute and 19 seconds. Palak did it in 22 seconds. Nauman did it in 10 seconds, thus winning the task and the advantage. The next day, Rannvijay told Nauman that he had the advantage of choosing his co-finalist-either Palak or Paulami. He chose Palak. But Rannvijay told him that there's gonna be a task to be conducted between the 2 girls. Palak wins. Raghu also surprised them by telling them that the final showdown will take place in India.

Episode 14.
The final episode of roadies hell down under. The pressure was immense. Nauman, Palak & Kiri had to perform rock climbing task which was a pre-final task. And the winner was given the power to take one of the other two losers. He had to cut the rope of one that he didn't want to take with him for grand finale. Kiri was way ahead of Nauman & Palak in the task. He reached the top first.
Raghu & Rajiv were standing there. They congratulated and asked Kiri which Roadie would he choose. He chose the weaker contender of the two, Palak and so Raghu got angry. Kiri said that he can beat anyone, and so Raghu said that if he can beat anyone, why doesn't he choose the stronger contender defeat him and win with respect? He had proved himself and reached the top so he should be confident enough to beat anyone in finale. But Rajiv was giving him a different option. He was saying he should easily win by choosing the weaker of two. Finally Kiri decided to win the respect & chose Nauman as his opponent for the Grand Finale & axed Palak's rope. Kiri could have won had he decided to go with Palak. But Raghu forced him to go with Nauman and subsequently he lost.
The final task took place near a lake. All the Roadies were there. It was going to finally end. The winner was going to be declared. Ranvijay encouraged them and gave an emotional speech. Then, both Nauman and Kiri got bound by chains on their hands, legs and neck. They were tied to a chain which was connected to a pan carrying heavy weights. To win, they had to pull the rope connected to the pan and use their strength and speed to walk 20 steps and pull out the Roadies flag. The race started. They both ran at first but were suddenly stopped by the force of the weight and nearly fell down. All the Roadies (except Sufi, Tamanna, Devarshi and Varisha) were cheering for Kiri. Kiri was in lead. Nauman was far behind. He even fell two times and his feet started bleeding very badly. But then he got up and used all his strength, went on and eventually won. Nauman became the Ultimate Roadie. Kiri and Nauman were called back and both got a Hero Honda Karizma bike. Nauman, being the winner of the season, also won the prize money - Rs. 3,52,000

Greeks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

The first Greek communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were established prior to the colonization of the country by Belgium. The Greek presence in the Congos reached a peak in the 1950s when many Greeks fled Egypt as their properties were seized by the nationalist government there. The Greek communities organized their own schools and churches and Greeks were active in trade, fishing, transport, coffee growing and the music industry.
History.
In the early to mid 20th century nearly all Congolese cities on the Belgian side had a Greek community and usually all hailing from a particular part of Greece as people would arrive, get settled in and send for their families. By the 1920s there were established Greek fishing and trading communities in the trading cities of Luapula and Katanga, where the Greeks plied the river trade of the Congo, ranging as far as Zambia where many settled. The traders and fishermen developed a good and likable reputation and cultivated good relations with their Congolese and Zambian colleagues as they were always ready to offer help or lend their equipment and traditional Greek skills in net and boat making. Later the Congolese Greeks played a significant role in launching the country's important music tradition by founding several recording companies like Olympia, Ngoma, Opika and others. When the country declared its independence in 1960 there were violent clashes and uncertainty followed by three decades of authoritarian rule by Mobutu Sese Seko which led to the exodus of most Greek settlers and the decline of the Greek community. Today there are about 100 Greeks left in the capital Kinshasa and 200 in Lubumbashi. The holy temple of Saint George and the Club Hellenique are the focal points of the community. In response to the 2008 humanitarian emergency in the Congo Greece dispatched $500,000 in aid.
Language.
Most Greeks speak French as their native language. Some can only speak Greek, with others speaking Bantu languages.

Acinipo

Acinipo was a city created for retired soldiers from the Roman legions more than 2,000 years ago, about 20 kilometers from Ronda, near Seville, southern Spain. The Acinipo ruins include a Roman theater still in use today. Acinipo is known locally as Ronda la Vieja, Arunda or Old Ronda, though it has a separate origin and history from Ronda.
History.
Some historians assert that Acinipo was created after the battle of Munda (45 BC), fought between the armies of Julius Caesar and the army of Pompey's two sons, Gnaeus and Sextus. To Caesar, Munda was supposed to be a mop-up action after Pompey's main forces were defeated in Greece. But Munda was no mop-up exercise. Tens of thousands of Romans were killed on both sides; there was no decisive victory for Caesar's armies; and one of Pompey's sons, Sextus, fled to fight another day as a famous rebel pirate against Caesar's successor, Augustus.
Some Spanish historians state that Munda is the Roman name for Ronda, where the battle of Munda may have been fought. According to Pliny, the battle of Munda was fought in Osuna, about 50 km north of Ronda in the province of Seville. But there is general agreement that Acinipo was created for retired veterans of Caesar's legions, while Arunda (Ronda) would be a separate Roman outpost, perhaps created before the Munda conflict for the veterans of Pompey's legions.

Computer User

Computer User is a computer magazine originally founded in 1982, and which, after several owners and fundamental changes, is still in business today online as computeruser.com. This is not to be confused with a magazine briefly published under the name of Computer User by Tandy for users of its Tandy computer.
History.
In the beginning years of publicly popular computer use, "Computer User" was originally founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota as a free monthly magazine published by Computer User, Inc. a Minnesota corporation. Steven Bianucci, Publisher. (Harvard, 1981.) Dale Archibald, Editor. Diane Teeters, Advertising Sales. (Gustavus Adolphus College, 1980.) Revenues were derived from advertising. Computer User took advantage of a tradition in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of placing free publication newsstands in business districts and stores. The magazine, printed originally in black and white with one spot color on newsprint, proved immediately popular with distribution, eventually hitting many hundreds of sites and a circulation around 25,000 in the Twin Cities for a full color piece on newsprint paper. It was then still free to pick up but could be subscribed for mail distribution for $34.95 per year.
Computer User won numerous awards such as this from 2001 or as now listed on the current publishers website awards.
Computer User became franchised to 18 metropolitan U.S. markets wherein Computer User provided content and the local publisher provided advertising and some local content. At some point, based on a reference from the University of Minnesota Library the publisher was Computer User Publications, Inc. Computer User was sold to M. S. P. Publications - a highly successful Minneapolis based magazine publisher. MSP published Computer User until 2004, when paper publication ceased and the enterprise and web based name rights were sold to ComputerUser, Inc. a New York State registered company.
Content.
"Computer User's" style was, from the beginning, focused on the user of the then new micro computers. Nearly all other publications national and local focused on more the more technical aspects of having a computer, many of which were homebrew, assembled in part or in whole by the user. "Computer User" articles might include personal experiences, advice on how to use software, and expert advice columns.
In the first decade before the internet a very popular feature was a complete local list of computer bulletin boards. The monthly index of these, which frequently changed because they were usually based on someone's home computer, included the bbs name, a phone number one could dialup with your computer modem, a list of the modem speed(s) offered (not all were as exists today. The most common speed available to home users then was 300 baud or "bits per second."), and a summary of the topics or interests of those using the bulletin board. It was, in the 1980s and 1990s a form of social networking and a very important reason many people read the magazine. The magazine also published an equally popular index of Computer User Groups and their meeting schedules. Some were generic but others were focused on a single type of computer such as Tandy or Commodore. The magazine list enabled one to go to a meeting and ask other enthusiasts how to do things in a world where there was no other source. Therefore the magazine often published articles aimed at the groups and how to use them.

St. Nicolas Church in Louny

St. Nicholas Church in Louny (Czech: "Chrám svatého Mikuláše v Lounech") is a Roman Catholic, parochial church dedicated to Saint Nicholas, located in Louny, Czech Republic.
The 1517 fire destroyed the nave and damaged the tower of the original church. Afterwards it was designed and rebuilt by royal architect Benedikt Rejt. After it was finished in 1538, it became one of the supreme pieces of Czech late Gothic. The temple has three naves, with external support system, round arches and pyramid-shaped turrets.
The interior is dominated by woodcarved main altar. The altar was made during 1701–1706 by sculptor Jeroným Kohl with his apprentice František Preiss. In the end of 19th century when the church has undergone restorations by Josef Mocker and Kamil Hilbert. During that time, the painting the altar was considered but in the end it didn't come into realisation. The altar is divided into three parts – the main one in the middle and two lateral, "optically" divided by huge screw-shaped columns – each of the which is mastered by a painting on wood in the midsection. The carvings come to the stunning details – the altar contains tens of characters of the biblical teachings, angels and baroque decor.
Two of the tall Gothic stained glass windows with religious motives were donated by local citizens and date to the restorations from the break of 19th and the 20th century; the others have decent, non-figurative content.
Tower.
The temple tower is 60 m tall. Sandstone was used as a building material. Inside the tower, there is a winding stairwell with approximately 180 stairs, leading to a belfry and the gallery with the view on the entire town and surrounding. In the belfry, there are two bells, each approximately 60 cm tall.
Presently, the temple goes under minor amendments, however the church services and tours are not disrupted. Tours to the tower are allowed.

Johan Remen Evensen

Johan Remen Evensen (born 16 September 1985 in Øksnes) is a former Norwegian ski jumper from Molde. He currently holds the world record for longest ski jump (246.5 meters).
A late bloomer, Evensen made his World Cup debut during the 2008–09 season at age 23, and earned a place in the Norwegian World Cup team following consecutive top-12 finishes at Granåsen. On 14 December 2008, Evensen finished on the podium for the first time in his career, when he finished third in the World Cup event at Pragelato. On 11 February 2011, Evensen made the world's longest ski jump with 246,5 meters in the ski flying qualification round at Vikersund, Norway. The following day he won his first world cup competition in the main event. Evensen announced his retirement from the sport just prior to the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2012, effective immediately.
Early life and career.
Evensen was born in Alsvåg, but his family moved from Sørvågen to Molde, his mother's home city, when Johan was aged seven. He has four brothers. He took up ski jumping in the sports club Molde og Omegn IF at the age of seven, his father Arnor Evensen being a supportive figure. Johan Remen Evensen attended secondary school at Heimdal, being affiliated with the regional ski jumping team Trønderhopp. He later moved to Oslo, leaving Trønderhopp to join Eastern Norway's Kollenhopp.
At the Norwegian Championships held in Holmenkollen in January 2006, Remen Evensen finished seventeenth in the large hill.
In January 2007 he was used as a test jumper in the ski flying hill Vikersundbakken. He described this as "fantastically fun", and added that the success of Anders Jacobsen inspired him. By February 2007, he had displayed consistently good results in the Norwegian Tournament. He then performed well in the 2007 national championships. For this, he was sent to Japan to compete in the FIS Cup, the third highest level of international ski jumping. Competing three times, twice in Zao and once in Sapporo, Evensen recorded two victories and one second place. He followed up with a second place in his first Continental Cup event, in Zakopane two weeks later. He was drafted to the Norwegian squad for the World Cup event in Planica, but here he fell through in the qualification round. At this time his short-term goal (his long-term goal being to become "the world's best ski jumper") was to make the Norwegian national ski jumping team. In May the same year his inclusion in the national B team was announced. He landed a number of sponsor deals in order to concentrate fully on his training.
In the 2007–08 season, Evensen continued his Continental Cup career in January, with three competitions in Sapporo. His best result was a fourth place. At his next international competition, the Continental Cup in Trondheim in March, he finished ninth and tenth in the two races. This season he achieved a personal best jump of 212 metres as a test jumper in Planica. He was also a test jumper at the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2008.
Just four days ahead of the 2012 Ski-Flying World Championships at Vikersund in Norway Johan Remen Evensen announced that he would retire from ski jumping effective immediately. Since he had not been selected to represent Norway in the forthcoming world championship some people speculated a connection between this and his decision to quit. At a press conference he explained however that the reason for his quitting was a persistent problem keeping his weight down. He explained that he had been gaining weight without being able to account for it, and he concluded, "I have a body that doesn't function, and that means it's time to quit."
World Cup career.
Ahead of the 2008 season, his place on the national B team was reaffirmed. He achieved mediocre results during the autumn 2008 Continental Cup run, but his performances in the Norwegian Tournament secured him a place on the team for the 2008–09 World Cup opener in Trondheim. In Trondheim Evensen achieved a tenth place in the first race, and followed up with a twelfth place the next day. He was noted as a surprise achiever by the national media. Evensen himself described the competition as a "dream" and "completely insane".
A week later in Pragelato, Evensen achieved a seventh place. Being the highest-placed Norwegian in the race, he described the experience as "unreal". The next day, he was third after the first round, but as the second round was cancelled due to weather conditions, Evensen took his first World Cup podium.
The podium was followed by several low rankings, however, on February 14, he again showed his potential by placing third behind Harri Olli and Anders Jacobsen in the Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze in Oberstdorf, where he not only improved his own personal record to 223.5 m, but also jumped 0.5m longer than the previous hill record set by Roar Ljøkelsøy in 2004. His record was not acknowledged because Harri Olli had already landed on 225.5 m in the first round. At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, Evensen won a silver in the team large hill event.
Personal life.
Evensen married at the age of 22. He is an outspoken Christian, sponsored by the newspaper "Vårt Land" among others. He is also a member of the Christian sports organization "Kristen Idrettskontakt" (KRIK).

<doc id="20694764" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20694764" title="Solar radiation management">
Solar radiation management

Solar radiation management (SRM) projects are a type of climate engineering which seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. Proposed examples include the creation of stratospheric sulfate aerosols. They would not reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and thus do not address problems such as ocean acidification caused by these gases. Their principal advantages as an approach to climate engineering is the speed with which they can be deployed and become fully active, as well as their low financial cost. By comparison, other climate engineering techniques based on greenhouse gas remediation, such as ocean iron fertilization, need to sequester the anthropogenic carbon excess before they can arrest global warming. Solar radiation management projects can therefore be used as a climate engineering 'quick fix' while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control by greenhouse gas remediation techniques.
A study by Lenton and Vaughan suggest that marine cloud brightening and stratospheric sulfate aerosols are each capable of reversing the warming effect of a doubling of the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (when compared to pre-industrial levels).
Background.
The phenomenon of global dimming is widely known, and is not necessarily a climate engineering technique. It occurs in normal conditions, due to aerosols caused by pollution, or caused naturally as a result of volcanoes and major forest fires. However, its deliberate manipulation is a tool of the geoengineer. The majority of recent global dimming has been in the troposphere, except that resulting from volcanos, which affect mainly the stratosphere.
By intentionally changing the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, scientists propose that we could reflect more heat back out into space, or intercept sunlight before it reaches the Earth through a literal shade built in space. A 0.5% albedo increase would roughly halve the effect of CO2 doubling.
These climate engineering projects have been proposed in order to reduce global warming. The effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere on global climate is a warming effect on the planet. By modifying the albedo of the Earth's surface, or by preventing sunlight reaching the Earth by using a solar shade, this warming effect can be cancelled out — although the cancellation is imperfect, with regional discrepancies remaining.
The applicability of many techniques listed here has not been comprehensively tested. Even if the effects in computer simulation models or of small-scale interventions are known, there may be cumulative problems such as ozone depletion, which only become apparent from large scale experiments.
Various small-scale experiments have been carried out on techniques such as cloud seeding, increasing the volume of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and implementing cool roof technology.
As early as 1974, Russian expert Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. Paul Crutzen suggests that this would cost 25 to 50 billion dollars per year. It would, however, increase the environmental problem of acid rain. However, this is now believed to be a minor side effect.
A preliminary study by Edward Teller and others in 1997 presented the pros and cons of various relatively "low-tech" proposals to mitigate global warming through scattering/reflecting sunlight away from the Earth via insertion of various materials in the upper stratosphere, low earth orbit, and locations.
Limitations.
As well as the imperfect cancellation of the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming, there are other significant problems with solar radiation management as a form of climate engineering not least of these are effects on the global hydrological cycle and the inability of such techniques to reduce ocean acidification.
Particular to solar radiation management, a risk of abrupt cessation exists. If SRM were to abruptly stop, the climate would rapidly warm. This would cause a sudden rise in global temperatures towards levels which would have existed without the use of the climate engineering technique. The rapid rise in temperature may lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude.
SRM has been suggested to control regional climate, but precise control over the geographical boundaries of the effect is not possible.
Atmospheric projects.
These projects seek to modify the atmosphere, either by enhancing natural processes such as the sulfur cycle, or by using artificial techniques such as reflective balloons.
Stratospheric aerosols.
Methods based on increasing the aerosol content in the lower stratosphere for climate modification were proposed by a Russian scientist, Budyko.
Stratospheric sulfate aerosols as proposed by Paul Crutzen, with the purpose to modify the Earth's albedo with reflective or absorptive materials spread over portions of its surface. This would typically be achieved using hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide, delivered using artillery, aircraft (such as the high-flying F15-C) or balloons. 
This proposal, not unlike the others, carries with it considerable risks, including increased drought or acid rain.
Broadly speaking, this technique is seen as a credible climate engineering scheme, although not one without major risks, and challenges for its implementation. This technique can give >3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is sufficient to entirely offset the warming caused by a doubling of CO2.
Sulfate is the most commonly proposed aerosol for climate engineering, since there is a good natural analogue with volcanic eruptions. Explosive eruptions inject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, which form sulfate aerosol. Studies of the Earth's climate have shown that such aerosol can achieve significant cooling. Sulfate aerosols have been shown to enhance ozone depletion. However, other aerosol types may be more efficient at cooling the climate or less damaging to the ozone layer. Such aerosols include the highly reflective titanium dioxide.
United States Patent 5003186 suggested that tiny metal flakes could be "added to the fuel of jet airliners, so that the particles would be emitted from the jet engine exhaust while the airliner was at its cruising altitude." Alternative proposals, not known to have been published in peer-reviewed journals, include the addition of silicon compounds to jet fuel to make silicon dioxide particles in the exhaust.
A more sophisticated approach, using multi-layered nanoparticles (consisting of aluminium and barium titanate), was published by David Keith in 2010. He suggests utilizing the effects of photophoresis to increase the amount of time the aerosols stay airborne.
David Keith has also developed an experiment involving the release of sun-reflecting sulfate from a balloon more than 80,000 feet above Fort Sumner in New Mexico to replicate the cooling effects of volcanoes.
In 1992, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on geoengineering noted that dust is a better choice compared to sulphur, because dust is from natural soil and so should have no noticeable effect on the ground as it gradually falls into the troposphere and rains out. It estimated that about 1010 kg dust would be required to mitigate the warming from a doubling of atmospheric or about 1 kg dust per 100 t of carbon emissions.
An example of the effects of the imposition of aerosol particles in the atmosphere can be found in history. Comets have been blamed for the dramatic but brief cooling period which commenced in 1159 BCE, and resulted in widespread disruption to civilisations at the time. 
However, this mechanism, and even the involvement of a comet, is not universally accepted. If a comet was indeed to blame, the action of its aerosols could also have been by the mechanism of cloud condensation nuclei. Other examples of climate change events linked to comets include the famines around 536 CE.
Cloud reflectivity enhancement.
Various schemes have been suggested, such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectiveness of clouds. The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray will change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter. The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth. The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect.
This technique can give more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,
which is sufficient to reverse the warming effect of a doubling of CO2.
Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement.
Enhancing the natural sulfur cycle in the Southern Ocean ocean by fertilizing a small portion with iron in order to enhance dimethyl sulfide production and cloud reflectivity. The goal is to slow Antarctic ice from melting and raising sea level. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but in this specific project the enhancement of cloud albedo was both the desired outcome and measured result. An alternative technique proposes the vertical mixing of ocean water, to bring deep-water nutrients to surface plankton. This technique can give only 0.016 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is essentially insignificant for climate engineering purposes.
Reflective balloons.
Placing billions of aluminized, hydrogen-filled balloons in the stratosphere has been suggested to provide a reflective screen.
These reflectors would be placed at a high enough altitude so that they do not interfere with air traffic. The cost estimate is about 20 times as much as the distribution of dust in the stratosphere, making these schemes economically nonviable. The large number of reflectors and the trash problem posed by their fall make the system unattractive.
Cloud seeding.
Cloud seeding has been proposed using various methods to distribute the cloud-seeding materials, including airliners and ships or power plants. Reck (1978) studied the effect of increases in cloud cover and, using a radiative-convective atmospheric model, found that a 4 to 5 percent increase in low-level cloud cover would be sufficient to offset the warming predicted from a doubling of preindustrial CO2. This value is in reasonable agreement with Randall et al. (1984), who estimated that a 4 percent increase was required in the amount of marine stratocumulus, which comprises the bulk of the low clouds on a global basis."
Terrestrial albedo modification.
Cool roof.
Painting roof materials in white or pale colours to reflect solar radiation, known as 'cool roof' technology, and encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California). This is a benign technique, although limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the costrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01-0.19 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated. This is generally insignificant when compared to the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2. However, in many cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials. Further, it can reduce the need for air conditioning, which causes CO2 emissions which worsen global warming.
Reflective sheeting.
Adding reflective plastic sheets covering of desert every year between 2010 and 2070 to reflect the Sun’s energy. This technique can give globally averaged 1.74 W/m2 of negative forcing, which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, but is still a very significant contribution and is sufficient to offset the current level of warming (approx. 1.7 W/m2). However, the effect would be strongly regional, and would not be ideal for controlling Arctic shrinkage, which is one of the most significant problems resulting from global warming. Furthermore, the total area required during 2010-70 is larger than all non-polar deserts combined.
Ocean changes.
An early geoengineering idea was to use pale coloured floating litter within certain "stable" oceanic gyres. This litter would tend to group into large and stable areas, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
Oceanic foams have also been suggested, using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the photic zone.
Farming, forestry, and land management.
Forestry.
Reforestation in tropical areas has a cooling effect. Deforestation of high-latitude and high-altitude forests exposes snow and this increases albedo.
Grassland management.
Changes to grassland have been proposed to increase albedo. This technique can give 0.64 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, but could make a minor contribution towards it.
High-albedo crop varieties.
Selecting or genetically modifying commercial crops with high albedo has been suggested. This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, with farmers simply switching from one variety to another. Temperate areas may experience a 1 °C cooling as a result of this technique. This technique is an example of bio-geoengineering. This technique can give 0.44 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, but could make a minor contribution towards it.
Space projects.
Space-based climate engineering projects are seen by many commentators and scientists as being far-fetched at present.
Space mirrors.
Mirrors in space: proposed by Roger Angel with the purpose to deflect a percentage of solar sunlight into space, using mirrors orbiting around the Earth.
Moon dust.
Mining moon dust to create a shielding cloud was proposed by Curtis Struck at Iowa State University in Ames 
Dispersive solutions.
Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large diffraction grating (thin wire mesh) or lens in space, perhaps at the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun. Using a Fresnel lens in this manner was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early. Using a diffraction grating was proposed in 1997 by Edward Teller, Lowell Wood, and Roderick Hyde. In 2004, physicist and science fiction author Gregory Benford calculated that a concave rotating Fresnel lens 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%. He estimated that this would cost around US$10 billion up front, and another $10 billion in supportive cost during its lifespan. One issue with implementing such a solution is the need to counteract the effects of the solar wind moving such megastructures out of position. Side-effects include that, if this lens were built and global warming were avoided, there would be less incentive to reduce greenhouse gases, and humans might continue to produce too much carbon dioxide until it caused some other environmental catastrophe, such as an chemical change in ocean water that could be disastrous to ocean life.
Public attitudes.
There have been a limited number of studies into attitudes to solar radiation management. Notable examples include Mercer et al.

Rulers and Kingdom.
The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khwarazm had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath. Khwarazm, or the classical Chorasmia, was the well irrigated and rich agricultural region of lower Oxus. Surrounded on all sides by steppe land and desert, it was geographically isolated from other areas of civilization. This isolation allowed it to maintain a separate distinctive Iranian language and culture.
The Ma'munids replaced the ancient line of Afrighid Khwarazmshahs. The name of the rulers of this were:

Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid

Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid ("Night Music of the Streets of Madrid",), Opus 30 No. 6 (G. 324), is a "quintettino" (quintet) for stringed instruments (ca. 1780), by Luigi Boccherini, the Italian composer in service to the Spanish Court from 1761 to 1805.
Background.
The Italian composer Luigi Boccherini was attached to the Court of the Spanish Infante, Luis Antonio (1727–85), brother of King Charles III of Spain (1759–88). For having married a common citizen, King Charles exiled the Infante from the Madrid Court to the Arenas de San Pedro palace in Ávila province. As a courtier of Luis Antonio, Boccherini joined the exile, and found himself with much time for composition, and there completed more than one hundred pieces.
"Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid" describes the bustling streets of night-time Madrid; about the composition, critic Jaume Tortella writes:
The composition was famous in Spain during Boccherini’s life; the best-known versions are arrangements of the "Ritirata" (Retreat) movement incorporated to the (G418) piano quintet, and the (G453) guitar quintet. "The Night Music of the Streets of Madrid" was published years after Boccherini’s death, because, he told his publisher: “The piece is absolutely useless, even ridiculous, outside Spain, because the audience cannot hope to understand its significance, nor the performers to play it as it should be played.”
Since the mid-twentieth-century revival of interest in the music of Luigi Boccherini, the "Ritirata" became well-known; Luciano Berio used it as the basis for a composition superimposing the four known settings of the "Ritirata", all playing concurrently, ebbing and flowing synchronously and asynchronously. Despite its slightly jokey nature, like Berio’s folk-song settings, his "Ritirata" interpretation is attractive and approachable, acknowledging and expanding upon Boccherini’s composition.
In 1975, the Boccherini Quintet, on the "Ensayo" record label, recorded an exceptional interpretation of "Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid", that in 1976 won the Grand Prix du Disque, by the Académie Charles Cros.
Instrumentation.
Composed for two violins, a viola, and two cellos, the "Night Music of the Streets of Madrid" quintet is in the C major key, and is approximately 13 minutes in duration.
Movements.

Sir Edward Wilmot, 1st Baronet

Sir Edward Wilmot, 1st Baronet (1693–1786) was a surgeon and physician to both George II and George III of England.
He became a successful physician and his clients included the family of King George II of England. He was made a baronet in February 1730 becoming Sir Edward Wilmot, bart., of Chaddesden.
Wilmot became the army's physician general and George III's physician. He resided at 18 Cork Street in Westminster.
Early life.
The second son of Robert Wilmot and Joyce, daughter of William Sacheverell of Staunton, Leicestershire, he was born at his father's seat of Chaddesden near Derby on 29 October 1693. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1714, was elected a fellow, took his M.A. degree in 1718 and M.D. in 1725.
Physician.
He was admitted a candidate or member of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1725, and was elected a fellow on 30 September 1726. In 1729 and 1741 he was a censor, and a Harveian orator in 1735. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 29 January 1730. From 1725 he practised as a physician in London, and was elected physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, and in 1740 appointed physician-general to the army. In April 1731 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Caroline of Ansbach; and soon became physician in ordinary, and physician to Frederick, Prince of Wales. He became physician extraordinary to George II on the queen's death in 1737 and physician in ordinary 1742.
In 1736 John Fothergill became his pupil. When Henry Pelham had lost two sons by sore throat in 1739, Wilmot preserved the life of his wife, Lady Catharine Pelham, by lancing her throat. In March 1751, with Matthew Lee, he attended Frederick, Prince of Wales, in his last illness; and does not seem to have anticipated his death. Archbishop Thomas Herring was his patient in a serious attack of pleurisy in 1753.
Later life.
He was created a baronet on 15 February 1759. On the death of George II, Wilmot, with John Ranby, acquainted George III with two wishes which the late king had confided to them: that his body should be embalmed with a double quantity of perfumes, and that it should be laid close to that of the queen. George III at once assented.
Wilmot became physician in ordinary to George III in 1760, left London next year, and lived in Nottingham; but then moved to Heringstone in Dorset, where he died on 21 November 1786. He was buried in the church of Monkton, where his epitaph remains.
Family.
He married Sarah Marsh, daughter of Richard Mead. She died on 11 September 1785, aged 83; her portrait, painted by Joseph Wright, A.R.A., remained in the family, as did a portrait of Wilmot by Thomas Beach. He was succeeded in his baronetcy by his son, Robert Mead Wilmot, and had also two daughters, Ann(e) and Jane, who both married.

<doc id="20695009" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20695009" title="Lying (position)">
Lying (position)

Lying (also recumbency or prostration) is a type of human position in which the body is more or less horizontal and supported along its length by the surface underneath.
When in lying position, the body may assume a great variety of shapes and positions. The following are the basic recognized positions.
Lying is the most common position while being immobilized, e.g. in bedrest while sleeping or being struck by injury or disease.
As a treatment.
Bedrest as a medical treatment refers to staying in bed day and night as a treatment for an illness or medical condition, especially when prescribed or chosen rather than resulting from severe prostration or imminent death. Even though most patients in hospitals spend most of their time in the hospital beds, bedrest more often refers to an extended period of recumbence at home.
Long-term risks.
Prolonged bedrest carries some medical risks such as demineralization of the bones and atrophy of the muscles, as well as economic and social costs, and is much less commonly prescribed today. Preterm labor with threatened miscarriage remains one of the few conditions for which bedrest remains a standard treatment.
It is also a major cause of thrombosis. 
Errors in usage.
The verb 'to lie' is an intransitive verb. People sometimes mistakenly use the verb 'to lay' intransitively when they mean 'to lie,' for example *'The cat is laying in the sun' instead of, correctly, 'The cat is lying in the sun.'
The transitive verb 'to lay' means to place a thing or person on a more or less horizontal surface. The direct object of the verb is the thing/person being placed in a horizontal position. Usually extra information is given in the complement of the sentence, telling us where the thing/person is being placed. For example, 'I lay my clothes on the bed when I'm packing for a holiday.'
The confusion between these two verbs may arise because 'lay' is the past form of 'to lie.'
For example:
'I lie in the sun every day on holiday' (present) vs 'I lay in the sun every day last week' (past)
and
'I lay my clothes out on the bed in the morning before I get dressed' (present) vs 'I laid my clothes out on the bed while I was packing for my holiday' (past)

Sgt. Joshua Eaton (1757 - October 7, 1777) was the only resident of Reading, Massachusetts, to die from enemy gunfire during the American Revolution. In early 1777 he enlisted from Reading's 3rd Parish into the 8th Massachusetts Regiment, under the command of Lt. Col. John Brooks. His company was led by Capt. James Bancroft, also of Reading.
Eaton died on October 7, 1777, during the Second Battle of Freeman's Farm in the days immediately preceding the Battle of Saratoga, near present day Schuylerville, New York. These battles were fought against British forces led by Gen. John Burgoyne. The Battle of Saratoga was a major victory for American troops, and a turning point in the American Revolution. In that battle American troops forced the surrender of some 6,000 British regulars, and won not only a decisive victory, but much needed guns and ammunition.
Near Eaton's homestead is now located Joshua Eaton Elementary School, one of five elementary schools in the town of Reading.

Merlin M4000

The BT Merlin M4000 was a Personal computer sold by British Telecom during the 1980s as part of the Merlin range of electronic machinery for businesses. It was not developed by BT but was a rebadged Logica VTS-2400 Kennet, and a completely different machine from the Merlin Tonto which was a rebadged ICL OPD. Merlin M4000 was designed as a general purpose computer but was not IBM PC compatible, and so could not run the major business applications around at the time as these were tied to the IBM PC hardware.
Hardware.
Merlin M4000 computers were packaged inside a substantial and heavy steel desktop case weighing approximately 12 kg. Inside the case was the main board, power supply, floppy and hard drives, and expansion cards. The design was reasonably modular as the case and main board were able to accommodate expansion cards and additional memory. 
A separate keyboard with 114 keys connected to the main unit using a reversed British telephone plug with the clip on the left hand side. Most monitors were amber monochrome but later colour screens were sold. 
An 8086 CPU was used. The maximum RAM was 768 KB, made up of 256 KB on the main board plus two additional 256 KB RAM cards. 
A security socket was located on the rear of the main unit although it is unclear how it was used in practice.
Networking was accomplished using ARCNET or Cambridge Ring LAN cards. An RS-232 optical fibre modem was also available.
The M4204T and M4213T computers were TEMPEST certified to BTR/01/202(4).
Storage media.
The M4204T had two internal 720 kB 5¼-inch floppy drives and the M4213T had one internal 720 kB 5¼-inch floppy drive and one internal hard drive with a capacity of either 10 MB or 20 MB. An external 76 MB hard drive and/or a 150 MB Tandberg QIC tape drive could also be connected to the M4000.
Software.
The CP/M-86 and Concurrent DOS (CDOS) operating systems were developed for Merlin M4000 computers.
Most Merlin M4000 computers were used to run bespoke software rather than off the shelf applications software. A few applications software packages were commercially available including: 
1. Lex9b word processor.<br>
2. MerlinWord word processor.<br> 
3. A rather neat telephone directory / database program that was mainly used by switchboard operators.<br>
4. Software development tools including an 8086 assembler and COBOL compiler.<br>
5. An Asteroids game - initially as a demonstration of the bitmapped graphics.
Usage.
Merlin M4000 computers were commonplace in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, although most were sold to the public sector as large contracts as opposed to the private sector. Major customers included the Royal Navy as part of the OASIS II project, and the Department of Social Security. Merlin M4000 computers were installed in DSS offices across the country where they were used for Case Paper location (tracking files as they moved from one room to another) and calculating benefits. Some M4000 computers were used by the Forestry Commission in their offices, and internally by BT although it is not clear if they were ever used in conjunction with System X telephone exchanges. Many theatres in the UK used Merlin M4000 computers running the RITA booking software that was written either by or in conjunction with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Successor.
The M4204T and M4213T computers were available in 1990 from the TEMPEST division of BT which sold TEMPEST certified computer equipment for high security applications. They were replaced by the M5000 range of IBM PC compatible TEMPEST certified computers running MS-DOS.

Peltigerales

Peltigerales is an order of lichen-forming fungi belonging to the class Lecanoromycetes in the division Ascomycota. The taxonomy of the group has seen numerous changes; it was formerly often treated as a suborder of the order Lecanorales. It currently contains two suborders, seven families and about 45 genera such as "Lobaria" and "Peltigera".
The fungi form lichens in a symbiotic relationship with one or two photosynthetic partners which may be a cyanobacterium such as "Nostoc" or a green alga such as "Coccomyxa". The majority of species contain just a cyanobacterium, a smaller number have both a cyanobacterium and a green alga while only a few species have just a green alga. The thallus of the lichen may be foliose (leafy), subfruticose (somewhat shrubby) or granular-squamulose (scaly). The thallus attaches to a surface by means of small root-like rhizines. In some species, the thallus may vary in appearance depending on whether it contains a cyanobacterium or a green alga. Sometimes these different morphs of a single fungus were formerly thought to be separate species.
The lichens occur worldwide, growing on bark, moss, soil or rocks in humid woodland. The greatest diversity occurs in the Northern Hemisphere although the family Lobariaceae is most diverse in the Southern Hemisphere.
Members of the suborder Peltigerineae produce a wide range of secondary compounds, some of which are useful to humans in medicine and dyeing. Former uses include using "Peltigera canina" (dog lichen) as a remedy for the bite of a mad dog and "Lobaria pulmonaria" (tree lungwort) as a remedy for lung diseases because of its supposed resemblance to lung tissue.

Battle of Messana

The Battle of Messana in 265-264 BC was the first military clash between the Roman Republic and Carthage. It marked the start of the First Punic War. In that period, and after the recent successes in southern Italy, Sicily became of increasing strategic importance to Rome.
Background.
The Greek historian Polybius states in Book One of "The Histories": "Even after long consideration, the (Roman) Senate did not approve the proposal to send help to Messana; they took the view that any advantage which would result from relieving the place would be counterbalanced by the inconsistency of such an action. However, the people who had suffered grievously from the wars that had just ended and were in dire need of rehabilitation of every kind, were inclined to listen to the consuls. These men, besides stressing the national advantages I have already mentioned which Rome could secure if she intervened, also dwelt on the great gains which would clearly accrue to every individual citizen from the spoils of war, and so a resolution for sending help was carried. When his decree had been passed by the people, one of the consuls, Appius Claudius, was appointed to command an expedition, and was given orders to cross to Messana." After this, the Mamertines forced the Punic garrison out of Messana and invited the Roman force into the city. The Carthaginians crucified the garrison commander, Hanno (not the son of Hannibal), on his return to Carthage for what was regarded as his cowardice and lack of judgement in leaving Messana.
The Punic army arrived first, landing at Lilybaeum, in the west of Sicily.

Battle of Kassel (1945)

The Battle of Kassel was a four-day struggle between the U.S. Army and the German Army in April 1945 for Kassel, a medium-sized city northeast of Frankfurt am Main. The battle resulted as the U.S. Third Army pushed northeast from the region of Frankfurt and Mainz. The battle opened on April 1, 1945 and ended with an American victory three days later. Opposing the Third Army's 80th Infantry Division were an infantry replacement battalion, some heavy tanks, and anti-aircraft guns. Although the Germans gave battle at Kassel, their army was on the brink of collapse as the Western Allies and the Red Army made deep inroads into Germany. The defense of Kassel did not materially impede the Allied advance, and, one month after the battle ended, Germany was forced to capitulate.
Background.
After the Ardennes Offensive, the U.S. Third Army had pushed east and southeast into Germany, capturing Pruem and Trier. This advance brought General Patton's troops to the Rhine River, which they crossed at Oppenheim, near Mainz, on March 22, 1945. While the U.S. First Army was marching on Paderborn, the Third Army moved on a roughly parallel course further to the east to cover the First Army's right flank and prevent any German attempt to relieve their troops trapped in the Ruhr Pocket. Moving east from its bridgehead across the Rhine, the Third Army's XII Corps fought through scattered German opposition and reached Frankfurt on March 26. After Frankfurt, Kassel was the largest city in Hessen, having had a population of 200,000 in 1939. Another corps of the Third Army, the XX, was directed to capture it. By March 30, elements of the Third Army were nearing Kassel, having moved some in eight days.
Much of Kassel's center lay in ruins as the city had been bombed 40 times by the Allied air forces. Among the bombing targets in the city was the Henschel factory complex, which produced Tiger II tanks. As the Americans approached, the Henschel Works finished work on thirteen Tiger II tanks, which were taken over by two companies of the German 510th and 511th Heavy Tank Battalions. Deployed on a military training ground south of the city was a battery of 88 mm anti-aircraft guns manned by Reichsarbeitdienst (RAD) members, a paramilitary labor service of the Nazi Party. Besides the tanks and AA-guns, the Germans had several hundred men of the 15th Armored Infantry Replacement and Training Battalion with which to defend the city. The German high command had designated Kassel a "Festung" (fortress) with dire orders to "resist to the last round". In the event, however, the designation of the city as "Festung" had little impact on the outcome of the battle. In command of the city's defense was "Generalmajor" Johannes Erxleben, a communications officer with little battle experience.
Battle.
On March 30, 1945, seven German Tiger II tanks rolled south, heading for Fritzlar. northeast of Fritzlar, the Tigers fought a meeting engagement with an armored spearhead of the U.S. Third Army, resulting in damage or destruction to six U.S. tank destroyers. The German tankers, however, were forced to retreat when their unit was subjected to heavy artillery fire. On April 1, leading elements of the Major General Horace L. McBride's U.S. 80th Infantry Division approached Kassel from the south, but were forced to halt by fire from the RAD anti-aircraft battery positioned on the Dönche training ground (), a relatively flat area that allowed the 88mm guns to engage in long range fire.
On April 2, the Americans again responded with heavy artillery fire, destroying the RAD AA battery. The U.S. 318th Infantry Regiment moved a battalion into the wooded high ground ("Habichtswald") west of Kassel, while the U.S. 319th Infantry Regiment crossed the Fulda River and moved north along its east bank. The 80th Division's third regiment, the 317th Infantry, was in divisional reserve. By the end of the day, western and southern suburbs of Kassel had been occupied by the Americans.
In the south, German infantry of the 15th Battalion mounted 15 half-tracks and, supported by about 12 tanks, moved south and surprised elements of the 1st Battalion, 318th Infantry. The subsequent exchange of fire saw six U.S. tank destroyers knocked out and one Tiger II damaged. The German infantry was separated from their tanks by enfilading fire from U.S. troops who had pulled back from the road. The German tanks continued south until they were struck by an American 155-mm artillery barrage that destroyed two tanks with direct hits. A second and similar German assault was less successful and also repelled by artillery fire.
Having reorganized, 80th Division troops, with the support of M16 half-tracks that mounted four heavy machine guns, closed on the German "Kaserne" from which the attack the previous day had originated. M16's of the 633rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery (Heavy Weapons) Battalion subjected the German base and its defenders to blistering fire and forced the capitulation of the base's garrison.
The U.S. 318th Infantry's advance north into Kassel was blocked by a 15-meter high railway embankment under which a street ran. The underpass was blocked by a German self-propelled gun whose fire commanded the approach to the underpass. After American attempts to take the embankment were repelled by Germans dug in on the other side, the regiment's 1st Battalion managed to cross the embankment to the northwest and approached the German positions from the flank. Early on the morning of April 3, the battalion took the surrender of some 500 German troops who believed their defensive position compromised.
Fighting in Kassel was house-to-house from April 2, but the German defenders were too few to defend effectively and the U.S. forces pushed into the city's center, fending off local counter-attacks by infantry and tanks. American tanks and the U.S. 319th Infantry were meanwhile approaching Kassel from the east bank of the Fulda River. The U.S. 317th Infantry was guarding the Americans' flank in the west and the U.S. 318th Infantry pushed through the city, arriving in the vicinity of the command bunker of General Erxleben at 0900 on April 4, 1945. Faced with the collapse of his defenses, Erxleben dispatched a captain early on April 4 to discuss surrender terms with the Americans. The American reply was that the Germans had to cease resistance with no cease-fire to evacuate wounded or civilians, or that the fighting would continue. Around 1100 on April 4, U.S. tanks crossed the Fulda River from the east and moved toward the center of Kassel. At 1200, General Erxleben capitulated and was taken prisoner along with 1,325 others, effectively ending the Battle of Kassel.

The 1956 FA Charity Shield was the 34th FA Charity Shield, an annual football match held between the winners of the previous season's Football League and FA Cup competitions. The match was contested by Manchester United, who had won the 1955–56 Football League, and Manchester City, who had won the 1955–56 FA Cup, at Maine Road, Manchester, on 24 October 1956. Manchester United won the match 1–0, Dennis Viollet scoring the winning goal. Manchester United goalkeeper David Gaskell made his debut for the club during the game, taking the place of injured goalkeeper Ray Wood, and, at the age of 16 years and 19 days, became the youngest player ever to play for the club.
This game was the first competitive floodlit Manchester derby. The game was a break with tradition as Charity Shield games were typically played at the home ground of the League Champions, but as Old Trafford had yet to install lights, the game was played at Maine Road. Prior to this the first floodlit Manchester derby was played on 26 February 1889 at the Belle Vue Athletic Ground. That match was also a charity game as it was played in aid of the Hyde Coal Mine disaster.

Musamman Burj (Agra Fort)

Musamman Burj also known as the Saman Burj or the Shah-burj, is an octagonal tower standing close to the Shah Jahan's private hall Diwan-e-Khas in Agra Fort.
History.
Musamman Burj was built by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is said that at first a small marble palace built by Akbar was situated at this site, which was later demolished by Jehangir to erect new buildings. Shah Jahan in his turn chose this site to erect the multi-storied marble tower inlaid with precious stones for Mumtaz Mahal. It was built between 1631-40 and offers exotic views of the famous Taj Mahal. 
Architecture.
The Musamman Burj is made of delicate marble lattices with ornamental niches so that the ladies of the court could gaze out unseen. The decoration of the walls is pietra dura. The chamber has a marble dome on top and is surrounded by a verandah with a beautiful carved fountain in the center.
The tower looks out over the River Yamuna and is traditionally considered to have one of the most poignant views of the Taj Mahal. It is here that Shah Jahan along with his favorite daughter Jahanara Begum had spent his last few years as a captive of his son Aurangzeb. He lay here on his death bed while gazing at the Taj Mahal in Agra.

<doc id="20695220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20695220" title="AMOLED">
AMOLED

AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) is a display technology for use in mobile devices and televisions. OLED describes a specific type of thin-film-display technology in which organic compounds form the electroluminescent material, and active matrix refers to the technology behind the addressing of pixels.
, AMOLED technology is used in mobile phones, media players and digital cameras, and continues to make progress toward low-power, low-cost and large-size (for example, 40-inch) applications.
Design.
An AMOLED display consists of an active matrix of OLED pixels that generate light (luminescence) upon electrical activation that have been deposited or integrated onto a thin-film-transistor (TFT) array, which functions as a series of switches to control the current flowing to each individual pixel.
Typically, this continuous current flow is controlled by at least two TFTs at each pixel (to trigger the luminescence), with one TFT to start and stop the charging of a storage capacitor and the second to provide a voltage source at the level needed to create a constant current to the pixel, thereby eliminating the need for the very high currents required for passive-matrix OLED operation.
TFT backplane technology is crucial in the fabrication of AMOLED displays. The two primary TFT backplane technologies, namely polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) and amorphous silicon (a-Si), are used today in AMOLEDs. These technologies offer the potential for fabricating the active-matrix backplanes at low temperatures (below 150°C) directly onto flexible plastic substrates for producing flexible AMOLED displays.
Future development.
Manufacturers have developed in-cell touch panels, integrating the production of capacitive sensor arrays in the AMOLED module fabrication process. In-cell sensor AMOLED fabricators include AU Optronics and Samsung. Samsung has marketed their version of this technology as "Super AMOLED". Researchers at DuPont used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to optimize coating processes for a new solution-coated AMOLED display technology that is cost and performance competitive with existing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology. Using custom modeling and analytical approaches, they developed short- and long-range film-thickness control and uniformity that is commercially viable at large glass sizes.
Comparison to other technologies.
AMOLED displays provide higher refresh rates than their passive-matrix OLED counterparts, improving response time often to under a millisecond, and they consume significantly less power. This advantage makes active-matrix OLEDs well suited for portable electronics, where power consumption is critical to battery life.
The amount of power the display consumes varies significantly depending on the colour and brightness shown. As an example, one commercial QVGA OLED display consumes 0.3 watts while showing white text on a black background, but more than 0.7 watts showing black text on a white background, while an LCD may consume only a constant 0.35 watts regardless of what is being shown on screen. Because the black pixels actually turn off, AMOLED also has contrast ratios that are significantly better than LCD.
AMOLED displays may be difficult to view in direct sunlight compared with LCDs because of their reduced maximum brightness. Samsung's "Super AMOLED" technology addresses this issue by reducing the size of gaps between layers of the screen. Additionally, PenTile technology is often used to allow for a higher resolution display while requiring fewer subpixels than would otherwise be needed, often resulting in a display less sharp and more grainy compared with a non-pentile display with the same resolution.
The organic materials used in AMOLED displays are very prone to degradation over a relatively short period of time, resulting in color shifts as one color fades faster than another, image persistence, or burn-in.
Current demand for AMOLED screens is high, and, due to supply shortages of the Samsung-produced displays, certain models of HTC smartphones have been changed to use next-generation LCD displays from the Samsung and Sony joint-venture SLCD in the future.
Flagship smartphones sold as of 2011-12 use either Super AMOLED or IPS panel premium LCD. Super AMOLED displays, such as the one on the Galaxy Nexus and Samsung Galaxy S III have often been compared to IPS panel premium LCDs, found in the iPhone 4S, HTC One X, and Nexus 4. For example, according to ABI Research the AMOLED display found in the Motorola Moto X draws just 92mA during bright conditions and 68mA while dim.
Marketing terms.
Super AMOLED.
Super AMOLED is Samsung's term for an AMOLED display with an integrated digitizer, meaning that the layer that detects touch is integrated into the screen, rather than overlaid on top of it. According to Samsung, Super AMOLED reflects one-fifth as much sunlight compared to the first generation AMOLED. The display technology itself is not changed. Super AMOLED is part of the Pentile matrix family. It is sometimes abbreviated SAMOLED.
For the Samsung Galaxy S III, which reverted to Super AMOLED instead of the pixelation-free conventional RGB (non-PenTile) Super AMOLED Plus of its predecessor Samsung Galaxy S II, the S III's larger screen size encourages users to hold the phone further from their face to obscure the PenTile effect.
Super AMOLED Advanced.
Super AMOLED Advanced is a term marketed by Motorola to describe a brighter display than Super AMOLED screens, but also a higher resolution – qHD or 960 × 540 for Super AMOLED Advanced compared to WVGA or 800 × 480 for Super AMOLED. This display equips the Motorola Droid RAZR.
Super AMOLED Plus.
Super AMOLED Plus, first introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S II and Samsung Droid Charge smartphones, is a branding from Samsung where the PenTile RGBG pixel matrix (2 subpixels) used in Super AMOLED displays has been replaced with a traditional RGB RGB (3 subpixels) arrangement typically used in LCD displays. This variant of AMOLED is brighter and therefore more energy efficient than Super AMOLED displays and produces a sharper, less grainy image because of the increased number of subpixels. In comparison to AMOLED and Super AMOLED displays, the Super AMOLED Plus displays are even more energy efficient and brighter. However, Samsung cited screen life and costs by not using Plus on the Galaxy S II's successor, the Samsung Galaxy S III.
HD Super AMOLED.
HD Super AMOLED is a branding from Samsung for an HD-resolution (>1280×720) Super AMOLED display. The first device to use it was the Samsung Galaxy Note. The Galaxy Nexus and the Galaxy S III both implement the HD Super AMOLED with a PenTile RGBG-matrix (2 subpixels/pixel), while the Galaxy Note II uses an RBG matrix (3 subpixels/pixel) but not in the standard 3 stripe arrangement.
HD Super AMOLED Plus.
A variant of the "Samsung Galaxy S3" using "Tizen" OS 1 was benchmarked using a non-pentile HD Super AMOLED Plus screen in 2012.
Full HD Super AMOLED.
As featured on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It has the broadest color gamut of any mobile display of up to 97% of the Adobe RGB color space, hence making it a wide-gamut display.
Future.
Future displays exhibited from 2011 to 2013 by Samsung have shown flexible, 3D, unbreakable, transparent Super AMOLED Plus displays using very high resolutions and in varying sizes for phones. These unreleased prototypes use a polymer as a substrate removing the need for glass cover, a metal backing, and touch matrix, combining them into one integrated layer.
So far, Samsung plans on branding the newer displays as Youm.
Also planned for the future are 3D stereoscopic displays that use eye tracking (via stereoscopic front-facing cameras) to provide full resolution 3D visuals.

Nils Christian Tønsberg ( 7 December 1813 - 6 February 1897) was a Norwegian publisher and author. Christian Tønsberg became one of the larger Norwegian publishers and was best known for illustrated books about Norway.
Background.
Nils Christian Tønsberg was born in Bergen, Norway. He was the son of a ship manager Johan Christian Tønsberg (1788-1830) and Anne Marie Dahl (1788-1837). From the age of 14 he was employed at the office of town clerk and justice secretary and worked as a secretary for several municipal commissions. In September 1834 he was assistant at the Recorder of Bergen. He enrolled in law studies, graduating with the cand.jur. degree in 1845.
Career.
Tønsberg was employed as clerk in the Treasury Department, working in the office of several Supreme Court lawyers. Tønsberg also served as consul for several countries: Kingdom of Bavaria, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg, Colombia, Liberia and Romania. Additionally he managed estates, auction and estate sales.
When the publishing company of Guldberg & Dzwonkowski was dissolved in 1844, Tønsberg assumed a large part of the publisher's legal literature. Tønsberg had met Henrik Wergeland in Bergen in 1832 and later became one of the writer's best friends and his main support. He arranged to published "Hasselnødder" in 1845. At the time of Wergeland's death the following year, he was asked to manage his estate and take care of the widow. He also published works of P. A. Munch, Mauritz Hansen, Magnus Brostrup Landstad and others. He was among the founders of the Norwegian Booksellers Association in 1851.
Tønsberg became strongly influenced by the National Romantic period and was eager to establish a co-operation between the different art forms. The illustrations were drawn by some of the most famous of Norwegian artists including Peter Christen Asbjørnsen among others. Tønsberg continued publishing similar books over the next years. He gathered and published the material in "Norge fremstillet i Tegninger" with Asbjørnsen in 1848. Tønsberg also published "Bondeliv i Norge" with Munch in 1861. Tønsberg continued with a limited publishing until 1891, by which time he was almost blind.

2008–09 Garamba offensive

The 2008–2009 Garamba offensive (codenamed Operation Lightning Thunder) started on December 14, 2008, when joint Ugandan, DR Congolese and Southern Sudanese forces launched a military attack against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the Garamba region of DR Congo.
Background.
In June 2008, after the LRA had attacked and killed 23 people in Southern Sudan, including 14 soldiers, a Ugandan military spokesman said Uganda, DR Congo and Sudan would launch a joint offensive against the LRA if its leader, Joseph Kony, failed to commit to the Juba peace talks. Concurrently, the Southern Sudanese Information Minister, Gabriel Changson, declared that "The LRA have started war", and that "Southern Sudan will not be the place where they can wage this war". The same month, diplomats reported that the LRA had acquired new weapons and was forcibly recruiting new soldiers, adding 1,000 recruits to the 600 soldiers it already had.
An onslaught against the LRA by Ugandan forces in northern Uganda and across the border in Southern Sudan, led the rebels to relocate to the densely forested Garamba National Park in DR Congo – and when they attacked and killed civilians there, the Congolese government vowed to destroy the LRA.
The operation.
In November 2008, the U.S. President George W. Bush personally signed the directive to the United States Africa Command to provide assistance financially and logistically to the Ugandan government during the offensive. The United States military helped in the planning stages of the operation, and also provided financial and technical support in the form of satellite phones and fuel.
On December 14, 2008, a statement announcing the operation was released in the Ugandan capital Kampala by the intelligence chiefs of the armed forces of the three countries: the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). "The three armed forces successfully attacked the main body and destroyed the main camp of Joseph Kony, code-named "Camp Swahili", setting it on fire," the statement said. The Ugandan government stated on December 21, 2008, that 70% of the LRA's camps had been destroyed so far. On December 24, 2008 Uganda said one of its MiG-21 fighter aircraft crashed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. "The pilot, Bosco Opiyo, failed to recover the plane from diving and plunged into the ground, dying instantly, and the craft also caught fire. The accident is purely a technical accident", said Ugandan Army spokesman Paddy Ankunda.
By early January 2009, according to a Congolese official, the LRA was routed, had lost most of its food supply, and was on the run and very close to the border of the Central African Republic, which had reinforced troops at the border. However, in late January, in apparent reprisals against the offensive, LRA launched several attacks against civilians, on one occasion killing more than 100 villagers.
Ugandan withdrawal.
On March 15, 2009, Uganda abruptly ended its participation in the offensive and began withdrawing its troops from Garamba. The withdrawal, according to Lt. Gen. Ivan Koreta, the Deputy Chief of Defence Forces, was due to an agreement signed with DR Congo. During a handover ceremony in Garamba, the DR Congo Chief of General Staff, Gen. Didier Etumba Longila, said Congo would continue hunting the LRA until they were neutralised.

Episcopal Diocese of Western Colorado

The Episcopal Diocese of Western Colorado was a diocese of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America from 1892 to 1898 and from 1907 to 1919.
In 1892 Western Colorado was detached from the Diocese of Colorado and constituted as a Missionary District. It consisted of all regions in Colorado west of Larimer, Boulder, Gilpin, Clear Creek, Park, Lake, Chaffee, Saguache, Rio Grande and Conejos counties.
The first Bishop was William Morris Barker from 1893 to 1894. The district was administered from 1894 to 1903 by Abiel Leonard, whose title in 1895 became Missionary Bishop of Nevada, Utah, and Western Colorado. In 1898 it became part of the Missionary District of Salt Lake. Bishop Leonard was succeeded by Franklin S. Spalding from 1904 to 1907.
In 1907 the Missionary District of Western Colorado was recreated and had the following bishops:

Hanan Porat

Hanan Porat (, born Hanan Spitzer; 12 December 1943 – 4 October 2011) was an Israeli rabbi, educator and politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Tehiya, the National Religious Party, Tkuma and the National Union between 1981 and 1984 and 1988 and 1999.
Biography.
Porat was born in Kfar Pines in 1943, during the Mandate era. In 1944, his family moved to Kfar Etzion. In early 1948, during the Arab riots of 1948, Kfar Etzion was besieged and the children were evacuated to Jerusalem. Porat's father also moved there to arrange convoys. After the Kfar Etzion massacre, his family settled in Kfar Pines. Porat studied at the Bnei Akiva yeshiva high school, Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh and the Mercaz HaRav talmudic college, and was ordained as a rabbi. He worked as a religious teacher at several yeshivas.
He served in the Paratroopers Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces during the Six-Day War and was among the troops that captured the Temple Mount. He later said that the Israeli victory should have become a national holiday. After the Six-Day War he helped re-establish the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank. He convinced Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to grant permission to settle in Gush Etzion. He was badly wounded in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 on the bank of the Suez canal. He recovered and was amongst the founders of Gush Emunim movement, which founded over 100 Israeli settlements. In 1975 he led the founding of Elon Moreh, the first Israeli settlement in the West Bank, in Sebastia.
In the 1981 elections he was voted into the Knesset on the Tehiya list. He resigned on 7 March 1984, towards the end of the Knesset term, and was replaced by Zvi Shiloah. After the evacuation of Yamit in 1982, he announced his intention to build new settlements in parts of the Land of Israel still not in Israeli hands. In 1995, he convinced Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin not to hand over Rachel's Tomb to the Palestinian Authority. He tried to repeat that in 2008. Prior to Israel's disengagement from Gaza, he instructed youngsters in Neve Dekalim in Gush Katif to disrupt evacuation forces.
In 1988 he returned to the Knesset, this time as a member of the National Religious Party. He was re-elected in 1992 and 1996. In 1996 he was appointed the NRP's parliamentary group chairman, but on 4 March 1999 he and Zvi Hendel left the party to establish a new faction, initially named Emunim, later renamed Tkuma.
Prior to the 1999 elections Tkuma formed an alliance with other small right-wing parties named the National Union. Porat was placed third on the Union's list, and was re-elected again. However, he resigned from the Knesset on 20 October that year, and was replaced by Hendel.
Porat died on 4 October 2011, aged 67, of cancer. He was survived by his wife, 10 children and 20 grandchildren.

Beit Kadima

Beit Kadima (lit. Kadima House) is a residential building complex in Jerusalem, Israel located on the west side of Kiryat Shmuel. The British Mandatory authorities built it in 1945 to house the families of British officers. In the end, it was used by UNSCOP Commission, whose members lived there while drafting the UN Partition Plan prior to the establishment of the state.
The building was designed by architect Otto Hoffmann and constructed by an Egyptian housing company. Hoffmann's design included 21 apartments along with parking garages and storage 
space. It was built in the International Style along with traditional Jerusalem motifs such as half arcs over the entrances and outside staircases. The building stood empty for several years until the British authorities chose the secluded compound to house the members of the UNSCOP Commission, who were sent by the UN to determine the future status of the land of Israel. For several weeks the Commission members lived in Beit Kadima and drafted the recommendation which led to the decision on partition of Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel. 
Shortly after the UN decision on November 29, 1947, violence erupted in region and the compound became a refuge for Jewish families living in the predominantly Arab neighborhood of Katamon. The building served as a Haganah military post during Israel's War of Independence. 
Today some of the original families still live in the compound, which retains its elegant character.

Adoration of the Magi (tapestry)

The Adoration of the Magi is a Morris & Co. tapestry depicting the story in Christianity of the Three Kings who were guided to the birthplace of Jesus by the star of Bethlehem. It is sometimes called "The Star of Bethlehem" or simply "The Adoration."
Commission.
The original tapestry was commissioned in 1886 by John Prideaux Lightfoot, rector of Exeter College, Oxford, for the Gothic revival chapel built for the college in the 1850s by George Gilbert Scott. Lightfoot approached William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, both former students at Exeter, and suggested the subject matter for the tapestry, to which Morris agreed readily in a letter to Lightfoot dated 4 September 1886.
The overall composition and the figures were designed by Edward Burne-Jones, who completed a 26 × 38 inch modello or design in watercolour and bodycolour heightened with gold in 1887. Large-scale cartoons for the tapestry weavers were created from photographically enlarged panels of Burne-Jones's watercolour. In a letter of 7 September 1886, Morris had suggested that the tapestry's colouration should be "both harmonious and powerful, so that it would not be overpowered" by the chapel's brilliantly coloured stained glass. Morris and his assistant John Henry Dearle chose a vibrant colour scheme and added background and foreground details including the flowering plants characteristic of Dearle's tapestry work. All in all, the tapestry took four years to realise, including two years' work by three weavers at Morris's Merton Abbey Mills. The tapestry was completed in February 1890 and displayed in Morris & Co.'s Oxford Street showroom in London that Easter before being presented to Exeter College. Lightfoot did not live to see the finished tapestry; he died at the Rectory at Exeter College on 23 March 1887.
Versions.
The Adoration proved the most popular of all Morris & Co. tapestries for both church and domestic settings. Ten versions were woven, each with a different border design:
The 1904 version, lately in the collection of Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Berge, was to be auctioned in February 2009, but at the last minute was withdrawn from the sale by Berge and donated to the Musée d'Orsay.
"The Star of Bethlehem".
In 1887, Burne-Jones revisited his tapestry design as a full-scale painting titled "The Star of Bethlehem". The colour palette with its rich blue-greens differs greatly from both the original watercolour modello and the Morris tapestry, and its large size allowed him to add a wealth of fine detail not possible in the tapestry version, especially in the clothing. "The Star of Bethlehem" was completed in 1890 and exhibited at the New Gallery, London, in the spring of 1891 before being sent on to the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, where it remains.

The first building of Roxas High School was situated in Quezon Boulevard near Feati University. It was established in 1948 and is the first high school to be named after a former president, Manuel Acuna Roxas. [http://www.opae.gov.ph/news28.html]
Special Science.
The establishment of the Special Science curriculum was spearheaded by the Department of Science and Technology- Science Education Institute in the 1980s. [http://www.sei.dost.gov.ph/simula.html] For the moment, support form DOST has been withdrawn and Special Science classes are maintained by the Division of City Schools in the implementing schools namely Manuel A. Roxas High School, Ramon Magsaysay High School, Victorino Mapa High School, Arellano High School and Araullo High School, with the exception of Manila Science High School which is a recognized science high school.
To be eligible for the Special Science sections, applicants must have final elementary grades no lower than 85 in Science, Math and English and 83 in other subjects. They are subjected to examination which includes knowledge of Sciences and use of Abstract Reasoning.
They are provided with elective subjects to fulfill the aim of the program; that is to give the students good grounding in Science, as well as in other subject areas.
There are two Special Science sections in Roxas per year level.
The student body is headed by the Supreme Student Government with officers elected yearly.
Facilities.
The School has seven buildings - the Main (L-Shaped), Vocational, Maceda, Hizon, Home Economics, SEDP and Administration buildings and three makeshift structures, two of which are temporary.
The Main, Vocational, Macaeda and Hizon buildings house the academic subject classes. The H.E. building is now used by the Science and Technology Department. The SEDP building is where H.E. classes are held. One of the two Guidance offices, the Museum, and EMIS office occupy the Administration, Marcos-type, building.
As of June 2006, the Main building, which is the most used, was declared "condemned" and unfit for use. [http://www.mb.com.ph/node/86214] This was explained by the impact of the 1990 earthquake that hit Manila. After the declaration, the school was forced to squeeze schedules and rooms. This called for 13 makeshift rooms.
On February 22, 2008 President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo led the groundbreaking for the PHP 220 million 4-storey building to replace the old structure. Also present in the event were Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim, Manila 6th District Rep. Benny Abante and 5th District Rep. Amado Bagatsing and Education Secretary Jesli Lapus.

Pink runs an intergalactic gas filling station. He gives a robot who gives him a credit card, a free lollipop. An intergalactic space man (The Little Man) flies to the station. The panther closes the station, making the space man so mad that he sends another robot to take off the bolts and screws to open the station. It does not work, and the space man throws his helmet off in anger. Then he sends another robot to catch a key, which the panther has.
The space man is flying a jet-pack through space. Pink takes the jetpack off his back, hiding in a cloud, sending the space man plummeting into a flower, is spat out, and Pink is chased by the villain. He goes into a molecular disassembler/re-assembler machine. He teleports to another one, with the space man doing the same thing. The panther throws a flower into the molecular disassembler/re-assembler machine, making the space man half space man, half flower. He is chased by a bee, and Pink Panther goes into the device once more. A bee flies in, making the panther half panther/half bee.

Heavy legs

Heavy legs () is an alleged medical condition, described as an "unpleasant sensation of pain and heaviness" in the lower limbs. It is recognised primarily in France, and to a lesser extent elsewhere.
Due to the limited recognition it has received, and because of its proliferation in the media and by the alternative health community, many medical practitioners believe it is a sign of hypochondriasis.
The cause may be venous insufficiency or peripheral arterial disease.
Remedies may include drinking plenty of tea, essential oil massages and walking in the sea; or alternatively sleeping with the legs elevated, wearing compression products like support stockings and possibly taking diuretics.
It was described by BBC reporter Emma Jane Kirby as "a curiously French complaint ... the illness you can only get in health-conscious France."

Plot summary.
Josie repeatedly attempts to impress her crush, Ethan Lancaster, with little success,even tripping down an up escalator at the mall to try to get his attention, while her best friend Cami is doing everything she can to become the high scorer on the basketball team so that she'll be chosen to participate in a demonstration with the coach's old friend and her idol, Rebecca Lobo. Cami agrees to help Josie get Ethan's affection, while Josie agrees to help Cami with basketball. However, Ethan starts flirting with Cami, who has also been secretly crushing on him as well and can't resist flirting back, even though she knows she's being a bad friend to Josie. Josie finds out about Cami and Ethan's relationship, and seeks her revenge by telling Ethan that Cami has kleptomania. The girls get into a fight, and Josie starts hanging out with her annoying science fair project partner, Frederick Vine, whom Josie finds is actually a good friend. Cami befriends her delusional science project partner, Caroline. Later, a smug Erica Green, the sidekick of Cami and Josie's worst enemy, Ashley Holt, reveals that Ethan was only paying attention to Cami to make Ashley jealous. Ashley had recently broken up with Ethan, but now the couple's back together.

He has also filed a lawsuit against the Circuit Court Budget Committee in order to protect the powers provided the office by the Missouri Constitution. The Missouri Constitution provides that "pon the expiration of the terms of office of the clerk of the circuit court for criminal causes of the city of St. Louis, and the term of the clerk of the St. Louis court of criminal correction, the offices of such clerks shall cease to exist and thereafter the clerk of the circuit court of the city of St. Louis shall have the powers and perform the duties and functions of such clerks and shall serve all divisions of the circuit court, except the courts presided over by an associate circuit judge, the judge of the probate division of the circuit court and by municipal judges." The Circuit Court Budget Committee has attempted to give that power to the presiding judge. Both Favazza and the judges have appealed the decision of the trial court. The appeal is currently pending.
In August 2010, Favazza lost the seat to Jane Schweitzer. Favazza ended his time in the Circuit Clerks position saving the city millions of dollars and creating many programs to make St. Louis safer.

Haptics

Haptics is any form of nonverbal communication involving touch (from Greek ἅπτω = 'I fasten onto, I touch').
Haptic customs differ greatly throughout the world. In many Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, people greet each other with one kiss on the cheek, for example in Argentina. In Spain, people greet each other with two kisses on the cheek. In Colombia, shaking hands or verbal greeting is common and probably without hugging. In Peru, when men greet one another, they usually do so shaking hands or with a verbal greeting, otherwise, whenever a woman is involved, greeting involves kissing on the cheek or verbal greeting. In Brazil, kisses when greeting women can vary from one to three, and be fake (kissing the air) or on the cheek; men can salute by shaking hands or demonstrate comraderie by slapping one another’s shoulders or backs.
In the United States, the main form of greeting is shaking hands, though when greeting friends it is not uncommon for them to hug.
Every culture has a different perception of touch as communication.

Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, locals were mainly occupied in rural economy. The Nartan collective farm had sufficient land holdings and a material and technical basis for a farming economy. The main crops grown are cereals, such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sunflower. In addition, fruits, such as apples and pears, and vegetables were grown, and livestock such as cattle was maintained. As a collective farm, households had individual plots of lands attached for growing for personal consumption and occasionally for market. Some households in Nartan continue to maintain the original personal use lands as gardens.
Community and consumer facilities include the local government building, a village club house, a supermarket, three schools, including two secondary and one elementary school, an outpatient clinic (now a village hospital), and a kindergarten. There is also a boarding school for the orphans.
At present, the population of the village—mainly females—is self-employed working on the lands attached to their residences. The unemployment rate is very high for both qualified and unqualified labor. The leaseholders of the former collective farm properties as the employers are not able to provide the population with suitable work. In the end, the people leave for earnings and for good to Central Russia or foreign countries.

Danny's Song

"Danny's Song" is a song written by the American singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins. It was written as a gift for his brother Danny for the birth of his son Colin. It first appeared on an album by Gator Creek and a year later on the album "Sittin' In", the debut album by Loggins and Messina. The song is well remembered for both the Loggins and Messina original, as well as Anne Murray's 1972 top-ten charting cover.
Loggins and Messina version.
Loggins and Jim Messina released "Sittin' In" in 1971, and although the album yielded no Top 40 radio hits, one song that received a significant amount of radio airplay was "Danny's Song". Loggins wrote the song for his brother Danny Loggins in 1970 when Danny became the father of a boy named Colin -- his first son. Loggins and Messina would achieve chart success in 1973 with their song "Your Mama Don't Dance", but their version of "Danny's Song" remains one of their best-known songs through frequent airplay on rock and adult contemporary radio stations.
Anne Murray version.
Canadian country-pop music singer Anne Murray was a fan of the original recording and recorded a cover version in 1972. Included on her album of the same name, Murray's version of "Danny's Song" was a hit, reaching the Top 10 on three major "Billboard" music charts in early 1973. On the pop chart, the song reached number seven; on the country chart, it peaked at number ten; and on the easy listening chart, it spent two weeks at number one in March of that year. Murray's version also earned her a Grammy Award nomination in the category Best Female Pop Vocal performance at the Grammy Awards of 1974, losing out to "Killing Me Softly with His Song" by Roberta Flack.
Murray stated that she loved the original version, but the song took on a deeper meaning for her after the birth of her first child a few years later. In an interview, she stated that "Whenever I was singing that song, it was very meaningful."

The town was named for the family. The first post office in Brownsville was established January 28, 1833, with John H. Beall as postmaster. He was succeeded on February 3, 1836, by John Brown, who was born near Brownsville, December 20, 1790, served as a soldier in the War of 1812 and saw action at the Battle of North Point.

The historic sites of the city (also spelled Hsing-p’ing) can be found in Xingping Old Street and Fishing Village about 2 km (1.3 miles) from the town. The old banyan tree, which needs as many as eight people's outstretched arms to encircle it, and Guandi (General Guan Yu) Temple which was built in the Qing Dynasty both tell the long history of the town.
Other places of interest in the city includes tomb of Han Maoling,Huo Yang's tomb,and Xingping's North Tower. 
Liu Jin (also known as Liu Chin), born circa 1451 or 1452, is from the area of Xingping (Hsing-p’ing). A son of T’an lineage, when he was made a eunuch under the aegis of a eunuch official named Liu, he appropriated that surname. Infamous for being an extremely corrupt official who abused his office to amass a great fortune, he was executed in Beijing in 1510 for treason by a "thousand cuts" over a three-day period. He died on the 2nd day after 300 to 400 cuts.

Strange situation

The Strange Situation is a procedure devised by Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s to observe attachment relationships between a caregiver and child. It applies to children between the age of nine and 18 months.
Structured Observation.
In this procedure of the strange situation the child is observed playing for 20 minutes while caregivers and strangers enter and leave the room, recreating the flow of the familiar and unfamiliar presence in most children's lives. The situation varies in stressfulness and the child's responses are observed. The child experiences the following situations:
Four aspects of the child's behavior are observed:
On the basis of their behaviors, the children were categorized into three groups, with a fourth added later. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver.
Secure attachment (B).
A child who is securely attached to its mother will explore and play freely while the caregiver is present, using her as a 'safe base' from which to explore. The child will engage with the stranger when the caregiver is present, and will be visibly upset when the caregiver departs but happy to see the caregiver on his or her return. The child feels confident that the caregiver is available, and will be responsive to their attachment needs and communications.
Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base to return to in times of need (also known as "rapprochement," meaning in French "bring together"). When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the mother's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style for learning and making use of resources in a non-threatening environment. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the mother is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. Others have pointed out that there are also other determinants of the child's attachment, and that behavior of the parent may in turn be influenced by the child's behavior.
Anxious-avoidant insecure attachment (A).
A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver - showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.
Ainsworth’s narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as ‘a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection’ by de-emphasising attachment needs. Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver - avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.
Anxious-ambivalent/resistant insecure attachment (C).
Children classified as Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant (C) showed distress even before separation, and were clingy and difficult to comfort on the caregiver’s return. They either showed signs of resentment in response to the absence (C1 subtype), or signs of helpless passivity (C2 subtype). Hans et al. have expressed concern that ‘ambivalent attachment remains the most poorly understood of Ainsworth’s attachment types’. In particular, the relationship between ambivalent/resistant (C) and disorganisation (D) is still to be clarified. However, researchers agree that the Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.
Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D).
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed ‘tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to precede crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through’. Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was “without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress”.
Drawing on records of behaviors discrepant with the A,B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's graduate student Mary Main. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganised' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. However, it should be noted, despite initial symptoms of disorganized/disoriented behaviors, Lyons-Ruth widely 'recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior.' 
There is ‘rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment’ from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. Yet the Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticised by some for being too encompassing. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new ‘D’ classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as ‘open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished’, as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might treat too many different forms of behaviour as if they were the same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a ‘strategy of desperation’ and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that ‘even disorganised attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent’. However, 'the presumption that many indices of “disorganisation” are aspects of organised patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganisation, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children’s capacity for response’.
Main and Hesse found that most of the mothers of these children had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequently studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganised attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.
Critique of the Strange Situation Protocol.
Michael Rutter describes the procedure in the following terms:
"It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov & Estes, 1984). To begin with, it is very dependent on brief separations and reunions having the same meaning for all children. This may be a major constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances. Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation have been developed for older preschool children (see Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990) but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood. Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behavior. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn & Waters, 1990). A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also it is not at all obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".
Ecological validity and universality.
With respect to the ecological validity of the Strange Situation, a meta-analysis of 2,000 infant-parent dyads, including several from studies with non-Western language and/or cultural bases found the global distribution of attachment categorizations to be A (21%), B (65%), and C (14%) This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions.
However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions. In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above. One study was conducted in North Germany in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in Sapporo, Japan where more resistant (C) infants were found. Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behavior as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978).
In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens, et al., 2007. found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of amae and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure-resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of amae.
Attachment measurement.
Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, it should be noted that continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports Richters et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn et al., 1990). The original Richter’s et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult the paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.

Gilles Caron

Gilles Caron (July 8, 1939 – April 5, 1970) was a French photographer and photojournalist.
Biography.
Gilles Caron was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France, of a Scottish mother and a French father, Edouard Caron, an insurance company manager. After the divorce of his parents in 1946, Caron spent 7 years in a boarding school in Argentières, Haute-Savoie. A keen horserider, Gilles Caron briefly embraced a career in horse races, before moving to Paris where he attended the lycée Jeanson de Sailly. He then moved on to study journalism at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Internationales, still in Paris.
He served his National Service in Algeria from 1959 as a paratrooper in the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (3ème RPIMa). After nearly 2 years fighting a war he opposed, Caron refused to fight after the Generals' putsch, an aborted coup d'état attempted by 4 former French generals in April 1961. As a result he spent 2 months in a military prison before finishing his military service in 1962.
After returning to Paris Gilles Caron married Marianne, a long-time friend. They had 2 daughters, Marjolaine (born 9 March 1963) and Clémentine (born 8 December 1967).
In 1964 Gilles Caron started working with Patrice Molinard, a fashion and advertisement photographer. In 1965 he joined the APIS (Agence Parisienne d'Informations Sociales) where he met Raymond Depardon, then working for Dalmas agency. It was during this period that he had his first major success as a photojournalist, with one of his photos illustrating the leading article of France Soir (February 21, 1966 issue, on the Ben Barka affair). After leaving the APIS and briefly working for a celebrity photography agency, Caron joined Depardon and the founders of the recently created Gamma agency in 1967.
For the next 3 years Caron covered most of the high-profile conflicts in the world in various countries.
In 1970 Gilles Caron went to Cambodia after king Norodom Sihanouk was deposed by Lon Nol on March 18, 1970. On April 5 Gilles Caron disappeared on Route 1, a road between Cambodia and Vietnam controlled by Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge.

St George's Square

St George's Square is a long narrow garden square in Pimlico, London SW1, England. At the northern end is Lupus Street, with Pimlico tube station close by and Belgrave Road to the east. At the southern end is Grosvenor Road (A3212) running along the River Thames.
History.
Pimlico's development was started in 1835 by the landowner, the Marquess of Westminster, and the building was supervised by Thomas Cubitt who also designed the gardens. St George's Square was originally laid out in 1839 as two parallel streets running north-south but by 1843 had been developed into a formal square, London's only residential square open to the River Thames. The first residents moved in in 1854. Until 1874 the square had its own pier for steamers. 
St George's Square was in the parish of George Hanover Square and was named after the patron saint of England. In the gardens, now known as Pimlico Gardens, stands a stone statue by John Gibson of William Huskisson MP — the first person ever to be run over and killed by a railway engine — wearing a Roman senatorial toga. The statue, originally designed for the Royal Exchange, was placed in the gardens in 1915. The statue was described by Sir Osbert Sitwell as "boredom rising from the bath". The Church of St Saviour (1864) stands at the north end of the square; it was designed by Thomas Cundy the Younger, who was the surveyor for the Grosvenor estate.
Residents.
The square has had many notable residents. The author Bram Stoker died at number 26 in April 1912, the author and gamesman Stephen Potter lived at number 56 in 1924 while teaching at a crammer at number 68, and William Makepeace Thackeray's eldest daughter Anne Ritchie made her home at number 109 from 1901 to 1912.
Today.
Much of Cubitt's original square remains and is predominantly four and five storey white stucco townhouses, although these have now been divided into flats. A survey in 2007 showed that 34% of residents are aged between 30 and 45 years old and that the dominant ethnic group self-identifies as White British (75%).

BK Mladá Boleslav

BK Mladá Boleslav (Bruslařský klub Mladá Boleslav) is an ice hockey team in the 1. Česká Hokejová Liga, the second highest level in the country, following relegation from the Czech Extraliga at the end of the 2011/2012 season. They play their home games at Ško-Energo Aréna.
History.
In 2000 and 2001, Mladá Boleslav won the 2. národní hokejová liga, and in 2008 won the 1. národní hokejová liga. In that year, they joined the Extraliga, after winning a promotion-relegation play-off against HC Slovan Ústečtí Lvi.
In each of its first three seasons in the Czech Extraliga, Mladá Boleslav has had to win a promotion-relegation play-off in order to ensure its survival, most recently beating Slovan Ústečtí Lvi 4-3 in the best-of-seven series.
During the 2010-2011 season, the team was deducted 22 points for having used players who were not correctly registered to the club, an affair which also involved the clubs HC Plzeň and HC Kladno. An appeal against the penalty was turned down. The club was later fined 3 million Czech crowns in a separate matter in which its administration was ruled to have deliberately withheld information concerning club debt.
In September 2011, local born player Radim Vrbata of the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes, bought a 33% share in the club.
In April 2012 the club was relegated from the highest Czech competition, the Czech Extraliga, after, once again finishing in last place and the subsequent promotion-relegation play-off. This time they were defeated by HC Piráti Chomutov in seven games, and will once again play in the 1. Česká Hokejová Liga.
Experienced coach František Výborný, father of the team's captain David, has been hired as coach for the 2012-2013 season.
The club finished the league phase of the 2012/2013 season in first place with 117 points from 52 games.
For the 2012/13 a new system for promotion and relegation between the Extraliga, (the Czech Republic's highest level), and the První Hokejová Liga, (the league below, literally First Hockey League), which would involve the two worst teams from the Extraliga and the two best teams from the První Liga was devised. Each team would meet each other team twice at home and twice away making 12 games per team in total. Points would be awarded in the same way as in the regular season, that is, 3 points for a win in regulation, 2 points for a win in overtime, 1 point for an overtime loss, and 0 points for a regulation loss. Since both semi-finalists would enter the promotion/relegation play-off, the První Liga championship final was dispensed with. BK Mladá Boleslav, however, as the winning semi-finalist with the better regular season record secured the championship trophy ahead of the other victorious semi-finalist HC Olomouc. The battle for promotion and relegation was completed by Piráti Chomutov, newcomers to the Extraliga, who had earned their place by defeating BK Mladá Boleslav in the previous season when the promotion/relegation play-off took the form of a best-of-seven series, and Bílí Tygři Liberec, who were fighting for survival for the first time since earning promotion to the Extraliga in 2003.
BK Mladá Boleslav began the play-off with two away losses, 1-2 in Chomutov and 0-3 in Olomouc. Things turned around, however, in the following three, (all home), games, when they first defeated Liberec 7-3, then Chomutov 4-3 after a shoot-out, and finally Olomouc 4-2. Their poor road form then continued. They succumbed to Chomutov 1-2 and to Liberec 1-4 before recording their one and only away victory of the campaign 3-1 in Olomouc. Three home games then followed, in which the team was again unbeatable. Impressive wins over Liberec, (7-0), and Chomutov, (5-0), made Slovakian goaltender Michal Valent one of the stars of the competition. These wins were followed by a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Olomouc, a team already out of contention which featured six junior players. At this point Mladá Boleslav, Chomutov and Liberec were inseparable on 20 points each with one game remaining. Mladá Boleslav took on local rival Liberec in the decisive game. With the scores level in the 53rd minute Boleslav forward Tomáš Nouza received 5 minutes plus game penalty for a hit on Tomáš Bulík after being adjudged to have elbowed the opponent in the head. Shortly after Lukáš Pabiška was penalised for delay of game. With a two-man advantage Liberec won the game by a score of 2-0.
Following the game in Liberec BK Mladá Boleslav's management submitted an official protest to the league's governing body on three counts, a perceived foul on goaltender Valent, the delay of game penalty against Pabiška, which the club claimed was not deliberate, and most importantly the decision to hand Nouza a five-minute penalty for what the club believed was not a foul. The league commission rejected all three protests adjudging that the referees' decisions were correct. Therefore, Piráti Chomutov and Bílí Tigři Liberec retained their places in the Extraliga for the 2013/14 season, while BK Mladá Boleslav and HC Olomouc remained in the První Liga.
The schedule for the 2013/14 První Liga has been announced, with Mladá Bolelav due to begin with a home game against Draci Šumperk on September 11.
Coach František Výborný has confirmed that he will remain with the club for the forthcoming season.
