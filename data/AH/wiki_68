IDT Global Israel

IDT Global Israel is a multi-lingual contact services company headquartered in Jerusalem, Israel.
Until July 1, 2008, it was a fully owned subsidiary of IDT Corp.; on that date, 80% of the company was sold to its Israeli CEO, Eli Ninio, with 20% remaining in the hands of Howard Jonas' IDT Corp..
Among the company's customers are Netgear, McAfee, 888.com, and the Israeli political party Shas. Most of the company's projects are not in Hebrew - Israel's primary official language - but rather in various European languages, including English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish and others. Until 2007, American companies were the company's main customers; these included AOL and Knowledge Networks. Since 2008, the company has focused almost exclusively on the European and Israeli markets.
The company's main location is in a Har Hotzvim office building which is shared with the Israeli branch of NDS Group. A smaller office is located in the Tel Aviv neighborhood Ramat HaHayal.
Philosophy.
When the company was founded in 2004, it was not intended to be profitable. The company was, at that time, focused on the American market in particular, employing almost only new immigrants ("olim chadashim") to Israel from North America. Similar companies in India, however, were much cheaper and more profitable due to the lower labor costs there. Howard Jonas, founder of IDT Corp., founded the Israeli branch of his company due to a desire to provide Western immigrants to Israel with an easy entry into the Israeli workforce: they could work in an Israeli company and earn a decent salary, without needing to speak Hebrew fluently. During the company's initial years, most of the activity was at night: shifts from 23:00 until 7:00 were rule rather than exception.
With the deteriorating situation of AOL, the AOL project was gradually downsized and eventually closed and the vast majority of its employees dismissed. Other American projects also closed or downsized, and as the company shrunk, it refocused on the Israeli and European markets. The nighttime operations gradually came to a near-halt, with most projects working during daytime hours.

Republic Day (Niger)

December 18, 1958 is commemorated in the Republic of Niger as Republic Day, the national holiday.
Importance of date.
Although not the date of formal, complete independence from France, December 18 marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across The French Colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider this date to be the founding of their national institutions. Between December 18, 1958 and August 3, 1960, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community.
Commemoration.
Since 1958, the 18th has been an historic anniversary, widely commemorated, but not a national festival. In 2005, the government of the Fifth Republic of Niger declared the 18th a national holiday, in conjunction with the August 3rd Independence Day.
The 18th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities. It is a Public Holiday, in which government offices and many businesses close. The 50th anniversary celebrations were held in 2008, centered not in the capitol, but in the regional center of Tillabéry, and surrounded by sports, musical and arts competitions, the opening of new buildings, a National Youth Festival, and other public festivities. Since the beginning of this national festival in 2006, the official commemorations have always taken place at Regional capitals. Zinder was chosen for 2006 (the 48th anniversary) and Tahoua for 2007. The National Youth Festival, previously held at other dates, has been tied to the new Holiday.

<doc id="20758543" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20758543" title="Rangzieb Ahmed">
Rangzieb Ahmed

Rangzieb Ahmed is a British citizen who was allegedly the highest ranking al-Qaeda operative in the United Kingdom (UK). Ahmed, who was a key link between British recruits and al-Qaeda leaders, was responsible for setting up a terrorist cell in Manchester and contacting one of the terrorists responsible for the failed London bombings of July 21, 2005.
Early life.
Ahmed was born in Rochdale in Greater Manchester and moved to the Kashmir area of Pakistan at the age of seven or eight. At the age of 18, Ahmed was arrested by Indian forces after allegedly fighting as a member of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and was held in an Indian jail for seven years without charge; during this time Ahmed was also allegedly tortured. While incarcerated, Ahmed received money from Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who later had Daniel Pearl murdered. Ahmed was eventually released in 2001 and he subsequently visited the UK for a brief period of time before returning to Pakistan. He returned to the UK again in 2005.
Al-Qaeda and British intelligence.
In 2005, surveillance by British intelligence revealed a diary in Ahmed's possession (located in his luggage at the time) containing al-Qaeda contacts, with some contact details written in invisible ink. Included in the contact list were the personal details of Abu Hamza Rabia, who was later killed in Pakistan on November 30, 2005, during a US/Pakistani joint operation. Traces of explosives were also found on Ahmed's rucksack. Following his arrest, Ahmed was initially held in a secret Pakistani prison facility, where he claims he was tortured alongside Hassan Ghul.
A second confrontation with the UK authorities occurred in 2007 when Ahmed was captured at London's Heathrow Airport following his arrival from Pakistan. On this occasion, he was charged with "directing the activities of an organization which was concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism", "possessing three books containing information which would be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism", and "possession of a rucksack containing traces of an explosive, in circumstances which suggested it was for a purpose connected with terrorism".
In December 2008, Ahmed was convicted in the UK of "directing the activities of an organization which was concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism". Such a finding of guilt meant that Ahmed was the first member of al-Qaeda to be convicted for directing terrorism in the UK. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and has been directed to serve a minimum of ten years before he is considered for parole.
Controversy.
On July 7, 2009, David Davis, a British Member of Parliament (MP), accused the UK government of "outsourcing torture". Davis contended that the UK government allowed Ahmed to leave the UK and enter Pakistan (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted), that Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence detained and questioned Ahmed under torture, and that British intelligence and police agencies had full knowledge of this. Davis further accused the UK government of trying to gag Ahmed by preventing him from coming forward with accusations after his imprisonment following his return to the UK. Davis stated that there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's CONTEST strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."

Insight Film Festival

The Insight Film Festival (IFF) is a biennial short film event focusing on interfaith films that has taken place in the UK from 2007 to the 4th Festival, held in 2013. IFF claims to be the UK's only interfaith film festival and has the tagline "Faith in Film". IFF exists to encourage filmmakers throughout the world to make films about the subject of faith, irrespective of their own personal world views. The Festival creates events and spaces where such films can be displayed, discussed and celebrated. It welcomes participants from all faith backgrounds and none and focuses particularly on young filmmakers. In doing so it wants to make positive contributions to understanding, respect and community cohesion. IFF organises an awards ceremony to reward film of excellence and relevance to the objectives of each prize. IFF is not a religious organisation: it is a Community Interest Company that allows space for discussion, learning and screening films. The Festival welcomes filmmakers and other participants of all faiths and none to take part. IFF continues to expand into new areas of work outside the Festival itself: expansion of awards; education events; Insight Annual Lectures; workshops; curation projects; and participation within other film festivals and other relevant events to screen an Insight strand.
History.
1st Insight Film Festival.
Venue, Nexus Arts Cafe Manchester (2007)
The Festival was launched in 2007 as an initiative of religious and education television producer John Forrest with the support and encouragement of the Centre for Screen Studies at the University of Manchester, through the personal involvement of Dr David Butler and other media practitioners from the Centre. The initial idea of IFF was to publicise an invitation to make a film about faith, with a prize of £1000 attached alongside a seminar event to discuss faith in the context of film. Response exceeded expectation and convinced the organisers to run an expanded event in Manchester in 2009.
2nd Insight Film Festival.
Venue, Zion Arts Centre, Manchester, now called Z-arts (2009)
The 2nd IFF was a larger event than the inaugural gathering, which meant that the Festival moved to a larger venue, which remains the IFF's home in Manchester. The main innovation was the introduction of an awards ceremony that presented an award for the best film submitted to the festival ("see" Awards section). The 2nd IFF was the first to encourage filmmakers around the world to submit their work to a judging panel that considered the merits of quality and relevance to the theme of the films entered into the show.
3rd Insight Film Festival.
Venue, Z-arts, Manchester (3–4 December 2011)
More than 300 delegates attended the 3rd IFF, again held at Z-arts. The Festival in 2011 saw the introduction of the Insight Annual Lecture ("see" Lecture section), now a key part of the Festival's remit. The Festival comprised two days of screenings, workshops and discussions. The programme included a preview of a UK feature, viewings of over 50 short films from across the globe. The 3rd IFF managed and judged nine awards, which resulted in nine winning film entries and seven special commendations ("see" Awards section for full list of winners)
4th Insight Film Festival.
Venue, Z-arts, Manchester (15–17 March 2013)
The 4th IFF comprised three days of screenings, workshops and discussions, including presentations of short films from all over the world. Filmmakers from a total of 64 countries submitted their work for consideration for awards. On 15 March 2013 Insight held their first ‘Education Day’, an exclusive daytime event for local schools. At a special awards ceremony on 17 March 2013, winning films were announced in a range of categories, including the prestigious Coexist Award that bestows a cash prize of £1000 to the film that best depicts the ‘uniting of faith’ across the world’s religions ("see" Awards section for full list of winners)

<doc id="20758607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20758607" title="Jason International Company">
Jason International Company

Jason International, Inc. is a manufacturing company specializing in hydrotherapy bathing products, including soaking, air, whirlpool, and air-whirlpool baths. Jason International was founded in 1982 by Remo C. Jacuzzi, of the Jacuzzi family that developed the first hydrotherapy pumps and products. Jason International is headquartered in North Little Rock, AR.
History of Hydrotherapy.
The history of Jason International is based around its founder, Remo Jacuzzi, whose story is entwined with the Jacuzzi family as a whole. Remo’s grandparents, Giovanni and Teresa Jacuzzi, lived in northern Italy through the early part of the 20th century. Remo’s father, Valeriano, was the second of thirteen children.
In 1907, Valeriano and his brother, Francesco, immigrated to America in order to find a better way of life. After working with pick and shovel building railroad tunnels in the northwest, the two brothers migrated to southern California to work in agriculture. Soon two other brothers joined them, one of which was Rachele, who became fascinated with aeronautics while serving in the Italian army. Rachele was an inventor and theorist who published "Creation", a book that theorized the existence of black holes, and that preceded any scientific proof of their existence. Eventually two additional brothers joined them.
Brother Rachele developed the highly efficient wooden “toothpick” airplane propeller which became the product that launched the founding of Jacuzzi Brothers, Inc. in 1915. Many of these propellers were used in WWI.
In 1920 the Jacuzzi Bros. company debuted their J-7, the first enclosed cabin monoplane built in the United States. In a test run returning from Yosemite to Oakland, the J-7 suffered damage and crashed, killing all passengers on board including Giocondo Jacuzzi, one of the brothers. This tragedy led the family to pursue other interests outside of aviation.
Rachele continued his research, eventually developing the Frostifugo, a device that utilized a steam-driven propeller to blow warm air over citrus crops of California, thus preventing them from frost. In 1926, Rachele developed and patented the revolutionary deep-well injector pump which launched Jacuzzi brothers into an international company. 
After Rachele’s death in 1937, the family members still working at Jacuzzi Brothers continued to test and develop new types of pumps for the agriculture industry, many of which became mass-produced and sold in both national and international markets. Brother Candido Jacuzzi became general manager of the company and helped develop their most famous invention, the whirlpool bath for home use. As a means to ease his son Kenneth’s rheumatoid arthritis, Candido worked with company engineers to build a portable therapy pump that could be placed in a home’s standard bath for at-home hydrotherapy use. In 1954 the pump was patented, and in 1962 the company launched the first built-in pump for a whirlpool bath, the J-500 and J-600.
Remo Jacuzzi.
Remo Jacuzzi’s experience in hydrotherapy far predates his work with Jason International. Remo grew up in Antioch, California and received his B.S. in Business Administration and Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. He went to work for Jacuzzi Brothers full-time immediately after school and worked as a sales engineer. 
After a major conflict and resulting lawsuit between members of the family, Candido stepped down as president of Jacuzzi Brothers. In 1968 Remo and his family moved to São Paulo, Brazil where he became president of the branch of the family company there. In 1980 Remo moved back to the U.S. and was appointed president of Jacuzzi Brothers. The headquarters at the time was in Little Rock, Arkansas. After the 1979 sale of Jacuzzi Brothers by the family to a corporate conglomerate, Walter Kidde, Inc., Remo decided to start his own business. 
In 1982 Remo founded Jason International, with the headquarters and manufacturing facilities in southwest Little Rock. The name Jason is an acronym for JAcuzzi SON, to reflect the history of the family. Remo and his wife, Paula, have six children, three of whom work for Jason.
"Spirit, Wind & Water" was written and published by Remo in 2007, chronicling his family history and the history of Jacuzzi Brothers.
Jason International.
The first products manufactured by Jason were a line of outdoor spas. In 1983 Jason introduced their first line of whirlpool baths. In 1988 they segmented their bath offering into two different collections. The company moved to their current location in North Little Rock, AR, in 1989. 
In 1992 Jason introduced the Remo Jacuzzi Signature Series of baths. In 1995 Jason introduced the whirlpool jetted neck pillow. In 1996 they introduced Sani-Design technology for whirlpool baths.
Jason manufactured the first air bath produced in the U.S. in 1999. Following this, in 2001, Jason manufactured the first combination air-whirlpool bath in the U.S. In 2004 they introduced the Carrera Collection of solid surface baths, designed by Shawn-Ian Bruce. 
In 2008, Remo Jacuzzi was honored by being inducted into the Haas School of Business Hall of Fame at the University of California at Berkeley.
Today, more members of the Jacuzzi family are employed at Jason International than at any other hydrotherapy company in the United States.

Zenvo

Zenvo or Zenvo Automotive is a Danish sports car company located in Præstø on the Danish island of Zealand. It is managed by Jesper Jensen, who is also the founder of the Jensen car maker, and founded and financed by Troels Vollertsen. The name 'Zenvo' is derived from a combination of their names.
Zenvo Automotive was founded in 2004. The first prototype of what became the Zenvo ST1 was completed in December 2008 and production began in 2009. Only 15 cars were built: they were sold to approved customers. The car was sold in the United States through the California based company Red Sea Distribution; The cost of the U.S. based model was estimated at 1.8 million USD, which included a free watch valued at $50,000.
The Zenvo ST1 was critically panned by the British motoring program Top Gear after a series of unfortunate accidents during filming of a segment for the show, including the car catching fire after a cooling unit failure. Another car from the company eventually finished a complete timed lap of the Top Gear Test Track, which was very wet at the time due to the extreme weather that plagued England at the time, the resulting time was worse than the time a BMW M5 costing nearly a tenth of the price had reached. Zenvo responded to Top Gear with a statement published on the Danish website Pro Street.

Foreign body in alimentary tract

One of the most common locations for a foreign body is the alimentary tract. 
It is possible for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the mouth, or from the rectum.
The objects most commonly swallowed by children are coins. Meat impaction is more common in adults.
Swallowed objects are more likely to lodge in the esophagus or stomach than in the pharynx or duodenum.
Diagnosis.
If the person who swallowed the foreign body is doing well, usually a x-ray image will be taken which will show any metal objects, and this will be repeated a few days later to confirm that the object has passed all the way through the digestive system. Also it needs to be confirmed that the object is not stuck in the airways, in the bronchial tree.
Treatment.
Most objects that are swallowed will, if they have passed the pharynx, pass all the way through the gastrointestinal tract unaided.
However, sometimes an object becomes arrested (usually in the terminal ileum or the rectum) or a sharp object penetrates the bowel wall. 
If the foreign body causes problems like pain, vomiting or bleeding it must be removed. 
Swallowed batteries can be associated with additional damage, with mercury poisoning (from mercury batteries) and lead poisoning (from lead batteries) presenting important risks.
One technique used is endoscopic foreign body retrieval.

Anjediva Island ( "Anjadiv"; ; also Anjadip Island) is an island in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Canacona in the South Goa district, Goa, India. Legally and constitutionally, it remains a part of Goa, although there is a widespread misconception that it is a part of the Karnataka state off whose coast it lies.
History.
Anjediva, as Portuguese territory, was used by the Christians and Hindus of the mainland as a refuge during the invasion of the coastal kingdoms of Bednore and Soonda by Tipu Sultan, who had created the new state of Khodadad after usurping the throne from the Maharaja Wodeyars of the Kingdom of Mysore. The ruins of Shri Aryadurga temple which was destroyed by the Portuguese is still to be found here. The Saraswat Brahmins on the island who could not bear this horrendous inquisition and mass destruction of temples done of by the Portuguese had no other option, rather to shift the deity to a neighboring place, now called Karnataka. The temple of Shri Aryadurga is located in the North of Karnataka, in a place called Ankola. Anjediva also has a fort built by the Portuguese

Muskox intrusion

The Muskox intrusion is a layered intrusion in Nunavut, Canada. It is located northeast of Great Bear Lake and south of Kugluktuk on Coronation Gulf. It was formed during a large magmatic event during the Proterozoic by hotspot or mantle plume volcanism that emplaced the widespread Coppermine River Group flood basalts.
The intrusion is a tilted trough shaped body with an exposed length of and a thickness or original vertical dimension of over . Rock types include picrite, peridotite, dunite, pyroxenite, gabbro and granophyre. A feeder dike of olivine gabbro is exposed "below" the now tilted sequence.
Potassium argon dating in the region provides an age of 1095 - 1155 Ma for the Muskox intrusion, 1100 - 1200 Ma for the Mackenzie dike swarm and 740 - 1200 Ma for the Coppermine basalt flows (younger dates are interpreted as having been reset by later intrusion of gabbro sills at 604 - 718 Ma). Further stratigraphic and structural evidence provides further support that the Muskox, the MacKenzie dikes and the Coppermine flows are of the same magmatic event that formed the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province and the Muskox is interpreted as occupying the magma chamber which fed the volcanism.

<doc id="20758876" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20758876" title="Leitrim Observer">
Leitrim Observer

The Leitrim Observer is the oldest newspaper in Leitrim. It is a weekly newspaper published every Wednesday and once competed with another newspaper called the "Leitrim Post" which has since closed down due to poor sales.
History.
The "Leitrim Observer" is celebrating its 124th birthday this year. It was originally founded by the Mulvey family in 1889 and was bought by Pat Dunne, for a rumoured sum of £150 some time before 1910 .The paper has experienced a very varied and colourful history. The Black and Tans made the paper their first stop when they came to Carrick-on-Shannon during the Civil War and badly burned the premises, destroying a lot of the early files of the paper.
In those times the local news pages were printed at the paper's works in Carrick-on-Shannon, while the 'international' news pages were printed elsewhere, and of course, the front page was already devoted entirely to advertising. During Pat Dunne's internment in Ballykinlar, Co. Down, his sister Liza ran the paper for a time. Not many people know that at one point the paper was printed on a Thursday and it was only when the war started in 1939 that this had the effect of bringing the paper's publishing day back a day to a Wednesday, in order to meet the Dublin train which was reduced to running on a once weekly basis.
The paper was brought initially by canal to Carrick and about one and a half bales of the paper would be enough for that week's paper. Each paper was folded by hand and it was not until the early 50's that the first folding machine was introduced. In 1947 a major blizzard in the West of Ireland brought everything to a standstill including the Observer. It was a few days late that week as the storm had knocked out all electricity in the area and made transport impossible.
Down the latter part of the 20th century the paper moved from hot metal printing to the use of linotype machines.The third linotype machine to be bought for the paper had to be lowered from a four story building in Cork city before it could be transported back to Leitrim. Another milestone in the history of the paper was the massive investment for the Observer of an electronic photo-engraving machine, only the second of its kind in Ireland, which set Pat Dunne back £5,000.
Pat Dunne died one Sunday afternoon in 1968, which saw the end of an era for the Observer. However, his nephew, Greg then took over the running of the company, re-organising the paper and spending £10,000 on a Reel Fed Flat Bed printing machine from London and a Duplex machine which enabled the paper to introduce 'spot' colour occasionally. In later years another Pat Dunne, son of Greg, took over as managing director of the paper.
The "Leitrim Observer" is one of the few provincial papers that can boast full computerisation with everything from the newsroom, to advertising, to photographs, processed through state of the art technology. This modern advancement has also resulted in full page make-up on computers with the pages then sent for printing in Northern Ireland. In September 1998 Scottish Radio Holdings purchased the "Leitrim Observer" for £1m. UK based group Johnston Press later purchased the "Leitrim Observer" in June 2005 and are the present owners.
Circulation.
According to ABC, circulation declined to 6,273 for the period July 2012 to December 2012, this represented a fall of 9% on a year-on-year basis.

Hornblower Hybrid

In 2006 San Francisco based Hornblower Cruises & Events began working on developing hybrid propulsion systems for its vessels. After two years of development and engineering their first vessel was introduced in San Francisco Bay in 2008. The second hybrid vessel is currently under construction and will go into operations in New York Harbor in 2011.
San Francisco Hornblower Hybrid.
The Hornblower Hybrid is the first known multi-hulled hybrid ferry boat in the United States. It is the first hybrid ferry in San Francisco, and the first hybrid ferry to be used to transport visitors to a National Park (Alcatraz).
The Hornblower Hybrid was built by Alcatraz Cruises in 2008. It uses a combination of solar, wind and diesel power to operate. In addition, much of the interior is also made from recycled or LEED certified materials.
The Hornblower Hybrid is a catamaran, with a fully enclosed main deck, and covered roof deck. The vessel, which was previously a commercial diving boat, has undergone a retrofit, repower and refurbishment at Bayside Boatworks in Sausalito, CA. This vessel was designed and created in house and no grant or public money was used. The two lead engineers on the project were employees Keir Moorhead and Cameron Clark.
The Hornblower Hybrid uses power generated by two ten-foot-tall twisted-Savonius wind turbines and a photovoltaic solar array covering the awning on the top deck. That power is converted and stored in batteries which power the navigation equipment, lighting, and electronics on board. Excess power is stored in the main propulsion battery banks.
In addition to solar panels and wind turbines, the Hornblower Hybrid also has Tier 2 marine diesel engines. These cleaner, fuel-efficient engines reduce the amount of diesel fuel used, emissions and overall carbon footprint. The customized drive system allows the captain to monitor the energy needs of the vessel and select the most efficient power sources. For example, when the boat is idle at the dock, the engines will shut off, and the motors will run on energy stored in the battery banks.
The vessel also contains a number of other environmentally friendly materials. The carpeting contains post consumer recycled materials, is recyclable and meets the US Green Building Council LEED criteria for recycled content. A significant portion of the interior signage is printed on Plyboo, a composite material made from sustainable sources and containing no harmful chemicals. The countertops throughout the vessel are made by Vetrazzo from pieces of recycled vodka bottles. The lighting throughout the vessel is LED, which requires a fraction of the energy of standard bulbs and provide an equal or greater amount of illumination.
Alcatraz Cruises' fleet already contains two of the greenest diesel-powered ferryboats on the Bay. Alcatraz Clipper and Alcatraz Flyer were recently repowered with the most fuel-efficient Tier 2 Marine engines available and use selective catalytic reduction units. This same technology will be used on two new commuter ferryboats in the Bay Area, scheduled to be in use in 2009.
New York Hornblower Hybrid.
The announcement by Statue Cruises on the New York Hornblower Hybrid comes two years after the introduction of the first hybrid still operating regularly in San Francisco to and from Alcatraz and Angel Island. The vessel has been completed and left Bridgeport, CT on October 26, 2011. It is now at Statue Cruises marina at Liberty State Park in New Jersey next to the Statue of Liberty. 
In addition to using solar power, wind power, and low-emission diesel, the New York Hornblower Hybrid also runs on hydrogen fuel cells, making it the first hydrogen hybrid ferry in the world. The Hybrid is 168 feet long by 40 feet wide and designed to carry 600 passengers. It features two Helix wind 5-kilowatt wind turbines, a 20 kilowatt solar array, LEED certified carpets, LED lighting, and an interior made almost exclusively of recycled and sustainable materials.
On October 27, 2011 the New York Hornblower Hybrid participated in a parade of vessels celebrating in the Statue of Liberty's 125th birthday. The Hybrid's team is continuing to work with the USCG as they complete the vessels inspections and certifications.
Alcatraz Clipper Hybrid.
The Alcatraz Clipper Hybrid was originally constructed in the early 1970s as a vessel to serve Catalina Island. Over the years the vessel has served guests and visitors in various capacities. Alcatraz Cruises acquired the Alcatraz Clipper in 2008 and retrofitted it to have Tier II engines with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units. In 2011 Alcatraz Cruises implemented Hornblower's Hybrid technology in order to once again improve the vessel in working to decrease its overall emissions. The vessel in currently completing its USCG inspections and is scheduled to go into service shortly.

Action of 18 September 1810

The Action of 18 September 1810 was a naval battle fought between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. The engagement was one of several between rival frigate squadrons contesting control of the French island base of Île de France, from which French frigates had raided British trade routes during the war. The action came in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Grand Port, in which four British frigates had been lost, and just four days after a fifth British frigate had been captured and subsequently recaptured in the Action of 13 September 1810. In consequence of the heavy losses the British force had suffered, reinforcements were hastily rushed to the area and became individual targets for the larger French squadron blockading the British base at Île Bourbon.
HMS "Ceylon" had been despatched by the British authorities at Madras after the Battle of Grand Port to reinforce the remains of the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley on Île Bourbon. Searching for Rowley off Île de France, "Ceylon" was spotted by French Commodore Jacques Hamelin who gave chase in his flagship "Vénus", supported by a corvette. "Vénus" was faster than "Ceylon", and although Captain Charles Gordon almost reached the safety of Île Bourbon, he was run down and forced to engage the French ship during the night, both frigates inflicting severe damage on one another before the wounded Gordon surrendered to the approaching corvette. As dawn broke, Rowley's flagship HMS "Boadicea" arrived, recaptured "Ceylon", drove off the corvette and forced the battered French flagship to surrender, capturing Hamelin. This was the last ship-to-ship action in the region before the successful invasion of Île de France in December 1810: without Hamelin the French squadron, short on supplies and low on morale, did not contest British control of the region and failed to even attempt to disrupt the invasion fleet.
Background.
The French Indian Ocean island bases of Île de France and Île Bonaparte had been ideal positions from which French cruisers could raid the valuable trade routes from Britain to India since the start of the war in 1803. However, it was not until 1808 that the French authorities spared a significant force to operate from the region, providing a squadron of four frigates under Commodore Jacques Hamelin. In 1809 and early 1810, these frigates operated with impunity along British trade routes, capturing seven valuable East Indiamen, a number of smaller merchant ships and several small warships. In response, the British admiral at the Cape of Good Hope, Albemarle Bertie, provided a small force of British warships to blockade the islands under Commodore Josias Rowley. Rowley knew that it would be almost impossible find and defeat the French ships out in the wider ocean with his limited resources, but he was able to limit French effectiveness by attacking their bases, raiding Saint Paul harbour in 1809 and capturing Île Bonaparte in 1810, renaming it Île Bourbon.
In August 1810, a squadron of four of Rowley's frigates, making up the majority of the forces under his command and led by Captain Samuel Pym, were despatched to Île de France to blockade Grand Port on the south-eastern coast. The arrival of a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré on 20 August prompted Pym into ordering an inadequately planned attack on the harbour on 23 August and two of his vessels were wrecked on the reefs that protected the harbour entrance. Pym was unable to withdraw his remaining ships and the entire squadron was lost, leaving Rowley with only his flagship HMS "Boadicea" and two small brigs to conduct his campaign against six large French frigates. Urgent reinforcements were requested, as French ships under Captain Pierre Bouvet blockaded Île Bourbon.
The first ship to arrive was HMS "Africaine" under the Captain Robert Corbet. In the Action of 13 September 1810, Corbet engaged Bouvet's two frigates alone and was defeated, dying of his wounds shortly after the battle. Rowley in "Boadicea" was able to recapture "Africaine" later in the day, but the frigate was severely damaged and unable to provide any reinforcement to the British squadron. Bouvet retired to Grand Port several days later for repairs, and thus was not on blockade duty on 17 September when HMS "Ceylon" arrived. "Ceylon" was an unusual ship, constructed by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) in Bombay as an East Indiaman merchant ship designed to operate as a 32–gun frigate during wartime. In 1805 she was purchased by the British government and commissioned into the Royal Navy for service in the Indian Ocean. In 1810, her commander was Captain Charles Gordon, who had been ordered to sail to Rowley's aid when word of the losses suffered at Grand Port reached Madras. In his haste to depart, Gordon had been unable to obtain any Royal Marines, whose place was taken by 100 men of the 69th Regiment and the 86th Regiment from the Madras garrison. Also embarked was General John Abercromby and his staff, who were to lead a planned assault on Île de France.
Pursuit.
Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, hoping to find Rowley maintaining the blockade off the port in "Boadicea". Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force consisted of the frigates "Vénus" and "Manche" with the corvette "Victor". Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron. French lookouts on shore spotted "Ceylon" but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with "Vénus" and "Victor".
At 14:00, "Ceylon" spotted Hamelin's ships in pursuit and her crew increased their efforts to escape, mistaking "Victor", which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed "Ceylon" by shortening sail in the hope of meeting "Vénus" (which had outdistanced "Victor") alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, "Vénus" caught up with "Ceylon", which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for "Victor" but attacked immediately, passing "Ceylon" and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.
Battle.
For an hour the frigates exchanged broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised that he was fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging. "Ceylon" was more severely damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, "Vénus" had lost her mizzenmast and two topmasts, while "Ceylon" had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell. With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when "Vénus" was able to haul herself away to await the arrival of "Victor".
The French corvette had been struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at "Ceylon", the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to "Ceylon" without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although it is not clear whether "Victor" opened fire or not before the British surrender). "Victor"'s men boarded "Ceylon" and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to "Vénus" as prisoners of war.
As dawn broke and visibility cleared, the sailors on "Ceylon", "Vénus" and "Victor" realised that they were within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship "Boadicea". Despite hasty repairs, neither "Ceylon" nor "Vénus" were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from "Africaine" to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering "Victor" to tow "Ceylon", but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted "Ceylon" and "Vénus", repeatedly broke the tow rope.
During the day, "Boadicea" continued to close until "Victor" was forced to abandon "Ceylon" and sail in support of "Vénus" at 15:30. As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on "Ceylon", rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed "Boadicea" to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching "Vénus" at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant that he would not be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered "Victor" to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at "Boadicea" as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.
Aftermath.
With the assistance of HMS "Otter", which had followed "Boadicea" from Saint Denis, Rowley was able to return his prize and the battered "Ceylon" to Île Bourbon without significant difficulty. British casualties had been relatively minor for such a difficult engagement, "Ceylon" suffering 10 men killed and 31 wounded and "Boadicea" just 2 wounded. French losses were also comparatively light, with only 9 dead and 15 wounded on "Vénus" and none at all on "Victor". Rowley repaired "Ceylon" and restored Gordon in command. "Vénus" was also repaired, and entered British service as HMS "Nereide" to replace the "Nereide" lost at Grand Port. Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasps "BOADICEA 18 SEPT. 1810", "OTTER 18 SEPT. 1810" and "STAUNCH 18 SEPT. 1810" attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.
With the British squadron bolstered and the French commander and best frigate in British hands, the campaign stalemated. The French were no longer able to repair or maintain their ships due a lack of naval stores on Île de France, and so remained in port and prepared for the inevitable invasion. Rowley meanwhile was busy preparing troops, stores and his squadron for the coming attack, which was led by Admiral Bertie in November 1810. The French squadron made no attempt to disrupt the invasion forces and were captured intact in their harbours. Bertie was credited with the final defeat of Île de France and was made a baronet as reward for the successful campaign, sending Rowley back to Britain with despatches. A court martial, held on HMS "Illustrious" in the aftermath of the invasion cleared Gordon of any blame in the defeat of his ship, although historian William James criticised Gordon's assumption during the battle that "Victor" was a French frigate rather than a much smaller corvette, and identified discrepancies between Gordon's published account and the ship's log.

<doc id="20758999" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20758999" title="Molybdenum hexafluoride">
Molybdenum hexafluoride

Molybdenum hexafluoride, also molybdenum(VI) fluoride, (MoF6) is the highest fluoride of molybdenum. It is a solid which melts just below room temperature; in water, it hydrolyses to give hydrofluoric acid. It is one of the seventeen known binary hexafluorides.
Synthesis.
Molybdenum hexafluoride is made by direct reaction of molybdenum metal in an excess of elemental fluorine gas.
Description.
Molybdenum hexafluoride is a liquid at room temperature. At 17.5 °C, it freezes into a white crystalline solid. The boiling point is 34.0 °C.
The solid structure measured at −140 °C is orthorhombic space group "Pnma". Lattice parameters are "a" = 9.394 Å, "b" = 8.543 Å, and "c" = 4.959 Å. There are four formula units (in this case, discrete molecules) per unit cell, giving a density of 3.50 g·cm−3. The fluorine atoms are arranged in the hexagonal close packing.
The MoF6 molecule itself (the form important for the liquid or gas phase) has octahedral molecular geometry, which has point group ("Oh"). The Mo–F bond length is 1.817 Å.
Applications.
Molybdenum hexafluoride has few uses, and generally appears as an impurity in uranium hexafluoride (in the nuclear industry, since molybdenum is a fission product of uranium) or tungsten hexafluoride (in the semiconductor industry; WF6 is used for chemical vapour deposition of tungsten, and MoF6 appears due to the chemical similarity of molybdenum and tungsten); it can be removed from the latter by reduction of a WF6-MoF6 mixture with any of a number of elements including molybdenum at moderately elevated temperature.

Pravind Jugnauth

Pravind Kumar Jugnauth MP Esq. (born:परावीन्द कुमार जुग्नौथ on 25 December 1961) is a Mauritian politician who served in the government of Mauritius as Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Finance from 11 May 2010 to 26 July 2011. He is also Member of Parliament for the 8th constituency Quartier Militaire and Moka.
He is the heir of the Jugnauth Family a prominent Indo-Mauritian family of Bihari descent settled in Vacoas-Phoenix, Mauritius. He served in Prime Minister Ramgoolam's Cabinet. He previously held the same position from 2003 to 2005.
He is the leader of Militant Socialist Movement since 2003 and is the only son of Sir Anerood Jugnauth and Lady Sarojini Jugnauth. His candidacy for Parliamentary General Elections in Constituency No 9, Rose Belle and Vieux Grand Port in 2000 made him elected as Member of Parliament from there. He surprisingly defeated Arvin Boolell who was and outgoing Minister and also 1st member of parliament being elected from that constituency from 1987. He was appointed as Minister of Agriculture by President Uteem to serve in the cabinet. He served as Minister under the premiership of his father Anerood Jugnauth who became Prime Minister in 2000 after winning the elections with then MSM/MMM coalition.
With a public image of a young, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Leadership elections of the Militant Socialist Movement in May 2003. As a result of having a new leader, Anerood Jugnauth resigned in September 2003 as Prime Minister. Pravind Jugnauth supported candidate Paul Berenger to become Prime Minister. Whilst Berenger was head of the cabinet, Jugnauth climbed the ladder and became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.
Jugnauth studied Law at University of Buckingham, gaining a first class honours degree. He then joined the Lincoln's Inn and became a Barrister. He then joined Aix-Marseille University in France where he graduated with an LLM. He officially joined the MSM in 1990 and was honored Doctor from the University of Buckingham with a "Honoris Causa" in 2005.
In the parliamentary elections of 2010, he and the MSM joined hands with the Mauritian Labour Party and Mauritian Social Democrat Party and formed a coalition known as Ptr-MSM-PMSD. Whilst the alliance presented 60 candidates, out of which 41 were directly elected and formed a total of 45 Mps against 20 Mps for the opposition party, the Mauritian Militant Movement. His party succeeded in bringing 15 directly elected candidates while, the labours won 26 seats and the social democrats obtained 4 seats. He was elected 1st Member of parliament for constituency of Moka-Quartier Militaire.
Navin Ramgoolam, leader of the labours became Prime Minister once more in 2010 and appointed some members as part of the alliance to the cabinet and Pravind was given the 4th position in cabinet.
Following his election as member of parliament, in the process of appointing the new cabinet of ministers, his father, the President Sir Anerood Jugnauth on the advice of Navin Ramgoolam appointed him as Vice Prime Minister & Minister of Finance taking office as from 11 May 2010.
In the morning of 26 July 2011 at 11.55 am, he resigned from his office of minister as well as all other MSM Ministers due to a scandale involving one of the MSM ministers.
Early life.
Born on 25 December 1961 in La Caverne, a suburb area in Vacoas-Phoenix, Mauritius. Jugnauth was born in a modest Hindu family of labourers. He often said that he was born in "a wooden hut" of his maternal grandmother. He was born to Anerood Jugnauth a then barrister and to Sarojini Ballah a school teacher. He has an elder sister, Shalini Jugnauth, married to famous Dr Kishan Malhotra.
In various interviews, Pravind stated that he has live a political life since birth. He stated that his father and uncles were all members of Independent Forward Bloc, a former political party led by Sookdeo Bissoondoyal (a former Minister in the Cabinet of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam) during the independence rally made by the country in 1967 so as to obtain autonomy from British Authorities.
His father were one of the few people to attend the conference and meeting on negotiations on the independence of Mauritius. Pravind Jugnauth states that he remembers all part of it. After independence, his uncle was appointed Attorney General in cabinet and his father was appointed as Junior Minister. He said he still remembers all negotiations on different aspects on the new constitution.
He went on to study at the local Primary School where he obtained his mother as teacher. He always mentioned his mother as his confidant and his father as his inspiration. After primary schooling, he went to Royal College Curepipe where he passed his O Levels and A levels. He then went on to study law in UK.
Early politics.
Pravind Jugnauth officially joined the Militant Socialist Movement in 1990 and helped as an activist member of the party. He saw his father remaining in power for a fourth time as Prime Minister in 1991 where he became more active in politics. He was candidate for the first time in the general elections of 1995 in constituency Vieux Grand Port and Rose Belle but was defeated and came fourth due to the landslide victory of the Labour Party and Mauritius Militant Movement. In 1996 he was elected as Councillor in the town of Vacoas-Phoenix until 2000 where he stood as candidate in the same constituency but returned as first member of parliament for the same constituency as 1995. He was elected as Deputy Leader of the MSM in 1999.
Navin Ramgoolam resigned as Prime Minister few days after and Cassam Uteem appointed Sir Anerood Jugnauth to the Clarisse House. Pravind was then appointed as Minister of Agriculture in September 2000. He served as such from 2000 to September 2003. He was then appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. Pravind experienced the downfall of his political party. The electorate of the MSM shifted from the support of more than 30% to less than 5% of the population gradually from 2003 up to now. In 2004 while the MSM was the largest party in parliament and forming a coalition government, a poll indicated that the Labour Party had a support of 46%, the Mauritian Militant Movement had 39% and the remaining of only 15% associated them with the MSM. While the Labour party was in force having increased from a support of less than 10% in 2000 to 46% in 2004, the MMM also had an increase in approval ratings. The MSM was the only party to shift from being the most powerful to the less powerful party in the country.
In 2008 the MSM once again lost some of its supporters. A new poll was made 2008 by a local newspaper which gave the Labour Party a total of 51% of support of the population, the MMM coming in second position with 45 and the MSM came last with only 4% of the poll. Pravind Jugnauth's image as a young and more democratic leader was tarnished when he lost the major of his supporters. Many MSM members joined either the MMM or the Labour party. In an Issue of 2 October 2011, a local newspaper made a recent poll and the MMM came out first with 64% of approval and the Labours received 39% and the remaining 5% did not associate them with the two parties probably showing the electorate of the MSM.
2000 to 2005.
As Minister of Agriculture from 7 September 2000 to 7 October 2003, Jugnauth presented the Sugar Sector Strategic Plan and led a reform process in the sugar sector to ensure its long-term viability and competitiveness. He initiated a process to convert the sugar industry from relying almost exclusively on the production of sugar into a fully diversified sugar cane industry with emphasis on the production of ethanol, agricultural rhum, special sugars, electricity generation from bagasse and other high value added products. After these reforms, the sugar sector has been able to bring down its production costs significantly and better face the challenges stemming from the reduction in the guaranteed sugar price under the Sugar Protocol with the European Union.
While working on the reforms in the sugar sector, he negotiated a package for workers under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme. Some 8,000 workers who opted for voluntary retirement received cash compensation exceeding 2.5 billion rupees and some 825 arpents of land worth 3 billion rupees.
Jugnauth also made reforms in the non-sugar agricultural sector by placing non-sugar agriculture on the path of modernisation and sophistication. He encouraged hydroponics and other modern methods of production while at the same time strived for excellence in agricultural biotechnology research and expertise in the field. He initiated actions to set up a National Agricultural Biotechnology Institute and Food Technology Laboratory in Mauritius; he later launched the Small Planters Welfare Fund. The fund caters to the welfare of planters and their families and provides crop insurance schemes designed to financially support planters whose crops are affected by unfavourable weather conditions.
As Minister of Finance from 7 October 2003 to 5 July 2005, Jugnauth reduced taxes on thousands of commodities. He increased subsidies on basic commodities and gave salary compensations well above inflation rates in two successive years. He launched a project to make Mauritius a Duty Free Island.
Pravind Jugnauth had some clashes with his then Prime Minister Paul Berenger however stayed and supported the coalition government.
eaders said the alliance MSM / MMM, Rama Sithanen insult himself and makes demagogy when it's a failure of government economic policy. In 2004 Pravind Jugnauth mentioned that from 1995 and 2000, the unemployment rate rose from 5.5% to 8.8% with 45,000 unemployed, while in the last three years, 32,000 jobs were created. He also mentioned that despite this heavy legacy, the government MSM / MMM kept the budget deficit to 6% and hopes to return to 5.5% in 2004/2005 and 4% in 2005/2006.
2005 to 2009.
Paul Berenger dissolved parliament in June 2005 and announced that the elections would be held on 3 July. The MSM-MMM coalition knowing the fact that the MSM had weakened throughout the years decided to propose Paul Berenger as candidate for Prime Minister. Navin Ramgoolam maintained his alliance called the Social Alliance which was composed of the Labour party and other small parties.
The Social Alliance won a total seat of 38 against the MSM-MMM which obtained only 24 seats. Pravind Jugnauth was defeated in his constituency and received 48% of vote. While the MSM had 14 seats and the MMM,the remaining 10,the MSM-MMM proposed Paul Berenger as Leader of the Opposition and maintained the alliance.
In 2006, Paul Berenger proposed Rajesh Bhagwan another member of the MMM as Opposition Chief Whip. The MSM having more seats than its sister party therefore removed their support from Paul Berenger and broke the coalition. Nando Bodha, general secretary of the MSM became Leader of the Opposition and Pravind Jugnauth continued as Leader outside of Parliament.
Another feud exploded when Pravind Jugnauth did not approve of Ashok Jugnauth- who was an elected MSM MP in 2005 and who is Pravind's uncle- to become Leader of the party and assume the responsibilities of Leader of opposition. Ashok Jugnauth left the MSM for democratic reasons stating that the party was a democratic dictatorship with Pravind as the only leader.
In 2007,two more members of the MSM namely Joe Lesongard, the party's then president and Sekar Naidu left the MSM and sworn allegiance to Berenger and thus he became Leader of the Opposition.
The MSM had weakened more and more since the leader was not in parliament and therefore they did not have a firm authority.
2009 By-Election.
Ashok Jugnauth who is the brother of Sir Anerood Jugnauth and uncle of Pravind was the only MSM MP in constituency Quartier Militaire and Moka and lost his seat as the Supreme Court of Mauritius had convicted him for fraud and corruption during 2000 to 2005 when he was Minister of Health. According to law, a MP who is convicted by the court loses his/her seat with immediate effect. Prime Minister Ramgoolam then announced that a By Election would be happening in order to elect an MP.
Ashok Jugnauth announced his candidacy for the By Elections and received the support of Paul Berenger and his MMM. The labour Party decided not to align any candidate in the By-elections and to everybody's surprise provided their support to Pravind Jugnauth and his MSM who then announced his candidacy in the 8th constituency. On 2 March 2009, he beat out his own relative in the partial elections and gained back his seat in Parliament. His uncle was in the other camp and accepted his defeat humbly
The By-elections sealed the Labour Party and the Militant Socialist Movement alliance for the general elections in 2010.
2010 & present.
The Labour-MSM-PMSD alliance was made and they won an overall of 47 seats against the MMM which obtained only 22 seats. The MSM came back in force from 10 Mps to 13 Mps in parliament and supported the coalition government of Navin Ramgoolam.
Following the victory, he was appointed as Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Finance thus getting back the office he held from 
2003 to 2005. Pravind Jugnauth lasted only thirteen months to the Ministry of Finance from 2010 to 2011. His performance as Treasurer showed that the economic crisis continued and internationally this had impact on the local economy. The recovery was slow in coming even though the country had grown in 2010.The indicators were negative. There was some scarcity of foreign direct investment. Economic growth was driven mainly by infrastructure spending. Despite the crises, the inflation rate was properly maintained and budget deficit was reasonable. The trade deficit was under control.
On 26 July 2011 at 11.55 am, he resigned from his office and all other MSM members resigned as well. However, they continued to support the government however seating as back benches. This was due to the Medpoint Scandal that was discovered by then opposition party MMM.
Medpoint Scandal.
In 2010, the government decided to buy a hospital and to make it a specialized geriatric center. The cabinet of Ministers approved of buying the MedPoint private Clinic which was owned by Dr Kishan Malhotra and Mrs Shalini Devi Jugnauth Malhotra who is the sister of incumbent Minister of Finance Pravind Jugnauth and daughter of incumbent President Sir Anerood Jugnauth.
In such matters involving large outlay of public funds, there is what is often called a gestation period and procedures have to be strictly followed and no stone should be left unturned. Although the decision to purchase MedPoint, which was not operating as a clinic at the time and still not operating, was taken by the government, in the use of public funds, the government is under obligation to consider whether this purchase is in the public interest and whether all possible measures have been taken to clinch the deal at the best possible price for the public and not for the owners of MedPoint. The government is also under obligation to demonstrate what safeguards have been put in place to guard against matters such as abuse of power, corruption and so on.
The government already had in its possession a Valuation Report for « Land and Building » for Rs75 million conducted by the government department Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS) and signed Roshnee Bissessur, No.2 at the Valuation Office, a department affiliated with the Ministry of Finance led by Minister Pravind Jugnauth, brother in law of Dr Malotra, owner of ex-MedPoint Clinic.
Mrs Maya Hanoomanjee, then Minister for Health who is a cousin of the Jugnauth family requested, in September 2010, a new valuation for « Land, Building and Services » to be obtained within two weeks with the view to closing the deal in December 2010. Mrs Hanoomanjee’s yet unjustified urgent request prompted Mr Yodhun Bissessur, the Director of the Valuation Department, to write, on 21 September 2010, to the Ministry of Public Infrastructure (MPI) headed by Minister Anil Bachoo requesting the expert help of that Ministry in Quantity Surveying for the purposes of the valuation of ex-Medpoint Clinic, which proposed acquisition was for use as a Geriatric Hospital, bearing in mind that the new valuation had to include Services.
After missed site visit, further correspondence and twists and turns, the private contractors Hoolooman & Associates were hired to conduct the survey and valuation, reason given being that Navin Ramgoolam’s government lacked the necessary quantity surveying human resources to do so. Mr Ramdyal of the Quantity Surveying Unit of the MPI felt the exercise would take at least two months and not two weeks as allegedly demanded by Mrs Hanoomanjee. Also, the new valuation is not said to be confined only to the MedPoint property after depreciation for the purposes of the purchase, but to second hand medical equipment and the cost of a new replacement building at current prices which Mrs Hanoomanjee allegedly wanted, hence her need for a Quantity Surveyor, who is a professional in the construction industry concerned with building costs. Hoolooman & Associates were also originally involved in the construction of the MedPoint Clinic and they valued the Land, Building and Services at Rs.145 millions (US$5 Millions). If this valuation contained the replacement cost of the building, the government would have therefore purchased a building which is non-existent and paid the seller for a fictitious building. This in itself should go to the root of the contract and be enough to set it aside.
ICAC, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, was formally requested to investigate what has come to be known as MEDPOINTGATE, or the MEDPOINT SCANDAL, a scandal which has the potential to bring down the whole government. Similarities are already drawn with WATERGATE and IRANGATE. In line with the MedPoint investigations, ICAC proceeded to the arrest of two Civil Servants involved in the decisions taken to give the go ahead to the new Rs145m valuation conducted by Hooloman & Associates and upon which the government solely relied for the purchase. The two Civil Servants, Yodhun Bissessur and Aneerood Jeebodhun, the respective Number 1 and Number 3 at the government’s Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS), have, on 5 April 2011, been provisionally charged with "public official using office for gratification", for having ordered a second valuation by Hooloman & Associates which allegedly favoured MedPoint over other contenders through the procedure of tender. The charge implies that the two Civil Servants allegedly took bribes when ordering and accepting the Hooloman & Associates Rs145m valuation without question when their own original valuation was for Rs75m. Mr Bissessur reportedly admitted that he knew the private firm had worked for Dr Malotra and detained « Bill of Quantities » for his clinic, but nevertheless accepted the firm’s valuation of Rs145m without disputing it. Hence, the decision of ICAC to proceed to the arrest of the two Civil Servants in question in the course of their investigations does appear justified.
Then Minister of Health, Maya Hanoomanjee was arrested by the ICAC police and the government chief valuer was suspended from his duties. Pravind Jugnauth was also arrested in respect for conflicts of interest in the matter. The police investigation is still on going.
Family life.
Pravind Jugnauth married Kobita Ramdanee in 1992 and is the father of three daughters: Sonika, Sonali and Sara. His father is Sir Anerood Jugnauth and his mother is First Lady Lady Sarojini Jugnauth. His sister is Shalini Jugnauth Malhotra who is former owner of Medpoint Clinic.

1984 Maryland Terrapins football team

The 1984 Maryland Terrapins football team represented University of Maryland in the 1984 NCAA Division I-A college football season. The Terrapins won the ACC for the second consecutive season.
Regular season.
The biggest highlight of the season was Frank Reich’s comeback against the defending 1983 National Champion University of Miami Hurricanes on November 10, 1984 at the Orange Bowl Stadium. Reich came off the bench to play for Stan Gelbaugh, who had previously replaced him as the starter after Reich separated his shoulder in the 4th week of the season against Wake Forest. 
Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar had led the 'Canes to a 31-0 lead at halftime. At the start of the third quarter, Reich led the Maryland Terrapins on a scoring drive after scoring drive. Three touchdowns in the third quarter and a fourth at the start of the final quarter turned what was a blowout into a close game. With the score 34-28 Miami, Reich hit Greg Hill with a 68-yard touchdown pass which deflected off the hands of Miami safety Darrell Fullington to take the lead. Maryland scored once more to cap an incredible 42-9 second half, and won the game 42-40, completing what was then the biggest comeback in NCAA history.

Vermont Route 143

Vermont Route 143 is a state highway within the town of Springfield in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It connects VT 11 to U.S. Route 5. The entirety of VT 143 is maintained by the town of Springfield.
Route description.
Route 143 begins in the west at an intersection with Route 11 in the center of town, just east of Route 106's southern terminus. The route heads eastward out of the town, and begins a windy journey, turning north, then east, then back to the north, and then to the northeast towards Interstate 91. Route 143 crosses underneath I-91 without an interchange, and continues to turn ever more northward until it reaches US-5, at which point the route is facing almost directly north–south. 
This intersection is Route 143's eastern terminus, just feet from the banks of the Connecticut River and the state border with New Hampshire. This is an isolated area, however, and the nearest border crossings are nearly in each direction: Route 11 crosses the border to the south, southeast of Springfield, and Route 12 crosses the border to the north from Ascutney. These two routes, the closest major roads (aside from US-5) accessible from Route 143's eastern end, also provide the closest access to I-91, at Exit 7 in the south and Exit 8 in the north.

Kremnica Mint

The Kremnica Mint (Slovak: "Mincovňa Kremnica"), is a state-owned mint situated in Kremnica, Slovakia. The predecessor of current Mincovňa Kremnica, š. p. (štátny podnik = state company) was established in 1328, and for nearly seven centuries it has continuously been producing mint articles.
History.
Kremnica Mint was established in 1328 when Kremnica was promoted to a free royal town by the Hungarian King Charles Robert of Anjou; the mint issued several kinds of coins early on, of which the most successful was its ducat. Kremnica ducats were well-known because of their good quality and were considered the hardest currency in Central Europe. Available historical records report that 21.5 million ducats were minted at the Kremnica Mint throughout its history. The aggregate value of this amount, measured at today's prices of gold, would be three billion US dollars (exclusive of the numismatic value).
The mint became very outdated by the beginning of the 20th century, and many called for new equipment and for the mint to be moved to Budapest. However, this did not happen until the end of World War I. As the Czech troops invaded Northern Hungary, the Károlyi government ordered to move the equipment and noble metal stock to Budapest. The Hungarian Government started to mint the first coins with the faulty machines and worn-out dies in Csepel. Even coins minted in 1922 bore the KB mint mark.
The Czechoslovak government had to set up a new mint as well, since not more than the buildings were left in Kremnica. Work on the new machinery started in 1921. Since then, the Kremnica Mint has manufactured all the coins used by the Czechoslovak and Slovak state and minted coins for 25 other countries. Since Kremnica was the site of the sole mint of the Czechoslovak state, the Czech protectorate (1939–1945) was supplied with coins by Germany, and the Czech Republic (since 1993) established its own mint.
Today.
Kremnica Mint manufactures both circulation coins and commemorative coins for the National Bank of Slovakia (Slovak euro coins), but the Mint's available capacities and quality standards make it capable of supplying coins to other countries worldwide.
In March 2013 the Mint won a contract to produce 175 million Sri Lankan 10 Rupee pieces with total value of the contract of 6,032 million USD. This contract is especially valuable for Kremnica Mint as it succeeded in the field previously dominated by the Royal Mint.
Mint marks.
The first mint mark on coins minted in Kremnica was C (for Latin "Cremnicium"), this was changed to K (for Hungarian "Körmöcz" or German "Kremnitz") under Sigismund and later K-B (Hungarian "Körmöcz-Bánya" or German "Kremnitz-Bergstadt"). With a decree from 16 June 1766, Maria Theresa uniformized the mint marks of the Austrian Empire, the new alphabetical system showed the importance of the mint: Körmöcbánya received letter B (Vienna mint received A, Prague mint C, etc.). This was changed back to K.B. (for "Körmöczbánya") temporarily in 1848-49 and finally in 1868. The K.B. mint mark was used after evacuation of the mint to Budapest until 1922. The Mincovňa Kremnica uses its initials (MK) as mint mark.

Tiles of the Hold

The Tiles of the Hold are a tool of divination in the epic fantasy series the "Malazan Book of the Fallen" by Canadian author Steven Erikson similar to the Deck of Dragons. This deck, however, is made up of tiles and acts not unlike a Tarot deck in that it is used to predict future events. In the Malazan world, it is used to give its readers a sense of the state of the Holds. A tile represents a specific role in one of the Holds, although some are the Fulcra (Unaligned) because they do not belong to any one Hold. As of "Toll the Hounds", the eighth book in the series, the Tiles of the Hold consisted of the following, although these will change in the future depending on the ascendancy of mortals or the fall of gods.
Fundamentals.
It was the First Empire in which the Holds were first discovered. The Empty Hold proved a later manifestation. The Tiles of the Hold are used only on the continent of Lether, where the use of the Jaghut warren has prevented the evolution of magic. On the other continents, the equivalent instrument of divination is the Deck of Dragons.
Divination of the Holds.
They, as mentioned before, can be used to divine future events much like the Deck of Dragons. However, unlike the Deck of Dragons, members of the Hold can be places or things. The only diviner seen in "Midnight Tides" was named Feather Witch, for feather witches generations before her time were ones that could read the Holds. In her readings, she could see actions of the individual members of the Holds not as if she were there but images in the form of representations of their actions. This is very unlike the Deck of Dragons, which the cards are drawn and placed in an order on the table/ground/etc. and the meaning is left for interpretation. 
Magic of the Holds.
Hold magic is unrefined, raw magic unlike the Warrens. It has never been said to be used individually; for example, using just the Hold of Ice, etc. 
Before the war officially started between the Letherii and the Tiste Edur, squads of Letherii mages performed time-consuming ritual magic to demolish several Tiste Edur villages; although unknown to the Letherii, they had already been emptied out. 
When the Tiste Edur invaded Letheras in "Midnight Tides", the Letherii used walls of white fire and lightning, while the Tiste Edur mages created dust pillars. The pillars of dust picked up Letherii soldiers, shredded them, and absorbed some of the Letherii sorcery. The Edur magic proved much more effective, but the Edur lost control of it. The Tiste Edur Hold magic finished the battle before weapons were even drawn.
The inhabitants on the continent of Lether only know of magic though the Holds, compared to the rest of the world who use Warrens. The lead sorcerer of the Lether Kingdom was the Ceda Kuru Qan, with Ceda being the title equivalent of the Imperial High Mage of the Malazans; a character speculates that "Ceda" is a corruption of the ancient First Empire word Cedance, meaning unknown; the "Cedance" is also the name of the inner sanctum of the Ceda, or his seat of power - a room with a floor tiled with the Tiles of the Holds. He died in defense of the King when the Tiste Edur invaded, but not before capturing the Tiste Edur's sea-demon through the use of a constructed piece of Hold magic. Ceda Kuru Qan survives as a sentient spirit and is trapped by Karsa Orlong's companion, Samar Dev, in an invested knife containing many spirits and minor ascendants. Through force of will he marshals these spirits trapped in the blade, and is instrumental in the slaying of the seemingly-immortal Rhuland Sengar, as he and his compatriots in the blade are released by Samar Dev to aid Karsa Orlong when duelling Rhulad Sengar. The spirits manage, with the aid of Ublala Pung and Hunch Arbat, Tarthenal Thelomen Toblakai of dubious descent, who invoke additional ritual magic to remove the Sword of the Crippled God, the source of Rhulad Sengar's power, from the mortal realm and to return it from whence it came, to the meagre realm of the Crippled God where it was forged by the then-enslaved Meckros blacksmith Withal. When Karsa Orlong slices the sword-arm off of Rhulad Sengar, the sword is thus out of play long enough to prevent his immediate resurrection. Rhulad, upon his death, returns to the Crippled God's Warren, but without his sword, which, due to the innumerable magics worked upon it from many sides, is now lying on the ground before the Crippled God's "Throne", a ratty tent. Rhulad has a choice whether to take up the sword and return to the world again, or to be killed by Karsa Orlong in the Crippled God's realm, making his death final in all realms. Although Rhulad longs for the dissolution of death, he longs for the forgiveness of his brothers, Fear and Trull Sengar, more. Using this, The Crippled God lures Rhulad into re-taking the Sword. As Rhulad lunges for the Sword, Karsa Orlong decapitates him, ending his life with finality. Withal, the Meckros Blacksmith who was forced by the Crippled God to forge the Sword of Power, takes up the sword and returns it to the forge where it was made to destroy it, stating that an invested weapon can be destroyed in one of two ways: it can be shattered by an even more powerful invested weapon, of which Withal claims none exist. However he has had no contact with Anomander Rake's Dragnipur - another sword that is described as unbearable to bear, even for the stolid, stoic Rake, of forbearance beyond measure - or Dessembrae's/First Sword of the Empire Dassem Ultor's Vengeance, the first of which was forged by the Elder God Draconus using Olar Ethil's/Burn's Hammer, and the second of which was forged by Anomander Rake and used to slay Draconus, and to take Dragnipur: it is unknown if these swords are powerful enough to destroy the Sword of the Mortal King of the Crippled God. However, the point is irrelevant, for Withal knows the only other way to destroy an invested sword: to return it to the forge in which it was created, and destroy it in the way it was created, inverted. Withal, being the Sword's maker, returns to the Crippled God's forge and sunders it.
Of the Malazans, the only person known to use the Holds is Bottle of the Malazan Fourteenth Army (who also has a host of possibly every Warren, many spirit magics, and other hinted magics available to him; he is described by another character as a "Warlock after the old fashion") first seen in "The Bonehunters". His grandmother taught him to use the Holds and was the one who urged him to join the Malazan army. When facing the Tiste Edur at sea, he and the Eres'al helped Quick Ben - who at the time was a boastful yet middling mage, mainly of Shadow and Mockra, who cast the illusion of powerful magics towards the Edur by making the illusion real, and investing it with true power, to successfully defend against an attack of the Tiste Edur warlocks, using a combination of Kurald Emurlahn/The Empty Hold, the Elder Warren of Shadow/Kurald Emurlahn, and the miasmic, chaos-aspected power granted by the lethal (to both its user and target) power of the Crippled God. However, later in the series, after a series of travails, Quick Ben seems to have become as he boasted in truth: he is able to successfully defend against Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake, when veered in to his Draconic form (with the help of some cussers lobbed by Dead Hedge the Sapper, a Bridgeburner returned to life after entering the Refugium, the realm in which the last Imass who did not bind themselves to the Ritual of Tellann, survive). He is shown time and again to have much greater power, and is possibly now an ascendant aspected now to Dark, or even Elder Darkness, as during a Reading of the Deck of Dragons, demanded by the Adjunct Tavore Paran, performed by the once-Fist (equivalent to brigadier), now-Sergeant Bridgeburner Fiddler, an Adept of the Deck, the card for the Magus of High House Dark flies across the room with enough force to bodily lift Adaephon "Quick" Ben Delat off of his feet and pin him to a wall. However, this is dismissed by Sandalath Drukorlat - wife of Withal Meckros, and mother of Korlat, Soletaken Tiste Andii and once-lover of Whiskeyjack, deceased, now Iskar Jarak, leader of the Bridgeburners - ascendants to a man, granted ascension through the power of a Tanno Spiritwalker's Song - guarding Hood's Gate, the "Guardians of the Gate", after Hood's death, "for as long as needed" - laughing, "Magus of Dark! Impossible! He's not even Tiste Andii!" (it is remarked that Quick Ben has extremely dark skin - a defining feature of the Tiste Andii - and Fiddler says many times throughout Quick Ben has "a whiff of Soletaken about him").
In "Reaper's Gale", another attack on the Malazans was performed on the Letherii continent against the entire 14th Army. The Letherii mages linked together and send out a wave of Hold magic to destroy the Malazans and Tiste Edur, the Letherii's 'allies', in the valley. They were protected by Beak, who used all of his 'candles' (Warrens, of which he had command of all, and was described as another mage as having a "blinding glow") to save them. In doing so he gave up his life, since his candles were burnt out (he allowed too much magic to flow through him in a casting of a combination of possibly all Warrens, forming a magical shield which resembled a physical manifestation of those created with Thyr, Warren of Light).

Teesside EfW plant

Teesside Energy from Waste plant (also known as Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill incinerator) is a municipal waste incinerator and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of electricity for the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year. It is located on the River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack Incinerator and opened in 1998.
The station is one of the most modern incinerators operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2 MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.
History.
Replacement for Portrack.
Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, generating 20 megawatts of electricity in doing so. In November 1996, the plant was closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000. Following the closure of the Portrack plant, a new facility to burn Teesside's refuse was constructed. Teesside Energy from Waste plant was opened in May 1998 as a collaboration between SITA UK (the station's operator) and the local authorities of Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Redcar & Cleveland.
Third incineration line.
In December 2006, SITA UK signed a 28-year private finance initiative contract worth £70 million with Northumberland County Council, to provide them with waste management services and to reduce the county's reliance upon landfill. This included the construction of an extra incineration line at the Teesside plant. Civil construction of the extension began in April 2007, with heavy erection beginning that November. Von Roll was the general contractor for the entire extension. In May 2009, the third line, which cost £70 million to build, was brought into operation. It was officially opened on 8 October 2009 by former MP Hilary Armstrong, SITA UK Chief Executive David Palmer-Jones, and Northumberland County Councillor Jeff Reid. At various times, between 60 and 100 people were employed in building the third line, and an additional 20 full-time jobs were created for its operation once open. Built on time and within budget, the extension surpassed expectations in its first year of operation. A year after the opening of the third line, only a fifth of the amount of waste that was being sent to landfill in Northumberland prior to its opening was still being sent there.
Design and specification.
The plant is a large metal-clad building. The metal is finished in the colour 'Goosewing Grey', accented in 'Solent Blue' and 'Petra Red'. The plant's clean, clear lines and colours are said to "contrast favourably" with the nearby industrial buildings.
Until 2009, the station had two operating furnace lines, which together were capable of burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, and generated 20 MW of electricity. However in May 2009 a third line was brought into operation. The plant currently burns 360,000 tonnes of waste a year and generates 29.2 MW of electricity. This is enough electricity to power 60,000 homes.
The original plant uses Babcock and Wilcox Volund boilers to provide steam for a single Ansaldo turbo generator rated at 19.2 MW. The third line uses a Von Roll Inova reciprocating grate to burn the waste, and generates electricity using a single Von Roll Inova three-pass steam generator, rated at 10 MW.
Operations.
The station operates constantly, burning municipal household waste from the local councils of Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland, North Tyneside and Northumberland. When there is a shortfall in household waste, non-hazardous industrial and commercial waste are used to make up capacity. The station burns only residual waste, which is material left over after recycling. The incinerator operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Waste is delivered to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be delivered to the plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, it was announced that the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400 million.
Waste arriving at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises the efficiency of the plant.
From the hoppers, the waste falls onto the furnace-charging chute and from there onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a temperature in excess of 1,200 °C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much in the same way as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.
Gases from the furnace are cleaned using selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, before it is released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.
A recycling centre operates next to the plant, which opened in December 2001. In 2006 a composting facility was opened.
Environmental impact.
Waste to energy plants are strictly monitored, and the plant has achieved various ISO external certificates. The plant is seen to be at the forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal. The plant not only reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill, but displaces the burning of depleting fossil fuels, and makes significant contributions to meeting the North East region's waste recovery and recycling targets.
The future: North East Energy Recovery Centre.
In 2008, it was announced SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it was announced that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.
NEERC is expected to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21 MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50 MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside of London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 in the construction of the plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.
In August 2010, SITA teamed up with Sembcorp UK to build another waste-to-energy facility in the Teesside region. Wilton 11 on the Wilton International complex is to burn a further 400,000 tonnes of waste in the region whilst generating 35 MW of electricity. The plant is expected to be operational by 2015.

Assessor (Italy)

In Italy an Assessor (in Italian language: "assessore") is a member of a "Giunta", the executive body in all levels of local government: regions, provinces and communes.
Assessors are appointed by the chief executive of local government, Mayor in commune, President in province and region, who chairs "Giunta". They serve until chief executive ends his term or resigns, if he doesn't dismiss them. 
In communes with 15,000 residents or more and in provinces assessors cannot be members of "Consiglio" (council), the local legislative body: if a member of council is appointed as assessor, he must resign from council.
Mayor or president usually assigns to each assessor responsibility for a specific aspect of municipal, provincial or regional affairs and the supervision of corresponding branch of local government, called "assessorato" (department). Among assessor one is chosen by mayor or president as his deputy and is called "vicesindaco" (deputy mayor) or "vicepresidente" (vice president).

Philosophy of a Knife

Philosophy of a Knife is a 2008 Russian-American horror film written, produced, shot, edited, and directed by Andrey Iskanov. It covers the Japanese Army's Unit 731, mixing archival footage, interviews, and extremely graphic reenactments of experiments performed there.
The film is four hours long, is presented in two parts ("Part one" and "Part two"), is in English, and shot in black and white. The interviews are shot in color and have English subtitles.
Release.
"Philosophy of a Knife" was shown at the 2008 Sitges Film Festival. TLA Releasing and Unearthed Films released the unrated film on DVD in July 2008. For a short time, "Philosophy" was available on Netflix, but was taken down without a given reason. The film is also accessible in its two parts via YouTube.
Soundtrack.
The film features Manoush and Cyanide Savior's song "Dead Before Born" as well as a song by A. Shevchenko, "Forgive Me", with Manoush speaking the introduction to the track. It also includes an original score by Shevchenko.
Reception.
A score of zero out of five was given by Dread Central, sparking a feud between the website and the film's creators.
The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre has "Philosophy of a Knife" listed as the fifth most disturbing film it has covered, and stated that while it was interesting and intense "I was reminded of Gibson's "Passion" in that the movie takes an ambitious and difficult subject, then spends most of its time focusing only on gore".

Bellzlleb

Bellzlleb (stylized as BELLZLLEB) was a Japanese heavy metal band, formed in Chiba in 1985 by Tetsu and Yuji. Their sound mixed elements from black metal, doom metal and hardcore with influences from Aleister Crowley, the occult, horror, satanism and the dark, heavy sound of British heavy metal band, Black Sabbath. They extensively toured the Japanese national club circuit during the 1980's and the early 1990's and left various recordings from 1986 until they disassociated in 1992. Kuroyume opened for their last gig in 1992 at Meguro Rock-May-Kan.
History.
Bellzlleb was formed in 1985 by junior high school mates, guitarist and composer Tetsu (Genkaku Allergy, Spooky Six Mouse, E.G.O., Love House, Zeus) drummer and arranger Yuji (Scarecrow, Love House), who played as local members of hard rock band Love House in Chiba-city. Rick, the loudest and wildest bass player in Chiba city, was recruited along with Koizumi who sang in local Black Sabbath cover bands. Her vocal style was high-toned with influence from Ozzy Osbourne. This completed the original lineup of Bellzlleb in 1985. Bellzlleb played local clubs Dancing Mother's and local metal festivals which led to participate in the Yamaha amateur band contest East West. In 1985 they participated in the East West national junior finals at Nakano Sun Plaza while still in high school. Their first real break came opening for thrash metal band Black Rose in 1986, whose guitarist and lead composer Pata later joined X Japan. Opening for Black Rose led to motivation to record a live-mini flexi sheet at Kagurazaka Explosion entitled "Satanic Metal". "Satanic Metal" increased Bellzlleb's core fan base leading to another compilation live recording at Kagurazaka Explosion in 1987 entitled "Heavy Metal Force IV". By the Summer of 1987, Bellzlleb had expanded their fan base nationwide by extensive club circuiting in Japan. Koizumi left Bellzlleb in 1987 due to direction disagreement and health related reasons to be replaced by vocalist Rei ex-Hardwave as the new frontman. Co-founder and drummer Yuji left Bellzlleb in 1988 due to disagreement of musical style and direction changes. The recording of Bellzlleb's first full length album "Bellzlleb" originally scheduled for release in 1998 was delayed for one year for this reason. Drummer Eby ex- supported Bellzlleb's live acts and compilation album recordings after Yuji's departure. Fumi was recruited to start recording of their 1989 first full length album, "Bellzlleb" released from Nude Records. Rick left the band not long after the release due to directional disagreement and was replaced by ex-Jurassic Jade bass player, Mataro. With the 1990 line-up, Bellzlleb recorded a second full length album, "Section II ~Aru Gusha no Shougai~" released by Captain Records (owned by Takarajima). Bellzlleb increased their touring schedule nationwide to support their release, however Mataro and Fumi left after the recording to pursue their respective band careers in Japan and overseas. Tetsu and Rei, left without a rhythm section for Bellzlleb in 1991 released an acoustic mini-album, "Inori" released by Nude Records. The final line-up in 1992 consisted of bass player Takami (Rosenfeld) and drummer Kimura. Bellzlleb released their third and last full-length album, "Mr.Ree: ~Kairai to Sad~" in 1992. Bellzlleb toured nationwide and participated in television programs to support the new release, but countless member replacements damaged the life of Bellzlleb throughout the years as to portray how they were haunted as a group. Bellzlleb disbanded because Tetsu knew they could not have continued to produce a better sound than they currently had.

Richard Hardinge

Richard Hardinge (c.1593 – 24 August 1658) was Groom to the Bedchamber to the then Prince of Wales (later King Charles II of England).
Background.
Richard Hardinge was born at Pewsey, Wiltshire. He was the son of John Hardinge of Pewsey and Salisbury and Honora Estcourt. Honora was the daughter of Giles Estcourt, Member of Parliament for Salisbury and Recorder for the town of Poole.
Education.
Hardinge matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University on 20 October 1609, but left two years later without a degree. In 1611 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn.
Parliamentary career.
In 1640 he represented Great Bedwyn in the Long Parliament.
English Civil War.
In August 1644 Hardinge was the bearer of King Charles II's (whilst Prince of Wales) message to the Parliamentarian General and Lord Beauchamp. Essex refused to make peace with the King and therefore the mission did not succeed. He was a friend of Essex.
Further service in Royal Household.
Hardinge accompanied the Prince to Jersey and France and back to England. He spent eight years in exile.
Death.
He is thought to have died at Bruges and is buried at Loosdiijnen.
There is a portrait of Richard still existing and is in the possession of the current Earl of Clarendon, a direct descendant of Edward Hyde, the 1st Earl of Clarendon. The portrait was painted by Cornelius Jansen of the Flemish school c. 1640. 
It was once part of the collection belonging to the 1st Earl at his seat, Clarendon Park, Oxfordshire. He left the collection to his son Henry, the 3rd Earl, who in turn left it to his sister, the Duchess of Queensbury. She took it to Amesbury Park, Wilts., and on her death in 1777, left it to her husband. Later the 4th Duke of Queensbury removed it to Richmond where it was seen by Horace Walpole. Upon the 4th Duke's death, the collection was taken to Bothwell Castle, Scotland and it remained there until the 7th Duke sold some back to the 4th Earl of Clarendon, in whose family it has remained ever since.

HMS Spartan (1806)

HMS "Spartan" was a Royal Navy 38-gun fifth-rate frigate, launched at Rochester in 1806. During the Napoleonic Wars she was active in the Adriatic and in the Ionian Islands. She then moved to the American coast during the War of 1812, where she captured a number of small vessels, including a US Revenue Cutter and a privateer, the "Dart". She then returned to the Mediterranean, where she remained for a few years. She went on to serve off the American coast again, and in the Caribbean, before being broken up in 1822.
Napoleonic Wars.
"Spartan"s first captain was George Airie, but he was soon replaced by Captain Jahleel Brenton, who took "Spartan" to the Adriatic Sea for service in the Adriatic campaign. In May 1807, "Spartan" engaged "Annibal", two frigates ("Pomone" and "Incorruptible"), and the corvette "Victorieuse" off Cabrera in the Mediterranean. 
"Spartan" was very active in the region, attacking numerous French coastal convoys, towns and small warships and in 1809 was employed in attacks on the Ionian Islands, landing troops on Zante and Cerigo in successful amphibious operations. "Spartan" was in action with and at Pesaro on 23 April, and at Cesenatico on 2 May.
In 1810, "Spartan" was operating off Naples and there fought and inconclusive engagement against a much larger Neapolitan squadron on 3 May, for which Brenton was highly rewarded.
War of 1812.
In 1811, Brenton's brother Edward Pelham Brenton took command and operated off the American Eastern Seaboard during the War of 1812, attacking shipping off Cape Sable but otherwise having little success against American merchant ships. 
In July 1812, "Spartan" and captured two American vessels:
The boats of "Spartan" and captured the US Revenue Cutter "Commodore Barry" on 3 August in the Little River, Bay of Fundy, together with three privateer schooners, "Madison", "Olive", and "Spence" (or "Spruce"). "Commodore Barry" was armed with six guns and each of the schooners was armed with two guns. Before the British captured the vessels their crews escaped. They had erected batteries on shore, using the guns from their vessels. They resisted, inflicting some casualties, but then evaded capture. Even so, some men were captured on "Commodore Barry" and remained prisoners of war until paroled in June 1813. Prize money to the crew of the "Spartan" for the "Commodore Barry" was paid in July 1820.
On 17 October 1812 and "Spartan", part of the squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren, were in company when "Maidstone" captured the American privateer brig "Rapid" on the Saint George's Bank. "Rapid" was armed with 14 cannon - twelve carronades of various sizes and two long 6-pounder guns - but her crew had thrown eight of her cannons overboard to lighten her during the nine-hour chase. She had a crew of 84 men and was three days out of Portland. Her backers and provisioned her for a three month's cruise first off the Azores, Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands, and then off Cayenne and Bermuda. The British took "Rapid" into service as , which they later renamed "Ferret".
In 1814, "Spartan" returned to Portsmouth, where command passed to Phipps Hornby, who briefly served with her in the Mediterranean. While commander of "Spartan", Hornby participated in the capture of Elba from the French, for which he was invested with the Austrian order of St Joseph of Würzburg.
Post-war.
With the end of the war in 1815, "Spartan" remained in the Mediterranean under Captain William Furlong Wise, who in 1818 was able to negotiate compensation of $35,000 from the current Dey of Algiers following the depredations of Algerian pirates under the previous Dey, who had died of the plague.
Fate.
In 1819 and 1820, "Spartan" visited the Caribbean and North America. "Spartan" was laid up and then broken up in 1822.

Gid hanasheh () is the term for sciatic nerve in Judaism. It may not be eaten by Jews according to Halacha (Jewish Law). The laws of prohibition regarding the gid hanasheh are found in Masechet Chullin (Hullin) Perek 7.
Source.
The Torah () recounts that Jacob fought with an angel (according to Rashi this was Esau's guardian angel) who could not beat him. At the end of the fight, the angel moves a nerve in Jacob's leg causing him to limp. The verse then states: "Therefore the children of Israel (Jacob) do not eat the gid hanasheh until today."
Removal.
The removal of the gid hanasheh and chelev (other forbidden fats) is called nikkur. Since it is labor intensive to remove all the forbidden parts of the hind-quarters of an animal, the entire hind quarters are usually sold to the non-kosher market.

Self rescue (climbing)

Self-rescue, in climbing, or in the broader activity of mountaineering, refers to actions and techniques, taken by either an individual climber or teams, to retreat or advance from situations which would leave them, otherwise unprepared, stranded (and, possibly, dead).
Self-rescue is an alternative to calling search and rescue (SAR) which can save the climber(s) being charged for SAR services and can avoid putting SAR team members in harm's way. Unfortunately, many aspiring climbers don't take the opportunity to train themselves in real-life conditions (overhanging edges, etc.) and "find they need to seek outside help".
When members of a team require self-rescue, rescuing a fallen partner may expose the rescuer to significant risks. Self-rescue requires having a practiced rescue plan, good communication, and foresight to avoid "an incident within an incident".
Reasons for self-rescue.
Self-rescue techniques can be used to pass a difficult section or to rappel down a multiple-pitch route with an injured climber.
Techniques.
Techniques employed during self-rescue include:

Circular delivery company

Origins.
The first such company was the "Edinburgh and Leith Circular Delivery Company" set up by Robert Brydone in 1865. Brydone undertook to deliver circulars within the boundaries of Edinburgh and Leith for one farthing each. He also delivered parcels which were not covered by the Post Office's monopoly. Brydone, a printer by trade, was declared bankrupt in 1866 but moved to London to form the "London Circular Delivery Company" which merged with the "Metropolitan Circular Delivery Company" in 1867.
Spread.
Further companies soon sprang up, some of which were connected with Brydone. They included:
Demise.
The spread of the circular delivery companies soon attracted the attention of the Post Office who had a legal monopoly on the collection and delivery of letters. In August 1867 the Post Office brought a legal action against the "London & Metropolitan Circular Delivery Company" for infringing their monopoly, which case they won, and the various companies are thought to have stopped operating by September 1867.
Legacy.
The demand for cheaper rates for printed materials was self-evident and on 1 October 1870 the British Post Office issued the first half penny stamp to pay the new reduced charge for printed papers, the small 1/2d bantam.
Collecting.
The stamps appear only in specialist catalogues. Many are thought to have been forged and some may have been produced purely for philatelic purposes and to have never seen genuine use. For these reasons, collectors prefer to collect the stamps on cover, however, such covers are rare. The stamps are classed as cinderellas or stamps for a local post.

Club History.
There was a rugby club in Roscrea during the second world war years. It was formed following a meeting in 1940. The President was Mr. A.C. Houlihan and Paddy Collins became the first captain. The club colours were all white, and all home games were played at Beechwalk.
The highlight was probably the defeat of Thurles in the Mansergh Cup. This was only the club's fourth match. This was probably the best performance of their existence. Travel was restricted during the war years, so the games were limited. The club seems to have faded by 1944. Subsequently there was the Rossory Rangers who had their pitch at Shanboe. This team only lasted a short time as well with some players switching to Rathdowney. Meanwhile some Roscrea lads played with Birr in subsequent years, and it was after Birr's exit from the PTC in 1949-50, when seven of the team were from Roscrea, that the idea was mooted of a club being formed in the town.
The first meeting was held in March 1950. H.M. Read(a local man who had won 13 caps for Ireland and who became President of the IRFU 6 years later) was elected president. The club colours are maroon and white and the reason for this makes a nice little story. Originally the committee had opted for an all-white strip but when they attempted to register the colours with the Leinster branch they were refused on the grounds that other clubs were using the colours. Shortly afterwards the club secretary went to a hurling match between Tipperary and Galway. He was very taken with the Galway colours of maroon and white, so Roscrea have used these colours ever since. This year the jerseys have been re-designed and now they are maroon with white stripes. During the summer the club affiliated to the Leinster branch.
As regards a ground, the club seems to have initially looked at acquiring a pitch at Benamore, a possible pitch on the Limerick road, with eventually a pitch being obtained at Mount Heaton courtesy of Tom Lalor.
The first official match was on October 1, 1950, when Birr were the visitors to Roscrea for a friendly, and were beaten 12-0. Three of the tries were scored by Seamus Power, the other by Tom McCann. The Roscrea team was: Dwyer, McCann, Dunne, Tobin, Power, Rafter, Power, Mossop, O'Connor, Wallace, McManus, Burke, Smith, Reardon, Barry and O Connell.
Success came quickly when Roscrea won the Garryowen cup in 1952 but it was not until 1970 that the second trophy the Manseragh Cup was won Roscrea scaled the heights in 1975 and again in 1980 when they won the Provincial Towns cup- the premier competition for junior clubs in Leinster. Midland's leagues were won during this period and they also qualified to compete in the Leinster senior cup twice. The structure of Leinster rugby has changed in the 1990s with the junior league and 4 divisions.
For a number of years Roscrea languished in division two and in 1999 gained promotion to division one in 1999. This was a brand new ball game. Roscrea had to compete against teams from larger towns like Dundalk, Kilkenny, Naas and Navan. This they did and finished comfortably in the top half of the league, easily retaining their division status. Coach Kevin O'Dwyer was instrumental in developing the players and bringing them to a higher level, which must be maintained to remain in Division one which is highly competitive.

Sierra Suroeste

Sierra Suroeste is a comarca (county, with no administrative role) located in southwestern province of Badajoz in the autonomous community of Extremadura, western Spain. Its capital and largest city is Jerez de los Caballeros.
Sierra Suroeste borders the comarcas of Tierra de Badajoz and Tierra de Barros to the north, Zafra - Río Bodión and Tentudía to the east, and Llanos de Olivenza to the west. The river Ardila, which runs between Andalucía and Portugal, borders the comarca to the south.
The comarca contains ten municipalities: Fregenal de la Sierra, Higuera la Real, Jerez de los Caballeros, Oliva de la Frontera, Salvaleón, Salvatierra de los Barros, Valencia del Mombuey, Valle de Matamoros, Valle de Santa Ana, and Zahínos.
History.
Prehistory.
Prehistoric artifacts have been found in the municipalities of Jerez de los Caballeros, Higuera la Real, Valencia del Mombuey and Oliva de la Frontera. Two stone celtic idols were found in the hermitage of "Nuestra Señora Virgen de Gracia" in Oliva de la Frontera. Celtic fortifications have been excavated in Higuera. Various dolmens can still be seen throughout the area, the most notable being the Neolithic "Piedra Pinchá" in Valencia del Mombuey, and the "dolmen del Toriñuelo" in Jerez de los Caballeros.
Roman Empire.
During the Roman occupation, Sierra Suroeste belonged to several different political regions. First the comarca was a part of Hispania Ulterior, then later being split in two, with part belonging to the province of Lusitania and the other part to Hispania Baetica. The towns that existed during that period were known by different names:
Though other towns in the comarca, such as Salvaleón, claim to have origins during the Roman Empire, there exists no evidence to support these claims.
Jerez de los Caballeros is home to a number of mosaics, stone stairs, and the bridges of Pontón and Viejo, all of which date to early Roman construction. Oliva de la Frontera was a Roman copper-working center, as evidenced by the discovery of 250 metalworking ovens and the remains copper mines and excavated ores. Coins from the different periods of the Roman Empire have been found throughout the comarca.
Visigoths.
A number of inscribed columns date back to the period of the Visigoth occupation of the Iberian peninsula. One such inscription, found in the church of "Santa María de la Encarnación" in Jerez de los Caballeros, dates to 25 December 556. Another, found near Oliva de la Frontera, is inscribed by Count Theudimer in the year 662 CE.
Other inscriptions from this period have also been found. A grave marker dating back to 514 was found on a farm near Alcobaza, and another dating back to 662 was found in a field by Valle de Matamoros. Additionally, latticework from the hermitage of the "Virgen de Gracia" is of Visigoth design.
There is evidence that the municipalities of Fregenal de la Sierra and Salvaleón were established during this time period.
Moorish conquest and Reconquista.
The Moors introduced a number of technological improvements to the daily life of the area. Especially impacted were agricultural practices, such as plowing, wherein the Arabs introduced new methodologies that greatly improved upon the efficiency of existing Roman techniques.
Around the year 1230, Alfonso IX, King of León, conquered the area. Alfonso orchestrated a great massacre of Moors in the area now known as Valle de Matamoros (literally, "valley of killing Moors"). Ten years later, Alfonso led a military campaign through the province to assure its safety, before ceding control of the territory to the Knights Templar.
Renaissance.
The territory experienced a great population boom and flourishing of local economies when the Knights Templar took control of the area. The Templar founded the municipality of Zahínos as a military fortification, and which was later expanded to become a castle, around which the town grew. In 1312 CE, Pope Clement V dissolved the Order of the Templar, and the Knights' lands and titles were transferred to the Spanish crown. The Knights mounted a resistance in Jerez de los Caballeros, and were summarily executed in the castle nearby. The tower in which their throats were slit is now known as the Torre Sangrienta (literally, the "bleeding tower").
The various municipalities that today make up the comarca were then divided among a number of nobles. Oliva de la Frontera, Valencia del Mombuey, and Salvaleón belonged to the Duchy of Feria. Valle de Matamoro and Jerez de los Caballero fell under the control of the Order of Santiago. Fregenal de la Sierra and Higuera la Real became a part of Sevilla.
A number of well-known conquistadors came from Sierra Suroeste, such as Alonso Rodríguez Santos and Hernando de Soto. Perhaps the most famous of these was Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who was born in Jerez de los Caballeros, and who is best known for conquering Panamá and discovering the Pacific ocean.
Geography.
The Sierra Morena mountains intersect the comarca. In this mountain range there can be found a number of major peaks, including: San Cristóbal, Oratorio, del Coto, de la Herrumbre, de la Corte, del Peñón, de Monsalud, de Santa María, de san José, de Botello, de la Cazuela and de las Mesas. The tallest peaks are:
A large number of rivers also run through Sierra Suroeste, the most important of which is the Guadiana. The Ardila Rivers, which forms the border with Portugal, is a tributary of the Guadiana in Extremadura. Other important rivers include the Sillo, Bodíón, Zaos, and Godolid rivers.
Flora and fauna.
Sierra Suroeste is one of the most productive "jamón ibérico"-producing regions of Spain, thanks in part to the abundance of black Iberian pigs in the area. The acorn-eating bovines share the fields with large numbers of horses, sheep, goats, cows, donkeys, mules, and chickens. Additionally, the forests are home to significant numbers of a variety of game animals, especially deer, wild boar, and foxes.
The European Union-designated Special Protection Area Dehesas de Jerez covers 480 km² and occupies approximately third of the comarca. More than thirty mated pairs of black storks make their nests in this area. In addition, numerous other storks roost in the belfries of various churches throughout the comarca.
The comarca is home to large quantities of holm oak and cork oak, two sources of cork and coal. Other common trees include olive trees, chestnut trees, and grape vines. Town plazas are usually decorated with palm and white mulberry trees, especially along the "Paseo de las Palmeras" in Oliva de la Frontera.
The holm oak forests of the area are some of the oldest and best established of all Extremadura, resulting in a variety of flora and fauna being able to develop in these areas. Hiking and sightseeing in these areas is a popular tourist activity, and there are many hiking paths and trails throughout the territory.
Main sights.
Sierra Suroeste is home to a number of officially designated historical monuments. Each municipality is host to several of these historic places, which account for the majority of tourism to the area.
Culture.
The comarca has three major tourist festivals: the passion play in Oliva de la Frontera, Holy Week in Jerez de los Caballeros, and the International Folklore Festival in Fregenal de la Sierra. Jerez de los Caballeros celebrates an annual Exposition of Jamón Ibérico, sometimes called the Festival of Jamón.
One of the major traditional industries of the municipality of Salvatierra de los Barros is pottery, to the point at which it is home to a museum dedicated to the pottery industry as well as an annual pottery fair, the Feria Ibérica de la Alfarería del Barro.
Authors and playwrights born in the area include Benito Arias Montano, Manuel García Torrado, José Ramírez López Uría, José Luis Gil Soto and Milagros Frías.
Gastronomy.
Due to the proximity to Huelva, and the comarca's natural abundance of black Iberian pigs, many pork products are produced and consumed in Sierra Suroeste. These products include, for example, chorizo, salchichón, blood sausages, loins and other cuts, and jamón ibérico.
Some typical dishes include chickpea stew, migas, pisto, caldereta, and bacalao "dorao". Also popular are dishes of nearby Portugal, which are made in a similar manner as across the border.
Sports.
The most popular sport in the comarca, like in much of the rest of Spain, is football. The most popular local team is Jerez CF, which has played in Segunda División B, but currently plays in the Tercera División. Also popular are the various municipal futsal tournaments, as well as the provincial juvenile tourneys.
Basketball is also growing in popularity.

Creative city

The "creative city" was a concept developed by urbanist Charles Landry in the late 1980s and has since become a global movement reflecting a new planning paradigm for cities. It is described in his "The Creative City: A Toolkit for Urban Innovators" and other writings.
Origins.
"The Creative City" when introduced was seen as aspirational; a clarion call to encourage open-mindedness and imagination implying a dramatic impact on organizational culture. Its philosophy is that there is always more creative potential in a place. It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. These might range from addressing homelessness, to creating wealth or enhancing the visual environment. Its assumption is that ordinary people can make the extraordinary happen if given the chance. Creativity is seen as applied imagination. In the "Creative City" it is not only artists and those involved in the creative economy that are creative, although they play an important role. Creativity can come from any source including anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. 
It advocates that a culture of creativity be embedded in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened. 
This requires infrastructures beyond the hardware - buildings, roads or sewage. Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes a city’s mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. To be a creative city the soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. Creativity is not only about having ideas, but also the capacity to implement them.
"The Creative City" identifies, nurtures, attracts and sustains talent so it is able to mobilize ideas, talents and creative organizations. The built environment – the stage and the setting - is crucial for establishing the milieu. A creative milieu is a place that contains the necessary requirements in terms of "hard" and "soft" infrastructure to generate a flow of ideas and inventions. A milieu can be a building, a street an area, a city or a region.
The popularity of creativity came about because of the increased recognition that the world and its economic, social and cultural structures was changing dramatically. This was driven in part by information technology revolution. The old way did not work sufficiently well. Education did not prepare students for the demands of the "new" world; organization, management and leadership with its control ethos and hierarchical focus did not provide the flexibility, adaptability and resilience to cope in the emerging competitive environment; cities whose atmosphere, look and feel were industrial and where quality of design was low were not attractive and competitive. Coping with these changes required a re-assessment of cities’ resources and potential and a process of necessary re-invention on all fronts.
Other influences.
Partners for Livable Places (later Communities) founded in 1977 was important in the trajectory of the Creative City idea. Partners initially focused on design and culture as resources for livability. In 1979 Harvey Perloff encouraged by Partners launched a programme to document the economic value of design and cultural amenities. The "Economics of Amenity" programme illustrated how cultural amenities and the quality of life in a community are linked to economic development and job creation. This started a significant array of economic impact studies of the arts across the globe. 
Core concepts used by Partners were cultural planning and cultural resources, which they saw as the planning of urban resources including design, architecture, parks, the natural environment, animation and especially arts activity and tourism. The terms were introduced into Europe by Franco Bianchini in 1990, who coming from Italy was acquainted with their notion of "resorsi culturali" and into Australia by Colin Mercer in 1991. Bianchini based his notions on Wolf von Eckhardt, who in 1980 in "The Arts & City Planning" noted that "effective cultural planning involves all the arts, the art of urban design, the art of winning community support, the art of transportation planning and mastering the dynamics of community development", to which Bianchini added "the art of forming partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors and ensuring the fair distribution of economic, social and cultural resources". Mercer added cultural planning has to be "the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development." Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: "Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow."
Cultural resources are embodied in peoples' creativity, skills and talents. They are not only "things" like buildings, but also symbols, activities and the repertoire of local products in crafts, manufacturing and services. Urban cultural resources include the historical, industrial and artistic heritage representing assets including architecture, urban landscapes or landmarks. Local and indigenous traditions of public life, festivals, rituals or stories as well as hobbies and enthusiasms. Resources like language, food and cooking, leisure activities, clothing and sub-cultures or intellectual traditions that can be used to express the specialness of a location. They are the range and quality of skills in the performing and visual arts and the creative industries. An appreciation of culture should shape the technicalities of urban planning and development rather than being seen as a marginal add-on to be considered after housing, transport and land-use have been dealt with. This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.
From the late 1970s onwards UNESCO and the Council of Europe began to investigate the cultural industries. From the perspective of cities it was Nick Garnham, who when seconded to the Greater London Council in 1983/4 set up a cultural industries unit put the cultural industries on the agenda. Drawing on, re-reading and adapting the original work by Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin in the 1930s which had seen "the culture industry" as a kind of monster and influenced too by Hans Magnus Enzensberger he saw the cultural industries as a potentially liberating force. 
An important player was Comedia, founded in 1978 by Charles Landry. The first detailed study of the concept was called "Glasgow: The Creative City and its Cultural Economy" in 1990, this was followed in 1994 by a study on urban creativity called "The Creative City in Britain and Germany". In fact the first mention of "the Creative City" as a concept was in a seminar organized by the Australia Council, the City of Melbourne, the Ministry of Planning and Environment of Victoria in September 1988. Its focus was how arts and cultural concerns could be better integrated into the planning process for city development. A keynote speech by David Yencken former Secretary for Planning and Environment for Victoria spelt out a broader agenda stating that whilst efficiency of cities is important there is more: "It should be emotionally satisfying and stimulate creativity amongst its citizens".
The emergence of the Creative Economy and Creative Class.
The publication of John Howkins' "The Creative Economy" and Richard Florida's book "The rise of the Creative Class" gave the movement a dramatic lift as global restructuring was hitting deep into the US. Its timing hit a nerve with its clever slogans such as "talent, technology, tolerance" and interesting sounding indicators like the "bohemian index" or the "gay index", that gave numbers to ideas. Importantly it connected the three areas: a creative class – a novel idea, the creative economy and what conditions in cities attract the creative class. Florida concluded that economic development is driven in large measure by lifestyle factors, such as tolerance and diversity, urban infrastructure and entertainment. 
Critics argue that "the Creative City" idea has now become a catch all phrase in danger of losing its meaning. Cities also tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and activities within the creative economy professions calling any cultural plan a "creative city" plan, when this is only an aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity of the creative city is about lateral and horizontal thinking, the capacity to see parts and the whole simultaneously as well as the woods and the trees at once.

USS PGM-18

USS "PGM-18" was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was built and originally commissioned as USS "PC-1255", a , and was decommissioned and converted in late 1944. USS PGM-18 struck a mine off the coast of Okinawa in April 1945; 13 men lost their lives when "PGM-18" sank.
Career.
"PC-1255" was built by the Luders Marine Construction Company in Stamford, Connecticut. She was laid down on 29 September 1943 and launched on 23 January 1944. She was commissioned as USS "PC-1255" on 1 September 1944. She was decommissioned in October 1944 and converted into a gunboat at the Dade Dry Docks Shipyard in Miami, Florida. She was recommissioned as USS "PGM-18" on 18 December 1944. She was destroyed on 7 April 1945 after striking a mine and foundering off the coast of Okinawa during the Battle of Okinawa.
After being commissioned as USS "PC-1255", the subchaser received her captain, Lieutenant John C. Bigham, Jr., USNR. She spent the first month of duty receiving her crew, bringing on supplies, and being inspected and inventoried. On 16 September 1944, she set sail for the Naval Training Center in Miami, Florida, arriving there on the 19th. The next day "PC-1255" received orders to report to the Dade Dry Docks Shipyard to undergo conversion from a submarine chaser into a patrol gunboat. Her submarine hunting technology and antisubmarine weapons were replaced with six 20mm, one twin 40mm, and one twin .50 caliber machine guns and a 60mm mortar. She was decommissioned in October 1944 at the start of the conversion and recommissioned as USS "PGM-18" when the conversion was finished on 18 December 1944.
With her conversion complete, "PGM-18" returned to the Naval Training Center to undergo shakedown training. The training lasted for two straight weeks of intense drills and exercises, excluding Christmas Day and New Years Day. With her training complete she spent the next several days getting her hull scrubbed clean and repainted. On 17 January 1945 she set out for San Diego, California via the Panama Canal, arriving there on 2 February. "PGM-18" spent several days resupplying before dispatching to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving there on 14 February. While at Pearl Harbor, the ship's captain, Lieutenant Bigham, broke his ankle and was replaced with Lieutenant Cyril Bayley, USNR. On 26 February, she set out for Eniwetok Atoll with fellow gunboat, USS "PGM-29".
On 28 February 1945, an unidentified ship approaching the pair of gunboats at an overtaking parallel course opened fire, firing two rounds which fell short. The unknown ship reversed course and attempts to contact her failed. "PGM-18" monitored a radio message reporting a sighting of a submarine. "PGM-18" proceeded to send out a message reporting that the submarine sighting was false and that they had been mistaken for a submarine. Due to the low profile of PGM gunboats and PC submarine chasers it was not uncommon for them to be misidentified as a submarine. Later, the same ship overtook them and was revealed to be US Army freighter, .
On 6 March 1945, the two gunboats arrived at Eniwetok. While anchored, "PGM-29" was accidentally struck by Liberty ship . While she underwent repairs, "PGM-18" proceeded without her to Guam and then to Ulithi. After a week of shoreleave, she proceeded to Kerama Retto, Ryukyu Islands with a group of "YMS-1" class minesweepers. Throughout heavy kamikaze attacks during the Battle of Okinawa, "PGM-18" and the minesweepers successfully cleaned up Japanese mines at Kerama Retto and off the west coast of Okinawa. The minesweepers turned their attention to the waters of Nakagusuku Bay.
"PGM-18", while following behind "YMS-103" and destroying mines she and other minesweepers cut loose, struck and detonated a mine. Eyewitnesses on nearby ships reported that the explosion was so powerful they could see five feet of sunlight under her keel before she came back down into the water, rolled over, and then foundered. "YMS-103", in an attempt to rescue survivors, struck two mines, blowing off her bow and stem. Despite this, she was able to remain afloat. "PGM-18" suffered thirteen dead or missing and "YMS-103" suffered five killed and seven wounded. The survivors were picked up by other ships in the area. "PGM-18" was only in service for 111 days before her destruction and received a battle star for her involvement in the Battle of Okinawa.

Micaela Ruiz Téllez

Micaela Ruiz Tellez (1821–1904), also known as "La Colchona", was born in Estepa, near Seville, Spain in 1821. She was an enterprising woman who perfected a recipe for mantecados, a traditional Spanish crumble cake often eaten at Christmas.
Commercial enterprise.
Micaela's husband often travelled from Estepa to Cordoba. She had the idea of trying to make mantecados that would last for the duration of his journey and succeeded in perfecting a recipe that allowed them to stay crisp on the outside but tender inside. In 1855, her husband started to sell these mantecado's in Cordoba and they proved to be so popular that Micaela Ruiz Téllez and her husband set up the first factory in Estepa to produce them.
Micaela Ruiz Tellez died at 83 years of age in 1904.

Kumarwarti is a village development committee in Nawalparasi District in the Lumbini Zone of southern Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 4155 people living in 698 individual households. However data derived more recently for marriage and education details has suggested in 2001 the population had grown to over 5000.
History.
On July 27, 2002, the Kathmandu Post reported that over 900 families in the Lumbini Zone area, including people from Kumarwarti had been displaced from their homes following flooding from the summer monsoon.
Then on November 15, 2006, it was reported that Kumarwarti VDC had been subject to attack by Maoist cadres who forcefully stole local farmers' rice.
Politics and conservation.
The Village Development Committee is part of a protected environmental buffer zone in Nepal called the Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP). Within the locality, politically, the VDC is under obligation to respect national Community Forestry guidelines.
However, according to a 2003 Journal and Forest Livelihood report, Kumarwarti has been facing a leadership crisis since 2001, with several people from it failing to provide a committee in discussing protection in a reluctance to deal with the warden and National Park rangers. The people of the Village Development Committee have been criticised for lacking the capacity to deal with the authorities, and to distance themselves away from management roles.
In Kumarvarti, the sale of forest products is restricted within the buffer zone. In 1998 when the poorer Majhi/Bote households wanted to sell their share of thatch grass to outside buyers for Rs 3 per bundle to raise finances, they were denied permission by the authorities.
Religion.
The Village Development Committee is primarily Hindu in religion. However, the 2001 census recorded 82 Buddhists and 91 Christians living within it.
Education.
In 2001, 1802 out of 2212 of the people eligible for school were attending classes. 410 children were not receiving an education, 250 of these were female. Kumarwarti has a number of schools including Kumarwarti English School, Kumarwarti Secondary School and Higher Secondary School/Kumarwarti College. Kumarwarti English School is located at. Rajendra K.C., currently a manager for the national Ideal Friendship-Nepal was previously a lecturer at Kumarwarti College for over two years.

Solar bonds

Solar bonds are municipal revenue bonds issued to provide low-interest financing for lower-cost accelerated development of local renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics. 
The first solar bond authority was drafted by Paul Fenn, creator of Community Choice Aggregation, and approved by San Francisco, California voters in 2001. Under "solar neighborhoods" approach, municipal governments would enter into multi-decade community-wide power purchase agreements with competitive suppliers and issue solar bonds, or "H Bonds", to finance the new supplier's rollout of local renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, offering municipal bond financing to residents and businessess, the debt for which would be repaid on monthly electric bills - an approach that has come to be called "on-bill financing." 
The City of San Francisco enshrined solar bonds in its Community Choice Aggregation program in 2004 when it adopted an ordinance combining the City's authority to procure power for its residents and businesses with its authority to issue revenue bonds under the solar bond authority. Fenn drafted the ordinance (86-04, 2004) for sponsoring supervisor Tom Ammiano, who had also sponsored placing the solar bond authority on the 2001 ballot, and Fenns' company, Local Power Inc., went on to draft a 2007 implementation plan and 2013 business model to implement the $1 billion project. Local Power also contributed substantially to Sonoma county's Sonoma Clean Power program which has a similar structure.
Apart from creating a new generation of Community Choice Aggregations, San Francisco's solar bond authority spawned the subsequent appearance of both public and private financing of customer-owned solar and energy efficiency measures, including PACE financing and the solar power purchase agreement or PPA, transforming the photovoltaics industry in the United States.

De Struise Brouwers

De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a microbrewery located in Oostvleteren, Belgium.
Origin.
Owners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.
Upon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.
The company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning "tough". They render the name into English as "The Sturdy Brewers", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.
Following current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, the brewery has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging.
They have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers. While their Black Albert was originally conceived in concert with USA-based Ebenezer's Pub, a joint effort to create a "Pannepot Cafe" in Brunswick, Maine was abandoned in May 2009.
Awards and recognition.
Craft beer fan rating website Ratebeer selected beers from DSB for 9 of their Top 100 Best Beers of Belgium in 2009. Struise was edged out for the #1 slot only by the venerable Trappist brewers of Westvleteren.
In 2008, RateBeer declared Struise to be the best brewers in the world per their annual members' poll. This was met with mixed opinions in the world of beer enthusiasts. Many of those critical of the award cited the recent founding of the company as well as the fact that DSB did not own a brewing facility at the time.
DSB also received 7 separate awards from Ratebeer in 2007, including accolades for the Aardmonnik and Pannepot.

Continental O-240

The Continental O-240 engine is a four-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled aircraft engine that was developed in the late 1960s for use in light aircraft by Continental Motors. The first O-240 was certified on 7 July 1971.
Design and development.
The O-240 was a new engine design derived from the six-cylinder Continental O-360 and introduced in 1971. It is generally similar in overall dimensions to the Continental O-200, but with a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio, designed to run on 100/130 avgas. The O-240 delivers 30% more power than the O-200 while it weighs only 12% more. It may be mounted in tractor or pusher configuration.
The O-240 was produced under license in the United Kingdom by Rolls-Royce Limited and was used to power the Reims Aviation-built Cessna 150s constructed in France under license. Rolls-Royce acquired the rights to the O-240, but not the IO-240 in 1977.
The fuel-injected IO-240-A and -B were introduced in 1993. The A and B versions differ only in the type of fuel injector used.
The engine was not selected to power any production North American-manufactured aircraft until the Liberty XL-2 entered production in 2006 powered by the IOF-240-B. The IOF-240 is similar to the IO-240-B except that it employs an Aerosance FADEC system to control the ignition and fuel injection systems.

Nikkur

Nikkur is the process of making an animal kosher by removing chelev (forbidden fats) and the gid hanasheh (sciatic nerve).
It is much easier to perform nikkur on the front part of the animal. It is also easier to perform on non-domestic animals such as deer as the chelev does not need to be removed from such animals.
Since it is difficult to perform nikkur on the hind part of domestic animals, the entire hind part is usually sold to the non-Jewish market. This tradition goes back for centuries. While many Muslims do accept that today (e.g. in the Middle East) based on Quranic permissibility of food from people of the book, not all Muslim communities accept Kosher-slaughtered meat, including those hindquarters as halal (e.g. Indian subcontinent). On the other hand, in countries like Israel, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher.

Aaranya Kaandam

Aaranya Kaandam (; ; English title: "Anima and Persona") is a 2011 Indian Tamil action film, written and directed by newcomer Thiagarajan Kumararaja. It is supposedly the first "neo-noir" film in Tamil cinema. The story takes place in a day in the lives of the six protagonists, played by Jackie Shroff, Ravi Krishna, Sampath Raj and newcomers Yasmin Ponnappa, Somasundaram and Master Vasanth. Produced by S. P. B. Charan's Capital Film Works, the film features musical score by Yuvan Shankar Raja and cinematography by P. S. Vinod and editing handled by the duo Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth.
The film was launched on 18 December 2008, with its principal photography being completed by late 2009, which was followed by a lengthy post-production phase. It ran into difficulties as the regional censor board in Chennai raised objection against the film, giving it an adult rating besides demanding 52 cuts. After screening at and becoming approved by the Tribunal in Delhi, the film was released worldwide on 10 June 2011, to high critical acclaim.
It had its world premiere on 30 October 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Award for Best Film. Subsequently, the film was honored with two National Film Awards for Best Editing and Best First Film of a Director category respectively.
Plot.
The film opens with the aging gangster, Singaperumal, forcing himself on a young girl, Subbu. He is unable to perform, and vents his anger by slapping the helpless Subbu. Singaperumal is the grand don of crime in Madras. His lieutenant, Pasupathi, brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about 20 million rupees, has entered the city. The guy bringing the stash wants to sell it for 5 million rupees. Pasupathi sees the immediate easy profit, as well as the long term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such a large supply) and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash really belongs to their arch rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary, and the venture is risky and likely to become messy. He decides to pass. Pasupathi dourly suggests Singaperumal is getting old and rusty. He asks Singaperumal to loan him the five million so he can do the job himself. Pasupathi is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but, instead asks Pasupathi to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. The money for the loan is brought to Singaperumal.
The film introduces Kalaya, a now destitute farmer, and his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli. They live in the slums and earn a meager living staging cockfights; as a coincidence, Singaperumal loves to watch these cockfights. One evening, a man arrives to bunk with Kalaya for the night. This man is the cocaine courier. He routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city, and collects a relatively small fee (10 thousand rupees) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the true value of the stash, and he now intends to sell it himself instead of delivering it to its true owner. He passes out.
Seeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her "so she is prepared to perform for him at night". Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her.
Pasupathi and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump off Pasupathi as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathi overhears this as the call is on speaker mode and gets into a Mexican standoff with others. In a desperate ploy he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape . The other men kidnap his wife, Kasturi, and use her as bait to lure Pasupathi. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasturi to him.
Subbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal. She yearns to be free and live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realize that Singaperumal is merely using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely lovers, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. We learn that Subbu is somewhat educated, and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal.
Kalaya stages his cockfight the following day. But this time, his prize cocks get killed. Kalaya is in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kalaya and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the telephone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathi). Kalaya declares that his financial woes are at an end.
Singaperumal is worried. His stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathi is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapati (Gajendran's right hand man): if Pasupathi seizes Gajapati's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a terrible gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapati that Pasupathi has gone rogue, and that Gajapati is free to take out Pasupathi. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and his avaricious general will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathi. Pasupathi is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathi figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally.
Kalaya calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kalaya at the rendezvous point. After continuous torture, Kalaya is unable to reveal anything as his son Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up calling Pasupathi's number accidentally, and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathi joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kalaya and Kasturi. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash.
Gajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathi. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive at about the same time. Pasupathi pretends to offer the stash to Gajapati, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An engraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathi. Pasupathi leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs mistaking Pasupathi's loyalties charge at each other and ensue in a gangfight. Pasupathi gets out of the fray, and watches as Gajendran and the key generals of Singaperumal's hack each other to bits. Pasupathi's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded. He returns to finish Singaperumal.
Back in his rooms, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. Sappai's faith is shattered. In his first moment of independence, he grabs a pistol and shoots Singaperumal dead! Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots and kills Sappai! When Pasupathi arrives, he finds Sappai and Singaperumal dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Subbu leaves. Pasupathi summons the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang and assumes command. Kasturi is unharmed. Pasupathi gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission.
It is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole thing. She sent Sappai with the bag containing the loan money to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag with the loan money and quietly leaves the city to begin her new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai, too, was not really an innocent victim. The film ends with her line: Sappai is also a man.but all men are sappai (The word 'sappai' has varied meanings, but in this case, it means insignificant to the point of being contemptuous) .
Production.
Development.
In August 2007, following the success of his film "Chennai 600028" (2007), speculation over S. P. B. Charan's next production venture arose. While initial reports suggested that he would produce "Achchamundu! Achchamundu!", starring Sneha and Prasanna, Charan opted to produce a film titled "Aranya Kandam", to be directed by a newcomer Kumar Raja and starring newcomers. However, despite announcing the project, it was called off later that year and Charan started producing the film "Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum" in May 2008.
In late 2008, while "Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum" was in post-production stage, reports surfaced that Charan and Kumararaja were going to revive the project, with noted Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff being roped in for a leading role, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Director Thiagarajan Kumararaja was revealed to be a former Loyola College student, and popular advertisement filmmaker, who has also directed several short films, including the short film "Becky", which was awarded the first prize at the one-minute film competition "60 Seconds to Fame". Kumararaja had previously written the dialogues for the 2007 comedy film "Oram Po" as well. He got the opportunity to work with Charan, when Pushkar-Gayathri, the director duo of "Oram Po", had suggested him to approach Charan, who listened to the storyline and immediately agreed to produce the film, "in a matter of time" as Kumararaja cites. The film was formally launched on 18 December 2008 at the Kodandapani Studios in Chennai.
Writing and inspiration.
The script was written by Kumararaja himself, which he had finished in 2006. He cites that he wanted to make a "racy film" and wrote the climax part first, which would be the "raciest part of a film". He then wrote "multiple story lines with three climaxes" as he felt that one climax was "not enough for a feature film", which eventually turned out to be a "leisurely paced film, taking its own time to unfold" and not a racy film as intended. He cited that, while writing the script, he was sure that it was meant for a matured audience and not for children, "primarily because of the content". Kumararaja went on to add that there were "no hero and no villain introduction scenes, there are no love scenes, no sentimental scenes" but nonetheless considered his film a masala film and not an experimental film. His inspiration behind the film was revealed to be "The Godfather" as well as the thought of "how someone becomes a gangster and continues to be one", clarifying that "Aaranya Kaandam" was not a biography or history of a gangster but "a page out of the life of a gangster". Poster of this film is directly lifted from the poster of Akira a much acclaimed Japanese post-apocalyptic cyber-punk animated film
Casting.
When announcing the film, Kumararaja had already roped in Jackie Shroff, debuting in the Tamil film industry, Ravi Krishna, Sampath Raj of "Saroja" fame along with Guru Somasundaram from the Chennai based theatre group "Koothu-P-Pattarai". Shroff was said to play the role of a "hoodlum", who was chosen after Kumararaja had approached several other Tamil actors, who refused the offer, fearing of their "image". According to the director, the role required a senior person and Shroff had fit the role "completely". Speaking of his role, Shroff remarked that he had done things in the film that he hadn't dared to do in the past 30 years of his career, quoting "I am literally a monster in the film. Actually, I am more like a coconut — hard on the outside, but a veritable softie inside". Ravi Krishna plays a "lover boy", whose role, he claimed would be totally different from his earlier roles. Ravi Krishna was Kumararaja's first choice for the character as he had written it with keeping Ravi Krishna in mind. Sampath Raj enacts the role of a gangster named Pasupathy. Kumararaja finalized Guru Somasundaram for the character of Kaalayan, after he had seen him performing the titular character in Koothu-P-Pattarai's play "Chandrahari". Kumararaja had stated that the voice modulation and pattern of the Kaalaiyan character was based on Somasundaram's performance in the play Chandrahari, which eventually resulted in casting him in the film. Somasundaram cited that the dialogues were also written "keeping the artist in mind".
Yasmin Ponnappa, a popular Bangalore based model, who had appeared in television advertisements and won many beauty pageants, was selected for the role of the lead female character. Her role was, however, written for Pooja Umashankar, keeping her in mind, who couldn't accept the offer as she had given her dates to Bala's magnum opus "Naan Kadavul". The details about the crew members were also published, when the film was announced in early December. P. S. Vinod was chosen as the cinematographer, who had earlier shot films like "Musafir" and "My Wife's Murder", while Videsh was announced as the art director, 'Super' Subbarayan as the stunt master and Kalyan and Ajay Raj as choreographers. Vasuki Bhaskar was appointed as the costume designer. However, during the making of the film 'Super' Subbarayan was replaced by his son Dilip Subbarayan.
Music.
Yuvan Shankar Raja was signed as the music director, who was working on a gangster film again after the likes of "Pattiyal" and "Pudhupettai". Kumararaja divulged that he actually hadn't anyone in mind, but joined with Yuvan Shankar, following producer Charan's recommendation, who shared a "good working relationship" with the composer. Initially a soundtrack was also planned to be composed, with Gangai Amaran being roped in to pen lyrics, however Charan disclosed later that the film would feature no songs at all, becoming Yuvan Shankar Raja's second film project after "Adhu" without a soundtrack. Charan told that background music of this film will be released in CD's.
Release.
The film was first screened on 30 October 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival in New York. The film was incomplete at that time, with post-production works pending and a low quality version without colour correction and without a film score was projected at the festival. Despite the drawbacks, the film gained positive feedbacks and went on to win the Grand Jury prize for Best Film.
After completion, the film was screened to the regional censor board in Chennai, who refused to clear it. The committee had demanded 52 cuts and several consequential sub-cuts, particularly due to profanity and excessive violence, before permitting a theatrical release. Kumararaja, who admitted that he had expected difficulties in the censorship, disapproved of the board's demands as he wanted to present the film uncompromisingly to the audiences. He claimed that the usage of "bad language" was "part of developing the characters" in his story, while he also disagreed with bleeping out the "objectionable" words since he felt "it throws audiences off the film's narrative". Producer Charan voiced the same opinion, citing that he had made the film for a "mature audience", took the film to the Central Tribunal at Delhi.
Critical response.
"Aaranya Kaandam" opened to strong critical acclaim. "The India Daily" lauded the director and the producer for making a "strikingly different film that is raw, realistic and is just like watching angry men up close", further adding that "picturising crude realities of life so real needs amazing guts". The leading actors, particularly Jackie Shroff and Sampath, were appreciated for their performances, being labelled as "perfect", while film score and cinematography were praised as well, citing that "Yuvan Shankar Raja deserves all accolades for a fantastic re-recording" and that "Vinod's lens captures the darker sides of city life well". "Rediff"s Pavithra Srinivasan gave the film 3 out of 5, claiming that film "bypasses gangster cliches". The reviewer also spoke in high terms of the cast and crew, pointing out Guru Soma Sundaram's performance whose "gleeful cackles at the rooster fight, pathetic rumblings to his son and wide-eyed act in the Lodge are wonderful to behold" and Yuvan Shankar Raja's score, described as "easily of the movie's biggest strengths". "Behindwoods" claimed the film to be an "intelligently made gangster flick", giving it 3.5 out of 5. Director Kumararaja was praised for that having structured "every frame and character in his film with brilliant dexterity", adding that the manner of narration and screen play was "commendable", while also acknowledging aspects such as dialogues, music and cinematography. "Sify"s reviewer appreciated Kumararaja for "taking the road less travelled", however criticized the large amount of violence in the film, terming it the "most violent and bloody film ever to get through Chennai regional censors". In regard to the performances of the cast, he cited that the best performance came from Sampath, who "just smirks throughout the film", while claiming that Yasmin was "fantastic in her debut role".
"NDTV"s critic described the film as a "gangster movie which stands out with its realistic portrayal and no-nonsense treatment", further adding that "good performances, effective dialogues, slick editing and amazing camerawork help the movie stand out from the crowd". A reviewer from "Chennaionline" wrote that the film was made "near-perfect" featuring "some stunning performances, sharp dialogues and excellent camera work and music". Jackie Shroff and P. S. Vinod, in particular, won high praise from the critic, who wrote that the former "proves his class" and "shines in the don’s role", while they had done a "terrific job and should be considered a major factor for the film’s success at the box-office". N. Venkateswaran from "Times of India" rated the film 4.5 out of 5 (the highest rating for any Tamil film ever), while "The Hindustan Times" critic Gautaman Bhaskaran gave 3.5 out of 5. Rohit Ramachandran of "nowrunning.com", too, rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stating that "Aaranya Kaandam is a neo-noir film that runs at breakneck speed only to be slowed down and stopped at an unwelcome destination. But why think of the destination when the journey is one that you've thoroughly enjoyed?" Baradwaj Rangan commended the film, citing that "with most mainstream films, especially in Tamil, you know some fifteen minutes in if they’re working for you (or not) [...] But there are a few that leave you hanging until almost the end [...] and then, gradually, things begin to cohere and reshape your entire thus-far experience, and you slap your forehead and smile and say "wow"! This is one of those films.
Box office.
Despite strong critical acclaim, the film performed very poorly at the box office.
Accolades.
"Aaranya Kaandam" appeared on many top ten or top five lists of the best films of 2011.
Litigation.
Producer, S.P.B. Charan wanted to dub this movie in other regional languages like Telugu and Kannanda. Aggrieved by this, Thiagarajan filed a suit in the Madras High Court on grounds of copyright violation saying that he is the author of the script and has copyright over it and therefore dubbing the movie in other languages would violate his copyright for it. With respect to the same, he prayed for an injunction directing the producer not to dub and release the movie. The respondent argued that the copyright rests with him and that his authorship of the movie entitles him to dub the movie. The court both in the Original Suit as well as in the Appeal passed orders in favour of the respondent/producer.

Chelev

Chelev (, "kheylev" or "ẖelev") is the term given to some kinds of animal fats in Judaism.
There is a prohibition in the Torah for Jews to eat "chelev", a form of animal fat (). Only the "chelev" of animals that are of the sort from which offerings can be brought in the Tabernacle or Temple are prohibited (). The prohibition of eating "chelev" is also, in addition to the Torah, one of the 613 commandments that, according to the Talmud, were given to Moses on Sinai. 
Hebrew language.
In Hebrew the word for fat is ( "kheylev" or "ẖelev", often transliterated "khelev" or "chelev") in the Hebrew Bible this is first used for the "fats" of Abel's offering, and most often used for fats of animal sacrifices on the altar of the Tabernacle or Temple. The same word is also used in the phrase "the fat of the land."
Rabbinical interpretation.
The punishment for eating "chelev" bemeizid (on purpose) is kareth. The atonement for eating it by mistake is to bring a korban hattath (atonement sacrifice).
The prohibition on "chelev" is only regarding those animal types which were used as a "korban": cattle, lamb and goat, which are the only kosher domestic livestock. Fats from avians and deer may be eaten, and different types of bovinae are in state of doubt.
In order that fat should be considered "chelev" it must look like a sheet of fats, like a thick fibrous skin that can be removed (see picture). Some tendons and muscles are also removed due to the rabbinic law, since they are neighboring and resolving some "chelev".
The "chelev" must be removed by a qualified "menaker" in a process called nikkur (purging).
Kidney fats.
The fats surrounding the kidneys are called "chelev hakloyoth", and are considered non-kosher.
Abdominal fats.
The sheet of fat which is covering the interior of the abdominopelvic cavity is real "chelev", except at some regions where it is covered with steak, not with skin or tendon. However even where it is covered with meat, there is some fat which is still forbidden, since could occasionally get uncovered while the animals walks. Therefore one must be well trained in order to identify kosher fat.
Digestive system fats.
There are many fats around the digestive organs such as the stomach and intestines, and one must be highly educated and trained in order to identify them.
Tail fat.
The tail fat of the fat-tailed sheep, called "alyah" in Hebrew, is a large fatty membrane located on the hindquarters of certain breeds of sheep. The written Torah uses the term "cheilev" of this fat, but only in the sense of "the good part"; its consumption is permitted. 
Karaite Jews maintain that the alyah, too, is prohibited.

Kareth

The Hebrew term kareth ("cutting off") is derived from the Hebrew verb "karat" ("to cut off"). The noun form does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. The plural, Kerithoth ("Excisions"), is the seventh tractate of the fifth order Kodashim of the Mishnah. In the Talmud "kareth" means not necessarily physical "cutting off" of life but extinction of the soul and denial of a share in the world to come.
Hebrew Bible.
In the Hebrew Bible to "cut off" ( "karath"), is a form of punishment which may mean killing or excluding from the people.
Rabbinical literature.
It is the punishment for serious crimes, some of which are also punishable by death by a human court. "Kareth" can mean dying young (before the age of 60), dying without children, or the soul being spiritually "cut off" from your people after death. According to Nachmanides both definitions are accurate, and are applicable according to the nature of the person that committed the offense. If he was generally a good person, meaning that the good in him outweighed the evil, he is punished with dying before his time, unless he had other virtues that are cause for him to merit living out his full life, but retains his portion in the world to come. However if the evil in him outweighed the good, he is then granted a good and lengthy life to reward him for the good that he did in his life, but upon death he will have no portion in the world to come. The medieval scholar Rabbi Yonah Gerondi in his famous ethical work "The Gates of Repentance" says that the Torah itself makes a distinction as to which form of "kareth" is to be applied for a particular offense. In most cases the Torah uses the term such as that in Leviticus 18:29; the persons who commit them shall be cut off from among their people, which he says is a reference to a punishment in this world. However when the Torah uses a term such as that in Numbers 15:31; that person will be cut off completely, his offense will remain with him, that penalty refers to being spiritually cut off after death.
There are two opinions as to what the nature of being spiritually cut off means in reference to the soul after death. Maimonides is of the opinion that this means that upon his death the "soul that left his body is completely destroyed and he dies the death of animal". Nachmanides maintains that the soul is not destroyed, but that the soul being cut off after death is a reference to the spiritual world where after death the soul exists in an exalted spiritual state, and that the penalty of Kareth is that he is not eligible to enter into that world. However the soul lives on and is eligible for the Resurrection of the dead. 
Kareth is applicable only when the transgression was done on purpose, and without later proper repentance, and is applicable only to Jews. When done unintentionally, such a transgression generally requires that a sin-offering be brought.
Offenses punishable by "kareth".
According to the Mishnah in Kerithoth (1:1) there are a total of 36 offenses punishable by kareth. These are the 36 offenses as enumerated in that Mishanh. Where the offense is sexual intercourse "kareth" applies to both parties:

BETASOM

BETASOM (an Italian language acronym of Bordeaux Sommergibile) was a submarine base established at Bordeaux by the Italian "Regia Marina Italiana" during World War II. From this base, Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from 1940 to 1943 as part of the Axis anti-shipping campaign against the Allies.
Establishment.
Axis naval co-operation started after the signing of the Pact of Steel in June 1939 with meetings in Friedrichshafen, Germany, and an agreement to exchange technical information. After the Italian entry into the war and the Fall of France, the Italian Navy established a submarine base at Bordeaux, which was within the German occupation zone. The Italians were allocated a sector of the Atlantic south of Lisbon to patrol. The base was opened in August 1940, and in 1941 the captured French passenger ship was used a depot ship before being returned to the Vichy French Government in June 1942. Admiral Angelo Parona commanded the submarines at BETASOM under the control of "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) Karl Dönitz. Dönitz was the "Commander of the Submarines" ("Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote") for the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine"). About 1,600 men were based at BETASOM.
The base could house up to thirty submarines and it had dry docks and two basins connected by locks. Shore barracks accommodated a security guard of 250 men of the San Marco Regiment.
A second base was established at La Pallice in La Rochelle, France. This second base allowed submerged training which was not possible at Bordeaux.
Operational detail.
From June 1940, three Italian submarines patrolled off the Canary Islands and Madeira, followed by three more off the Azores. When these patrols were completed, the six boats returned to their new base at Bordeaux. Their initial patrol area was the Northwestern Approaches and at the start they out-numbered their German allies' submarines. Dönitz was pragmatic about the Italians, seeing them as inexperienced, but useful for reconnaissance and likely to gain expertise.
Dönitz was disappointed. The Italian submarines sighted convoys but lost contact and failed to make effective reports. Even when assigned to weather reporting - critical for the war effort on both sides - they failed to do this competently. Fearing that German operations would be prejudiced, Dönitz reassigned the Italians to the southern area where they could act independently. In this way, about thirty Italian boats achieved some success, without much impact on the critical areas of the campaign.
German assessments were scathing. Dönitz described the Italians as "inadequately disciplined" and "unable to remain calm in the face of the enemy". When the British tanker "British Fame" was attacked by the "Malaspina", "the officer of the watch and lookouts were on the bridge and the captain was dozing in a deckchair below". It took five torpedoes to sink the tanker and, at one point, the tanker's gunfire forced the "Malaspina" to submerge to safety. The Italians towed the lifeboats to safety, an act worthy of praise, but one against Dönitz's orders and leaving the submarine open to attack for 24 hours.
While the BETASOM submarines did have some value, it is clear why they did not meet the expectations of Dönitz. By 30 November 1940, Italian submarines in the Atlantic each sank an average of 200 gross tons per day. By comparison, German U-boats each averaged 1,115 gross tons per day during the same time period. But the Italian submarines sank 109 allied merchship for 593,864 tons.
Seven BETASOM submarines were adapted to carry critical matériel from the Far East ("Bagnolini", "Barbarigo", "Cappellini", "Finzi", "Giuliani", "Tazzoli", and "Torelli") of which two were sunk by the Allies, two were captured in the Far East by the Germans after the September 1943 Italian Surrender and used by them and a fifth was captured in Bordeaux by the Germans, but not used.
Italian naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini has put forward the view that, although Italian submarines didn't perform as well as the U-boats, they did achieve a good success considering the inferior quality of their boats (among which the lack of modern torpedo fire-control systems and their slower speed both surfaced and submerged). Taking into consideration the period in which the BETASOM submarines operated and the numbers of submarines employed, comparing the respective tonnages sunk by U-boote and the Italian submarines, it can be seen that the respective "exchange rates" (gross tonnage sunk divided by the submarines lost) were 40.591 t and 34.512 t, meaning that the Italian submariners were not as bad as surmised. However, he also acknowledges that this fact does not change the fact that Italy's participation in the "Battle of the Atlantic" was not a success and that its strategical significance was small.
German U-boat activities.
Admiral Dönitz decided during the summer of 1941 to build protective U-boat pens in Bordeaux. Construction began in September 1941. Constructed of reinforced concrete, wide, deep, and high, with a roof above the pens thick, and thick above the rear servicing area.
On 15 October 1942, the 12th U-boat Flotilla was formed at Bordeaux by the German "Kriegsmarine" under the command of "Korvettenkapitän" Klaus Scholtz. The first U-boat to use the bunker was on 17 January 1943.
End of operations.
The base was bombed by the British on several occasions. The base was indirectly attacked by Operation Josephine B in June 1941, a raid to destroy the electricity substation that served the base.
After the Italian Armistice in September 1943 the base was seized by the Germans. Some of the Italian personnel joined the Germans independently of the Italian Social Republic. During this period the Italian postage stamps on hand were overprinted to show loyalty to Mussolini's rump state.
The last two remaining U-boats left Bordeaux in August 1944, three days before the Allies occupied the base on 25 August. The last remaining German naval personnel attempted to march back to Germany but were captured by U.S. forces on 11 September 1944.
List of submarines operating from BETASOM.
In 1940, all twenty-eight Italian submarines which were to be based at BETASOM initially had to sail from bases on the Mediterranean Sea and transit the Straits of Gibraltar to reach the Atlantic Ocean. All twenty-eight did this successfully without incident.
In 1941, another four Italian submarines based in Italian East Africa ("Africa Orientale Italiana", or AOI) reached the base after the fall of that colony during the East African Campaign. All four had to travel around the Cape of Good Hope to get to BETASOM.
Date of arrival at Bordeaux from the Mediterranean in 1940:
Transferred from the Red Sea Flotilla during the summer of 1941:
In 1941, it was decided to return some of the boats to the Mediterranean. The "Perla", the "Guglielmotti", the "Brin", the "Argo", the "Velella", the "Dandolo", the "Emo", the "Otaria", the "Mocenigo", and the "Veniero Glauco" made the passage but the "Glauco" was sunk by the British Royal Navy. The "Cagni" was transferred in 1942.
Post-World War II.
The submarine pens have proved to be impossible to demolish due to the massive reinforced construction designed to withstand aerial bombardment. In 2010, after conversion several years previously, approximately of the building are open to the public as a cultural centre for the performing arts, exhibitions and evening events.

Tugdamme

Tugdamme (also Dugdammi and, in classical Greece, Lygdamis) was Cimmerian king of the mid-seventh century BC.
Tugdamme's legacy began sometime around 660 BCE. It seems that his first known attacks were against the Greek coastal cities in Asia Minor. In 653 BCE he began to push at the mighty Assyrian Empire during the reign of Ashurbanipal. The Assyrian inscriptions speak of Tugdamme as being the "King of the Saka and Qutium" but the Assyrian inscriptions also call him by the title "Sar Kissati" which means "King of Kish" or "King of the world" which suggests that Tugdamme ruled a vast area of land. Tugdamme would eventually be defeated around 641-640 BCE, but it remains unknown as to who defeated and killed him. The historian Strabo suggest that Madys killed Tugdamme and defeated his forces. Ashurbanipal says Marduk defeated Tugdamme, which may suggest that an outside element had defeated Tugdamme and not the Assyrians; this outside element may have been Madys.
According to Fritz Hommel, Tugdamme must have been an ancestor of Sandakhshatra (whom he identified with Cyaxares) and his son Ishtivegu (Astyages), implying identification of Tugdamme with Phraortes.

Blacklight poster

A blacklight poster is a poster printed with inks which fluoresce under black light. The inks used contain phosphors which cause them to glow when exposed to the ultraviolet light emitted from black lights.
In the United States, blacklight posters emerged as part of the psychedelic fashion scene between 1967 and 1969. Since then, the art form has gone out of fashion and is generally viewed as a relic of the 1970s.

Seiddab Trilogy

The Seiddab Trilogy is a series of video games designed by Steve Turner (as Graftgold) for the ZX Spectrum and published by Hewson Consultants. It consists of 3D Space-Wars (1983), 3D Seiddab Attack (1984) and 3D Lunattack. All three games were later published together as "The Seiddab Trilogy" by Hewson for the Rotronics Wafadrive. The series name is derived from the word "baddies" being spelt in reverse.
Astroclone (1985), also programmed by Turner and featuring the Seiddab, is part of this series.
3D Space-Wars.
"3D Space-Wars" was released in by Hewson Consultants.
3D Seiddab Attack.
"3D Seiddab Attack" was released in by Hewson Consultants.
Critical reception.
Your Spectrum's review highlighted the realistic 3D effect and split-screen display, but criticized the monochrome graphics and slow game speed. Sinclair User awarded 5 out of 10, criticizing the unclear, flickering display but praising a sophisticated concept and satisfying explosions. Personal Computer Games were unimpressed with the 3D effect and felt that the enemy ships were indistinct and the action unexciting.
3D Lunatack.
"3D Lunattack" was released in by Hewson Consultants, and is the only game of the series that was also published for the Commodore 64. The player takes control of a Z5 Luna Hover Fighter in an attack against the Seiddab command base. The Z5 must be piloted through three rings of defence before destroying the base.
Gameplay.
The game requires the player to attack the Seiddab base, which is protected by three rings of defense. The first consists of robotically controlled tanks which fire missiles; these tanks can be destroyed by laser fire. The second ring is an area of mountains protected by mines, which are set to explode when the player gets too close. They may be shot using the Z5's lasers, or dodged. An exploding mine rocks the players craft altering its course. The third ring of defence is studded with missile silos, which may be attacked with the Z5's lasers. If the player manages to penetrate the command zone, the base must be repeatedly strafed while avoiding its defensive firepower.
At any time the player may be attacked by Seiddab fighters. The Z5 is armed with air-to-air missiles that can be used to destroy the enemy fighters before they come into range. Once they are visible, the lasers must be used. Weapon selection is automatic- if the target is below the horizon lasers will be used, if the target is above then missiles will be fired.
The screen displays a cockpit with a horizon of mountains, and enemy craft displayed, and crosshair sights of the Z5's weaponry. There is also a radar display which switches on automatically when an enemy hover fighter is detected, and places a small box near the enemy location indicating the range to the fighter. At this stage missiles may be fired and forgotten.
Below the main display are indicators for fuel, armament type in use and hull temperature, which increases to a critical point with each enemy strike.
An additional audio track was included on the cassette tape. "3D Lunattack" also supported Currah Microspeech.
Critical reception.
Reviews were mixed. While "Sinclair User" only gave the game 6/10, "CRASH" awarded it a CRASH Smash at 90%.
"Sinclair User" said of the game ""The controls are difficult to handle and of the type where you lose position rapidly through having to over-correct continually."", while "CRASH" decided that ""The display is wonderful, the best three dimensional Battlezone-type game yet... Really excellent, most playable and addictive too.""
Astroclone.
"Astroclone" was published in by Hewson Consultants. Its working title was "Seiclone", but was changed to avoid confusion with Vortex Software's similar-sounding "Cyclone". The game combines shoot 'em up sections with arcade adventure elements that Turner had developed with "Avalon" (1984) and "Dragontorc" (1985).

Greeks in Syria

The Greek presence in Syria began in the 7th century BC and became more prominent during the Hellenistic period and when the Seleucid Empire was centered there. Today there is a Greek community of about 4,500 in Syria, most of whom have Syrian nationality and who live mainly in Aleppo, the country's main trading and financial center, and Damascus, the capital.
History.
Greek presence is attested from early on and in fact the name of Syria itself is of Greek provenance from the Greek word for the Assyrians. However it was during the Hellenist times that it was most prominent. In particular, the Seleucid Empire, which was centered in modern day Syria and Lebanon and reached as far as Pakistan at the height of its power, was a major centre of Hellenistic culture which maintained the preeminence of Greek customs and where a Greek elite dominated, mostly in the urban areas. Following the decline of the Seleucid Empire, Greek culture began to wane, particularly following the Muslim conquest.
Present situation.
Damascus has been home to an organized Greek community since 1913, although there are also significant numbers of Greek Muslims originally from Ottoman Crete who have been living in several coastal towns and villages of Syria and Lebanon since the late Ottoman era. They were resettled there by Sultan Hamid II following the 1897-8 Greek-Turkish war, in which the Ottoman empire lost the island of Crete to the Kingdom of Greece. The most notable but still understudied Cretan Muslim village in Syria is al-Hamidiyah, many of whose inhabitants continue to speak Greek as their first language. There of course is also a significant Greco-Syrian population in Aleppo, as well as smaller communities in Latakia, Tartus and Homs. As with most other ethnic minorities in Syria, most Greco-Syrian Orthodox Christians speak Arabic only, along with a school-taught foreign language such as French or English; however, a working or rudimentary knowledge of Greek for liturgical purposes as well as among older, particularly first and second-generation, individuals, is relatively widespread. Damascus has a private Greek-language school as well for the community that is maintained by guest instructors from Greece.
Greek Muslims in Syria.
In addition to the Greek Orthodox Christian population there are also about 8,000 Greek-speaking Muslims of Cretan origin in Al-Hamidiyah, Syria and 7,000 people of Greek Muslim descent in Tripoli, Lebanon. Greek Muslims constitute a majority of Al-Hamidiyah's population.

Address Unknown (1944 film)

Address Unknown is a 1944 American drama film directed by William Cameron Menzies based on Kathrine Taylor's novel "Address Unknown" (1938). The film tells the story of two families caught up in the rise of Nazism in Germany prior to the start of World War II.
Shot in a film noir style, the film contains many elements of suspense and irony reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. Cinematographer (Rudolph Maté) employed shadows, shapes and camera angles to create the imagery. One notable scene shows Martin Schulz (Paul Lukas) descending a staircase awaiting his arrest by the Gestapo, while behind him the shadow of a web-like criss-cross of window panes shows him being caught in his own web of deceit.
Plot.
Two close friends, Martin Schulz and Max Eisenstein (Morris Carnovsky), are German expatriate art dealers living in the United States. Martin's son Heinrich (Peter van Eyck) and Max's daughter Griselle (K.T. Stevens) are in love. However, she turns down his proposal of marriage for the time being, as she aspires to become an actress. When Martin and his wife return to Germany for business purposes, Griselle accompanies them to seek acting opportunities there. Max and Heinrich remain in San Francisco to run the art gallery, while Martin sends them paintings to sell. Martin sends a strange painting from an unknown artist to Max as a joke, the "unknown" artist being Pablo Picasso. A determined patron (Mary Young) insists on buying the painting, over Max's well-intended protests.
Martin meets the influential Baron von Friesche (Carl Esmond), a dedicated Nazi, and joins the Nazi party, becoming an important official in the new regime. But Max is Jewish. Martin eventually insists they stop writing to each other, as his new associates would not approve of it. Suspecting that Martin is hiding his true feelings from Nazi censors who examine the mail, Max has an American friend personally deliver a letter to Martin. However, Martin coldly makes it clear that Max is mistaken: his antisemitism is now genuine.
After acting in Vienna for a time, Griselle lands the leading role in a play in Berlin, under the stage name "Griselle Stone". Her lines include the Beatitudes, such as "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God", but during the final rehearsal a censor (Charles Halton) declares that the lines are contrary to Nazi doctrine and must be removed. At the premiere, Griselle ignores the order, inciting the irate censor to demand the play be stopped. Griselle admits that she acted on her own. When the censor demands to know her real name, her obviously Jewish surname rouses the hostile crowd to riot. The play's director hurries a still-defiant Griselle out of the theater for her own safety.
Finally realizing her danger, she flees into the country. She makes her way to Martin's estate, barely ahead of her Nazi pursuers. However, Martin shuts the door in her face, and at once several gunshots ring out. Martin's wife Elsa (Mady Christians) witnesses the exchange and is appalled by her husband's heartlessness. Max and Heinrich learn of Griselle's death in a short, cold letter in which Martin states only that Max's daughter is dead.
At the christening of Martin's newborn son Adolf, he receives a telegram saying that Max will write to him and Martin will understand his messages. Baron von Friesche asks if the telegram is important; Martin lies out of fear. Martin now begins to receive odd typewritten letters from Max, written in what appears to be code. He has no idea what the letters mean. But the censors have seen them, and later, von Friesche warns him that receiving coded messages is illegal. As the letters continue to arrive, Martin is forced to resign his position.
Martin's wife leaves him, taking their children to Switzerland. He writes a secret letter begging Max to stop writing to him, and begs her to mail it in Switzerland. But the border guards see the letter, and Elsa destroys it rather than let it be read. This only serves to heighten suspicions. Von Friesche tells Martin what happened at the border and says he knows about the telegram. He now demands that Martin name his associates; when Martin continues to protest his innocence, von Friesche tells him that the Gestapo will take him in for questioning. Martin considers killing himself, but does not. That night, a terrified Martin ventures out of his deserted mansion and is suddenly illuminated by a flashlight.
Back in San Francisco, Max receives a returned letter, addressed to Martin but stamped "Address Unknown". Max tells Heinrich that he does not understand, as he had stopped writing to Martin. From Heinrich's reaction, it becomes clear that he was the one who had been sending the letters.
Awards.
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards; Best Score and Best Art Direction (Lionel Banks, Walter Holscher, Joseph Kish).

Régiments de marche de volontaires étrangers

Régiments de marche de volontaires étrangers, also known as RMVE or Regiments of Foreign Volunteers were temporary formations of the French Foreign Legion organized from Foreign volunteers during the Second World War. These regiments were formed on 16 September 1939:
On September 16 1939, the war minister decided to form special corps of foreign volunteers independent of the Foreign Legion, presumably to avoid the sort of conflict that had occurred in 1914. To make certain that these unit of foreign volunteers would be in no way confused with the "real" Legion, which wanted to distance itself from them, they were assigned numbers superior to 20 from February 1940 and so became the 21E, 22E and 23E régiment de marche des volontaires étrangers (RMVE). 
These regiments, despite the best effort of the French War Ministry and the Legion itself were assigned Legion cadres, crests carried the Legion Colors and celebrated Christmas and Camerone day. These regiments had large numbers of refugee Spanish Republicans, Jews and other refugees from Nazi Germany, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia. These men were considered volunteers for the duration and many who escaped the fall of France were allowed to join their respective national armies before the Liberation.
They achieved a mixed success, but like many units during the Fall of France were overwhelmed by the German blitzkrieg. Their regimental honors live on in the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment.

Asilomar State Marine Reserve

Asilomar State Marine Reserve (SMR) is one of four small marine protected areas (MPAs) located near the cities of Monterey and Pacific Grove, at the southern end of Monterey Bay on California’s central coast. The four MPAs together encompass . The SMR protects all marine life within its boundaries. Fishing and take of all living marine resources is prohibited.
History.
The Asilomar State Marine Reserve was established in September 2007 by the California Department of Fish and Game. It was one of 29 marine protected areas adopted during the first phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, which created a statewide network of marine protected areas along the California coastline. 
The reserve helps protect some of the central coast’s most heavily used and accessible areas near the shore while leaving most of the coastal waters open for continued fishing.
Geography and natural features.
Asilomar SMR is located off the coast of the Monterey Peninsula, at the southern end of Monterey Bay. It covers an area of . The reserve is directly offshore from Asilomar State Beach. 
Asilomar SMR is the westernmost of four marine protected areas bordering the Monterey Peninsula. It is adjacent to the Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area. Further east are the Lovers Point State Marine Reserve and the Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area. All four areas are included within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
This marine protected area is bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed: ,

Habitat and wildlife.
The Monterey Peninsula includes extensive tidepools brimming with life. Its sandy beaches are used by pupping harbor seals, and dense kelp beds offshore provide shelter for sea otters. The Asilomar SMR provides habitat for a variety of marine life, and includes kelp forest, beach, rocky intertidal, and soft and hard bottom.
Recreation and nearby attractions.
The natural beauty and ocean resources of the Monterey Peninsula draw millions of visitors from around the world each year, including more than 60,000 scuba divers drawn by the area’s easy access, variety of wildlife, and massive kelp forests
The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a major tourist attraction featuring a living kelp forest. The exhibit includes many of the species native to the nearby marine protected areas. The aquarium also houses sea otters, intertidal wildlife, and occasionally sea turtles.
In addition to diving and visiting the aquarium, people enjoy the Monterey Bay by kayaking, whale watching, charter fishing, surfing, bird watching, tidepooling and walking on the beach. Asilomar State Beach, adjacent to the reserve, offers a .75 mile walking trail.
California’s marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. Activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkeling, and swimming are allowed unless otherwise restricted.
Scientific monitoring.
As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s central coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number. 
Local scientific and educational institutions involved in the monitoring include the Hopkins Marine Station (located at the Lovers Point SMR), the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Research methods include hook-and-line sampling, scuba diver surveys, and the use of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) submarines.

The Marion E. Wade Center at Wheaton College (Illinois) is a special research collection of papers, books, and manuscripts, primarily relating to seven authors from the United Kingdom: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, G. K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, and George MacDonald, as well as C. S. Lewis's wife, the poet Joy Davidman. The center is named after Marion E. Wade, founder of ServiceMaster Corp.
The Wade Center serves primarily as a research center, attracting scholars from around the world. It holds at least one copy of every book written by the Wade authors, plus books, articles, and other materials about the various writers. It holds the world's fullest collection of the writings of Dorothy L. Sayers, including 30,000 pages of letters and documents both published and unpublished. For some of the Wade authors, collections of family documents are also available.
History and organization.
The center was founded in 1965 by Clyde S. Kilby. In 2001 a new building was completed at the edge of the Wheaton College campus to house the Wade Center, with an expanded reading room, classroom space, and an enlarged exhibits area. C. S. Lewis's dining-room table, which used to serve as desk space for visiting researchers, has been moved into the exhibits area near the Wade's own Lewis wardrobe.
The small staff was headed by director Christopher W. Mitchell (author of "Through the Wardrobe and into the Mind of C. S. Lewis", 2009), until his departure to teach at Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University. It was also headed by Associate Director Marjorie Lamp Mead (author of "A Reader's Guide Through the Wardrobe: Exploring C. S. Lewis's Classic Story", and of "A Reader's Guide To Caspian: a journey into C. S. Lewis's Narnia").
The Center hosts special events related to its authors: meetings of scholarly societies, book discussions and classes, film-release celebrations, etc.
Publications.
The Wade Center also publishes the journal "VII: An Anglo-American Literary Review", highlighting works by and about the Wade authors.

Regular season.
In 1996, the Sun Devils went a surprising 11-1, highlighted by a 19–0 shutout of the number-one-ranked, two-time defending national champion, Nebraska Cornhuskers in Tempe, ending Nebraska's 26-game win streak. The upset win also gained a measure of revenge from the previous season, when they went into Lincoln and were not only destroyed by a 77-28 margin, but enraged after the eventual national champions threw a long touchdown pass in the game's final minutes. ASU quarterback Jake Plummer led the Sun Devils, propelling Arizona State into the Rose Bowl against the Ohio State Buckeyes. Had the Sun Devils won, they would have had a very good chance of winning at least a share of the national championship, as they would have been the only undefeated and untied major-college team in the nation. The Sun Devils held a slim 17–14 lead with 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, but surrendered a late touchdown to Ohio State, falling by a final score of 20-17. As it turned out, Florida State lost in the Sugar Bowl to the Florida Gators; had the Sun Devils won a few days earlier, ASU would have had a perfect 12-0 record while the Gators would have finished with one regular season loss (ironically, to the Seminoles).

Five (Circus Devils album)

FIVE is the curiously titled fourth studio album by the experimental/psychedelic rock band Circus Devils. Released in 2005, FIVE is considered among the band's least accessible albums due to the fragmented moods and styles and the experimental nature of the music. All songs on FIVE were written and performed by Robert Pollard and Todd Tobias.
Reaction.
"Multi-instrumentalist (Todd) Tobias keeps things primal-n-futuristic while (Robert) Pollard's lyrics allude to the horrors of the human race in a way both cryptic and imaginative. Much like "Gang of Four"'s attempt to wise us to the consumer world, "Circus Devils" forewarn of a world consuming us." 
- Detroit Free Press
"The previous (Circus Devils) albums were experimental, yet they somehow always kept at least one toe on the terra-firma of accessibility on which (Robert) Pollard has made a career. As such, these albums were wondrous romps through the slightly musically-disparate musical imaginations of its members. "FIVE" has Pollard and Todd Tobias amputating said toe, and the majority of the record is an over-indulgence of their prog-rock influences. They opt for experiment over melody and noise over rhythm." 
-- "Bryan Roswell" / Coke Machine Glow
"Five often doesn't feature a single guitar, instead relying on
Todd Tobias's trademark aural textures to create moods often bordering on ambient, a new and exciting background for (Robert) Pollard to ply his trade. The new contrast is captivating from the start. FIVE is an album of wonderful aural scope and intelligence, filled with emotion. Whenever Pollard attempts a style of music with which he's unfamiliar, the results are always at worst interesting; here they're nothing short of spectacular."

Game notes.
Cincinnati.
Kicking off the start of the 1990 Iowa Hawkeye season, the Hawks welcomed in the Cincinnati Bearcats. The Bearcats finished out the '89 season at 1–9–1 as the Hawks finished out at 5–6. In a game that ended up in a blowout, the Hawks cruised to a 63–10 win. Iowa managed to set records as well as they pummeled the Cincinnati defense. After Cincinnati built a 7–0 lead after an interception and a 1-yard touchdown run from Joe Abrams, the Hawks took command for the afternoon. After a scoreless first quarter, quarterback Matt Rodgers led the Hawks to 28 unanswered points, following two touchdowns from Rodgers, and one each from running backs Nick Bell and Tony Stewart. Cincinnati scored its last points of the game with a late field goal and ended the half with Iowa up 28–10. After halftime, Iowa went on cruise control. Iowa went on to score 21 points in the 3rd and 14 in the 4th to win the contest 63–10. Rodgers ended the game going 15–27 on passes with 191 yards. Hawkeye offense racked up 662 yards with 455 yards rushing. The defense was excellent as well. The Bearcats were allowed only 4 first downs and 69 yards rushing. 
The other two games in the non-conference schedule were both high-scoring affairs, which included their eighth in a series of fifteen straight wins over in-state rival Iowa State, and a loss to the mighty Miami Hurricanes. Even in showing some competitiveness at the game in Miami, FL, few Hawk fans could have guessed what was going to follow, esp. following the 5–6 debacle of the previous season, which represented the first season Iowa had not gone to a bowl since 1980.
But starting the next week, Iowa started what ended up being their third Rose Bowl run in ten seasons. What set this conference season apart from others was that the Hawkeyes played most of their best football on the road. In weeks 1, 3 & 5, Iowa upset what ended up being the other three teams that tied for the Big 10 championship that season, all at their home venue. 
First was a wind-blown, defensive struggle at East Lansing, with Iowa holding onto a 12–7 victory. Hayden Fry admitted after the game that every pass he had Matt Rodgers throw was with the wind, which was blowing at a diagonal across Spartan stadium.
After a win over (what ended up being cellar-dweller) Wisconsin at home, Iowa traveled to the Big House in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines were still smarting after a tight, tough loss the previous week against Michigan State and it was Homecoming week. But Iowa kept it close throughout. Following a botched two-point conversion by the Wolverines after they had taken a 20–10 lead, the Hawkeyes went to work. Following one Hawkeye touchdown countered by a Michigan field goal, the Hawkeyes put together a drive for the ages, never facing a third-down. Tony Stewart grabbed the last of a series of key passes from Matt Rodgers with one hand, giving the Hawkeyes the ball at the Michigan 1-yard-line. Paul Kujawa ran it in from there, and with the extra point, the Hawks took the lead by the eventual final score of 24–23. A sack by Moses Santos and an interception by linebacker John Derby sealed the stunner.
But the Hawks key road triumphs weren't finished. Two weeks later in Champaign, Illinois, against an Illinois team that had the inside track to the Rose Bowl, Iowa put together one of their best offensive games in the Fry era, especially for a key road game. The Hawkeyes used an early fumble by the Illini to begin an exhibition by RB Nick Bell, the likes of which had rarely been seen in the Big 10 between two undefeated teams (in conference play). Bell literally ran over the Illini, scampering for over 100 yards just in the 1st quarter. By the end of the quarter, the Hawks led by an amazing 28–0, and they stretched it to 41–7 by the end of the half, and 48–7 by the end of the 3rd quarter, before settling for a 54–28 final. It was most likely from the efforts of that game that Nick Bell was named by the media as the Big 10 player of the year. 
The Hawkeye bubble burst the next week in Iowa City with a last-second loss to Ohio State. They bounced back the next week with what proved to be a Big-10 clinching win at home against Purdue. Then knowing that they were Rose Bowl-bound before they even took the field, the Hawkeyes dropped their final road game at Minnesota, 31–24. In that game, Tony Stewart became (at least at that time) the Hawkeyes all-time leading rusher, though he lost a key fumble on that play. 
The Rose Bowl placed an over-matched Iowa against one of the best teams in the country that season, the Washington Huskies. The Hawkeyes trailed badly at the half before making the game close by the end, but lost in Pasadena again, 46–34. It was Hayden Fry's last trip to Pasadena, and he ended up 0–3 in those games.

Isaiah Berlin (rabbi)

Isaiah Berlin (c. October 1725 Eisenstadt, Hungary - May 13, 1799 Breslau) was a German Talmudist.
Biography.
Berlin studied under Ẓevi Hirsch Bialeh (Ḥarif), the rabbi of Halberstadt, at the latter's yeshivah. In 1755 Berlin moved to Breslau where he engaged in business. In 1793, when already advanced in years, he was elected to a rabbinical post, being appointed to succeed Isaac Joseph Te'omim as rabbi of Breslau. His election was marked by a dispute between the members of the community and the local maskilim, who had begun to organize themselves as a body and opposed Berlin, who, despite his love of peace, openly attacked their ideas. Berlin was elected by an overwhelming majority.
Berlin was greatly admired, even by persons who differed with him in religious views. According to ḥasidic sources, Berlin was sympathetically disposed toward that movement and extended a friendly welcome to one of its emissaries, Jacob Samson of Spitsevka. Further, Joel Brill, Aaron Wolfsohn, Judah Bensew, and many other Maskilim of Breslau often visited him to seek advice on scientific questions. As the Maskilim always carefully avoided wounding Berlin's religious feelings, he on his part met them half-way in many things. On the occasion of the Peace of Basel, for instance (May 17, 1795), he held a solemn service in the synagogue and exceptionally permitted the use of instrumental music, he himself delivering a discourse which was highly praised by the press ("Schlesische Zeitung", 1795, No. 59). Thus Berlin, conciliated the hostile elements of his congregation, and his death was mourned equally by all.
Literary activity.
Berlin's had the habit of annotating almost every book he read; mentioning the sources, or noting parallel passages and variant readings. Such glosses by Berlin have been published on the following books: the Bible (Pentateuch, Dyhernfurth, 1775; the other books, ib., 1807); the prayer-book, ed. Tiḳḳun Shelomoh (ib., 1806); Maimonides' Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah (ib., 1809); Alfasi (Presburg, 1836); the "Ḥinnuk", attributed to Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona (Vienna, 1827); Malachi b. Jacob's methodology, "Yad Malachi" (Berlin, 1825); Elijah b. Moses de Vidas' book of morals, "Reshit Ḥokmah" (Dyhernfurth, 1811).
Although the terse yet clear notes contained in these volumes reveal the immense learning and critical insight of their author, yet Berlin's lasting place of honor among the pioneers of Talmudic criticism rests on the following works, which treat principally of the Talmud: (1) "'Omer ha-Shikḥah" (Forgotten Sheaf), Königsberg, 1860, containing a large number of Halakot on the Talmud not noted by the codifiers; (2) "Oẓar Balum" (Full Treasure), in the edition of Jacob ibn Ḥabib's "'En Ya'aḳob", published at Wilna in 1899, tracing all the Talmudic passages quoted without sources in the different commentaries on the haggadic elements of the Talmud; (3) "Haggahot ha-Shas" (Notes to the Talmud), textual corrections and notes on the origin of parallel passages (Dyhernfurth, 1800, and in nearly all the editions of the Talmud); (4) "Hafla'ah Sheba-'Arakin" (Detached Orders) (part i., Breslau, 1830; part ii., Vienna, 1859), containing, as the title indicates, explanations and glosses on the 'Aruk; (5) "Ḥiddushe ha-Shas", novellæ on the Talmud (Königsberg, 1860, and in several editions of the Talmud); (6) "Minè Targuma" (Dessert Dishes), Breslau, 1831, remarks on the Targum Onkelos (the word "Targuma" signifying both "Targum" and "dessert", equivalent to the Greek τράγημα) and on the Palestinian Targum; (7) "Kashiyot Meyushab" (Difficulties Answered), Königsberg, 1860, treating of the Talmudic passages which end with, and written by Berlin in fourteen days; (8) "Rishon leẒion" (The First for Zion; Dyhernfurth, 1793; Vienna, 1793, and several times reprinted, the title being a play on, "Zion", and, "index"), a collection of indexes and parallel passages in the Midrash; (9) "She'elat Shalom" (Greeting of Peace), Dyhernfurth, 1786, a commentary on Aḥa of Shubḥa's "She'iltot." Berlin's responsa collection and his commentary on the Tosefta deserve especial mention, though nothing is known of their fate.
Berlin, was the first—at least among the Germans—who showed an interest in the history of post-Talmudic literature; and it was he, who opened the Kalir question (compare his letter to his brother-in-law, Joseph b. Menaḥem Steinhart, in the latter's "Zikron Yosef", No. 15.

Albert Reiss

Albert Reiss (22 February 1870 – 19 June 1940) was a German operatic tenor who had a prolific career in Europe and the United States during the first third of the twentieth century. He spent much of his career performing at the Metropolitan Opera where he sang in more than 1,000 performances, including several premieres, between 1901-1919. Excelling in the tenor buffo repertoire, Reiss was particularly associated with the roles of David in Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" and Mime in Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen", two roles he sang in numerous houses internationally.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Reiss was born in Berlin and began his career as an actor. He appeared in several plays in Berlin and Strasbourg before deciding to pursue an operatic career under the encouragement of Bernhard Pollini and Ernestine Schumann-Heink. He proceeded to study singing with Wilhelm Vilmar and later Julius Lieben and Benno Stolzenberg. He made his professional operatic debut in 1897 as Peter Ivanov in Lortzing's "Zar und Zimmermann" at Königsberg. The following year he joined the opera house at Posen where he sang roles for only one season. In 1899 he began performing at the Wiesbaden Opera House where he performed roles until the fall of 1901 when he left to join the roster at the Metropolitan Opera.
Mid to late career.
Reiss began his association with the Met touring throughout North America during October–December 1901. His first performance with the company was in Toronto on 12 October as Remendado in Bizet's "Carmen". He made his first appearance at the company's house in New York City on December 23, 1901 as both the Shepherd and the Steersman in Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde". This was the beginning of a long association with the Met for Reiss, who appeared with the company every year for the next eighteen years in mostly tenor buffo roles. Most notably he sang in several world premiers with the company including: Nick in Puccini's "La fanciulla del West", the Broom-maker in Humperdinck's "Königskinder", Nial in Horatio Parker's "Mona", the offstage male lover in Puccini's "Il Tabarro", Richard II of England in Reginald de Koven's "The Canterbury Pilgrims" and Ragueneau in Walter Damrosch's "Cyrano". His farewell performance on 14 April 1919 - again as Remendado - was his 1,070th performance with the company.
In addition to performances with the Met, Reiss returned periodically to Europe to appear in operas. From 1902-1907 he sang in several productions at the Bavarian State Opera. He also sang at the Hamburg State Opera (1904) and the Palais Garnier (1910). Reiss made his only other American appearances with the Chicago Grand Opera Company in 1911 and 1912. He appeared at the Royal Opera House in London at various times between 1902–1905 and 1924–1929, where he sang the roles of Valzacchi in "Der Rosenkavalier", Mime in "Der Ring des Nibelungen" and David in "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg". After leaving the Met, he sang at the Volksoper Berlin (1923–25) and Berlin State Opera (1925–1930).
Upon retiring from the stage in 1930, Reiss resettled in Nice, France, where he lived until his death in 1940.

United States Senate election in Texas, 2012

The 2012 United States Senate election in Texas was held on November 6, 2012, along with other elections to the United States Senate the United States House of Representatives in additional states. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison decided to retire instead of running for re-election to a fourth full term.
Libertarian John Jay Myers was elected by nomination at the Texas Libertarian Party State Convention on June 8, 2012. After the first round of primary on May 29, 2012, a runoff was held on July 31, 2012, for both the Democratic and Republican parties, with Paul Sadler and Ted Cruz winning, respectively. Cruz won the open seat.
Background.
In an interview with "Texas Monthly" published in December 2007, incumbent senator Kay Bailey Hutchison stated that she would not seek re-election and might also resign from the Senate as early as 2009 to run for Governor of Texas. After the 2008 elections, Hutchison formed an exploratory committee to run for governor in 2010. State Republican Party Chairman Cathie Adams later called upon Hutchison to clarify when she would vacate the Senate so that other Republican candidates could make preparations to run.
On December 4, 2008, Hutchison set up an exploratory committee, setting up a primary battle with incumbent Republican governor Rick Perry. Fellow Texas senator and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn tried to convince Hutchison to stay in the Senate, for fear of losing the seat to the Democrats. On January 15, 2009, Hutchison transferred nearly all the money, approximately $8 million, from her federal campaign account to her gubernatorial exploratory committee. On November 13, 2009, Hutchison announced that she would not resign from the Senate seat until after the primary on March 2, 2010.
Hutchison lost the gubernatorial primary to Perry and on March 31, 2010, she announced her intention to serve out her third term. On January 13, 2011, after some discussion about whether she would change her mind, Hutchison announced she would not seek re-election in 2012.
Requirements for nomination.
Texas requires a majority for nomination, and a second round runoff between the two candidates with the two highest pluralities if none win a majority on the first round. No candidate won a majority in either 2012 major party first round primary, so both parties had a runoff on July 31, 2012.

Ron Hines

Ron Hines (born 1940) was the first black Ivy League-educated auto racing engineer on America’s road racing circuits. He was an engineer for Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), the first black auto racing team to attain national sponsorship in America, in the 1970s.
Early years.
Ron Hines was raised in New Rochelle, New York. His interest in automobiles began as a teenager. At age 14, he bought a partially finished 1948 Plymouth coupe with a chopped top. Knowing he was too young to own and drive a car, Hines’s father discarded it while Ron was away at boarding school. At 16, Hines bought a four-door 1949 Mercury with a chopped top. Once again, his father was reluctant to let him keep the car. Hines was told he was still too young to drive legally in the state of New York.
Elite education.
At Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts he roomed with John Cox, a car enthusiast from Terre Haute, Indiana. Hines’s love of cars was solidified when Cox showed him a "Rod & Custom" magazine article featuring a 1934 Ford five-window coupe.
In 1963, Hines graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with a degree in mechanical engineering. In his senior year he met Ennis Dawson, a local drag racer who became a lifelong friend. Attending local drag races with Dawson rekindled Hines’s passion for cars. As a result, he bought a 1953 Studebaker coupe and installed a 364-cubic-inch Buick motor and a four-speed transmission. After engaging in a number of dangerous street races, Hines entered his car in sanctioned National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) meets at the Strato Rods Dragway on the McGuire Air Force Base in Wrightstown, New Jersey.
After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Hines was hired by General Motors as a quality control engineer at the manufacturer’s Trenton, New Jersey facility. In 1966 he purchased a 1933 five-window Ford coupe hot rod. He still owns the Ford, which has been transformed several times into a trophy-winning drag racer, a wild street machine, and a classic street rod. The 1933 Ford currently has a detuned 302-cubic-inch Formula 5000 racing engine installed from one of the Lola T332 road racers that Benny Scott drove for Black American Racers, Inc. in 1975.
Black American Racers Association.
In 1972 Hines met Leonard W. Miller, whose vision was to organize the black racing community into a national association. Hines, Miller, Eugene Gadson, and Charlie Singleton founded the Black American Racers Association (BARA). Hines was BARA’s secretary for the five years of its existence, responsible for publishing its monthly newsletter. In 1974, Hines wrote half of the articles contained in the "’74 Black Racers Yearbook". The annual covered pre-World War II black racing history, as well as practical articles for black racers on how to obtain sponsorship. Several Fortune 500 companies placed advertisements in the yearbook.
Road racing engineer.
In 1973, Hines became a crew member of Miller’s road racing team, with Benny Scott as driver of a redesigned Tui Formula Super Vee (FSV). The team was sponsored by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (Viceroy Cigarettes). Hines was an engineer for two other BAR drivers in the 1970s - Randy Bethea and Tommy Thompson in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) - as well as for International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) road racing entries. The Lola chassis Hines tuned and set up for the team were the T-324 and T-620. Hines traveled to road circuits such as Lime Rock Park, Road Atlanta, Watkins Glen International, Mid-Ohio, and Road America. During this period, Hines appeared on a number of television and radio shows on the East Coast with Leonard W. Miller and Benny Scott.
Keys to the city.
In the spring of 1974, mayor Maynard Jackson gave Hines, Miller, and Benny Scott the keys to the city of Atlanta in a ceremony at City Hall, at which he also declared April 20 Black American Racers Day. A photograph of the team appeared in newspapers and periodicals throughout the United States. The same photo was published in Miller's autobiography "Silent Thunder" and in Andrew L. Schupack's book "Formula Vee/Super Vee-Racing, History, and Chassis/Engine Prep".
Trenton Speedway tragedy.
After the 1975 season BAR lost its sponsorship, along with other Viceroy teams, due to internal union pressures at Brown & Williamson Tobacco. BAR was sidelined for two years.
Leonard W. Miller commenced a second effort in FSV racing after African American driver Tommy Thompson persuaded him to continue the BAR vision in 1977. Ron Hines and Ken Wright were key technical elements of the team. Hines helped it advance to an SCCA Northeast Championship at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania.
On September 27, 1978, Tommy Thompson was killed in a crash exiting the fourth turn at the 1.5-mile Trenton Speedway, which is distinguished by its dogleg before turn 3. At this Mini-Indy (the new name for FSV) event, a competitor abruptly stopped in front of Thompson due to a catastrophic mechanical failure. Thompson never regained consciousness and died less than a week later.
Second mission.
After a two-year recovery, Ron Hines served as crew chief of the BAR dirt track team in 1980-81, with Bruce Driver as the driver. The team won ten races at speedways at Flemington Speedway and East Windsor Speedway in New Jersey. Bruce Driver became the first black driver to achieve ten victories in each track's history. BAR continued to aim for professional road racing and the Indianapolis 500, but sponsorship proposals presented to many Fortune 500 companies were declined.
Retirement.
Over the years, Ron Hines served as an instructor at the Granville Academy. He instructed and mentored minority urban youth in improving their mathematical skills for preparation as future technicians or engineers. During this period, he has owned many specialty cars. In addition to his 1933 five-window Ford coupe, he owns a 1975 Chevrolet Monza with a Ron Whitney Chevrolet small-block V-8 engine coupled with a four-speed transmission.
Ron Hines currently organizes the annual specialty car and motorcycle show at St. John's Baptist Church in Ewing Township, New Jersey. The show takes place in July in a park adjoining the church and is open to all years, makes, and models.

Moulder

A wood moulder is a machine used to shape wood with profiled cutters. The profiled cutters are also known as knives, and blades. Tooling refers to cutters, knives, blades including planer blades, and cutterheads. Most moulders require the blades to be secured into a cutterhead that mounts on the shaft(s) of the machine. However, some machines such as the Williams & Hussey and the Shop Fox require the blades to bolt directly onto the shaft of the machine. The wood being fed into a moulder is commonly referred to as either “stock” or “blanks”.
Wood moulders almost always have the capacity to serve as a wood planer as well. For this reason they are also known as Planer/ Moulders. However, a wood planer does not necessarily have the capability to be a moulder. There are several makes and models of both planers and planer/ moulders on the market.
A wood moulder has one or more horizontal cutter heads, and may also have side cutter heads. Because it has horizontal cutter heads a wood moulder differs from a spindle shaper, which has one or sometimes more vertical spindles and no horizontal heads.
Common types of moulders.
Multi Head Moulder:
Standing from in front of the infeed side of the machine where the stock is fed into the machine. A common cutter head configuration is;
Bottom horizontal head, a Right hand vertical side head, a Left hand vertical side head, and a Top horizontal head.
This is a common configuration (in order of layout), but there are countless other configurations available. For instance; a multi head moulder may have two Bottom heads and two Top heads in order to size the lumber with the first Top and the first Bottom head, and then finish cut the lumber with the remaining Top and Bottom head.
Machines with two or more Right heads more common in the furniture industry to give the ability to run shorter stock and more detailed, deeper cuts on the edge of the stock.
Tooling.
Tooling refers to cutters, knives, blades, as well as planer blades, and cutter heads.
Most blades are made from either a type of tool steel known as High Speed Steel(HSS), or from carbide.
Cutter heads are normally made from either steel or aluminum.
High Speed Steel, carbide, aluminim, and steel for the cutter heads all come in a wide variety of grades.

Communities That Care

Communities That Care (CTC) is a program of the "Center for Substance Abuse Prevention" (CSAP) in the office of the United States Government's "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration" (SAMHSA). CTC is a coalition-based prevention operating system that uses a public health approach to prevent youth problem behaviors such as violence, delinquency, school drop out and substance abuse. Using strategic consultation, training, and research-based tools, CTC is designed to help community stakeholders and decision makers understand and apply information about risk and protective factors, and programs that are proven to make a difference in promoting healthy youth development, in order to most effectively address the specific issues facing their community’s youth.
Developed by Drs. "J. David Hawkins" and "Richard Catalano" at the University of Washington’s "Social Development Research Group" (SDRG), CTC’s principal strategy, the Social Development Strategy (right), focuses on strengthening protective factors that can buffer young people from problem behaviors and promote positive youth development.
CTC is grounded in rigorous research from social work, public health, psychology, education, medicine, criminology, and organizational development. It engages all community members who have a stake in healthy futures for young people and sets priorities for action based on community challenges and strengths. Clear, measurable outcomes are tracked over time to show progress and ensure accountability.
Research base for Communities that Care.
Public health understanding of risk and protective factors.
The field of public health [http://www.cdc.gov/] has developed a systematic methodology for understanding and effectively preventing health problems. Through rigorous research, the etiology of diseases has been documented, and the factors contributing to those diseases have been identified. Once these contributing factors are understood, careful study and application of approaches to amend those factors have demonstrated reductions in the disease burden. For example, heart disease has been one of the primary causes of death among American adults. We now know, however, that adequate exercise, a healthy diet, and avoidance of smoking can help to prevent heart disease. These behaviors are considered protective factors, just as smoking, high blood pressure, and a family history of heart disease are considered risk factors for poor heart health.
Since the late 1970s, researchers in a variety of disciplines (for example, criminology, sociology, social work, psychology, community psychology, education) have been applying this public health approach to the study of the healthy development of young people. This work has created a field called prevention science, [http://www.preventionscience.org/] which identifies the factors that contribute to the healthy development of children and youth (protective factors) and the factors that impede that development (risk factors).
Etiology: Longitudinal studies of youth development.
" Protective Factors and the Social Development Model. "
The prevention of health and behavior problems in young people requires, at its foundation, the promotion of the factors required for positive development. Research shows that five basic factors promote positive social development: opportunities for developmentally appropriate involvement, skills, recognition for effort, improvement and achievement, strong social bonds, and clear, consistent standards for behavior. All children need opportunities to be actively involved with positive adults and peers, the skills to participate and succeed in social, school, and civic settings, and recognition for their efforts, improvements, and accomplishments. When young people are provided with opportunities, skills, and recognition, they develop strong social bonds, that is connections with and commitment to the families, schools, and communities that provided them. When families, schools, and communities communicate to young people clear standards for behavior, those who feel bonded, emotionally connected, invested in the group, will follow those standards that promote health and success. These five factors are protective factors that promote positive development in young people (Hawkins & Weis, 1985), and form the basis for the Social Development Model.
" Risk Factors. " Research has also identified risk factors that can interrupt the process of positive social development. High quality longitudinal studies have identified risk factors in neighborhoods and communities, families, schools, and peer groups, as well as in individuals themselves. These factors increase the probability of delinquency, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, dropping out of school, and other behavior problems in young people. The risk factors shown in the risk factor chart (right) have been found in at least two high-quality studies to predict later health and behavior problems in young people. Many of these risk factors predict multiple problems. For example, the risk factor of “Poor Family Management” has been shown to predict five youth problem behaviors: substance abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school drop-out, and violence. Providing effective parent training programs in a community, therefore, could potentially impact all five of these undesirable outcomes.
Intervention: Testing effectiveness of interventions.
The identification of risk and protective factors provides the foundation for advances in preventing adolescent health and behavior problems. Prevention scientists have rigorously tested programs and policies that address these risk and protective factors in studies funded largely by the National Institutes of Health, and an increasing number and range of effective prevention approaches have now been identified. By 2004, 56 tested and effective programs were available in the United States that have been demonstrated to reduce involvement in problem behaviors and/or increase positive outcomes for youth. These 56 effective programs and policies are summarized in CTC's Prevention Strategies Guide at www.preventionplatform.samhsa.gov. Sixteen of these programs have been tested at least twice with replicated findings and have been designated as "Blueprint model programs", which, if rigorously followed, will significantly reduce youth violence and substance abuse. Programs range from prenatal (for example, Olds, 1997) and early childhood interventions (for example, Reid et al., 2001), to community policies related to alcohol (e.g. Holder et al., 2000), to school-based curricula that teach youth social and emotional skills that will help them navigate life (e.g. Botvin at al, 2003, Eisen at al., 2002, and Grossman et al., 1997).
Systems: Researching systems change in states and communities.
Prevention scientists understand that the final task arising from these research findings is the application of proven prevention programs, policies and strategies in the real world in order to enhance youth development on the ground in communities. In collaboration with communities and state and federal governments, researchers are studying the impact that prevention science can have on the effectiveness of prevention efforts within those systems. to History section of this article, to be added
What is CTC?
Five Phases of Communities That Care.
Communities That Care guides the community’s prevention efforts through a five-phase process which includes: 1) Get Started—assessing community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts; 2) Get Organized—getting a commitment to the CTC process from community leaders and forming a diverse and representative prevention coalition; 3) Develop a Profile—using epidemiologic data to assess prevention needs; 4) Create a Plan—choosing tested and effective prevention policies, practices, and programs based on assessment data; and 5) Implement and Evaluate—implementing the new strategies with fidelity, in a manner congruent with the programs’ theory, content, and methods of delivery, and evaluating progress over time.
CTC activities are planned and carried out by the CTC Community Board, a prevention coalition of community stakeholders who work together to promote positive youth outcomes. Board members participate in a series of six CTC training workshops in which they build their coalition and learn the skills needed to install the CTC system.
Working through the five phases of CTC provides the opportunity to increase communication, collaboration, and ownership among community members and service providers invested in healthy youth development.
Phase One: Getting Started. With technical assistance provided by a CTC trainer, a community catalyst and small group of advisors assess community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts, and identify the stakeholders who need to be involved. Key activities in this phase include recruiting key leaders to serve as champions of the effort, obtaining school district support to conduct a youth survey to provide epidemiological data on risk, protection, and youth behaviors, and hiring a coordinator to manage CTC activities.
Phase Two: Organizing, Introducing, Involving. In Phase Two a diverse and representative prevention coalition is formed. Specific tasks for this phase include involving and educating stakeholders who were identified in Phase One; developing a vision for the future of the community’s children, and putting an organizational structure in place to help the community move toward the vision. The first two CTC trainings are implemented in this phase: the Key Leader Orientation (KLO) and the Community Board Orientation (CBO). These trainings introduce prevention science to community stakeholders, and help community members create an appropriate structure for the Community Board.
Phase Three: Developing a Community Profile. This is the data collection phase, including a comprehensive community assessment of adolescent behaviors and current prevention services. This phase usually requires administration of the CTC Youth Survey [https://preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/Macro/Csap/dss_portal/templates_redesign/start1.cfm?page=http%3A%2F%2Fncadi%2Esamhsa%2Egov%2Ffeatures%2Fctc%2Fresources%2Easpx&topic_id=0&sect_id=1&CFID=1366190&CFTOKEN=66897747&link_name=Communities%20That%20Care%26reg%3B]. Members of the Risk and Protective Factor Assessment Work Group participate in the Community Assessment Training, in which they learn about key data sources for risk and protective factors (such as the student survey) and how to analyze the data. In communities already using the CTC Youth Survey, this training is tailored to help the work group interpret survey results and identify elevated risk factors, depressed protective factors, and problem behaviors prevalent among youth in the community. From this analysis, the work group recommends priority risk and protective factors for focused attention by the CTC Board.
The second component of the community profile is an assessment of current community programs, policies, and resources that address the prioritized risk and protective factors. The Resource Assessment workgroup is trained in assessment procedures during the Community Resource Assessment Training. The goals of the resource assessment are to identify existing evidence-based programs that address the priority factors, discern the gaps in existing program delivery, and recommend where new programs or policies are needed.
Phase Four: Creating a Community Action Plan. During the fourth phase of CTC, the results of the assessment process are reviewed by the full Community Board, and a community action plan is developed. The Community Plan Training (CPT) is provided to Community Boards during this phase. During this training, Board members select prevention policies and programs that target their prioritized risk factors to fill gaps in current prevention services. The "CTC Prevention Strategies Guide" is a tool used during this process. It describes prevention programs that have been demonstrated in at least one high quality research trial to be effective in changing risk, protection, and problem behaviors. Once program choices are made, CPT participants are trained to write an action plan that sets clear, measurable goals regarding anticipated outcomes, and also develop an evaluation plan.
Phase Five: Implementing and Evaluating the Community Action Plan. In this phase, the CTC Board implements selected strategies, and evaluates progress over time. Board members and staff for the selected preventive programs attend the final CTC training workshop, the Community Plan Implementation Training (CPIT), which emphasizes the importance of implementing prevention programs with fidelity; that is, ensuring that the programs’ content, dosage, and manner of delivery adhere to the protocols identified by program developers. Participants also learn methods for tracking implementation progress, assessing desired changes in participants, and using this information to adjust implementation as needed to fulfill program objectives.
CTC is intended as an ongoing process. The process of monitoring implementation progress and community level changes in risk, protection and youth outcomes is repeated every two years. Based on a review of these data, CTC boards revise their action plans as needed.
Essential components of Communities That Care.
The CTC system is collaborative, proactive, science-based, and data driven, and provides structure, tools, training and technical assistance for coalitions.
Collaborative. CTC uses a coalition approach to address issues at the community level. The coalition will include a diverse group of stakeholders concerned with youth development (youth-serving agency staff, school representatives, health professionals, city leaders, law enforcement, United Way, other funding entities, neighborhood groups, business people, parents, media representatives, faith community members, youth, etc.) in applying prevention science principles to decisions affecting the community’s youth. By providing a setting and common language for all stakeholders to discuss prevention, the model ensures that all voices in the community are heard and respected.
Proactive. Rather than reacting to problems once they have already occurred, CTC focuses on strengthening protections and decreasing risks in order to promote healthy youth development and decrease the likelihood of problem behaviors.
Science based. CTC is grounded in rigorous research from a variety of disciplines, including public health, sociology, psychology, criminology, and community psychology. This research has identified the "predictors" of youth problem behaviors, developed epidemiologic "assessment tools" for measuring those predictors in a community, and tested "programs that work" in addressing those predictors.
Data driven. The CTC system ensures local control of decisions based on local data and needs assessments, and flexibility to implement actions specific to the priorities identified by community members. The CTC system provides tools for measuring levels of risk and protective factors, selecting priority factors on which to focus a strategic plan, selecting appropriate prevention responses, and tracking progress toward desired changes in priority risk factors.
a. The "CTC Youth Survey" is the primary tool for needs assessment and monitoring. This is a confidential, schoolwide survey for students appropriate for Grades 6-12, that measures a majority of the risk and protective factors identified to predict youth problem behaviors. Coalition members use survey results from students in their community as well as community archival data to prioritize risk and protective factors for attention. The survey is re-administered every 2 years in order to monitor progress over time.
b. "Effective program selection" is another element of the data-driven process. Coalition members review policies and programs that have been tested and proven effective in addressing their priority factors. They consider the suitability of each program to the community's circumstances, and select prevention responses most likely to be successful in that environment. Information on program effectiveness is summarized in menus of effective programs, for example CTC’s Prevention Strategies Guide and The Blueprint for Violence Prevention list of effective programs.
c. "Monitoring of program implementation" is the third element of the data-driven process. Throughout the implementation cycle of each prevention program or strategy, coalitions collect data to ensure that the program is delivered with fidelity to the original program design. This monitoring information is important, because without close replication, the effectiveness of these programs can be compromised (see, for example, Elliot & Mihalic, 2004). Monitoring implementation is also a management tool for identifying challenges that can be addressed before they lead to program failure.
Structure and tools. The CTC structure includes six training workshops and additional tools that help walk community members through each stage of the process. Training manuals are composed of modules that provide comprehensive information, exercises, and guidelines for each stage of the process. The "Milestones and Benchmarks" checklist [https://preventionplatform.samhsa.gov/Macro/Csap/dss_portal/templates_redesign/start1.cfm?page=http%3A%2F%2Fncadi%2Esamhsa%2Egov%2Ffeatures%2Fctc%2Fresources%2Easpx&topic_id=0&sect_id=1&CFID=1366190&CFTOKEN=66897747&link_name=Communities%20That%20Care%26reg%3B] functions as a roadmap for the entire effort. Milestones are major tasks that must be accomplished in each phase of CTC, and benchmarks provide essential steps toward achieving each of these major tasks. Booklets are available to help local leaders evaluate and address community readiness issues before initiating the process, and to explain the system to key leaders and potential board members.
Training and technical assistance. Successful CTC efforts include high-quality training and technical assistance from experienced and certified facilitators. Feinberg et al. (2004), Gomez et al. (2005) and Greenberg et al. (2005) studied the functioning and sustainability of CTC coalitions in Pennsylvania, and found three factors strongly related to effective coalition function: community organizational and motivational readiness, initial training, and ongoing technical assistance (TA). The Pennsylvania study also documented that the sustainability of the effort was predicted by the prevention knowledge of coalition members, the quality of coalition functioning, and their fidelity to the CTC model.

Tested and effective programs.
A cornerstone of effective community-level prevention involves the implementation of appropriate responses to the priority needs identified during the assessment phase of the process. The CTC system guides community groups to choose and implement appropriate tested and effective programs, policies, and practices in families, schools, and communities (see the CTC Prevention Strategies Guide and the Blueprints for Violence Prevention website). These programs have shown significant effects on minimizing youths’ risky behaviors and enhancing positive choices.
Evaluation results: Does CTC work?
Evaluation of implementation.
The CYDS evaluated community efforts to faithfully implement (1) the core principles of the CTC prevention system, and (2) tested and effective prevention programs with respect to content and delivery specifications. The study found that CTC communities achieved high implementation fidelity at the system and program levels when supported by training and technical assistance in CTC. Control communities did not achieve these things.
At the start of the CYDS, CTC and control communities did not differ in their use of a science-based approach to prevention. By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities. They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use.
The CTC Milestones and Benchmarks Survey was used to track progress in the implementation of core components of the CTC prevention system. In each year of the intervention, CTC communities enacted an average of 90% of the key features of the CTC prevention system, including developing a community board, prioritizing risk and protective factors, selecting tested and effective preventive interventions from the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide, implementing selected implementation programs with fidelity, and periodically assessing risk and protective factors and child and adolescent well-being through surveys of students. One year after the implementation phase of the trial had ended, eleven of 12 CTC coalitions continued to operate in CTC communities. These coalitions continued to implement key CTC milestones and benchmarks to a significantly greater degree than coalitions in control communities, even without ongoing study-provided support. Control communities did not make this progress over time in completing CTC milestones and benchmarks, implementing scientifically proven prevention programs, and monitoring program impacts. 
Over the course of the trial, the 12 CTC communities demonstrated faithful implementation of 17 different school-based, after-school, and parenting interventions selected from a menu of 39 possible tested and effective programs for 5th through 9th grade students contained in the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide. On average, CTC communities implemented 2.75 tested and effective prevention programs per year (range: 1-5). High rates of fidelity were achieved consistently over time with respect to adherence to program objectives and core components (average = 91-94% per year) and dosage (number, length, and frequency of intervention sessions; average = 93-95% per year). Faithful implementation continued two years after study support ended. CTC coalitions still offered significantly more tested and effective intervention programs, implemented them with high quality, monitored implementation to a significantly greater degree, and reached significantly more children and parents, compared to control coalitions.
Impact evaluations.
The Prevention Research Center at Pennsylvania State University has been studying the process and impact of the statewide CTC system since its inception in the early 1990s. Summaries of their findings will be posted here soon.
The Community Youth Development Study (CYDS) is the first controlled experimental trial of the Communities That Care system. Twenty-four communities in 7 states agreed to participate in the study. These communities consisted of 12 matched pairs which had equivalent demographics and equivalent levels of youth risks and problem behaviors at the start of the study. Communities were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. The intervention communities received funding to hire a full-time community coordinator, who formed a community coalition that subsequently participated in the full cycle of CTC trainings. These communities then created community action plans, and were awarded up to $75,000 per year for the next four years to implement the tested, effective prevention strategies selected as part of the action planning process. Control communities continued prevention business as usual.
Hawkins et al. 2008, reported finding no significant differences between CTC and control communities in average levels of community-targeted risks among students in fifth grade, prior to the start of the CTC programs. By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities, . They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use. The longitudinal panel youth in CTC and control communities reported similar levels of targeted risk in Grade 5, when the intervention began, but targeted risk exposure grew more slowly for youth in CTC communities between Grade 5 and Grade 10. Significantly lower levels of targeted risk were first reported by CTC panel youth 1.67 years into the intervention, in Grade 7, and have continued to be reported by CTC panel youth through Grade 10.
Panel youth from CTC and control communities also reported similar levels of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking at Grade 5 baseline. However, between Grades 5 and 10, CTC had significant effects on the initiation of these behaviors by youth. Significant differences in the initiation of delinquency were first observed in the spring of Grade 7. Panel youth from CTC communities were 25% less likely than panel youth from control communities to initiate delinquent behavior, and they remained so in Grade 8. Significantly lower delinquency initiation rates were sustained through Grade 10, when panel youth from CTC communities were 17% less likely to initiate delinquency than panel youth from control communities.
Preventive effects on alcohol use and cigarette use were first observed in the spring of Grade 8, 2.67 years after intervention programs were implemented. Grade 8 youth from CTC communities were 32% less likely to initiate alcohol use, and 33% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than Grade 8 youth from control communities (Hawkins et al., 2009). Preventive effects were again sustained through Grade 10 when CTC panel youth were 29% less likely to initiate alcohol use and 28% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than panel youth from control communities.
Differences in the initiation of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking from Grade 5 through Grade 10 led to cumulatively lower rates of initiation over time: 62% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from CTC communities had engaged in delinquent behavior compared with 70% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from control communities; 67% vs. 75% had initiated alcohol use; and 44% vs. 52% had smoked cigarettes. (insert illustration here).
CTC also significantly reduced the prevalence of youth problem behaviors in Grade 8 and Grade 10. In Grade 8, the prevalence of alcohol use in the past month, binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row) in the past two weeks, and the variety of delinquent behaviors committed in the past year were all significantly lower in CTC panel youth compared to control community panel youth. The CYDS also found significant effects of CTC in reducing the prevalence of cigarette use in the past month and delinquent behavior and violence in the past year in the spring of Grade 10.
"Child Trends Research Brief:" An overview of the Communities That Care system and up to date research information is available from Child Trends with an in depth research brief that can be found here. Other research is also available through the Child Trends Website.
"Conclusions:" CTC’s theory of change hypothesizes that it takes from 2 to 5 years to observe community-level effects on risk factors, and 5 or more years to observe effects on adolescent delinquency or substance use CTC timeline graphic. These early findings from the first randomized community trial of CTC are promising, suggesting that CTC is slowing the usual developmental increase in adolescents’ risk exposure. Longer follow-up measurements are needed to determine if CTC can significantly reduce community levels of delinquency and drug use as hypothesized. The Community Youth Development Study will collect additional data from these students in 2007 and 2008. These data will allow tests of CTC’s effects on community rates of delinquency and substance use initiation among young people through the spring of grade 9, almost 5 years after CTC was introduced in the intervention communities and approximately 3½ years after communities began implementing tested and effective prevention programs chosen through the CTC system.

Fingerpori

Fingerpori is a Finnish comic strip written and drawn by Pertti Jarla. It started in "Helsingin Sanomat" in February 2007, and is currently syndicated in "Satakunnan kansa", "Aamulehti", "Karjalainen", "Keskisuomalainen", "Turun Sanomat" and "Etelä-Saimaa". Several strip collections in album format have also been published.
The central milieu of the strip is Fingerpori, an imaginary Finnish small town. The main character in the strip is the eyeglass-wearing Heimo Vesa, but other citizens also appear, such as the brash-mouthed café worker Rivo-Riitta. As well as the Fingerporians, the strip has included characters such as the Pope, The Phantom, Spider-Man, Adolf Hitler, Kimi Räikkönen and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. A few strips, featuring Jesus, have caused controversy in some circles.
The humour in "Fingerpori" is largely verbal and is often based on (mostly untranslatable) wordplay and puns. Although "Fingerpori" contains some political satire, the author claims it is not a political comic strip.
Publication history.
The original form of "Fingerpori" was a strip by the same author called "Karl-Barks-Stadt", which won the third prize in the strip category of a Nordic comics contest at the Kemi comics days in 2006. According to the judging board, "Karl-Barks-Stadt" was "a really well drawn strip, whose unexpressionistic characters give a lively life to the joke told by the strip". After winning the prize, "Karl-Barks-Stadt" appeared in November 2006 in "Ilta-Sanomat" as the Finnish strip of the month. "Karl-Barks-Stadt" was Jarla's first continuous comic strip, he had previously only made short one-time strips to the humour magazine "Pahkasika" and worked as a graphic designer in the corporate world. The name of the strip is a portmanteau, referring to the East German Karl-Marx-Stadt (currently known as Chemnitz) and the cartoonist Carl Barks.
In the turn of the year 2006–2007, "Helsingin Sanomat" was looking for a new Finnish comic strip to its pages, and the newspaper's comics editor Eeva Lepistö turned her attention to "Karl-Barks-Stadt". The strip, now renamed "Fingerpori", started appearing in "Helsingin Sanomat" on 5 February 2007. It replaced "Tiger", having appeared in the newspaper for over 40 years, whose creator Bud Blake had retired in 2004.
In April 2008, the comics publisher Arktinen Banaani published the first "Fingerpori" album. The album, like the whole strip, received mixed response. In "Helsingin Sanomat", professor Olli Alho criticised "Fingerpori" because its humour is mostly based on homonym puns, which do not interest the mature reader. He compared the strip's "view of the body and the soul" to the grotesque realism defined by Mikhail Bakhtin and its representatives, such as François Rabelais. In contrast, the "Plaza.fi" Kaista review praised "Fingerpori" as "the best new Finnish strip for a long time", and in a review in "Suomen Kuvalehti", Jarla was praised for bringing Finnish pun humour to a new and fresh level.

Only the Young

"Only the Young" is a song recorded by the American rock band Journey in 1983. Previously intended for the "Frontiers" album, it was pulled from the album within days of recording in favor of songs "Back Talk" and "Troubled Child". The song was eventually released as a single (which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1985) and appeared on the soundtracks to the 1985 film "Vision Quest". The song's lyrical theme focuses on young people and the hope and future they all have in front of them. The song was featured later as a bonus track on the 2006 CD reissue of Frontiers.
The first individual outside the band to hear the song was sixteen-year-old Kenny Sykaluk of Rocky River, Ohio, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. His mother wrote a letter to the band telling them about her son's terminal condition, and how big a fan he was of Journey. The band flew to his hospital bedside in Cleveland, Ohio at the request of the Make a Wish Foundation. Along with a Walkman containing the new track, the band also brought Kenny a football helmet signed by the San Francisco 49ers and an autographed Journey platinum record award. The experience of playing the song for Kenny left Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain deeply affected. Perry said, "As soon as I walked out of the hospital room I lost it. Nurses had to take me to a room by myself." On the band's episode of VH1's "Behind the Music", Cain broke down in tears recalling the event, remarking that "children should not have to live with that kind of pain". Kenny died the next day, with the Walkman still in his hand. The song brought life into perspective for the band and left them humbled. Neal Schon said that Kenny's death affected Journey by making them re-evaluate the issues that were causing friction inside the band itself. In honor of Kenny Sykaluk, the band used the song as their opener for the Raised on Radio Tour.
The song was also recorded by American rock band Scandal in 1984. The song was featured on their album "The Warrior".

Critique.
Uneven.
The reviewer of this book from Barnes & Noble wrote that even though none of the eleven short-stories are out of the ordinary, the author does however find strange goings on.This reviewer surmises that this collection of stories is uneven and the style of writing can make for monotonous reading.
It is quite often painfully hard to read.
According to John Pilling there is insistent use of the present tense used throughout the book that produced in the mind of this reviewer "a kind of literary indigestion". He went on to mention that a person could "fear the snare of thinking that this sort of literary indigestion is therefore good for the person reading!

St. Anne's Chapel (Fredericton)

St. Anne's Chapel is a Gothic Revival Anglican chapel of ease in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Constructed between 1846 and 1847, it was designed by British-born architect Frank Wills. St. Anne's Chapel is a National Historic Site of Canada.
History.
St. Anne's Chapel was built at the direction of John Medley soon after his arrival in Canada in 1845 as the first Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Fredericton. Its architect, Frank Wills, was brought to Canada by Bishop Medley from Exeter, England in 1846 to work on Christ Church Cathedral. Located at the corner of Westmorland and George Streets in the west end of the city, St. Anne's was intended as a chapel of ease in which services could be held until construction of the Cathedral was completed. The chapel's cornerstone was laid in May 1846 and it was consecrated on March 18, 1847. Bishop Medley himself paid most of the construction costs. Christ Church Cathedral was completed in 1853 and in 1854 the chapel became Christ Church (Parish) Church, although it continued to be commonly known as St. Anne's. With the completion next to it of a much larger church building in 1962, St. Anne's became a chapel once more. St. Anne's Chapel of Ease was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989. The designation encompasses only the 1847 chapel, not the adjoining 1962 structure.
Architectural significance.
. Anne's Chapel was the first church in North America constructed according to the principles of the Ecclesiological Society, with which both Bishop Medley and the architect, Frank Wills, had been associated before coming to Canada. As such, it was intended by Bishop Medley to be a model for future parish churches in New Brunswick. It has been authoritatively described as the finest Gothic Revival church of its size and kind in North America.
The hammer-dressed grey sandstone building, which measures only 74 by 21 feet, comprises a nave and a chancel with a carved butternut screen. The interior roof, pulpit, altar and open bench pews are also crafted of local butternut. The interior is richly decorated, with multicoloured Minton encaustic tiles on the nave and chancel floors and the reredos. The stained glass windows in the nave were obtained from the Beer studio in Exeter, while the triplet window in the chancel was made by William Warrington of London. The entrance is through a small porch with ornate ironwork hinges and decoration on the doors. The churchyard is surrounded by a low stone wall incorporating a lychgate.
The new chapel's innovative design was controversial at the time, with some parishioners objecting to the inclusion of a chancel with a screen, which symbolically separated the priest from the laity. Also, no pew rents were charged for the open bench pews. This deprived the parish of a source of income, as well as taking away a mark of status from pew owners.

Bemeizid

The Hebrew adjective מזיד "mezid" means "deliberate." The adverbial form "be-mezid" means "deliberately." This Hebrew term is used in Jewish law to indicate that something was done on purpose. This matters in order to determine how culpable someone is for his actions. The opposite adjective is שוגג "shogeg", "not on purpose."
In order to for an action to be considered deliberate, it must have been done with the knowledge that it was wrong, and with the intention of doing the action, and of his own free will. If he did not know the action was forbidden, or did not think it was wrong in his particular circumstances, he is considered to have done the action "beshogeg", "not on purpose." If he was forced to do the action, then it was done "beones".

Ganggangsullae

Ganggangsullae (Hangul: 강강술래) is a 5,000-year-old Korean dance that was first used to bring about a bountiful harvest and has developed into a cultural symbol for Korea. It incorporates singing, dancing, and playing and is exclusively performed by women. The dance is mostly performed in the southwestern coastal province of Jeollanam-do. It is often associated with the Chuseok holiday and Daeboreum.
History.
The dance is thought to have originated around 5,000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the universe. Participants would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring about a good harvest. 
In the 16th century, during the Japanese invasion of Korea, Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance in military uniform to intimidate the Japanese. The women were said to have dressed in military uniform and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산). The Japanese scouts thus overestimated the strength of the Korean troops.
On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea #8.
Characteristics.
Traditionally, this dance is performed only by women at night without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in traditional Korean clothing, hold each other's hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line and everyone sings the refrain 'ganggangsullae'. The song tempo progressively becomes faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and desires. During the dance, the women play a variety of games. The dance can last until dawn.

Technology Across the Curriculum

The Technology Across the Curriculum program at George Mason University fosters the integration of technology across the liberal arts curriculum. Its central goal is to promote information technology skills among students enrolled at GMU. It has been widely recognized as an outstanding example of the programmatic implementation of technology skills across the curriculum.
History and structure of the program.
The Technology Across the Curriculum (TAC) program began in 1998 with funding from the governor and legislature of Virginia, along with additional funding from GMU itself. After a series of consultations with faculty members about the technology skills that students need to succeed in majors and with local businesses and corporations about the skills they expect from graduates (in addition to discussions with students and with technology leaders), the creators of the program, Anne Scrivener Agee and Dee Ann Holisky, developed a series of IT goals that reflect the skills required by students to flourish in college and upon graduation. The goals, revised in fall 2001, are described in detail here. Thy are broken down into "essential" skills that all students should have (and that might be integrated into lower-division courses) and the "advanced" skills that might be relevant only to particular majors or to upper-level courses. Those skills in brief are:
Having articulated those goals, the TAC Program solicited faculty course and program development proposals that would incorporate one or more of the goals into particular course assignments, so that students would develop the skills associated with the various goals.
You can find a history of the TAC-funded proposals on the TAC Project Summary Page. Over most of its history, the TAC program has funded proposals from faculty members modifying individual courses or a small group of courses to incorporate several of the skills listed among the TAC IT Goals. The program has also funded department-wide proposals, in which a department decides on a series of courses that will advance student technology skills in a deliberative way, as the student progresses through the program or major. Individual proposals often involved a one-year funding cycle, in which a faculty member (or a few faculty members) would design a new assignment that incorporated student technology skills, implement it during one or two semesters, and write a report back to the TAC program assessing the success of the project. Department-wide proposals often extended over multiple years, as a group of faculty members incorporated new assignments into a series of courses, providing interim and annual assessment reports for each year that the department received TAC funding. A good example of a department-wide project was the Technology in the NCC Curriculum project, in which several faculty in the New Century College developed a series of technology-based assignments, trained other NCC faculty in the use of those assignments, and described those assignments in a detailed online report. An example of a very ambitious, "individual" project is the U.S. History Online project, in which two faculty members developed a series of online modules for a particular course, teaching students how to think like historians and how to use various online sources and tools to interpret historical events and to analyze historical data. Individual TAC projects more typically involve a single assignment with clear, technology-based learning goals, advancing one or more of the 10 TAC IT goals.
One of the original creators of the program, Dee Ann Holisky, has overseen the program since its inception. As Associate Dean and Senior Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (now the College of Humanities and Social Sciences), she has also been responsible for overarching curriculum development for the college. The TAC Program is thus related to a general process of curriculum redesign, in which departments and faculty members rethink their course and program requirements to fulfill the college's mission of preparing students for their working lives and for citizenship in a complex, technology-rich society. Several TAC Coordinators have guided the program over its existence, including Jim Sparrow, Susan Warshauer, Leslie Harris, Beth Secrist, and Glenda Morgan.
Recognition and awards.
In June 2000, the TAC Program was selected as one of 20 international finalists in the Education Category of the Stockholm Challenge. In October 2000, the TAC Program received the Governor's Technology Award in the Higher Education category. In October 2001, the program received the annual Educause Systemic Progress in Teaching and Learning Award. The Educause Award articulates in a very clear way the essential elements of the TAC program:
Unique characteristics of the program.
The summary of the TAC Program by the Educause Award committee gives a good sense of what makes the program particularly effective. Two key words in that summary are "systematic" and "programmatic." The TAC Program is "systematic" in part because of the 10 overarching IT Goals. Those goals set up an ambitious range of skills for students to develop over their four years at GMU. When faculty members submit TAC proposals, the faculty members indicate the goals that those proposals are intended to satisfy. By means of the IT Grids and a project database, the TAC program tracks how many courses satisfy each of the 10 goals. The program also sets its own priorities for each funding cycle, choosing to concentrate on different goals over time based on the goals that need the most attention or that are most appropriate for that funding year. The overarching strategy is to integrate as many of those 10 skills into the curriculum over time as possible, so that by the time a student graduates from the university, s/he will have not only a broad-based liberal arts education, but also a good grounding in the technology skills needed for future success.
Another key element of TAC's "programmatic" nature is the emphasis on impact. The program has attempted over the years to gauge the impact it has had on the undergraduate curriculum and to keep track of the number of departments, courses, faculty, and students who are in some way affected by the program itself. The faculty members and departments are those who have been involved in TAC projects, and the students have taken courses that incorporate assignments advancing student technology skills as a result of TAC funding. The impact of a project can also influence whether the project receives funding, since one of the goals of the program is to be as comprehensive as possible. When a course that is a university requirement incorporates a new technology assignment (or assignments) as part of the TAC program, then almost every student at the university will complete that assignment, and those students will gain the technology skills inherent to the assignment. For example, History 100 (Western Civilization) is a required course at GMU, and all students who cannot place out of the course need to take it. The Western Civilization Webography project teaches students how to evaluate Internet sources based on their Authority, Accuracy, Objectivity, Currency, Coverage, Quality, etc. Students work collaboratively to review Web-based resources relevant to the course (and that might be useful for a later writing assignment in the course), and the students enter their review into a searchable database. Students are learning crucial skills in Information literacy, and they are also learning how information is stored in a database to make it useful for later searching and retrieval. The TAC program can then feel confident that the vast majority of students at the university have received training in those crucial skills. Similarly, if Communication 104 (Presenting with Technology) is a university or college requirement, then most students will receive training in several of the IT Skills: Electronic Collaboration, Electronic Documents, Technology-Enhanced Presentations, Electronic Research and Evaluation, and Representation Technologies. If the 100-level and 200-level chemistry courses teach students essential spreadsheet skills, then all non-science majors and science majors who take those courses will have gained those skills. The more the TAC program can influence large and required courses, and the more other departments and courses become involved in the program, the more effective TAC becomes in achieving its goal of ensuring that all students receive training in the 10 crucial IT skills that provide the foundation and structure for the program.

John Appleby (inventor)

John Francis Appleby (1840–1917) was an American inventor who developed a knotting device to bind grain bundles with twine, which became the foundation for all farm grain binding machinery and was used extensively by all the major manufacturers of large grain harvesting machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Appleby's knotting device was a major landmark in the mechanization of agriculture and aided the development of the western wheat fields of the United States.
Background.
John Francis Appleby was born in Westmoreland, New York in 1840. In 1844 his extended family of 17 arrived by boat to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
When he was just 18, Appleby invented the basic knotting device that would become the foundation for all farm binding machinery, but no one was interested in the idea at the time.
He served with the 23rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the American Civil War, from 1862 to 1865. During the war, Appleby invented and patented a manual magazine feed breech loading needle gun.
When the US government rejected the idea, Appleby sold the patent for $500. The weapon was later used extensively by the Prussian Army.
Grain binder.
After the war, he returned to Wisconsin and by 1874 had developed a successful wire grain binder. He was unable to gain any financial backing for it because of lack of support from farmers for the use of wire binding because small bits of wire often got into feed grain and were ingested by cattle, causing them harm.
By 1878, Appleby had developed a successful twine binder, which he patented. Twine binders did not cut into the wheat or, like wire binders, kill cattle that happened to eat a strand. 
He licensed the twine binder mechanism to the Gammon and Deering Company, which incorporated it into its Marsh Harvester grain binders and harvesters. Primarily on the value of Appleby’s twine binder, The Deering Harvester Company (as it became known in 1880) outsold its competitors.
Appleby's design soon became the standard grain binding device used on machines manufactured by Cyrus McCormick’s McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Champion Machine Works, and the D.M. Osborne Co.
Later life.
In 1881, Appleby sold his grain binder machine patent interests to Champion Machine. He continued to work on various inventions, eventually patenting a horse-drawn cotton harvesting machine in 1905.
He died in Chicago in November 1917.

João Paulo Cuenca (Rio de Janeiro, 1978) is a Brazilian writer.
João Paulo Cuenca was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1978 and is considered to be among the new generation of promising Brazilian authors. In 2012, the English literary magazine »Granta« named him as one of the 20 best Brazilian writers under 40. In 2007, he was selected by the Hay Festival as one of the most talented 39 Latin American writers under 39. His striking eloquence creates scenarios which change effortlessly between common surroundings and surreal incidents.
In 2003, Cuenca published his first novel »Corpo Presente« (tr: Body Present), which depicts a man’s radical descent into his own obsessions. In seductive Copacabana, the narrator goes through days, streets and women on a search for a lost or impossible love affair, looking for feelings that have been lost forever in a world that has become too cynical, too violent, too sexualised. An idealist in his own way, he searches for purity by dirtying himself in the precarious moments that life presents him with. In 2007, his second, very successful novel »O Dia Mastroianni« (The Mastroianni Day) was published in Brazil and subsequently released in Italy in 2008 and in Portugal in 2009. This generational novel is based on the idea of two friends who take the legendary Italian actor as their role model, enjoying the moment, the pleasures of women, and life itself as modern dandies in a 24 hours spiral. Cuenca’s most recent novel, »O único final feliz para uma história de amor é um acidente« (2012; tr: The Only Happy Ending to a Love Story is an Accident) is set in present-day Tokyo and tells the story of Shunsuke and his complicated relationship with his father, Mr Okuda, whose hobby is spying on his son. When Sunshuke falls in love with Iulana, a maelstrom of jealousy is set in motion that culminates in abduction and death. In poetic and imaginative language, Cuenca subtly interweaves reality and fiction, creating a world whose palpable characters leave a lasting impression. Written rather like a crime novel, full of odd events and reminiscent of Haruki Murakami, this story draws the reader in from the very first page. »O único final feliz para uma história de amor é um acidente« has been published in Portugal, Spain, German and will be released in the United States and France in 2013.
Besides writing books, Cuenca worked as a journalist and columnist for various major Brazilian newspapers and magazines, among them »O Globo«. An anthology of his chronicles and columns appeared only recently in the volume »A última madrugada« (2012; tr: The last dawn). João Paulo Cuenca’s texts have already appeared in anthologies inside and outside of Brazil.

"Helas madam" is a folk song said to be composed by Henry VIII. The song is part of a secular collection, found on a manuscript that was used in Henry's court. The originality of the song has been questioned, with various parts of the song allegedly lifted from similar pieces in Europe. The song itself is a conversation in Middle French between a man and woman, with the man asking the woman if he can become her humble servant.
Lyrics.

Robert J. Donovan

Robert John Donovan (August 21, 1912-August 8, 2003) was a Washington correspondent, author and presidential historian. 
Biography.
Donovan attended Lafayette High School in Buffalo, New York, where he was Captain of the Hocke Herald Tribune after the war and served as a foreign correspondent and Washington Bureau Chief. During the latter period he was President of the White House Correspondents' Association. From the Tribune, he moved to the Los Angeles Times as Washington Bureau Chief and for a short time as Associate Editor in Los Angeles.
Donovan began writing books on the Washington political scene while still a reporter and continued that after retirement. He also served a year as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow and a year as a Visiting Professor at Princeton University. He liked to joke that he was the only Professor at Princeton never to have attended a single day of college in his life. On the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Congress, he addressed a Joint Session of Congress as Truman's principal biographer. At the time, he was the only active journalist to have ever had that distinction.
His titles include "The Assassins" (1955), "Eisenhower: The Inside Story" (1956), "PT-109: John F. Kennedy in World War II" (1961), "The Future of the Republican Party" (1976), "Conflict and Crisis: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1945-48" (1977), "Tumultuous Years: The Presidency of Harry S.

The origins of this institution can be traced back to the Reformation. 
Until 1951 it belonged jointly to the city and the university and was supported by the Canton of Berne, and by the Community of Burghers of Berne. 
The collection of the library includes the illustrated late mediaeval historical chronicle Berner Chronik written by Diebold Schilling the Elder, "Liber ad honorem Augusti". It contains about 30 000 pictorial documents about Berne and about 1 000 precious codices, some of them from the late antiquity. 
The library includes collections inherited from the following collectors:

Diamond Schools

Diamond School is a term that applies to a type of Independent school in the UK that combines both single-sex and coeducational teaching in the same organisation. Typically, boys and girls are taught together until the age of 11, separately from 11-16, before coming back together again in a joint Sixth Form.
"Diamond schools" are often the product of the merger of a boys' and a girls' school, thus it is usual that at KS3 and KS4 girls and boys can be taught separately on different sites. It is a common feature that boys and girls combine outside the classroom in activities for academic trips and visits and in some co-curricular activities, such as choirs, orchestras and the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.
"Diamond schools" in the UK Independent sector include:

IUoU

IUoU is an DIN-designation and acronym for an automated, three phase procedure to charge a lead-acid battery by means of a battery charger. The three phases are: I-phase, constant electric current; Uo-phase, constant over-voltage; 
U-phase, constant voltage. 
The term 3-Step Charge Profile refers to the same procedure but is not part of the DIN terminology. At least one equipment manufacturer refers to the three phases as Bulk Phase, Absorption Phase and Float Charge.
The purpose is to fully charge the battery in a relatively short time without reducing its life span and to indefinitely keep the battery charged as long as the charger is connected. The three phases (or stages) have no connection with three-phase electric power.
I-phase.
When an IUoU charger is connected to an empty battery, it will enter the I-phase and provide a constant current. The current is determined by the charger and possibly its settings and should be in a reasonable relation to the battery's capacity. For longest battery life, the current would not exceed one tenth of the battery's capacity (C/10), although many battery specifications allow for a fast charge with a higher current than C/10. As a result of the current, the battery absorbs the charge and its voltage rises. The charger limits the maximum voltage to Uo, a constant or temperature-dependent maximum, typically 2.4 V to 2.6 V per cell. As soon as Uo is reached, the charger enters the Uo-phase. 
Uo-phase.
In the Uo-phase, the battery is continued being charged at a constant voltage, but the charge current is decreasing. The decrease is imposed by the battery. The voltage in the Uo-phase is too high to be applied indefinitely but it allows charging the battery fully in a relatively short time. So it is important that the end of the Uo-phase is detected reliably. Depending on the charger, the Uo-phase is concluded when the charge current goes below a threshold, typically 0.8 times the rated I-phase current and the U-phase is entered.
U-phase.
In the U-phase, the voltage is decreased to typically 2.3 V per cell. This phase is intended to first fully charge the battery and to keep the battery charged, if desired indefinitely. The charge current decreases to a value much lower than C/10 and compensates for the self discharge.
Special cases.
When an IUoU charger is connected to a full or partially full battery, the I-phase and Uo-phase are brief and the U-phase is entered quickly.
A bad battery will have short I-phase and Uo-phase, but there is a risk of gassing, further damaging the battery.
If a battery is connected to a significant load during charging, the end of the Uo-phase may never be reached and the battery will gas and be damaged, depending on the charge current relative to the battery capacity.

Shooting at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics

Shooting at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, as approved by the International Shooting Sport Federation, comprised 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol, each for boys (60 shots) and girls (40 shots), with 80 competitors altogether. For each of the four events, a total of twenty NOCs qualified and participated with one competitor each. 
The continental confederations of ISSF organized special qualifying competitions for shooters born in 1992 and 1993. The minimum qualification scores (MQS) have been set at 552 / 368 (60 shots boys / 40 shots girls) for air rifle and at 540 / 355 (60 shots boys / 40 shots girls) for air pistol. In comparison, the "adult" MQS for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics were air rifle 570 / 375 and air pistol 563 / 365 respectively.
1 In the girls' air rifle and the boys' air pistol competitions, one of these spots is reserved for the host country, Singapore.

Adam Smethurst

Adam Smethurst is an English actor and writer. He has appeared in TV dramas including "Casualty", "Marple" and "Lewis", is the son of "Love Thy Neighbour" star Jack Smethurst, and is married to fellow actor Rakie Ayola, with whom he has one daughter and is expecting a second.
Personal life.
Smethurst is the son of "Love Thy Neighbour" star Jack Smethurst. During a 1998 production of "Hamlet" at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Smethurst met his future wife, Rakie Ayola. Ayola has stated that there was initially "no spark" between them, however they met again two years later during a production of "Twelfth Night", and went on to become a couple. Asked to describe what attracted her to Smethurst, Ayola responded: "He's a very nice, uncomplicated man, but I saw something deeper in him. I also liked his incredible cheerfulness and openness and he has grown up with sisters so that made him easy with women." Smethurst proposed to Ayola by giving her a locket, containing a scroll which read "Will you marry me?". They married in May 2004, and Ayola gave birth to their daughter Tansy in July that year. Ayola has explained that they planned the wedding before discovering her pregnancy, and although they had been trying to conceive for around eighteen months, she failed to recognise the initial symptoms and instead believed herself to be diabetic. In the early years of their marriage, Smethurst and Ayola struggled financially, and she has spoken of her worry that she may have to cease acting, shortly before being offered the role of Kyla Tyson in the BBC medical drama "Holby City". In October 2008, Ayola announced that she was pregnant with the couple's second child.
Filmography.
Smethurst has undertaken the following roles from his televisual debut in 1994, to the present day.

Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit

The Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit was an Anglo-French volunteer medical unit which served initially with the 4th French army in Lorraine, eastern France, during the Second World War from February 1940 until it was forced to retreat on 9 June ahead of the German advance. Its official French designation at that time was Ambulance Chirurgical Légère de Corps d’Armée 282. The unit made its way across France via Bordeaux to Arcachon from where it was evacuated back to Britain, arriving at Plymouth on 26 June. The unit re-grouped and re-equipped in Britain before sailing on 20 March 1941 for the Middle East, landing at Suez on 2 May. Under the designation of HCM (Hôpital chirurgical mobile) 3 Ambulance Hadfield-Spears, it was attached to the Free French forces (1st Free French Division) in the Middle East, North Africa, Italy and France before being dissolved in Paris in June 1945 on the order of General Charles de Gaulle.
Origin and leadership.
Sponsor.
The unit was established during the Phoney War with £100,000 donated by Sir Robert Hadfield, the British steel tycoon. He had entrusted the money to his wife, Lady Frances Belt Hadfield, asking that she find a suitable good cause. Lady Hadfield, a francophile like her husband, spent most of the year at their villa at Cap Ferrat in the south of France. She explained to the French Consulate in London that 'the gift was the repayment of a debt she owed to France for the happiest years of her life'. In the First World War, this well-connected American from Philadelphia had been one of the first to start a Red Cross hospital for the treatment of wounded and sick servicemen. This hospital at Wimereux, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, was run entirely at her own expense. Lady Hadfield, CBE, died in London on 6 November 1949.
Mary 'May' Borden.
At the start of the Second World War, Lady Hadfield was 77 and no longer able to run a field hospital. Accordingly she turned to another American – her friend, the novelist Mary Borden, who was known to her friends and family as 'May'. The latter had, at her own expense, also set up a hospital for the French army in July 1915 (l'Hôpital Chirugical Mobile No 1); now she wanted to help during the new conflict. Mary had close ties with France – it was while her unit was on the Somme in 1916 that she met Captain Edward Louis Spears, a British liaison officer attached to the French army. He was subsequently promoted to a General Staff Officer 1st Grade, liaising between the French Ministry of War and the War Office in London. They were married in 1918 and living in Paris at the end of the war. Spears later became a Member of Parliament; his pro-French views in the Commons earning him the nickname of 'the Member for Paris'. They had a wide circle of influential friends, both British and French, whom they entertained at their London home during the inter-war period. Mary Borden (Mrs Spears) agreed to be in charge of the (largely British) female personnel – the nurses and drivers of Lady Hadfield's new field hospital with its 100 beds. Mary Spears was generally known as 'Madame la Générale' by the French – a reference to her husband's rank in the British army. The French military 'Service de Santé' agreed to provide the male staff for the medical unit, including doctors, orderlies and drivers for the unit's heavy trucks.
Active service in Lorraine.
The Hadfield-Spears unit was attached to the French 4th Army, which was commanded by Général Réquin, a former World War 1 comrade of General Spears. At St Jean le Bassel, they were billeted partly at a convent and partly in the village itself. Their predecessors had left the wards in poor condition and they spent two weeks getting the place into shape before moving patients to their new quarters.
There was little military activity in the sector – even when the Germans launched their attack on Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium on 10 May. The girls had a peaceful time in the French countryside, making sorties up to the front line at Sarreguemines, which had become a ghost town since its French inhabitants were evacuated nine months previously. Lady Hadfield travelled up from the south of France to visit her unit – Mary Spears would not see her again until the end of the war. On 20 May, the news came through that her husband had been promoted to Major General, although she did not then know that he had been appointed Churchill's personal representative to the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud.
On 28 May, they heard that the Belgian army was surrendering. General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and emphasised the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted her to come to Paris before he flew to London. She resisted – how could she leave her unit at a time like this? Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. They met at the British embassy. With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what what going to happen. The war leapt at me out of his eyes. I was terrified.' 
That evening a call came from her unit in Lorraine – they had received orders to move to another location the following day. She realised it had been most unwise to become separated from her girls. Then her driver reported that she had wrecked their car in the blackout. Fortunately, General Spears managed to procure another car with two French military drivers; Mary Spears and her MTC driver left the following morning. They arrived back at St Jean le Bassel just as the mobile hospital was about to move off.
Retreat.
Over the next 12 days, the unit made its way first west, and then southwest across France. Initially they kept in touch with the French 4th army, hoping to set up their hospital and carry out the humanitarian task which had brought them. But this was not to be. The pace of the French collapse quickened; they were never more than two nights in any one place. It was only at Châlons-sur-Marne that a party of six French orderlies and a French nurse was briefly detached to a hospital to help its overwhelmed medical staff. The roads were choked with refugees, petrol was hard to find and they went off the edge of their road maps. While queuing to refuel at the barracks in Gannat, between Moulins and Clermont-Ferrand, they heard that Marshal Philippe Pétain had asked the Germans for an armistice. 
The British military attaché in Bordeaux directed them to Arcachon where, at a villa outside the town, they met a British naval lieutenant, Ian Fleming, who arranged for them to be taken aboard HMS Galatea (71) for the short sea voyage to St Jean de Luz near the Spanish frontier. Here they were transhipped to a passenger vessel, the "Etric" ship of this name can be traced. It is likely that the liner was, in fact, the P&O vessel, "SS Ettrick". She was later designated a troop carrier. On 15 November 1942 she was torpedoed by German U155 whilst part of a convoy in the Gibraltar area and later sank. Most of her crew were rescued, but 18 naval ratings lost their lives. [http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Bedfordshire/BiggleswadeRollofHonour.html</ref> which already had on board a large number of British subjects (mainly well-to-do ladies and their staff) evacuated from their villas in France. Mary Spears and her party of 25 British nurses and MTC drivers docked in Plymouth on 26 June 1940 with nothing but their personal effects.
Re-grouping and re-equipping in Britain.
Mary Spears wished to continue with her work, and had the support of some of her original volunteer nurses and MTC drivers. However, Sir Robert Hadfield was dying at a country house near Epsom; Lady Hadfield was cut off at her villa in the south of France. There was accordingly no question of more help from the original sponsors but, through her contacts in America, she tapped into funds which had been donated in America by a charitable organisation known as the British War Relief Society, whose initial donation of £25,000 was enough for her to consider that their financial worries were over. The name of the new unit would remain unchanged, but its organisation and Anglo-French character would be identical to that of her two previous hospitals. These conditions – including the proviso that Mrs Spears would exercise complete control over the female personnel – were accepted in writing by General Charles de Gaulle, who was by now leading the Free French Forces from his headquarters in London.
The unit's next posting would be overseas and there would be a requirement for heavy trucks and 30 men who could not only drive but also act as orderlies. De Gaulle was unable to provide this manpower from his forces, but drivers were forthcoming from the American Field Service, and hospital orderlies from the Friends' Ambulance Unit in London – the latter all conscientious objectors. Vehicles, tents, beds, cookers and ward equipment were purchased from the War Office. The vehicles included 15 3-ton Bedford trucks, and the same number of 15-hundredweight trucks, as well as five Ford V8s to transport the nurses and officers. De Gaulle's, Free French had few medical officers and it took months to assemble a team of four doctors who would be led by Colonel Fruchaud. The Mechanised Transport Corps provided 12 drivers.
The equipment and vehicles left Cardiff by sea for Port Sudan at the beginning of February 1941. The personnel sailed on 23 March from Greenock on board the Orient Line liner "SS Otranto".
