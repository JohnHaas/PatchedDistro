Patrick Keane

Patrick Anthony Keane QC (born 26 October 1952 in Brisbane) is a Justice of the High Court of Australia and a former Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia.
Early life and education.
Patrick Anthony Keane was born to Patrick and Margaret Keane in a family of Irish descent and raised in Wilston, a middle-class, inner-city suburb north of Brisbane CBD, Queensland. The senior Patrick was an RAAF aviator who died from a heart attack when the younger Patrick was 7.
Keane was educated at Catholic schools St. Columba's Convent School and St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace in Brisbane, where he was the school captain and dux of 1969, winning an Open Scholarship in the Queensland Senior Public Examinations. After eliminating other vocations, he graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973, and a Bachelor of Laws with First-Class Honours and a University Medal in 1976.
During his studies, Keane worked as a law clerk at Roberts & Kane Solicitors and was headhunted by Feez Ruthning (now Allens Linklaters) by one of the partners.
Keane read for a Bachelor of Civil Law at Magdalen College of the University of Oxford and was awarded the Vinerian Scholarship, a scholarship given to the student that "gives the best performance in the examination for the Degree of Bachelor of Civil Law". Having earned a B.C.L. with First-Class Honours in 1977, he then returned to Australia.
Career.
Pre-judicial career.
Keane was admitted as a Solicitor and Barrister of the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1976 and went to the bar, as a Barrister of the Supreme Court of Queensland, in 1977. During 1978–1979, he was a part-time lecturer at the University of Queensland.
In 1988, after 11 years at the bar, Keane took silk.
In 1992, Keane was appointed Solicitor-General for the State of Queensland, a position he held under Labor and Coalition state governments until his appointment to the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland.
Keane published a number of articles and has been outspoken on the quality of legislative drafting. During 1990–1992, he was the Deputy Chairman of the Queensland Law Reform Commission. In 2011, he condemned the "volume and complexity of federal laws", telling the "Australian Financial Review" that "opening the tax act is like entering the door to a parallel universe".
Judicial career.
In 2005, Keane was appointed a Judge of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland, the highest court in that state.
On 10 February 2010, Commonwealth Attorney-General Robert McClelland announced that Keane would be appointed as the next Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia. Keane took up that role on 22 March 2010.
High Court career.
On 20 November 2012, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon announced that Keane had been appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia effective on the retirement of Dyson Heydon on 1 March 2013.

In 1974, aged 22, Keane married Shelley, with whom he has three sons and four grandchildren. His wife, Dr. Shelley Keane, is a psychologist. His son Patrick was born in Oxford in December 1976. His son David is a barrister.
The Australian reported that Keane is said to have been close to Prime Minister and fellow Queenslander Kevin Rudd and that Keane has been described by one unnamed Brisbane barrister as a "Labor man". Keane's appointment met with bipartisan approval: the Liberal Party's justice spokesperson, Senator George Brandis QC, described Keane's appointment as "the right decision" and Keane himself as a "very, very distinguished lawyer, both academically and professionally" with "a very illustrious reputation".
Keane is a supporter of the Brisbane Lions and the Carlton Blues AFL clubs and enjoys cricket, even having once considered playing the sport professionally.

Olaf Rude

Olaf Rude (1886–1957) was a Danish painter who was born in Estonia. As a child, he moved with his family to Frejlev on the island of Lolland. He is remembered in particular for his paintings of oak trees at Skejten on Lolland, two of which can be seen at Christiansborg.
In 1905, he studied at the Copenhagen Technical School and later at the Kunstnernes Frie Studieskole where he was taught by Zahrtmann and Johan Rohde. 
In 1911, he travelled to Paris where he was inspired especially by Paul Cézanne. On returning to Denmark, he became one of the classic modernists who around the time of the First World War focused on formal representation concentrating on form, line and colour. His work was exhibited at Grønningen's first exhibition in 1915. In 1919, he moved to Bornholm where he specialised in landscape painting and became a member of the Bornholm school of painters.
Rude was one of Denmark's most important modernists, sometimes called Denmark's Matisse for his use of colour in his expressive landscapes.

Electric Pandas

Electric Pandas were an Australian pop-rock band, fronted by vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Lin Buckfield, which formed in Sydney in 1983. Fellow founders were Warren Slater on bass guitar, Mark Stinson on drums and Tim Walter on guitar. Their first release was the single "Big Girls" in 1984 on Regular Records, which peaked into the Top 10 on the Sydney charts. It was followed up by an EP, "Let's Gamble". Electric Panda's only album "Point Blank" was released in September 1985, which peaked at No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. After Electric Pandas disbanded in 1987, Buckfield worked in television, eventually on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's "Four Corners" from 2000.
Biography.
Electric Pandas were formed in Sydney in 1983 and comprised Lin Buckfield on vocals and guitar, Tim 'Pretty Boy' Walter on guitar, Warren Slater on bass guitar and Mark 'Hips' Stinson on drums. Buckfield came up with the name as a reference to the English punk rock outfit Exotic Pandas. Buckfield had known that band whilst living in the United Kingdom during the late 1970s, and drew upon their sound to a degree in the Electric Pandas' early work.
The band were signed to the Regular Records label and their debut single, "Big Girls", written by Buckfield, was released in April 1984. The track was featured on commercial radio play lists and music commentator, Molly Meldrum, raved about Electric Pandas on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) pop music show "Countdown". "Big Girls" reached No. 8 in Sydney by May, and peaked at No. 18 on the Kent Music Report for Australian singles charts by mid-year. A relentless touring schedule led up to the release of Electric Pandas' debut EP, "Let's Gamble", in December, 1984. The EP peaked at No. 81 on national charts. Prior to entering the studio to record their debut album, the band underwent significant changes with an entirely new line-up consisting of Buckfield, Craig Wachholz (Dee Minor and the Dischords), Marcel Chaloupka (Smith, Moving Parts), and Phillip Campbell on drums. Campbell and Wachholz both finished off recording tracks for the album with producer Charles Fisher in Sydney. Prior to the album's release Buckfield issued a duet single, "R.O.C.K." / "Under My Thumb", with James Reyne (Australian Crawl) for the Freestyle label in April 1985, which peaked at No. 44 on the charts. The first single from the album, "Missing Me" was released in July, 1985 and reached No. 41 on the charts. In July 1985, Electric Pandas performed two of their hit songs, "Missing Me" and "Let's Gamble", for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program). It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.
Electric Pandas released their debut album, "Point Blank", in September 1985, which peaked at No. 22 on the Australian charts in November. "Italian Boys" was issued as the second single, but only reached No. 90. The line-up continued to change with Brad Holmes replacing Campbell, Neil McDonald replacing Chaloupka on bass guitar and the addition of Charlie Chan on keyboards expanding Electric Pandas to a quintet. 
The new line-up filmed videos, guest-hosted an episode of "Countdown", and toured Australia. However, they did not release any new material although they recorded an ad for Coca Cola in 1985. The jingle - concurrent with the "Coke is It!" campaign - was an English-language, rock-music remake of the Brazilian song "Águas de Março," and was used for TV spots and on RCA/Columbia Pictures/Hoyts videos such as "Ghostbusters".
Electric Pandas disbanded in April 1987. Buckfield and Wachholz, formed indie band F.O.O.D with former Dee Minor and the Dischords bass player Spole. F.O.O.D released a self-titled EP on Shock Records and then Buckfield and song writing partner Wachholz formed another band, Happy House. They recorded another Fisher-produced EP, "Passion", with the single "Whatuwannadothatfor" released which gained support from 2JJJ but did not achieve mainstream chart success. Buckfield and Wachholz continued their song writing partnership along with touring Happy House both around Australia and across the UK, Europe and North America. 
Buckfield became a current affairs researcher with Australia’s Nine Network, then a television reporter, eventually working on ABC-TV’s "Four Corners". She played in another band called MisChalin, and then in a Sydney band, Bully Girls, with Wachholz joining on guitar for live performances.
Wachholz went on to found Lets Go Surfing - Bondi Surf School and plays in reformed Dee Minor & The Dischords.
Electric Pandas' keyboard player Charlie Chan signed as an artist with Sony Classical.

Spanish destroyer José Luis Díez

She was named after Teniente de Navío José Luis Díez y Pérez Muñoz. 
Civil War.
The ship sailed into Biscay in 1936 and was anchored off Santurce for some time. She received the nickname "Pepe el del puerto" ("Joe of the harbor"), for her perceived inactivity.
On 20 April 1937, she was involved in a friendly fire incident when her anti-aircraft guns shot down Felipe del Río's Polikarpov I-15. The gunners mistook the aircraft for a German fighter.
On 31 May of the same year, the Police and the "Marina de Guerra Auxiliar de Euzkadi" took control of the "José Luis Díez" and the "Císcar". At the request of the Republican government, the ships embarked more than 200 sailors of the auxiliary Navy from Euzkadi to replace their original crews, who had been deemed untrustworthy. The ships were eventually returned to their original crews. 
On 10 June 1937, "Císcar", under the command of Alférez de Navío Juan Antonio Castro and "Jose Luis Díez" commanded by teniente de navío Evaristo Lopez engaged the cruiser "Cervera" (capitán de navío Manuel Moreu). The result was inconclusive.
"Jose Luis Díez" and "Ciscar" left Bilbao on 15 June 1937, heading for France. They were loaded with refugees and several civilian and military personalities, shortly before the Nationalists entered Bilbao. Both ships went on to Santander, and after its fall, to Gijon. The "Jose Luis Díez" then took refuge in Falmouth, England where, among others, the commander, the engine room chief and the navigator deserted. Subsequently, the destroyer sailed to Le Havre, France.
She then used her strong resemblance to a British destroyer as part of a ruse in an attempt to break the blockade of the Gibraltar Strait and return to the Mediterranean Sea in June 1938. During the trip, she sank two Nationalist-flagged trawlers. The ship was painted with the pennant number of HMS "Grenville" and used the Royal Navy flag, but she was intercepted by the heavy cruiser "Canarias" and other ships. After two frustrated attempts, she was badly hit and forced into Gibraltar on 29 August 1938, where she underwent repairs while looking for an opportunity to try again.
On the night of 29/30 December, she left Gibraltar prepared for a new attempt, but was spotted by the gunboat "Calvo Sotelo". A close-range battle ensued between the destroyer and several rebel ships, including the gunboat-minelayer "Vulcano". She was beached at Catalan Bay in Gibraltar to avoid being sunk or captured. The crew were returned to the Republican side by the British.
Post Civil War.
In March 1939 the British government, delivered the ship to the Nationalists. She was taken back by the gunboat "Calvo Sotelo". 
"José Luis Díez" was decommissioned and scrapped in 1965.

Pemberton Hall (Salisbury, Maryland)

Pemberton Hall is a historic home located at Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland, United States. It is a -story, three-bay, Flemish bond brick house with a gambrel roof. The construction date of "1741" is scratched in a brick above the side door. One of Isaac Handy's (d. 1763), builder of Pemberton Hall, five sons was George Handy (1756–1820), a charter member of the Society of the Cincinnati. During the American Civil War, the Hall was the home of Allison Parsons, a Southern sympathizer, who insisted on firing a cannon upon the receipt of news of each Confederate victory. In 1868, the Governor of Maryland, Elihu E. Jackson (1837–1907), purchased Pemberton Hall with James Cannon at a trustee's sale. Seth Taylor owned Pemberton Hall from 1931 to 1963, at which time the Pemberton Hall Foundation took it over and restored the house.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Gymnasium 9 (Simferopol)

The 9th Gymnasium (Simferopol) or officially Gymnasium No.9 of Simferopol municipality Autonomous Republic of Crimea () with the profound study of English was organized in 1990 on the basis of a school with a study of a range of subjects in English. It is a general educational institution of academic level, humanities- and linguistics-oriented; it is aimed at a more comprehensive development of the students' intellectual abilities. The school implements differential-individual approach to students.
History.
As such, the school was founded in 1917 and was at the time a private educational institution. It was owned by a married couple of teachers, the Zhirovs, and 20 pupils studied there. Due to certain difficulties, the school was obliged to change its location and move in 1935 to the building of the former gymnasium for girls. 
In 1934 the school appeared at the exhibition of experimental schools in Moscow, and received a favourable verdict. 
With the beginning of the Great Patriotic War of 1941–45 many of its teachers and students went to the front. The name of those who died have been immortalized on the commemorative plaque.
Present.
At present, some 770 pupils study in the school. English (profound study), German (second foreign language) and French (optional) are taught. In 2000, the tradition of organizing summer language camps was renewed. Camps like these had been organized in the 1970s on the basis of boarding houses on the southern coast of Crimea. Currently the work of the camps is overseen by native speakers (US Peace Corps volunteers). Students of the gymnasium regularly win I-IV levels of the all-Ukrainian pupil Olympiad in English (IV level - twice). They also make reports at the annual theoretical and practical conferences hosted by the Crimean Institute of Business.
Gymnasium 9 serves a basis for frequent conferences for foreign language teachers organized by the Crimean In-Service Teacher Training Institute (KRIPPO). Teachers of Gymnasium 9 offer demo lessons and workshops for their colleagues.
Since 1999 the Gymnasium has been cooperating with US Peace Corps in Ukraine (teachers Erica Martin in 200, Alison Stohr in 2007 and Adrianne Kleine in 2010).

Thomas Yamamoto

Thomas Yamamoto (August 20, 1917–2004) was an American artist.
Born in Alameda, California, Thomas Yamamoto majored in art at UC Berkeley. His instructors included John Haley and Erle Loran, who worked with Hans Hofmann. To some degree they influenced his future work. 
In the 1930s, Tom was active in the art scene of the San Francisco Bay area until the Pearl Harbor incident. He was interned first at the Assembly Center in San Francisco, and was later moved to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah. While there, he contributed work to the camp magazine, "Trek". He was released early due to the sponsorship of Takashi Ota, an artist who housed him in his West Village home in New York City. While in New York City, Tom and other Japanese American artists formed the anti-fascist group Japanese Americans for Democracy.
In 1947, Tom returned to San Francisco, where he met Jane Emily Pitkin, daughter of nationally recognized educator Royce Stanley "Tim" Pitkin who brought Goddard College to prominence as an innovative school in alternative education. Because of California's anti-miscegenation laws, Tom and Jane were married in New York City. They then traveled extensively, living at times in different countries, and Tom continually practiced his art. From 1960 to 1971 they lived in Marshfield, Vermont where they raised three children. While in Marshfield, Thomas taught art at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. 
After Vermont, they lived in Spain, American Samoa, and then 24 years in Honolulu, Hawaii before returning to central Vermont shortly before Tom's death in 2004.
In 1976, in honor of the American Bicentennial, the town of Marshfield commissioned Tom to do a series of paintings of historical Marshfield. These paintings are still (in 2010) on view in the town's offices in the Old Schoolhouse Commons.

Pennant (automobile)

The Pennant was an automobile make manufactured by the Barley Motor Car Co. in Kalamazoo, Michigan (1924–25), which also made the Roamer (1916–29) and the Barley automobiles (1922–24). The latter was intended as a less expensive companion car to the Roamer. After a reorganization the Roamer Motor Car Co. was to be incorporated at Toronto, Ontario, where it was headed by George P. Wigginton and would continue to manufacture the Pennant. A. C. Barley sold his interest in Roamer and the Kalamazoo factory remained the Barley Motor Car Co. and continued to manufacture the Barley. When it failed, the Pennant was phased in. It was basically a Barley with a Buda 4-cylinder engine and targeted at the taxicab market. Its main competitor was the Checker, also built in Kalamazoo. The Pennant trade dress was a maroon upper body and ivory lower body. Both the Barley and Pennant were out of production by 1925, and so A. C. Barley was out of the automobile business.

David P. Patterson

David P. Patterson (c.1840 – July 15, 1879) was president of the Hackensack and New York Extension Railroad (later the New Jersey and New York Railroad) in the late 19th century, and an instrumental figure in the development of Hillsdale, New Jersey, the terminus of the railroad when it reached there in 1870.
In 1860, a decade before the railroad began operating, Patterson purchased "a Demarest farm and 56 acres of land" in the area where it would pass through present-day Hillsdale.
An 1876 map of the hamlet (then a part the Township of Washington) lists Patterson as the owner of most plots in its center, though ultimately the development was not as successful as hoped.
In addition to arranging the sale of hundreds of parcels in the vicinity of the train station,
Patterson is said to have donated the land for Veteran's Memorial Park, the town's central common (1871), and the original location of the Hillsdale United Methodist Church (1876).
Patterson's lavish home (named "Brook Side Pines" by later owner John Riley) and its surrounding landscaped grounds, located on the north side of Hillsdale Avenue between Pascack Brook and Patterson Street, were the showplace of Hillsdale in their day. The home eventually became the convent for St. John the Baptist Church, and was destroyed in the early 2000s to make way for expansion of the St. John school.

Shadoran

The Shadoran Movement was intended to be a social and environmental movement based on a philosophy and ideals of simple living, local economies, and self-sufficiency created by convicted child sex offender, Scott Zirus.
Overview.
Those involved often call themselves Eco-warriors. The principle or slogan regularly used in debates is "I’m not only a tree hugger but an air breather just like you." (Scott Zirus - 2007)
Shadoranism was an idea-set, intended to be a movement created by West Australian, Scott Zirus. It incorporated numerous different ideals that thread through most cultures and religions, especially indigenous or tribal based societies. Zirus claims the system believes "that the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. The process of reversing this socialization is referred to in Shavox (the Shadoran conlang) as Rein Tavin (to re-introduce). This is a personal journey aimed at eventually living a lifestyle closer to the original hunter-gatherer lifestyle."
In blogs (since removed), he also posited notions of "love without boundaries" wherein it is allegedly possible to have equally loving and physical relationships regardless of gender, race or age. In posts, he gave examples of being possible to share relationships with "a 70 year old black man, a 35 year old white woman" to which an anonymous reader challenged that following that logic, one could also say it also applies to "a 7 year old boy". Zirus responded that whilst that wasn't within his personal interests, it would certainly be possible. The challenger to that post summarised the exchange between them by claiming that Zirus was simply trying to "justify your own sick interests".
Zirus's writing on Shadoranism also calmed : "Shadorans endeavor to create social change through non-violent terms and setting examples as they believe the only person whom you have any control over is yourself. They try to avoid genetically modified produce or those that contain artificial additives, colors, or flavorings. They believe that because these elements don’t belong to nature they shouldn’t enter their bodies. They live by the slogan ‘the wilderness is our future’
They abide by the rule that simpler is better, quality not quantity. They have no cultural concept of the value of money and believe that the ability to give is more important then the need to receive. They draw inspiration not only from tribal lifestyle, but from a booklet entitled Dair Shoron (The Introduction).
Shadoran at times is called "a way of life," or "way of thinking," and has little, if any, religious element. It’s considered a sub-culture because a member of the movement can remain belonging to a religion or culture.
Since Zirus's arrest (and subsequent sentencing for 40 years in a Texan jail) for charges relating to child molestation and possession of child pornography, his blogs have been removed. There is no evidence of Shadoranism being embraced by a community that goes beyond Zirus himself.
In the media.
On October 23, 2009 the movement leader, Scott Zirus, was arrested by the F.B.I. on accusations, from multiple parties, of molesting children in the United States.
On April 16, 2010, Scott Zirus entered a guilty plea in a Kerrville, Texas court. In a plea deal reached with prosecutors, Zirus agreed to a 40 year prison term with a non-parole period of twenty years.

Historical money of Tibet

The use of historical money in Tibet started in ancient times, when Tibet had no coined currency of its own. Bartering was common, gold was a medium of exchange, and shell money and stone beads were used for very small purchases. A few coins from other countries were also occasionally in use.
Coins were first used in a more extensive way in the 17th century: these were silver coins supplied by Nepal. There were however various difficulties with this system. In 1763/64 and 1785 the first silver coins were struck in Tibet. In 1792 the first mass-produced silver coins were created under joint Chinese and Tibetan authority. Coins bearing Tibetan inscriptions only were subsequently replaced by issues which had Chinese and Tibetan legends. This lasted until the 1830s. In 1840 purely Tibetan coinage was struck under Tibetan authority, and this coinage continued being made until 1954, with only two short interruptions when Sino-Tibetan coins were issued.
In 1910 the Tibetan Government started producing a large range of copper and silver coins of different denominations, and in 1918 to 1921, gold coins were struck. Tibetan banknotes were first issued in 1913. From 1955 to 1959 no more Tibetan coins were created, although banknotes were still being printed, and by 1959 all of the money was gradually being replaced with renminbi yuan (the official currency of the People's Republic of China).
Methods of exchange in ancient Tibet.
In ancient Tibet, the use of coins was insignificant. Tibet’s main neighbours, India, Nepal and China had had their own coinage since time immemorial. Ancient Tibet however had no locally-struck coinage, although a certain amount of coins from India, Nepal, Chinese Turkestan and China had reached Tibet by way of trade, or as donations to important monasteries. Some of these foreign coins may have entered circulation, but they did not develop into an important instrument for transactions in daily life, because most of the trade within Tibet and also the foreign trade were carried out via barter.
Bartering.
Tibet had the biggest trade volume with China, the main barter items being horses from north-eastern Tibet (Amdo), which were traded for Chinese tea. Tibet also exported medicinal herbs, stag antlers, musk and gold to China, and apart from tea, the Tibetan traders imported silk cloth, porcelain and silver from China.
The trade volume with Tibet's southern neighbours, India, Nepal and Bhutan, was much smaller. The Tibetan traders mainly exchanged salt and wool for grain (including rice) with these countries. Traditionally one measure of salt was traded for one measure of grain at the border with Nepal and India. Other, less important export goods were yak tails, musk and live animals (goats and sheep). For the 17th century, the export of falcons to India is also recorded.
For large transactions within Tibet, gold dust (probably tied up in small leather bags) and Chinese silver ingots were used. These ingots came in different shapes; the most common kind resembled horseshoes or donkey shoes, and were named "rta rmig ma" in Tibetan.
For small transactions, various consumer goods (which had about the same standard value among the majority of the Tibetans) could be used. Among others, these were areca nuts, tobacco, ceremonial scarves (khatas, also named "khadags"; Tibetan: "kha btags") and tea Tea was usually traded in the form of tea bricks (Tibetan: "ja sbag"). This developed into the most important medium of exchange in the 19th century, when a regular coinage had already been introduced into Tibet.
Shell money and stone bead money.
For very small purchases, cowries (small seashells which were mainly procured in the Maldive Islands and reached Tibet and China via Bengal) and stone beads are recorded as being in use as money in ancient Tibet
Gold currency before 1650.
Before the government of the 5th Dalai Lama was established various small gold ingots circulated in Tibet, some of which were marked with stamps. So far there exists no consent whether these pieces could be regarded as coins.
We are well informed about this type of gold currency, which was called "gold sho" (Tibetan: "gser sho") because officials of finance of the new Tibetan government received tax payments in the form of these small gold ingots. The officials had to convert these into the current monetary standard. In order to assess the fineness of these pieces one used a standardized gold weight unit, which was referred to as Sewa (Tibetan: "se ba") The following types of gold pieces are recorded in lists of the finance officials:
Furthermore pieces designated as Tsangsho (Tib.: "gtsang zho") are mentioned, but their gold weight is not specified.
Lastly a form of gold currency named Sertam (Tib.: "gser tam") is mentioned which had a gold weight of 2 sewas. Fifteen Sertam corresponded to one standard Changsho (Chagsho Tshema; Tibetan: "byang zho tshad ma"). The currency unit Gursho (Tibetan: mgur-zho) was already mentioned by Sarat Chandra Das in his Tibetan-English Dictionary. According to this author 1 Gursho = 24 sewas.
Silver Ingots.
Chinese silver ingots (sycee) were used until the 20th century for larger transactions. They were referred to as "rta rmig ma" ("horse hoof") and normally weighed 50 tael, or 50 srang (c. 185 grams). There existed also silver ingots of smaller size, named "gyag rmig ma" (yak hoof) and yet smaller ones, referred to as "ra rmig ma" (goat hoof). In the early 20th century the large ingots were worth about 60-70 Indian rupees, the ingots of medium size 12-14 rupees and the smallest ingots 2-3 rupees. Britisch-Indian authors occasionally refer to the silver bars found in Tibet, some of which were imported from Kashgar, as "yambus", an expression which derives from Chinese yuanbao.
Coinage.
Earliest coinage, 17th and 18th centuries.
The first coinage which was extensively used in southern Tibet was silver coins, which were supplied by the Nepalese Malla Kingdoms and the first kings of the subsequent Shah dynasty from about 1640 until 1791.
Tibet provided the silver for the striking of these coins and received coins at the same weight, the Nepalese reaping a handsome profit by alloying the pure silver with copper before the striking of the coins. Owing to a dispute between Nepal and Tibet regarding the fineness of the silver coins supplied by Nepal, the export of these coins was disrupted after the mid-eighteenth century.
In order to overcome the shortage of coins in Tibet at that time, the Tibetan Government started striking its own coins, modelled on Nepalese prototypes. This occurred in 1763-64 and again in 1785 without any interference by the Chinese government.
The Nepalese tried to carry on the very lucrative coin business during the Shah dynasty which had been established by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the Kathmandu Valley in 1768. First the Nepalese supplied mohars (silver coins which weighed about 5.4 grams) of good silver, but wanted these to circulate at the rate of one new mohar for two of the old adulterated silver coins struck by the Malla kings. This would have meant a tremendous loss for the Tibetan traders, and so the Tibetan Government did not accept these terms. 
The second Shah king, who ruled from Kathmandu, Pratap Singh Shah, supplied alloyed silver coins during the period 1775 until 1777. Thereafter, when the Nepalese again tried to introduce into Tibet coins of good silver, which should have circulated at a considerable premium compared with the Malla and Pratap Simha coins, the Tibetans refused which resulted into a disruption of trade between Nepal and Tibet. Tibet again experimented with its own coinage in 1785, in order to mitigate the shortage of silver coins.
End of the 18th century.
The Chinese took this opportunity to tighten their grip on Tibet, and issued an edict which among other dispositions stipulated the introduction of a new silver coinage, struck in the name of Emperor Qian Long. In the same time it was from now on forbidden to import silver coins from Nepal.
In order to solve temporarily the shortage of coins in Tibet when the Chinese army arrived in 1791, the Chinese had allowed the striking of the so-called "Kong-par tangkas" which were produced from alloyed silver and had a design copied from Nepalese prototypes. These tangkas which first were produced in the Kongpo province and later in Lhasa, were the first mass-produced silver coins of Tibet and had about the same weight as their Nepalese counterparts, i.e. about 5.2 grams.
From 1793 new coins made from almost pure silver were struck in Lhasa. These had both Tibetan and Chinese inscriptions. Meanwhile the striking of the Kong-par tangkas continued through the year 1792 and in early 1793. Both types of coins were authorised by the Chinese, and struck under joint Chinese and Tibetan supervision, but they were not part of the Chinese currency system, as silver coinage was unknown in China during the 18th and early 19th century (with the exception of Xinjiang province).
In 1791 it was originally planned by the Chinese authorities to cast copper cash coins in Tibet. Had this plan been carried out, the Tibetan coinage could have become part of the Chinese currency system. But this plan was abandoned because it was found to be too expensive to transport copper from China to Tibet in order to cast cash coinage in Lhasa.
Between 1791 and 1836 the Tibetan currency was largely decided on by the Chinese government in consultation with Tibetan authorities, and silver coins were struck to the sho (zho) standard (i.e. about 3.7 grams) in the 58th, 59th and 60th year of Qian Long (1793, 1794 and 1795).
A few silver coins were also struck in the 61st year of Qian Long (1796) who had abdicated towards the end of his 60th year in power. By the time the news of his abdication reached Lhasa, some silver coins of the 61st year had already been struck and released for circulation.
19th century.
Further Sino-Tibetan silver coins were struck in the first six years of the Jia Qing era (1796–1801), as well as during the 8th and 9th year (1803–04) and during the last two years of this reign, the 24th and 25th year (1819–20). During the Dao Guang era which followed, silver coins were struck only in the first four years of this era (1821–24) and in the 15th and 16th year (1835–36).
1840 to 1954, coinage of the Tibetan Government.
Thereafter Chinese influence weakened in Tibet, and from 1840 until 1954 the Tibetan Government made decisions about Tibet's coinage system with just one incidental interference by the Chinese; the coins of this period had only Tibetan inscriptions and designs, and made no reference whatsoever to China. and in later years of the 20th century they considerably increased in value. 
The Chinese authorities saw the popularity of the Indian rupees among Tibetan traders with misgivings and in 1902 started striking their own rupees which were close copies of the Indian Victoria rupees, the portrait of the Queen being replaced by that of a Chinese mandarin, or, as most numismatists believe, of the Chinese emperor Guang Xu. The Chinese rupees were struck in Chengdu and, starting in the 1930s also in Kangding, the former Tibeto-Chinese border town in western Sichuan. The first issues were of good silver and could gain a certain popularity among the Tibetans, but later issues, particularly the ones minted in Kangding, had a considerable amount of alloy, and were therefore not accepted by many traders.
In the early minting-period also a small amount of half and quarter rupees were struck in Chengdu. Since they often ended up as buttons or as parts of silver jewellery, their production was soon discontinued, and, when small change was needed, the whole rupees were cut in half or were quartered with the help of a sword and a hammer. The total mintage figure of the half rupees was 130,000 and that of the quarter rupees 120,000. It is estimated that between 25,500,000 and 27,500,000 Sichuan rupees were minted between 1902 and 1942.
Tibetan banknotes.
Tibetan banknotes were first issued in January 1913 with the denominations of 5 tam (green or blue) and 10 tam (red). These were dated to the year 1658 of the Tibetan Era (which began in AD 1912 and ended in early 1913).
Further issues followed later in AD 1913. All these notes are dated to the Tibetan Era year 1659, which began in February AD 1913. They are as follows: a 10 tam note (red), a 15 tam note (violet), a 25 tam note (brown or yellow), and a 50 tam note (blue or purple). Like the two earlier issues, they bear a red seal representing the authority of the Dalai Lama and a black seal which has the following inscription in 'phags pa ( also called "seal script") Tibetan script: "gzhung dngul khang," and can be translated as "government treasury" or "government bank".
The five tam notes continued to be printed, but the date on this notes was not changed, i.e. it remained T.E. (Tibetan Era) 1658. The early Tibetan notes were woodblock printed on locally-produced paper and were hand-numbered with black ink by specially trained Tibetan calligraphists. In the 1930s they were withdrawn from circulation. They bear the following inscription on the obverse:
The highest denomination note (50 tam) was often forged, and the Tibetan government decided to introduce a new multicoloured version printed in a more sophisticated manner. The legends on the obverse were printed from woodblocks, while the remaining design on both sides was machine-printed using several different metal blocks. The first notes of this new issue were dated T.E. 1672 (= AD 1926). New notes of this denomination were produced every year until T.E. 1687 (= AD 1941).
In 1937 or '38 new multicolored notes with the high denomination 100 tam srang were introduced. They bear the same octagonal red seal as the early "tam" denominated notes and a black seal of a new type which bears the following inscription: "Srid zhi dpal ´bar".
This legend refers to the Tibetan government mint. The following translations have been suggested: "Two famous Governments"; "The Glory of both (lay and religious) Governments´ houses" "May every form of being augment the good" and "Government, peace and progress." A freer translation would read: "A peaceful government (generates) prosperity".
The denomination of these notes was soon changed from "tam srang" to "srang" and they were given a smaller circular red seal. The 100 srang notes are machine-printed and hand-numbered; they were regularly issued between 1939 and 1945 and again between 1951 and 1959 but bear no date. Numerous notes of this denomination have survived and they are relatively common on the numismatic market.
Further machine-printed "srang" denominated notes followed. In 1940 saw the issue of "10 srang" notes bearing the date T.E. 1686. These were machine-printed in three colors (red, blue and black) and carried different T.E. dates until T.E. 1694 (= AD 1948). An undated "5 srang" note of small size was issued between 1942 and 1946. Finally, an undated "25 srang" note was introduced in 1950 and was issued until 1955. 
All the Tibetan srang-denominated banknotes were machine-printed on locally made paper at the government mint of Trabshi Lekhung using inks imported from India. All denominations are hand-numbered. 
In 1959 these issues were withdrawn from circulation and replaced by Chinese banknotes denominated in Renminbi Yuan.
The Tibetan mints.
Among the most important mints in the early 20th century were one known by the name 'dod dpal (las khung) located in Shol, below the Potala Palace, and one located about 10 kilometers north/northeast of Lhasa in the Dode valley ("dog bde" or "dog sde" valley)
Another important mint was located in Trabshi (4 kilometers north of Lhasa on the way to Sera monastery). This mint was modernized in the early 1930s, all the machinery of the other mints was subsequently transferred to this establishment, which was operated as the only Tibetan Government mint from 1932 onwards It had the official name Trabshi Lotrü Lekhung ("grwa bzhi glog ´khrul las khung", the "Trabshi electric machine factory"). Nowadays the huge compound of the former mint is occupied by one of Lhasa´s several prisons, known as "Trabshi Prison". 
Furthermore a mint named "gser khang" ("gold house"), located west of the Norbu Lingka, was in operation in the 1920s for the striking of gold and copper coins. A mint referred to as Mekyi (Tibetan "me kyid"; short for "me tog skyid po" meaning "enjoyable flowers") was located in the residence of the Chinese Amban and was perhaps used by the Chinese in 1910 to strike Sino-Tibetan coins. It was taken over by the Tibetan government after the forced departure of the last Amban in 1913, and coins were minted there between 1914 and the early 1930s. An establishment located south of the Kyichu (river) near Lhasa, known as Tip Arsenal, is occasionally mentioned as mint", but there is no evidence that coins were struck there. A small facory destined for the production of copper blanks existed in the Chumbi valley about half way between Yatung and the Tibeto-Sikkimese border; its name was Norbu Tsoki (Tibetan: " nor bu mthso dkyil") and it was operational between 1923 and 1928.
The coins of the 18th and 19th century were struck by hand and those of the early 20th century by locally built, water- or man-powered machines. From the 1920s coins were struck by machines imported from England and from British India, first on an experimental basis in 1928 and 1929, and then on a large scale from 1932 to 1938, and again from 1946 to 1954. The electric power for these machines was supplied by a hydroelectric power plant in the Dode valley which was set up between 1927 and 1928 with equipment which had been imported from England in 1924.
1955 to 1959.
After the Battle of Chamdo in 1950-51 the renewed interference of the Chinese resulted in a situation where no more coins were struck from 1955 and 1959. However, paper notes of 100 srang were still printed. 
In the early 1950s the Chinese restruck dollars with the portrait of Yuan Shikai in the Chengdu mint. These were introduced into Tibet to pay Tibetan workers involved in road building and to buy the goodwill of influential Tibetans. Many Yuan Shikai dollars were smuggled to India by Tibetan traders who bought western goods in Calcutta which they sold at considerable profits to Chinese Army members in Lhasa.
After 1959.
During the great exodus of Tibetans, by the middle of 1959, also the circulation of bank notes stopped, when the PRC introduced the mimang shogngul (= "people's paper money") currency into Tibet, eventually replacing the traditional Tibetan money.
Since 1959, mimang shogngul sgor () is used. One sgor is divided into 10 sgor-zur () or 100 skar ().
One sgor is called "gor gcig" () while one skar is called "skargang" ().
Tibetan texts are printed on banknotes but not on coins.
The dates on Tibetan coins.
Except for the Sino-Tibetan coins, the early undated tangkas of the 18th century, and the undated Ganden tangka issues, all Tibetan coins are inscribed with the cycle and the year in which they were struck. Each cycle comprises 60 years. The first year of the first cycle corresponds to the western year AD 1027. 
According to Tibetan tradition, the Kalachakra (dus kyi ‘khor lo) was introduced into Tibet from India in the year 1026. Therefore the dates found on Tibetan coins record the number of years which have elapsed since this historical event. In order to convert a cycle date of a Tibetan coin into a western date one can use the following formula: "(Number of cycles minus 1) times 60, plus number of years, plus 1026."
Example: rab byung 15 lo 43 means that 14 complete cycles plus 43 years of the 15th cycle have elapsed since the year 1026. This date can be converted as follows:
(15 – 1) × 60 + 43 + 1026 = AD 1909.
It is necessary to know that the Tibetan year usually starts some time in what is the month of February according to the calendar of the Western World. Therefore the coin of the above example cannot have been struck as early as January 1909, but may have been struck as late as January or early February 1910.
Tibetan currency units.
Tibet had a dual and therefore complicated system of currency units. One was imported from Nepal and its basic unit was the "tangka" (also called "trangka" "tam" or "tamga"; equivalent to about 5.4 to 5.6 grams of alloyed silver). The other was imported from China and its basic unit was the "srang" (Chinese liang, equivalent to 37.3 grams of silver). These two systems were used in Tibet concurrently from about 1640 until 1959.
The small units of ½ sho and ½ tangka were only struck for circulation in small numbers in 1793. There also exist some ½ sho coins dated Qian Long 59. These however are extremely rare, and most of them probably have to be considered as patterns or prototypes.
In the 20th century, the following units were struck:

Anibal dos Santos

Aníbal António "Anibalzinho" dos Santos Júnior (Aníbal dos Santos, born 1971 or 1972) is a Portuguese criminal convicted of masterminding the November 22, 2000, murder of Carlos Cardoso, a journalist investigating bank fraud in Mozambique's Central Bank (BCM). After a first trial "in absentia" in 2003, one failed and two successful escapes and two extraditions (from South Africa and Canada), dos Santos was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in January 2006. Dos Santos maintained his innocence throughout the trial. As of April, 2008, dos Santos remained in Mozambican custody and was investigated in another murder case, that of BCM lawyer Albano Silva.
December 7, 2008, dos Santos escaped from a maximum security Maputo jail for a third time. On the next day, the news media reported that dos Santos was arrested 36 hours after escape, but on December 10 a police spokesperson denied these reports, saying that dos Santos was still at large. After eight months at large, in August 2009 dos Santos was recaptured in South Africa.
Background.
In November 2000, white Mozambican Carlos Cardoso, 49, editor of the "Metical" daily newspaper specializing in investigating corruption, was investigating an alleged $14 million fraud at the Central Bank of Mozambique (BCM). On November 22, 2000, nearly 15 minutes after speaking to BBC reporters, he left his Maputo office in a car and was ambushed on the Avenue of the Martyrs by gunmen who blocked his escape routes with two cars. Later, trial judges adopted the version of events that dos Santos was driving the stolen ambush car that overtook Cardoso's Toyota and forced it to the curb; the shots were fired by another suspect. Witnesses said the shooters fired 10 shots, killing Cardoso and injuring his driver. The murder occurred two weeks after 26 people were killed in riots; Cardoso reported on the incident and was highly critical of both leading political parties' actions preceding the clashes. The murder and funeral of Cardoso "produced a rare show of unity among political opponents"; president Joaquim Chissano and opposition leaders vowed to solve the murder.
In May 2001 six men were charged with the murder. Initial reports stated that "a prominent businessman" and a bank manager were charged with contracting the murders and four men were charged with carrying out the murder. Later, Western media reported dos Santos was one of the four, the mastermind of the murder. Media reports of dos Santos' "normal" activities range from a petty car dealer to a car thief.
First escape.
August 31, 2002, dos Santos escaped from a jail in Maputo, despite specific warnings of an upcoming escape attempt reported to the Minister of the Interior. Unidentified police officers on the case said that "everything was done at the highest level to facilitate the escape and make a trial impossible". Dos Santos' lawyer expressed fears that dos Santos might already be dead and "there were reports of bloodstains in his client's cell". Actually, dos Santos escaped to South Africa on a false Swazi passport. Seven low-level prison guards were tried and acquitted in connection with the escape.
The whereabouts of dos Santos remained unknown until November 22, 2002.
First trial and extradition.
The trial against the five present suspects and the missing dos Santos began November 18, 2002. Court sessions were broadcast on national TV. Three of the suspects identified Nyimpine Chissano, son of the president, as the man behind the murder. Nyimpine Chissano appeared in court and refuted all allegations. Soon after the trial commenced, the mother of dos Santos announced that her son was safely living in London. She said dos Santos "was helped to flee to London in order to prevent him from testifying",; she also claimed that he was innocent and ready to return to Mozambique and testify if given security guarantees.
Dos Santos was arrested in Pretoria, South Africa, at the end of January 2003, one day before the scheduled pronouncement of court sentence in Maputo. South African authorities immediately announced that extradition would proceed "as early as weekend". The next day the court declared dos Santos guilty as the mastermind of the crime, and sentenced him to 28 years and six months. Other suspects received up to 23 years. No charges where ever brought against Chissano family members.
In the end of 2003 three of the convicts, but not dos Santos, were reported to be involved in court proceedings against the fraud at the Central Bank — the last case of Carlos Cardoso.
Second escape and extradition.
According to the Ministry of Interior statement, "On 9 May 2004 Anibal dos Santos Junior disappeared from his cell." Anonymous sources at the prison said that dos Santos was "actually taken out of the jail by accomplices". The escape occurred when the court was preparing to pronounce verdicts against 15 suspects involved in the 1996 bank fraud case.
In the middle of May Canadian authorities detained dos Santos at the Toronto Pearson International Airport. Mozambican authorities immediately requested extradition although Canada and Mozambique did not have an extradition treaty; international press organizations called on the Canadian government to "expedite return of dos Santos" too. Dos Santos applied for political asylum in Canada, stalling the extradition process for half a year. Authorities persuaded dos Santos to drop the request for asylum in exchange for a fair retrial in Mozambique, an option open to anyone sentenced in absentia to more than two years in jail. The Mozambique court confirmed the convict's right to retrial. On December 14, 2004, Canadian authorities approved extradition, and dos Santos finally departed for Mozambique on January 21, 2005, arriving in Maputo the next day. Reporters without borders and other press organizations celebrated the capture.
Second trial.
The second trial against dos Santos commenced December 1, 2005. Three days before the trial, dos Santos was caught preparing to make a third escape. The attempt was thwarted by a new guard, recently transferred to the jail.
Dos Santos immediately pleaded innocent and not guilty and said that his previous statements on the Cardoso case had been the result of manipulation by his former defence lawyer. Dos Santos exonerated Nyimpine Chissano from any association with the murder and identified the Satar family members, already convicted at the 2002-2003 trial, as his principal clients. The trial pronounced dos Santos guilty on all nine counts and increased the sentence to 30 years. 
Media reports commented that the trial did not solve many incident questions on the extent of dos Santos' connections in Mozambique politics and that dos Santos' decision not to appeal the sentence was an indicator of another jailbreak being planned. His court-appointed lawyer explained that his client feared that the appellate court could increase the jail term further.
2008 trial.
In April 2008 dos Santos was in court again, this time as a defendant for the murder of BCM lawyer Albano Silva. His statement to the court addressed the 2000 Cardoso murder; this time, contrary to his past statements, dos Santos directly pointed at Nyimpine Chissano (by then deceased) as the ultimate client. According to the new statements by dos Santos, Chissano initially contacted him on to hire a car; commentators expressed disbelief that such a petty business could grow into a murder contract. The alleged "recruiter" identified by dos Santos has also died, leaving nobody to denounce or corroborate his story. He also made a statement that the late Chissano protected him in Maputo prison: "I never escaped, I was taken out".
Dos Santos refuted all allegations of the Albano Silva case, despite objective evidence showing his regular communications with the other suspects in the case prior to the murder.
Third escape.
On December 7, 2008, dos Santos escaped from a maximum security Maputo prison for a third time, together with two other notable gangsters. The next day, the media reported that dos Santos was arrested 36 hours after escape. According to Reporters without borders, he was apprehended 75 kilometers from Maputo, on the road to the border with Swaziland. However, on December 10 a police spokesperson denounced these reports, saying that dos Santos was still at large. The opposition requested that the national parliament summon executive ministers for an explanation, but the proposal was turned down by majority vote. Police officials, again, expressed regret over the incident, while the right-wing "Zambese" newspaper hailed dos Santos as a hero defying incompetent police.
In a period of less than a week ending December 17, three high-ranking Maputo police officers were killed. Police chief Pinto said that the murders may be connected to the escapees, however, it was not clear which of the three escapees is considered most dangerous. Ministry of Interior General Zinocacossa has openly blamed police for the escape: "Anibalzinho was released by police commanders ... They, there in the police, they're mixed up with Anibalzinho, and now they want to involve me".
On December 30, 2008, the Mozambican Interior ministry dismissed top-ranking police commanders for their part in the December 7 escape. It was reported that the officials visited Anibalzinho on the day before the escape and did nothing about the hole in the corridor wall that was used by the fugitives. .
Recapture.
On August 26, 2009, the Mozambican authorities confirmed the recapture of Anibal dos Santos in South Africa.

1999 Virginia Tech Hokies football team

The 1999 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A college football during the 1999 season. Virginia Tech competed as a member of the Big East Conference. The Hokies were led by Frank Beamer in his thirteenth year as head coach. Virginia Tech finished the regular season undefeated but lost in the national championship game to the Florida State Seminoles.
Regular season.
Michael Vick led the Hokies to an 11–1 season and to the Bowl Championship Series national title game in the 2000 Nokia Sugar Bowl against Florida State. Although Virginia Tech lost 46–29, Vick was able to bring the team back from a 21-point deficit to take a 29-28 lead into the fourth quarter. During the season, Vick appeared on the cover of an "ESPN The Magazine" issue.
Vick led the NCAA in passing efficiency that year, setting a record for a freshman (180.4), which was also good enough for the third-highest all-time mark (Colt Brennan holds the record at 185.9 from his 2006 season at Hawaii). Vick was awarded an ESPY Award as the nation's top college player, and won the first-ever Archie Griffin Award as college football's most valuable player. He was invited to the 1999 Heisman Trophy presentation and finished third in the voting behind Ron Dayne and Joe Hamilton. Vick's third-place finish matched the highest finish ever by a freshman up to that point, first set by Herschel Walker in 1980 (Adrian Peterson later broke that mark, finishing second in 2004).

<doc id="20707803" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20707803" title="Alpha Repertory Television Service">
Alpha Repertory Television Service

Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) was a cable television channel in the United States. The channel was co-owned by Hearst Corporation and American Broadcasting Company through their Hearst/ABC Video Services joint venture.
History.
By the early 1980s, cable television had reached millions of viewers in the United States and was starting to draw significant audiences away from the "Big 3" broadcast television networks. All three networks saw opportunities to expand into cable television to protect and grow their audiences, and they all experimented with niche programming. In fact, all three traditional networks introduced arts-related channels within one year of each other.
Hearst/ABC's ARTS started broadcasting in 1981, airing highbrow cultural fare such as opera, ballet, classical symphonic performances, dramatic theater productions, and select foreign films. CBS Cable, which also began in 1981, was its most direct competitor, with similar "art house" programming and critical acclaim. (Bravo, NBC's The Entertainment Channel, and the Public Broadcasting Service were competitors as well). Many cable operators had limited channel bandwidth, so CBS Cable struggled to find space and an audience, eventually folding in late 1982. However, while ARTS fared no better in finding viewers, it shared channel space with Nickelodeon children's television, signing on at 9 p.m. Eastern Time for the evening hours. That shared channel arrangement was a perfect symbiotic scheduling match for the two networks given their respective audience demographics (ARTS's viewers either had no young children or had sent them to bed by the time the station signed on). ARTS had somewhat lower programming costs than CBS Cable, with less (and less costly) original programming. Prime time was normally the most valuable air time, but not for Nickelodeon — ARTS paid a very low rate to Nickelodeon for its three evening satellite transponder hours, plus a repeat at 9 p.m. Pacific Time (according to Hearst executive Raymond Joslin, ARTS paid Nickelodeon nothing for the first year, $1 million for the second, and $2 million for the third). Most cable operators that carried Nickelodeon also carried ARTS simply because the single channel feed was convenient. These factors combined to keep the channel on the air more than twice as long as CBS Cable.
Nonetheless, despite having a small but affluent audience ostensibly attractive to advertisers, Hearst/ABC could not turn a profit on ARTS (ARTS carried limited advertising per hour, typically low-key ads for luxury products and services. Often advertising slots went unfilled). The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) had a similar problem finding a sufficiently large audience for its "The Entertainment Channel," which premiered in 1982 and aired such expensive programming as BBC cultural imports and live broadcasts from Lincoln Center. The companies merged their respective channels in 1984 to form the Arts & Entertainment channel (A&E), with ABC exiting the partnership soon after. A&E took over the former ARTS timeslot before moving to its own dedicated channel in 1985, whereupon Nickelodeon expanded its programming schedule to fill the former ARTS/A&E hours with more teen-oriented programming and on July 1 of that year, it also added "Nick at Nite", a nighttime program block carrying reruns of older discontinued television series that continues to air on the channel this day.
A&E survives to this day as one of the most popular cable television channels, but its programming evolved to bear little or no resemblance to its progenitors'.

Al-Baghdadia TV

Al-Baghdadia TV is an independent Iraqi-owned Arabic-language satellite channel based in Cairo, Egypt. It is considered a Nationalistic channel of funding directly and only from the CEO. During the Iraqi insurgency, several prominent journalists with the station were murdered. More recently, the station became well known for journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi, who threw two of his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush during a press conference on December 14, 2008. It has journalists stations in every city and town in Iraq. Global TV Stations depend on Al Baghdadia for news coming from Iraq. It has a live morning show called 'Al Baghdadia Wa El Nas' which is a free show that allows Iraqis to give their opinion and to send a message to the government, this supports Iraqi democracy. The CEO of Al Baghdadia believes that democracy should be created by true Iraqis, not by force. The TV station is dubbed the name 'Umm al-Fuqarā' (The Mother of the Poor People).
History.
Management and programming.
Al-Baghdadia is a general entertainment channel that broadcasts in Arabic via a Hot Bird 8 at 13E satellite (Frequency: 12245, S/R:27500, Pol:Horizontal, Fec: 3/4), Arab Sat (Frequency: 12149, S/R 27500, Pol: Horizontal, Fec: 3/4) and Nilesat (Frequency: 11919, S/R: 27500, Pol: Horizontal, Fec: 5/6), the CEO and Managing Director of the station is Dr. Awn Hussain Al Khashlok (a Civil Engineer), Abdel-Hameed al-Sayeh is the station's manager, in Cairo. The Newseum said, "The station is often critical of the new Iraqi government and of the U.S. presence in Iraq." Dr. Hussein Shaaban, the previous director general of Al Baghdadia, has described the U.S. occupation as “humiliating to Iraq”.
Journalists murdered.
In a round of killings targeting journalists during the Iraqi insurgency that shocked the country, Al-Baghdadia suffered through several casualties of some of its most well-known contributors. On 16 January 2006, cameraman Luaay Salam Radeef was murdered. In April 2006, So'oud Muzahim al-Shoumari, an Al-Baghdadia correspondent, was found dead in Baghdad's southern district of Doura, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). On 5 May 2006, human rights correspondent So’oud Mukahim Al-Shoumari, who was also known by the last name Al-Hadithi, was abducted, tortured and shot dead in Baghdad. 
A line producer for the channel, Jawad Al-Daami, was murdered in Baghdad on 24 September 2007. Al-Daami, a very well known poet, worked on cultural and social programs for Al-Baghdadia until he was found shot in the head in Al-Qadissiya, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad.
Muntadhar al-Zaidi and shoeing of Bush.
In September 2005, Muntadhar al-Zaidi joined the station. On 16 November 2007, al-Zaidi was kidnapped in Baghdad working on assignment for Al-Baghdadia, but released on November 19, without harm or ransom payments. The studio gained international attention when al-Zaidi hurled two of his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush during a press conference in Baghdad on 14 December 2008. Dhirgham al-Zaidi, who sometimes worked as his brother's cameraman, said Muntadhar's reporting for the station was "against the occupation," and that at times he signed off "from occupied Baghdad." Dihirgham said the reporter's stories focused on Iraqi widows, orphans, and children.
After he was jailed, the station issued a statement demanding al-Zaidi's release. Canada's Globe & Mail chastised the channel in an editorial, stating, "To its shame, Al Baghdadia has not only failed to apologize, or to discipline or fire Mr. Zaidi, who is being held in an Iraqi jail over the attempted assault, but instead posted his photo on its website and attacked the government for holding him." The network appointed Dheyaa al-Saadi, president of the Union of Lawyers in Iraq, to defend Zaidi.

La France au travail

La France au Travail ("France at Work") was a pro-German French newspaper which appeared from 30 June 1940 onwards funded by the German embassy in France. It was started as a propaganda initiative in the aftermath of the German occupation to influence left-leaning segments of French public opinion. The Director, Jean Drault, was a French anti-Semite while its editor, Georges Oltramare, was a pro-Nazi Swiss journalist who broadcast on French radio. The extent of German control is evident in that editorial meetings were held directly in the German embassy on the rue de Lille. In style and content, the newspaper mirrored the Communist newspaper "L'Humanité" except for virulent anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic positions. The newspaper was fairly successful with sales of 92,000 in the first weeks rising to 180,000 by August 1940. Exposure by the clandestine Communist press as well as mainstream French newspapers, however, ensured a steady, and then permanent, decline.

Midtown Woodward Historic District

The Midtown Woodward Historic District is a historic district located along Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Structures in the district are located between 2951 and 3424 Woodward Avenue, and include structures on the corner of Charlotte Street (14 Charlotte Street) and Peterboro Street (10 and 25 Peterboro Street). The district was admitted to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
Structures.
The district spans two blocks along Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit. Significant structures in the district include a number of architect-designed buildings. Some of these are:
Addison Hotel.
The Addison Hotel, currently known as the Addison Apartments, is located at 14 Charlotte. The structure, designed by Albert Kahn, was built in 1905 and originally featured 50 luxury apartments. The structure is currently being restored to feature 40 apartments.
Fine Arts Theatre.
The Fine Arts Theatre is located at 2952 Woodward. The theatre, with 582 seats, was designed by C. Howard Crane. It opened in 1914 as the Addison, and closed in 1980.
Crystal Ballroom.
The Crystal Ballroom is located at 3100 Woodward; the building is currently known as the Crystal Lofts and the current ground-floor tenant is Zacarro's Market. The ballroom was built in 1919. The facade of the original building was altered (likely in 1936 when Woodward Avenue was widened) to add the Art Deco elements apparent on the front. In 2005, the building was redeveloped with retail space on the ground floor and 16 residential units above on the second floor.
Kahn Print Shop.
Albert Kahn designed this structure at 3408-3414 Woodward Avenue in 1912; it was built in 1919 as a print shop. After sitting vacant for decades, it has been redeveloped into retail space.
Bonstelle Theatre.
Wayne State University's Bonstelle Theatre is located at 3424 Woodward at the north end of the district; it was origally the Temple Beth El. At the turn of the 20th century, Rabbi Leo M. Franklin of Detroit's Temple Beth El led the push for the construction of a new temple building. He hired architect Albert Kahn, a member of the congregation, to design the building. Groundbreaking began on November 25, 1901, with the ceremonial cornerstone laid on April 23, 1902. The first services were held in the chapel on January 24, 1903, and the formal dedication was held on September 18–19 of the same year.

Billy Deans (diver)

"Captain" Billy Deans is a pioneering wreck and technical diver. Although "Captain" is the nickname which is universally applied to Billy Deans, he is in fact a US Coast Guard-rated captain up to 100 tons.
Billy Deans is a former member of the board of directors of International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). He was a technical diving instructor for the US Government. In addition to teaching diving to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, he also taught Special forces divers for the United States Army and the United States Navy. He is also a Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) and National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) recreational diving instructor.
In Kevin McMurray's book, "Deep Descent", Billy Deans is described as "the world's best diver".
Billy Deans was one of the early pioneers in relation to the use of trimix for deep diving. During the exploration of U-869 chronicled in the best selling book, "Shadow Divers", John Chatterton and Richie Kohler sought instruction from Billy Deans in the use of trimix (which had, until then, largely been restricted to cave exploration diving in Florida). These presaged a number of North Eastern wreck divers to seek trimix training from Billy Deans, leading to its popularity as a deep diving breathing gas.
Billy Deans has been involved in a number of high profile shipwreck expeditions over the years, including Gary Gentile's expedition to the "USS Monitor", various exploration dives on the "SS Andrea Doria", the "USS Wilkes-Barre" and U-2513. In late 1993, Billy Deans served as Dive Operations Officer for an expedition recovering treasure and artifacts from a Spanish brigantine which sank in the Gulf of Mexico off New Orleans.
Billy Deans ran a dive shop (known as Key West Diver) in Key West, FL for many years prior to retiring from diving in 1998.
He qualified as an ICU nurse.

Sasson Somekh

Sasson Somekh (; Arabic:ساسون سوميخ; born 1933) is an Israeli academic and writer. He is professor emeritus of Modern Arab Literature at Tel Aviv University.
Biography.
Sasson Somekh was born in Baghdad to a secular Jewish family. In 1951, Somekh and his family immigrated to Israel in the wake of growing pressures on the Jews of Iraq to leave the country. He did not know Hebrew at the time, but started learning it in earnest in order to achieve his goal of becoming a translator of Arabic poetry into Hebrew. His first translation was published in 1954 in "Ner", a journal published by Ihud ("Unity"), an association dedicated to the advancement of Arab–Jewish reconciliation established by Judah Magnes.
Academic career.
Somekh earned a Bachelor's degree in Hebrew Language and History from Tel Aviv University, and a Master's degree in Linguistics of Semitic languages at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1962–1965, Somekh served as scientific secretary of the Academy of the Hebrew Language. He did his doctorate at Oxford University in 1966–1968. His subject was the novels of Naguib Mahfouz, concentrating on the Cairo Trilogy. Over the years Mahfouz and Somekh became friends. The thesis supervisor was Egyptian scholar Mustafa Badawi. Upon his return to Israel he became a lecturer in Arabic Literature. He served as chairman of the Arabic Language and Literature department at Tel Aviv University in 1972–1984. In 1980, he became a full professor. Between 1982 and 2003, he held the Helmos Chair for Arabic Literature. In 1996–1998 he was head of the Israel Academic Center in Cairo. He was a visiting professor at Princeton University, St Antony's College, Oxford, Annenberg Research Institute, NYU and Uppsala University. In 2004, he received an honorary doctorate from Ben Gurion University.
He is among the founders of the Arabic Language Academy in Israel, established in December 2007 in collaboration with several former students.
He wrote 10 books, many translations from Arabic to Hebrew, among which are 4 anthologies of modern Arabic poetry, and about 90 articles in academic journals. Over the past 50 years Somekh published hundreds of articles in literary magazines and supplements such as Iton 77, Halikon and Moznayim. His articles deal mainly with modern Arabic literature and writers, connections between Arabic and Hebrew literature and the Cairo Geniza. He is a regular contributor to Haaretz newspaper.
Awards.
In 2005, Somekh was awarded the Israel Prize, for Middle Eastern studies.
"Baghdad Yesterday".
At the age of 70, Somekh wrote the first volume of his autobiography, "Baghdad, Yesterday: The Making of an Arab Jew". The book was published in Hebrew and has been translated into Arabic, English and Turkish. In the book he describes his life as a Jewish child and teenager in Baghdad during the first 17 years of his life. He speaks of being a secular Jewish child from a secular Jewish home. He shows that the educated middle class that achieved prominence in the 1930s and 40s was the main influence on the norms of life in the Jewish community. Also, he shows that the Jews of Iraq enjoyed neighborly relations with their Muslim neighbors. Perhaps not ideal relations, but mutual respect between neighbors.
The second volume, "Yamim Hazuyim" ("Call it Dreaming") was published in 2008. It describes his life between Tel Aviv, Oxford, Princeton, and Cairo between 1951 and 2000. The book moves between the four major stations of his life: Tel Aviv - where he lived and worked for 40 years as a professor of Arabic literature, Oxford - where he received his PhD, Princeton - where he was occasionally a visiting professor in the 1970s and 80s, and Cairo - the city he did much literary research in, and where he was the head of the Israel Academic Center.

He was an acting head coach and after his first game away the team won. The team started to revive and was able to avoid relegation. According to own admission Zayaev started to work as a coach since 1973 as he stashed a great deal of knowledge.
During Soviet times Zayaev won the Ukrainian championship on several occasions, the Cup of the Ukrainian SSR, the Ukrainian Spartakiad, led teams to the top of the Soviet First League and semifinals of the Soviet Cup. Until the 1990s he worked for SC Tavriya Simferopol as the team director. In 1992 he became famous by obtaining the national title when SC Tavriya Simferopol beat FC Dynamo Kyiv in Lviv. After 1995 Zayaev once again became not needed.

Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof

Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station in the city of Halle in southern part of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The station is situated east of the city centre and is a category 2 station.
Importance.
The station is one of the most important transport hubs in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is a stop for long-distance and regional services. In addition, it is part of the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn network and is served by the trams and buses that are part of the city's public transport.
History.
In mid-1840 the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway – initiated by city councillor, Matthäus Ludwig Wucherer, who supported the building of a railway from Magdeburg to Leipzig via Halle – built the first station in Halle, which was subsequently (1845 to 1847) rebuilt again to form a junction with the Thuringian Railway. The unusual feature of the route between Magdeburg and Leipzig was that it was the first cross-border railway link (from Prussia through Anhalt-Köthen to Saxony).
As further routes were added the station soon became too small, but could not be expanded because the various railway companies could not agree an overall concept. Not until 8 October 1890, after the nationalisation of one company and a five-year construction period could the new passenger station be opened. The station hall was largely destroyed during the Second World War and the wooden platform roofing replaced after the war with steel coverings.
In 1967 the S-Bahn was opened and hence a new platform added on the western side. In 1967/68 the station hall was clad by corrugated aluminium sheeting which matched the architecture and ideology of the time, and gave the station a typical modern, socialist appearance. As early as 1984 this covering was removed again however and the dilapidated domed roof was renovated. In 2002 the station, like many others in German cities, was comprehensively refurbished, rebuilt and provided with a range of shops.
In about 2016 the station will be linked to the planned, new Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway. By 2008 the southern approach had been rebuilt over a length of 5 kilometres and now runs under the new Saale-Elster viaduct (to which a connection is being built) towards Erfurt.
Layout.
Halle is an 'island station', i.e. it is located between the main sets of tracks. It has 13 platforms, of which 10 are covered by the station hall. The actual station building is located in the middle between tracks 6 and 7. In the station halls are small shops and restaurants/cafes.
Train services.
The following services currently call at the station:
Long-distance services.
The station is on the intersection of railway links from Berlin to Erfurt and Dresden to Magdeburg. InterCity (IC) and Intercity-Express (ICE) trains stop at the station as do several night train services of the (DB City Night Line (CNL)). Traffic for Erfurt will in future be routed south of Halle on the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway; long-distance trains to Leipzig already use the completed section of this line. The Berlin–Halle railway will be removed by 2006.
Local services.
Halle is linked to the surrounding area with local services on the RB, RE und S-Bahn lines as well as other cities such as Kassel or Eisenach.
Internal city transport links.
The station is accessible from several major roads. A fast road ("An der Magistrale") links the Hauptbahnhof to the west of the city (Neustadt, Nietleben and Dölau districts) and the B 80 links it to the western outskirts of Halle (Halleschen Vorland (West)).
The public transport system is provided by "HAVAG". Tram routes 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 18, and bus routes 30 and 43 all stop at the station, as do OBS buses.
Goods traffic.
The Halle (Saale) marshalling yard on both sides of the tracks to the east next to the passenger station was formerly important, but is largely closed today. A modern marshalling yard is planned to be built on the same site however.

Iran–Serbia relations

Iran–Serbia relations are diplomatic relations between Iran and Serbia. Iran has an embassy in Belgrade and Serbia has an embassy in Tehran.
History.
Iranian theory of the historic origin of Serbs.
Historians have stated that it is remotely possible that Serbs historically originated from the early Persian tribes in the Caucasus. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that the same theory may be a reliable explanation for the origin of Croats, who have historically lived in very close proximity of Serbs.
Relations.
Iran Air's refueling hub in Belgrade.
From March to June 2011, Iran Air made scheduled landings in Belgrade for fueling aircraft which had been denied kerosene in airports in the European Union. After 18 June 2011, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport revoked landing rights for Iran Air, citing pressure from the United States.
NAM relationship.
In September 2011, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Iran, Mohammed Akondzadeh, visited Serbia during the annual NAM council held in Belgrade that year, and claimed that Iran doesn't recognize Kosovo as a sovereign nation, and that he hoped friendly relations between Serbia and Iran would progress further. Less than a year later, Ivan Mrkić traveled to Tehran to represent Serbia at the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. It was reported on 31 August 2012 that Mrkić addressed the summit participants that Serbia wishes to remain engaged with NAM member states while devoting to accession to the EU.
Conflicting EU interest.
Serbia, despite having been severely sanctioned and isolated by the west for eight years during the existence of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, reportedly put sanctions on Iran as apart of EU accession procedure, according to local media in November 2012. The announcement of sanctions met very harsh criticism among Serbian media and political writers and reflected a divide between the actions of the Serbian government and the opinions of Serbian citizens. Professor Predrag Simić of the UB Faculty of Political Science said in an interview with "S Media" that Iran seemed to be tolerant of the Serbian government's accession into the EU, and inferred that it was possible that relations with Iran would not be as damaged as they are with other western nation's despite Serbia's sanctions. In 2013, Serbia's ambassador in Tehran Aleksandar Tasić met with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; the meeting was cited by Mohammad Reza Rahimi in a note of congratulations to Serbia's state holiday on February 15, in which it was stated that there are "no impediments" to further relations between Tehran and Belgrade.
Culture.
Along with the Iranian embassy, there is also an Iranian cultural center located in Belgrade. An Iranian film festival is held annually at the Filmography Museum in Belgrade.

George Knott

George Charles Henry Knott (19 August 1910 - 22 March 2001) is a former Mayor and councillor from 1963–1964 of the City of Collingwood.
Knott enjoyed track and field athletics as a young man and joined his beloved Collingwood Harriers Athletic Club which had been founded in 1926. Knott excelled at walking events and over the years won a number of Victorian and Australian championships. In 1948 there was a large amount of debate over the inclusion of Knott in the 1948 Olympic Games team for Australia. Knott had set an Australian 10,000 metres walk record at the Melbourne Showgrounds.
Knott encountered difficulties with his walking technique whilst in England prior to the 1948 London Olympics. Knott was disqualified in his walking events at the British AAA's Championships and also at Birmingham. This necessitated Knott correcting his style, which left him well behind in his Games heat. During the London Olympic Games, Knott finished last in his heat of the 10,000 metres walk.
After Knott finished his competitive career he became a dedicated and hardworking official, not only for his club Collingwood but also for the State body, the Victorian Amateur Athletic Association. On 5 October 1986, Knott was honoured with the Victorian Athletic Association's highest honour, Life Membership.
Further honours came Knott's way when the athletic facility in Heidelberg Road, home to the Collingwood Harriers Athletic Club and the Collingwood Little Athletics Centre was named after George Knott.
As a prominent Collingwood businessman, Knott served as a Collingwood City Councillor and as a Collingwood Mayor from 1963–1964. Knott was the publican of the Yorkshire Stingo Hotel in Hoddle Street for many years.
George Knott died aged 90 years and 7 months in March 2001.

Saint Grwst

Saint Grwst "the Confessor" (also known as "Gwrwst", "Gwrst", "Gorwst" or "Gorst" "ap Gwaith Hengaer") was a 6th and 7th century saint operating in the Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd.
Family.
Grwst was the son of Gwaith Hengaer ap Elffin, a Prince of Rheged, thought to be centred on modern day Cumbria, and Euronwy ferch Clydno Eiddin, a Princess of "Din Eiddin" (Edinburgh) in Lothian, making him the great-grandson of King Urien Rheged.
Hagiographic life.
He may have arrived in Wales in the "c."540s at the instigation of King Maelgwn Gwynedd, who granted charters for Christian missionaries, like Grwst, Kentigern and Trillo to set up their individual cells across his kingdom, where he earned the honoured title of "Grwst yr Cyfaddefiadwr" (Grwst "the Confessor"). He is said to have witnessed a grant by Maelgwn Gwynedd to St Kentigern, where his signature ""Sanctus Gwrwst"" lies alongside those of Saints Deiniol and Trillo. However, these dates and events are a little at odds with the genealogies ("Iolo Morganwg" Welsh MSS. 529), which would put Grwst's generation in the early 7th century, in the "c."600s to 630s.
Veneration.
The site of Grwst’s original cell or "Llan" is now occupied by the Seion Methodist Chapel, with the nearby Cae Llan housing estate the location of the first church dedicated to him by the 11th century. An annual fair was held on these grounds during the 16th century to celebrate the saint’s feast day, with the area known as "Gwgrwstw" after him.
He was the reputed founder of Llanrwst and his festival, known as "Gwyl Rwst", is held on 1 December.

BL 4 inch Mk IX naval gun

The BL 4-inch gun Mk IX was a British medium-velocity naval gun introduced in 1916 as secondary armament on the "Renown"-class battlecruisers and "Glorious"-class "large light cruisers", but which served most notably as the main armament on Flower-class corvettes throughout World War II.
History.
World War I.
The gun was based on the barrel of the QF 4 inch Mk V and the breech mechanism of the BL 4 inch Mk VIII and was first introduced in World War I on capital ships as secondary armament in triple-gun mountings, intended to provide rapid concentrated fire. This turned out to be unworkable in practice : Jane's Fighting Ships of 1919 commented : "4-inch triples are clumsy and not liked. They are not mounted in one sleeve ; have separate breech mechanism : gun crew of 23 to each triple". Guns were thereafter used in single-gun mountings, typically on smaller ships as primary armament.
World War II.
In World War II the gun was employed on many small warships such as Flower-class corvettes and minesweepers, primarily for action against surfaced submarines.
This was the last BL 4 inch gun in British service: all subsequent guns have used charges in metal cartridges "QF". It was succeeded on new small warships built in World War II by the QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun which fired a slightly heavier shell at much lower velocity.

Her special skills include aerial acrobatics such as swinging trapeze, aerial silk and aerial hoop. She also performs a hand-to-hand acrobatic act with her Russian partner, Viatcheslav Volkov (born 9 February 1976 in Yaroslavl), a former World Champion of Sport Acrobatics.
Career.
Pauliina Räsänen started ballet, painting and gymnastics at a very young age. However, her interests lay more in arts than in competition. She enrolled in the Performing Arts High School of Tampere pursuing her acting, improvisation, and speech. After high school she was accepted into the National Circus School of Montreal, where she trained under their performing arts coaches. Pauliina graduated with a difficult routine of swinging trapeze including an original skill, in which she intentionally dislocates her shoulders while executing a salto around the bar. Cirque du Soleil signed her up as their first Scadinavian artist, to perform in their production "Alegría". She toured with Cirque du Soleil for 5 years until she decided to leave in pursuit of other goals.
While in Cirque du Soleil, Pauliina met her future partner Viatcheslav (Slava) Volkov from Russia. The couple found they shared similar visions in personal life as well as in acrobatics. Together they created a hand-to-hand acrobatic act combining elements of dance, acting, and high-level acrobatics. Their performance music is composed by French accordionist Corinne Kuzma. At the moment the couple lives in Kustavi, a small city in the Southern Archipelago of Finland, and regularly performs in European theaters.
Räsänen and Volkov are currently filming a feature film, "Circus Fantasticus" for Staragara production. Pauliina was also awarded a 5-year grant from the Finnish Central Commission of Arts to continue her artistic goals in Finland.
ArtTeatro.
Räsänen and Volkov own their own Finland-based circus arts company and agency, ArtTeatro Ltd.

Alexander Mack (c. 27 July 1679 – 19 January 1735) was the leader and first minister of the Schwarzenau Brethren (or German Baptists) in the Schwarzenau, Wittgenstein community of modern-day Bad Berleburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Mack founded the Brethren along with seven other Radical Pietists in Schwarzenau in 1708. Mack and the rest of the early Brethren emigrated to the United States in the mid-18th century, where he continued to minister to the Brethren community until his death.
Early life and founding of the Brethren.
Mack was born in Schriesheim, Palatinate in contemporary Baden-Württemberg, Germany, where he worked as a miller. He was born the third son to miller Johann Phillip Mack and his wife Christina Fillbrun Mack and baptized into the local Reformed church on 27 July 1679. The Macks remained in Schriesheim throughout the Nine Years' War, intermittently seeking refuge in the hill country due to violence. Upon finishing his studies, Mack took over the family mill and married socialite Anna Margarethe Kling on 18 January 1701. By 1705, the Macks became moved by the Pietist movement locally led by Ernst Christoph Hochmann von Hochnau and started to host an illegal Bible study and prayer group at their home.
In the early 1700s, Graf (Count) Henrich Albrecht Sayn-Wittgenstein provided refuge to religious dissenters from other German states and elsewhere. Many were settled around the small village of Schwarzenau, including Mack and his followers. The era of toleration for radical Pietism lasted only until ~1740, but had few precedents at the time and was denounced by the rulers of most other German states. Schwarzenau is now part of the town of Bad Berleburg in the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein in the state of Nord Rhein Westfalen. The school (now closed) in Schwarzenau was named in honor of Alexander Mack.
The initial group that became known as the Schwarzenau Brethren were inaugurated by Mack as a Bible study with four other men and three women. In 1708—having become convinced of the necessity of Believer's baptism—the group decided to baptize themselves, using a lottery system to choose who would baptize one another in the Eder.
Emigration to the United States.
Mack and several other Brethren emigrated to East Friesland due to pressure within the interfaith community in Schwarzenau in 1720. They stayed until 1729, when the impoverished community found it impossible to sustain itself. In 1719, a different Brethren group led by Peter Becker had already emigrated to Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States for religious freedom. Mack and his followers sailed for Germantown to establish a community in the New World.
Teachings and writings.
Prior to the formation of any strict doctrine, the Schwarzenau Brethren espoused several fundamental tenets that would define the Brethren movement, including a rejection of any coercion in religion (such as infant baptism), viewing Christian rites and ordinances as a means of grace, and the New Testament as the only creed and Rule of Faith. Mack was a Universalist and strict pacifist.

Chitteri

Chitteri Hills (654.52 km²) are one of the segments of Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, within the geographical limit of 78°15’−78°45’E longitude and 11°44’−12°08’N latitude. The hill harbour various vegetation types such as the evergreen, the semi-evergreen, the riparian, the dry mixed deciduous, the dry deciduous scrub and the southern thorn scrub forests (Champion and Seth, 1968). The minimum and maximum temperature of the area is 19 °C (in winter) and 40 °C (in summer) respectively. The annual rainfall varies from 620 to 900 mm and it received both northeast and southwest monsoons. The hills form a compact block consisting of several hill ranges, and contain tangled ridges and ravines running in the northeast and southwest directions, enclosing many narrow valleys (rivers), viz. Kallar, Varattar, Kambalai and Anaimaduvu. Topographically, the area is undulating with an altitude varying from 240 to 1266 m. The rocks on Chitteri hills are chiefly gneisses/granitic in composition. Soil is generally shallow and reddish-loam, varying in fertility and often mixed with gravel and boulders. Black soils are seldom found in the forests.
On 13 September 2011 at least 10 people have been reported killed and more than 70 injured when a passenger train from Chennai rammed into a stationary train near chitteri railway station close to Arakkonam, about 75 km from here, late on Tuesday night.

Seaview Services

Seaview Services is a coach and tour operator operating on the Isle of Wight.
History.
In 1922 Richard Newell commenced operating a bus service between Seaview and Ryde. By the end of the 1920s Newell had commenced operating charter services.
The development of holiday camps at Puckpool and St Clare in the late 1930s boosted business considerably on the bus route as well as providing additional excursion work. The extra revenue created from this was used to fund the purchase of new coaches. In July 1939 Newells (Seaview) Limited was registered, being renamed Seaview Services Limited in July 1942. After the end of World War II trade increased rapidly particularly in connection with the holiday camps. In 1950, the company purchased two new Leyland Titan double deck buses to cope with the increased passenger numbers.
In 1980 Seaview Services was sold to Mary Robinson and in December 1981 the company name was renamed A & MA Robinson Seaview Services Limited. The company continued to run route 12 from Seaview to Ryde under "Redlynx" branding, and in May 1986, (several months before deregulation day) extended this route to Nettlestone, St Helens, Bembridge and Sandown. However this move encouraged Southern Vectis to compete against Seaview Services with a minibus service to Seaview, leading to a bus war between the two firms. After this period of initial competition, in May 1987 Seaview Services retreated back to its previous Seaview to Ryde route and Southern Vectis withdrew its competing service. In 1992 the us side of the business was sold to Southern Vectis and the company has since concentrated solely on coach charters and tours. 
In 1989 the Seaview garage was sold and a new garage opened in Sandown.

Queensland Fire and Rescue Service

The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service (QFRS) is the primary provider of fire suppression and life rescue services to the residents and visitors to the state of Queensland, Australia. Its headquarters are located in Kedron, Brisbane.
The QFRS has a diverse workforce including approximately 2,100 full-time fire officers, another 2,100 auxiliary (retained) fire officers and around 34,000 volunteers that cover the state. The operational fire officers are supported by 750 salaried public service employees. Reference is still made in some parts to the Rural Fire Service or RFS which ceased to exist as a separate entity when the Fire and Rescue Service Act 1990 was introduced, some members of staff and volunteers will still identify with the RFS and proclaim independence.
The Minister responsible for the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service is the Honourable Jack Dempsey, Minister for Police and Community Safety. The QFRS is an agency within the Department of Community Safety, of which the Director General (and QFRS CEO) is Kelvin Anderson.
Commissioner.
The Commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service is Lee A. Johnson AFSM who is a 35+ year veteran of the QFRS. Commissioner Johnson joined what was then the Townsville Fire Brigade Board as a firefighter in 1975. Commissioner Johnson is a Board Director of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council (AFAC) and held the position of President until the 2013 AGM. and further to this, he represents Queensland as a Director of the National Aerial Firefighting Council (NAFC).

Commissioner Johnson is a regular keynote speaker at industry events across Australia and Internationally, his topics often include Incident Management, Command and Control and technology & its impact on emergency and disaster management.
History.
The QFRS is the result of 150 years of evolution in Queensland’s fire fighting services; in fact the QFRS was born from Australia’s oldest formal volunteer fire service, formed in 1860 after a fire destroyed a Brisbane cabinet making workshop. The early years were tough for the Brisbane Volunteer Fire Brigade and it wasn’t until 1889 that the first full-time firemen were employed.
The first legislation for rural fire management was the Act to Prevent the Careless Use of Fire 1865, and for urban fire management, the Fire Brigades Act 1876. In 1990, the Queensland Fire Service and the Rural Fires Council were formed replace the 81 Fire Boards in local government areas and the Rural Fires Board; this was the first step in creating a single fire service for Queensland.
In 1997, it became the Queensland Fire and Rescue Authority and 2001 saw another name change to the current Queensland Fire and Rescue Service.
On Monday 22 April 2013 at Ayr Fire Station in North QLD, The Premier Hon Campbell Newman announced that Cabinet had received the Malone Review into the Rural Fire Services recommending that the current Rural Operations arm of QFRS become an independent service in its own right bearing the name Rural Fire Service Queensland (RFSQ) which, alongside SES will be parallel services with QFRS all under a Chief Officer. This review was considered as part of the Keelty Review into Police and Emergency Services The Rural Fire Service Queensland exists by order of Government and Commissioner QFRS. 
The Malone Review will be implemented in a team led by member for Mirani Ted Malone MP which includes, for the first time, the order to fit Rural Fire Appliances with Blue and Red beacons to finally bring them into line with rural fire brigades across the nation. 
Organization.
The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service is divided into seven regions, each headed by a Regional Assistant Commissioners, divided into a number of geographical areas each headed up by an Area Director.
Rural Fire Service Queensland.
The Rural Fire Service Queensland (RFSQ) serves rural, semi-rural and urban fringe areas where there is no urban fire service coverage and is divided into 15 Districts, grouped into two regions. The regions are managed by Regional Inspectors in Townsville (Northern Region) and Redcliffe (Southern Region). The Rural Fire Service Queensland administers Queensland’s volunteer Fire Wardens and Rural Fire Brigades, and assists them in providing rural fire management to the communities of Queensland. The RFS consists of around 34,000 volunteers manning around 1,500 rural fire brigades across Queensland, providing fire protection to 93% of the state. Representative Body RFBAQ 
Ranks and structure.
The QFRS employs both full-time and part-time (auxiliary) firefighters to staff its more than 240 urban fire and rescue stations, with volunteer firefighters making up the State's almost approx 1500 rural fire brigades. All three groups wear the same blue station wear uniform, however:

Dickie Burnell

Richard "Dickie" Desborough Burnell (26 July 1917 – 29 January 1995) was an English rower who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal alongside Bertram "Bertie" Bushnell in the double sculls. He and his father Charles Burnell are the only father and son in Olympic history to have won gold medals in rowing.
Career.
Burnell was born in Henley-on-Thames the son of Charles Burnell who had won a gold medal in the Men's Eight in the 1908 Summer Olympics. He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. 
In May 1939, Burnell was commissioned into the London Rifle Brigade. He was a rowing correspondent for "The Times" and wrote several books on rowing matters. He rowed for Kingston Rowing Club and in 1946 he won the Wingfield Sculls.
1948 Summer Olympics.
In the 1948 Summer Olympics Burnell won the gold medal with his partner Bert Bushnell in the double sculls event. Burnell was chosen to pair with Bert Bushnell in the Olympic double sculls event, having never previously trained with his new partner. Jack Beresford told Bushnell that there wasn't a chance for him to win the single sculls, and so created the double sculls team instead. Their differing physiques — Burnell was 6 ft 4inches and weighed 14½ stone, while Bushnell was 5 ft 10 inches and 10½ stone — presented some difficulties in the boat, which Bushnell had to re-rig so that they were able to reach together. 
The pair only had a month to train for the Games, with animosity between the two due to the difference in their class backgrounds. Bushnell later said in an interview, "There was class tension there and it came from me being bloody awkward." Bushnell struck up a friendship with American rower John B. Kelly, Jr. and Australian Merv Wood. The rowers' diets had been increased from the normal 2,500 allowed by rationing to a "miner's diet" of 3,600. However, the other teams were having food flown in specially in order to increase their calorie intake and allow them to train more. Bushnell would invite Kelly and Wood over for dinner, with his guests bringing the food. Bushnell and Burnell both attended the opening ceremony of the 1948 Games, something Bushnell described as "dreadful", as they gave the athletes poorly fitting uniforms and made them stand out in the sun en-masse for three hours.
On the Henley Royal Regatta course, they lost to France in the first round, but then won both the repêchage followed by the semi-final. On 9 August 1948, in front of a home crowd, Bushnell and Burnell competed in the Olympic final against the double scull teams of Uruguay and Denmark. Bushnell nearly missed the final, held at the Leander Club in Henley, as stewards would not allow him to enter; he later explained "You see I wasn't a member then – not posh enough". At around the three minute mark, the British team decided to push for the win, eventually taking it in six minutes and 51.3 seconds, two lengths ahead of the favoured Danish duo of Ebbe Parsner and Aage Larsen (6:55.3) and five ahead of Uruguay (7:12.4). On the jetty they were awarded their medals while standing in their socks. There were no ribbons for the medals due to cost saving measures, and so they were given them in presentation boxes while God Save the King was played by a band.
1950 British Empire Games.
At the 1950 British Empire Games he won the bronze medal as part of the English boat in the eights competition.
Burnell died in Wallingford.
Personal.
Burnell and his father Charles Burnell are the only father and son in Olympic history to have won gold medals in rowing. In 1940 Burnell married Rosalind, a daughter of English Olympic Gold medal-winning rower Stanley Garton. They had five children: Peter, John, Edward, Alexandra (“Zandra”), and Elizabeth (“Tizzy”). Burnell's son, Peter, rowed for Oxford in 1962.
Works.
R.D. Burnell was also the author of several books on rowing, among them:
Legacy.
During the run up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the BBC produced the film "Bert and Dickie" (also called "Going For Gold: The '48 Games"), depicting Burnell and Bushnell's achievement at the 1948 Games, with Sam Hoare portraying Burnell, and Bushnell portrayed by Doctor Who actor Matt Smith.

Bert Bushnell

Bertram "Bert" Harold Thomas Bushnell (3 September 1921 – 10 January 2010) was a British rower who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal alongside Dickie Burnell in the double sculls, having had hopes to compete in the single sculls following a series of victories whilst competing in South America.
Having initially competed in athletics whilst at school, he took up competitive rowing in 1939, and during the Second World War he worked at John I. Thornycroft & Company's shipyard as a marine engineer and was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. He retired after the Olympics in 1951 and ran his own company renting cabin cruisers, and had three children.
Early life.
Bushnell was born in Wargrave, Berkshire, the younger son of John "Jack" Henry Bushnell (born 17 January 1885 in Richmond, Surrey; died March 1970), a ship builder who had operated his own boatyard at Wargrave since 31 December 1917, and was a former rower who gave up his own Olympic dreams in order to provide for his family, and Lena Simmonds Bushnell (born January 1893 in Richmond, Surrey; died December 1957), who had been a shorthand typist and an opera singer. His older brother was Leonard John Bushnell (born 19 May 1918; died 1974). The Bushnell family have had a Royal Warrant since before the First World War and this has continued into the present generation with the senior member appointed a Royal Waterman to the reigning British monarch.
John Henry Bushnell carried on the business of renting self-propelled rowing boats, dinghies, skiffs, punts, camping punts, until the early 1920s when he obtained electric canoes followed closely by motor-driven launches. Both the motor-propelled craft could be hired for self-drive or with drivers. During this time boat building of various types was carried on at the site and, as years passed, larger and more sophisticated craft were constructed for both sale and hire. In the mid-1930s the first self-drive holiday hire cruiser was built and thereafter others followed up until 1939 when the boatyard took on rapid expansions to cope with Admiralty contracts to build fast motor boats for both Naval and RAF air/sea rescue.
Bushnell attended Henley Grammar School where he excelled at sport, including running the 100 yard dash in "evens" at Palmer Park. In his youth he was coached by sprinter Sandy Duncan. He became an apprentice at ship builders John I. Thornycroft & Company at the age of fourteen at the Southampton Docks.
Career.
Bushnell first competed in rowing in August 1939 at the Maidenhead Regatta. In order to retain his amateur status under the rules of the Amateur Rowing Association, Bushnell was ineligible to work for his father's shipbuilding business as a boat mechanic and instead continued to work for Thornycrofts, becoming a marine engineer. During the Second World War, Bushnell tested motor torpedo boat engines and worked a 52-hour week for ₤3 10s. He was also involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. attaining the rank of Chief Petty Officer.
Following the war, Bushnell began to compete in rowing once more. At the 1946 Henley Royal Regatta, Bushnell (representing Maidenhead Rowing Club) lost to Burnell in the Diamond Challenge Sculls. While at the Marlow Regatta in 1946, he accepted an offer to travel to Argentina to train and compete there. While in South America in the summer of 1947, he was undefeated in several single scull races on the Rio Tigre and met Juan Perón, President of Argentina, and his wife Eva Perón. He won the Wingfield Sculls in 1947, but lost to Jack Kelly in the semi-final in the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1947.
1948 Summer Olympics.
Bushnell hoped to compete at the 1948 Summer Olympics in the single scull event. However, after he was a distant runner-up by five lengths in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta on 4 July 1948, to Australian policeman Mervyn Wood, who subsequently won the Olympic singles that year, Bushnell was chosen instead to pair with old Etonian Oxonian rower Dickie Burnell in the Olympic double sculls event, having never previously trained with his new partner. Jack Beresford told Bushnell that there wasn't a chance for him to win the single sculls, and so created the double sculls team instead. Their differing physiques — Burnell was 6 ft 4in and weighed 14½ stone, while Bushnell was 5 ft 10in and 10½ stone — presented some difficulties in the boat, which Bushnell had to re-rig so that they were able to reach together.
Bushnell and Burnell only had a month to train for the Games, with animosity between the two due to the difference in their class backgrounds. Bushnell later said in an interview, "There was class tension there and it came from me being bloody awkward." Bushnell struck up a friendship with American rower John B. Kelly, Jr. and Australian Merv Wood. The rowers' diets had been increased from the normal 2,500 calories allowed by rationing to a "miner's diet" of 3,600 calories. However, the other teams were having food flown in specially in order to increase their calorie intake and allow them to train more. Bushnell would invite Kelly and Wood over for dinner, with his guests bringing the food. Bushnell and Burnell both attended the opening ceremony of the 1948 Games, something Bushnell described as "dreadful", as they gave the athletes poorly fitting uniforms and made them stand out in the sun en-masse for three hours.
At the Olympic regatta on the Henley Royal Regatta course, which only measured 1900 metres, Bushnell was in the bow and Burnell the stern seat, or as Bushnell indicated later: "I was on the bridge and Dickie was in the engine room. In an attempt to avoid the favoured Danish duo of Ebbe Parsner and Aage Larsen in the semi-finals, Bushnell and Burnell deliberately came second to France in the first round. According to Bushnell: "Dickie decided we should lose the first heat so as not to meet the Danes in the semi-final. ... I wouldn't have had the nerve to do that. We could have won, but we didn't." They subsequently won both the repêchage followed by the semi-final.
On Monday, 9 August 1948, in front of a home crowd estimated to be 20,000 spectators, Bushnell and Burnell competed in the Olympic final against the double scull teams of Uruguay and Denmark. Bushnell nearly missed the final, held at the Leander Club in Henley, as stewards would not allow him to enter; he later explained "You see I wasn't a member then – not posh enough". At around the three-minute mark, the British team decided to push for the win, eventually taking it in six minutes and 51.3 seconds, 1½ lengths ahead of the favoured Danish duo of Parsner and Larsen (6:55.3) and five ahead of William Jones and Juan A. Rodriguez Iglesias of Uruguay (7:12.4). On the jetty they were awarded their medals while standing in their socks. As there were no ribbons for the medals due to cost-saving measures, they were given them in presentation boxes while "God Save the King" was played by a band.
Decades later Bushnell indicated in an interview with Janie Hampton: "The Olympics didn't feel a big deal. It was like Henley regatta with a few foreigners thrown in." Despite winning an Olympic gold medal, Bushnell returned to his occupation, indicating in an interview: "There was no fuss and my life wasn’t changed. I went back to work as a marine engineer on Monday. I didn’t get paid to have days off and my employers considered I was a bloody nuisance."
In the 1949 European Championships Bushnell and Burnell finished 5th. In the Henley Royal Regatta of June 1949, Bushnell withdrew from the single sculls to focus on the double sculls. However, Bushnell and Burnell were defeated by the Danish team of Parsner and Larsen in the double sculls event in a record-breaking race.
Later life.
In September 1948 Bushnell married Margaret Campbell (born 27 October 1925; died December 1988). They spent the first few years of their married life on a Thames sailing barge, moored up outside the boathouse in Maidenhead. They had three daughters: Patricia Pueschel, Jacqueline Page, and Susan Bushnell, and six granddaughters.
After World War II, his father bought a second boatyard at Maidenhead. Later the businesses were split with Bert transferring to Maidenhead, and his older brother Leonard (and later his two sons, Nicholas and Paul) operating the original Wargrave boatyard until Leonard's death in 1974. After retiring from competitive rowing in 1951, Bushnell played association football for Maidenhead United and set up his own boatyard in Maidenhead, that rented cabin cruisers. Bushnell pioneered the development of recirculative "pump-out" lavatories which freed holidaymakers from elsan emptying and earned him the affectionate nickname "Recirc Bert". Bushnell was a founder member and later Chairman of the British Hire Cruiser Federation. After selling his business in 1979, he moved to The Algarve, Portugal. After the death of his wife in December 1988, Bushnell returned to live in Henley. In 1990 Bushnell had a lung removed.
About 2000 Bushnell donated his gold medal to the River and Rowing Museum in Henley, as he was concerned about it being stolen from his home and figured it was easy enough to go and visit it at the museum. In October 2006 Bushnell presented the trophy to Alan Campbell as winner of the Wingfield Sculls. Bushnell died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire on Saturday, 9 January 2010, aged 88, survived by his three daughters and his domestic partner Monica Rees. His funeral was on 27 January 2010 at the Parish Church of Saint Mary the Virgin at Henley-on-Thames.
Legacy.
Bushnell was initially thought to be the final surviving gold medallist from the British team at the 1948 Summer Olympics, however David Bond (who won a gold medal in the sailing Swallow class) wrote in to "The Guardian" to inform the newspaper that he was very much alive.
Hitchambury Homes created a housing development called Bushnell Place in honour of Bert Bushnell on Alwyn Road, Maidenhead. Bushnell and Burnell's Olympic success is featured at the Maidenhead Heritage Centre. Bushnell and Burnell and their efforts in the 1948 Summer Olympics are featured in "The Perfect Rower: 100 Years of Racing for Glory" exhibition at the River and Rowing Museum, from 31 March to 30 September 2012.
On 25 July 2012, two days before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, BBC One screened the film "Bert and Dickie" (also called "Going For Gold: The '48 Games"), depicting Burnell and Bushnell's achievement at the 1948 Games, with Bushnell portrayed by Doctor Who actor Matt Smith and Sam Hoare portraying Burnell. The film's writer, William Ivory, met Bushnell before his death in 2010.

Precision viticulture

Precision viticulture is precision farming applied to optimize vineyard performance, in particular maximizing grape yield and quality while minimizing environmental impacts and risk. This is accomplished by measuring local variation in factors that influence grape yield and quality (soil, topography, microclimate, vine health, etc.) and applying appropriate viticulture management practices (trellis design, pruning, fertilizer application, irrigation, timing of harvest, etc.). Precision viticulture is based on the premise that high in-field variability for factors that affect vine growth and grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according to local conditions. Precision viticulture depends on new and emerging technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), meteorologic and other environmental sensors, satellite and airborne remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess and respond to variability.
Background.
Precision viticulture is unique in its emphasis on vineyard management according to local variation, and in its use of science and technology to accomplish this. While Australian viticulturalists are generally recognized as leaders in precision viticulture, and while viticulturalists worldwide have embraced the approach, the fundamental concepts have deep roots in the traditions of Old World winemaking regions. "Terroir", a related French concept, refers to the special geographic qualities or "sense of place" embodied in the wine produced in a particular region.
Precision agriculture emphasizes "doing the right thing, in the right place, at the right time", and is practical for viticulture because of high local variability of conditions within vineyards, and because of responsiveness to intensive management in terms of increased grape yield and quality. According to CSIRO, Australia "Typically grape yield varies eight to ten-fold under uniform management"; "patterns of yield variation are stable in time and driven by soil and topographic variation"; and "patterns of variation in fruit quality tend to be similar to those for yield, suggesting opportunities for zonal management and selective harvest". Australian precision viticulture has focused on yield monitoring, whereas California precision viticulture has focused on remote sensing.
Technology for Characterizing Vineyard Variation.
Precision viticulture uses a broad set of enabling technologies to observe and respond to vineyard variability: 
Precision Viticulture Management Practices.
Precision viticulture draws upon a variety of management approaches, including zonal management, in which different areas of the vineyard are managed according to their unique conditions, and adaptive management, in which different management practices are applied according to observed needs and improved knowledge. Trellis design, in terms of row orientation and geometry of vine support, and pruning practices can be tailored to optimize vine health, to protect grapes from frost, sunburn, and mildew damage, and to ensure even grape ripening. Irrigation and fertilizer application schedules, pest management, and selective harvest based on timing of ripening can all be managed to minimize costs and maximize vineyard performance based on observed needs. Increasingly, precision viticulture, with its focus on management according to local variability, is coupled with organic farming, with its focus on environmentally friendly practices without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and with sustainable agriculture, with emphasis on long-term environmental stewardship and economic viability.
Future.
Various integrative technological approaches are gaining increasing attention for application in precision viticulture:

Lithuanian Land Force

The Lithuanian Land Forces (LLF) form the backbone of the country's defence force, capable of acting as an integral part of NATO forces. Lithuanian Land Forces consist of one brigade, the Engineer Battalion, and the National Defence Volunteers.
Structure.
The main element of the Land Forces is a single mechanised infantry brigade, the Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade. This is formed around three mechanized infantry battalions and an artillery battalion, all named after Lithuanian grand dukes as the tradition of the Lithuanian Armed Forces goes.
In addition to the formed infantry brigade, the Land Forces maintain three additional motorised infantry battalions; one of these is tasked to support operations both domestically and overseas; one is tasked primarily with the defence of territorial Lithuania, and the third is primarily a training unit
Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion is responsible for mine clearance, the construction of pontoon bridges, unexploded ordnance detonation tasks, underwater engineering, and participation in search and rescue operations. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Platoon is ready to participate in international operations. Starting in 2008, the Lithuanian Armed Forces launched a 10-year-long project continuing mine cleaning on Lithuanian territory of explosives left after the First and Second World War, and in former soviet military bases.
As an integral part of the Land Forces, the National Defence Volunteers have been developing since the beginning of the national movement for independence. The volunteers act smoothly together with the Allies during military operations and have been assigned new missions: to augment the regular forces, to deploy individual units and specific capabilities for international operations, to assist host nation support and to support the civilian authorities.
Equipment.
In reforming the Armed Forces, most of the available attention and financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. To bring them up to NATO standards, current efforts focus on upgrading equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness, and combat training. The standard service assault rifle of the Lithuanian Armed Forces is the Heckler & Koch G36 and the standard pistol is the Glock 17. The Lithuanian Land Forces are also equipped with machine guns, including the GPMG MG-3, the FN MAG, and the 12.7mm (.50 cal.) M2 Browning machine gun. They also employ the AT-4 and Carl Gustav anti-tank grenade launchers, HK GMG high-velocity grenade launchers, and low-velocity AG-36 under-the-barrel grenade launchers, in addition to light and heavy mortars and M101 howitzers. The army also uses high-technology Lithuanian-made tactical automated commanding and controlling informational systems (TAVVIS).
Reserves.
Lithuanian Land Forces are formed from professional military servicemen and volunteers. In 2008 the minister of national defence of Lithuania signed a law that ceased conscription in an effort to develop Lithuania's profesisonal army. National defence is based on reserve forces and mobilisation forces. The new minister plans to increase national defence capabilities by making all males from 18 to 24 take 7 week military basic training. After that the person will be added to the military reserves.
International missions.
Lithuania has participated in international missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Bosnia. The main force is currently (2013) in Afghanistan. Right now there are more than 200 soldiers serving on foreign soil

Emilio Spedicato

Emilio Spedicato (born 1945) is full professor of operations research at the University of Bergamo in Italy. He attended the Liceo Classico Manzoni, obtaining (with Enrico Camporesi, now medical professor in Florida) the highest score in northern Italy at the final exams. He graduated in physics at Milan University and was the first non-Chinese to receive a PhD in a mathematical discipline in China, at Dalian University of Technology. Starting in 1969, he worked for seven years at CISE, a nuclear research center near Milano. He also spent two years in the United Kingdom, University of Essex, and the United States, at Stanford University. He then moved to the University of Bergamo as a professor in operations research and was for many years director of its mathematics department.
Disciplines.
He has been active in different disciplines, as shown by his list of about 500 papers, of which some 300 in mathematics.
Quasi-Newton methods.
In mathematics he worked ten years in the field of Quasi-Newton methods, obtaining the first results on optimal conditioning and invariancy to nonlinear scaling.
ABS methods.
Then, motivated by a seminar of Jozsef Abaffy, he developed within an international collaboration the new field of ABS (Abaffy-Broyden-Spedicato) methods. These are based on the little-known rank-one reducing matrix iteration due to Jeno Egervary, a great Hungarian mathematician who committed suicide after hostility from communist bureaucrats. The work on ABS methods started in 1981 and is still continued. It has involved mainly Hungarians (Abaffy, Galantai, Jeney,…), Chinese (Deng, Zhu, Xia, Zhang, Huang, Li…) and Iranians (Mahdavi-Amiri, Esmaeili, Mirnia….). It has produced over 400 papers, three international conferences in China and two monographs: one in 1989 by Abaffy and Spedicato, based upon some 60 papers, and another in 1998 by Xia and Zhang, based upon some 250 papers. A third monograph is envisaged. 
The main results by ABS methods include:
Applied optimization.
Other mathematical work of Spedicato has dealt with applications of optimization to industrial problems, especially to the reduction of fuel consumption and noxious emissions by cars, on data from Alfa Romeo and Fiat.
Mechanics and astronomy.
He also has worked in celestial mechanics, in particular analyzing the effects of an inversion of the rotation axis of Earth (the results confirm statements in Herodotus and Pomponius Mela). Work in progress regards a new theory for the origin of the Moon (by capture from a passing by planet) and the study of a super Tunguska explosion over northern Germany, which may explain such things as the events of Exodus and the Deucalian flood.
Other interests.
Spedicato’s interests also concern ancient history, especially with respect to catastrophic events of extraterrestrial nature, where he has published papers related to Atlantis, Exodus and the Tunguska-type impacts of 1178 AD over the Pacific. He has also studied problems in biblical and other ancient texts, dealing e.g. with the geography of Eden and Gilgamesh's travels, the empire of Solomon, the origin of the Etruscans within the theory of Alinei who has shown their language to be ancient Hungarian.
Finally he has interests in the musical field, started by a contact with prof Taboga, who found a convincing explanation for Mozart's death and showed that Andrea Luchesi, the teacher of Beethoven, played an essential role in the origin of the Wiener Klassik. These interests have been devoted recently to operatic music, after his discovery that Gigli and Pertile were family friends. He has met such stars of lyric as Valdengo, Taddei, Panerai, Di Stefano, Bergonzi, Prandelli, Olivero, Stella, Cerquetti and Maliponte, and is presently working on a book devoted to Puccini.

63rd Ohio Infantry

The 63rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry (or 63rd OVI) was an infantry regiment which served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was a part of the Union forces in the Western Theater of operations.
Organization.
The original 63rd OVI was organized on December 1, 1861, at Camp Worthington in Columbus and at Camp Marietta in Marietta, but only enough men were available to fill four companies. Hence, the 63rd was not officially designated as a regiment.
The 63rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry was organized January 23, 1862, in Marietta, Ohio, by consolidation of a battalion of the 22nd Ohio and the four companies of the old 63rd Regiment. Governor David Tod appointed John W. Sprague as the regiment's colonel. Its ten individual companies had been raised in southern Ohio.
Service history.
The 63rd immediately took the field and joined Major General John Pope in Missouri. At New Madrid, the 63rd was brigaded with other Ohio regiments in what became known as the Ohio Brigade. It took part in all the operations resulting in the surrender of Island No. 10. 
In April 1862, the 63rd OVI joined Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck's forces near Corinth, Mississippi. After the evacuation, it operated in Northern Alabama, and participated in the battles of Iuka and Corinth in the army of William S. Rosecrans. Colonel Sprague was promoted to brigadier general, and Oscar L. Jackson assumed command of the regiment.
During 1863, the 63rd operated mostly in Northern Alabama and Tennessee. In January 1864, most of the men re-enlisted for three years, and the regiment went to Ohio on veteran furlough. In May it joined Sherman's Atlanta Campaign and shared in all the battles to the end of the campaign. In the autumn, the 63rd took part in Sherman's March to the Sea. 
In early 1865, the 63rd participated in the Carolinas Campaign. It took part in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. in May and then went by train to Louisville, Kentucky, where the men mustered out on July 8, 1865.
The regiment lost during its term of service 2 officers and 91 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded; and 5 officers and 259 enlisted men by disease, for a total of 357 fatalities.

<doc id="20708733" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20708733" title="The Jon Richardson Show">
The Jon Richardson Show

The Jon Richardson Show was a weekly radio show on BBC 6 Music, which was created due to the departure of Russell Howard from "The Russell Howard Show", which Jon Richardson co-hosted with Russell. The show was broadcast on Sundays 10am - 1pm. It was co-hosted by Matt ("Fordie") Forde, who usually joined Jon at 12pm.
On Sunday 7 February 2010, Richardson announced that after three and a half years on 6 Music, he would be leaving the station after the March 7th show. He said he didn't want "to get typecast as a DJ", as he is a comic. He went on to state "I've loved doing it, so I'd love to do more radio at some point", but after he has asserted himself further as a stand-up comic.
On Sunday 7 March, the last show aired.
Features.
Guest Comedian, each week Jon invites a different comedian each week to join him in the studio for usually at least the first hour of the show. Rarely, two or more comedians may also be featured, such as Pappy's Fun Club.
Cheer up Jon, Mark Olver finds someone who would cheer Jon up and they join him on air. These guests have included a Dyson engineer (due to Jon's admiration of the Dyson Airblade handdryer), the current Sheriff of Nottingham, and the lady who coined the phrase "a dog is for life, not just for Christmas" for the Dog's Trust. As of June 2009, this feature no longer appeared on the show, but currently continues under a Christmas theme.
Olvers Olvent Calendolv
Mark Olver appears again with a Christmas themed version of 'Cheer Up Jon': guests so far have included the founder of Pets As Therapy, a British charity which uses pets to aid those in need.
The Podjoke, a feature present only in the podcast of the show. It takes the form of a gag, usually pun-based, which is begun in the intro at the beginning of the show, and completed in the outro.
Pitcher's Pictures, Comedian Al Pitcher, while collecting pictures for a piece in his new stand-up set, began e-mailing the pictures to Jon. These pictures were put on the 6 Music website. This became a feature where listeners were challenged to take a better picture than Pitcher each week. The picture has to adhere to a category that is chosen by Pitcher. The category must be based on a song title. The winner is decided by Jon some weeks and by listener votes on other weeks. After the feature each week the song which the category is created from is played.
The Project, a project announced on the podcast in which the Jon asks the podcast listeners (by over-clicking subscribe) to ruin the iTunes podcast chart, and propel Jon to the top. It was begun by James Bates-Prince, a listener, that discovered that by clicking on the subscribe button next to the podcast on iTunes many times it was possible to cheat the podcast chart system and work Jon up near to the top of the charts. This became a popular idea, with many listeners following James's footsteps, however, after some doubting emails, Jon became skeptical on if it really worked, and eventually called for listeners to abandon the project.
In 2009, the first hour of the show has been designated the Happy Hour where Jon tries to be happy (as he generally considers himself to be pessimistic). Listeners have a chance to email in stories of happiness to share with Jon, his team and other listeners. The happy hour is more frequently used to discuss listener's 'good deeds', in which Jon and his guest compare the deeds and decide which is the best - the show is then dedicated to this listener. Winners of this have included a group of friends holding a picnic for a friend's birthday, a lady who taught someone how to use a Dyson Airblade, and on one occasion, Jon himself (He picked up a man's train ticket and was thanked with the reply, "You have saved my life" which he took quite literally). Jon plays songs that will make himself and the listeners happy. Naturally, just minutes after the Happy Hour, Jon reverts to his usual self. On February 1, 2009, Jon was in a bad mood and decided to do 'Crappy Hour' instead of Happy Hour which consisted of anectodes from both Jon and the listeners about bad things that had happened to them during their weeks.
Matt Forde features.
The Fordie Files are a series of reports by Fordie, which have delved into topics such as Halloween, chivalry, advent, the art of taking a penalty, and cloning (in which Forde put across a compelling argument about why we shouldn't bring back any extinct animal with "wild" in its name). Whilst presenting his reports, Jon often plays random sound effects, that are often unrelated, and off-putting for Fordie.
Get Fordie fit (sometimes referred to as "Get Fit Fatty" to the annoyance of Fordie), charts Fordies journey of losing weight. The main goal of this feature was for Fordie to lose a certain amount of weight before Christmas, and as an incentive, it was agreed he would only receive a Christmas present from Jon if this was achieved. This feature no longer appears on the show.
Fordie's One Week Feature, Fordie creates a feature that will only be done for one show and will never appear again, usually because the feature is a weak attempt at a feature. An example of a one week feature was "Inside Fordie's Car" where sound effects were played to recreate Fordie driving his car. The feature was filled with silences between Fordie saying phrases such as "Ahh, McDonald's is closed again, I'm starving." and "You're driving like an idiot! Not you." which led to awkward laughter from Jon and much criticism of the feature which Fordie had hoped would become a weekly occurrence on the show.
Challenge Fordie Listeners text or email in challenges for Fordie, previous ones have included to climb Arthur's Seat (Mountain in Edinburgh), To complete a session of Cardiokick (exercise class) and get either live on air or a recorded message from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin or John McCain.
Fordie's Advice In this feature Fordie gives listeners tips on how to behave in certain situations, such as how to behave with the opposite gender, and how to behave at a party. During his advice for the latter, he insisted that filling a wine bottle with water and proceeding to 'accidentally' drop it on the door step of the party host was a successful way to get out of not bringing a present, whilst looking as if you had.
Fordie Tries To Join The Gym Each week Fordie tries to join the gym in preparation for his marathon attempt, and then has to answer to Richardson and give some lame excuse as to why he has failed.
Fordie's Interviews Each week, Fordie pretends to interview a famous person, yet actually uses soundbites from old interviews and fills in his part himself. He has 'interviewed' Gordon Brown, David Cameron, David Attenborough, the England football team, and even Jon.
Guest comedian.
Every week, Jon Richardson invited a guest comedian to join him in the studio.
Some of guest comedians appeared on the show were:
Stephen K Amos,
Jarred Christmas,
Arnab Chanda (who announced his retirement from comedy while on the show),

Stara Synagogue, Łódź

The Stara Synagogue was a "beautiful" synagogue in Łódź, Poland. The name "Stara" means "old," many Polish cities called the oldest synagogue in town the Stara synagogue. The Stara was Łódź's principal Orthodox synagogue. It was built by Orthodox industrial magnates who wished to outshine, or at least compete with, the 1881 Great Synagogue (Łódź) built by the Reformed Jewish community. 
History.
Łódź, a village of fewer than 200 people at the end of the eighteenth century, developed rapidly into a great industrial city. Łódź's first synagogue, a wooden building, was built in 1809 at 8 Wolborska Street. The land was purchased from a lieutenant in the National Guard named Józef Aufschlag. By 1854 the building was in such poor condition that it was condemned by town authorities. Services are known to have continued thorough 1861 despite the official condemnation.
Work began in 1859 on a new, brick synagogue at 20 Wolborska Street designed by Jan Karol Mertsching in a neo-mannerist style. The new building opened in 1861. Construction, slowed by a financial crisis, continued until 1871.
The 1861 building was replaced between 1897 and 1900 by an elaborate Moorish Revival synagogue designed by Adolf Zeligson, a well-known Łódź architect. The architect's signed plans for the building were auctioned at Southby's on December 17, 2008 for $13,750.
According to Shimon Huberband (1909–1942), who documented the response of religious Jews of Poland to the Holocaust before he was murdered by the Nazis: "The synagogue was very tall and beautiful. It contained two women's galleries. In all, it held fifteen hundred seats. There were thirty-six Torah scrolls in the synagogue and a large amount of silver Torah ornaments, including many antique works of art. All official public ceremonies took place in this synagogue".
The synagogue was burned to the ground on November 15–16, 1939 during the Nazi occupation.

History of CAF

From a humble beginning in 1957, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has grown into a respected organisation that today can hold its head high anywhere in the world.
Formation.
The Confederation of African Football began its formation at the 29th FIFA Congress in Bern, Switzerland, in June 1954. Africa was represented at the Congress by four national associations: Egypt, who had joined FIFA in 1923; Sudan affiliated in 1948; Ethiopia in 1953 and South Africa in 1910 and 1952. It was at that Congress that Africa was recognised as a zonal group with a right to have for the first time a representative on the FIFA Executive Committee. This representation was taken up by Engineer Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem of Egypt.
It was not an easy task to get this recognition, Argentina kicked against the seats given to Africa and Asia arguing that the standard of football in these continents was not good enough, although at the previous Congress in Paris in 1953 it was agreed that Africa will be given the right to be represented subsequently. There was a long, heated argument. Africa's position was supported by Great Britain and the eastern countries, 24 votes in favour, 17 against. The Congress then elected Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem to represent Africa on the Executive Committee until a confederation was founded. Then, the African delegation agreed to meet in Lisbon in 1956 on the occasion of the FIFA Congress to realise the project.
Due to the Ethiopian Football Federation's lack of funds, Ydnekatchew Tessema was unable to travel to the historic 1954 FIFA Congress in Bern, which recognized Africa as a FIFA zone. The other African members were represented, not only in Bern, but at the 1956 Lisbon Congress as well.
South African apartheid issue.
A committee was also set up to look into the case of South Africa, who run two separate federations the oldest run by only whites while the other recognised the other races. The committee visited South Africa on January 16, 1956. Nevertheless, the very fact that all the other founders had not objected to the Africa-Zone, FIFA membership of Apartheid South Africa in the previous four years, indicates that the abrupt change of attitude was influenced by newcomer Ydnekatchew Tessema. Confirming this assumption, on CAF News number 30 of October 1987, Sudanese, Dr. Abdel Halim Mohammad, who had attended all the earlier meetings of the African Zone in FIFA that were concluded without opposition to Apartheid South Africa, had testified that Yidnekatchew's firm stand against Apartheid started in Khartoum when he insisted that the South African team should be a mixed team.
Established five years before the Organization of African Unity, and the famous Rivonia Trial that passed life sentences on Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and other black South African activists; the African football Confederation was the first International Organization to dare say no to then very strong Apartheid, as far back as 1957. At this point in history; Apartheid was acceptable both to the International Olympic Committee and to FIFA. The two heavy weight Global Sports Institutions thus labeled the unprecedented stand of the young Confederation, as one of, "mixing politics with sports". Subsequently, FIFA told the Confederation that it had no right to expel a member association of FIFA, and instructed immediate reinstatement of Apartheid South Africa. The new Confederation did not only refuse to comply, but, demanded that FIFA itself expel the racist association from membership.
This first confrontation, which could have easily caused the early withdrawal of the three African member associations, subsided briefly, when FIFA under the Presidency of Englishman Arthur Drewry promised to review the African position. However, it relapsed again, after a three man fact finding mission led by the newly elected president, Sir Stanley Rous, travelled to South Africa, and concluded that the National Football Federation had nothing to do with Government instituted Racial Discrimination. The controversial recommendation of this delegation to readmit the South African Federation was adopted at the FIFA Congress in Cairo 1963.
The African delegation at the Congress in Lisbon, were Abdel Aziz Salem, Mohammad Latif, Youssef Mohammad (Egypt); Abdel Halim Mohammad, Abdel Rahim Shaddad, Badawi Mohammad Ali (Sudan) and Fred Fell (South Africa). They got together on June 7 and 8 at the Avenida Hotel and decided among other things to create an African Football Confederation and to organise a competition among countries beginning from 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, where the statutes and regulations of the new body would be drawn.
African Cup of Nations is born.
The Constitutional Assembly of CAF took place on February 8, 1957, at the Grand Hotel in Khartoum. In attendance were Abdel Aziz Salem, Mourad Fahmy, Galal Koreitem, Moustafa Kamel Mansour and Youssef Mohammad representing Egypt, Ydnekatchew Tessema, General Aman Andom and Guebeyehu Double (Ethiopia), Abdel Halim Mohammad, Abdel Rahim Shaddad, Badawi Mohammad Ali and Ahmad Mohammad Singawi (Sudan) and Fred Fell (South Africa). The foundation of the CAF statutes came from proposed statutes by both Tessema and Shaddad while regulations were also drawn for the African Cup of Nations. Engineer Salem was elected first CAF President while Tessema, Abdel Halim and Fell were voted into the executive committee as members with Youssef Mohamed as the first honorary General Secretary. The first African Cup of Nations kicked off on February 10 without South Africa who failed to present a multi-racial team.
Ethiopia has a bye to the final,while at Khartoum Stadium the Egyptians beat the hosting nation 2:1. The final was much easier for Egypt; 4:0 against Ethiopia, all the goals were scored by Mohammad Diab El Attar, also known as "Ad-Diba", who finished the tournament as top scorer with 5 goals. Only two games were played to give Egypt the African Champions title.
CAF moves to Cairo.
The young organisation suffered an early setback when its important documents were lost during a fire outbreak at the offices of the Sudan Football Association where they were kept. Lucky it was that the statutes adopted at the Constitutional Assembly had already been sent to FIFA and they were subsequently approved by the FIFA Executive Committee on June 21, 1957, in Zurich.
Thus going by Article 5 of these statutes which stipulates that the headquarters of CAF be located in the
same country as where the president resides, the organisation's first office was on 3, El Hadika Street, Garden City, Cairo.
Abdel Aziz Moustafa becomes president.
The third CAF General Assembly took place in June 1958 in Stockholm during the FIFA Congress and World Cup. The four founding countries were represented although acting president Salem stayed away because of a strained relationship with the president of the Egyptian Football Association (EFA), Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer. General Abdel Aziz Moustafa will thus replace his compatriot as CAF President while Dr. Abdel Halim emerged as the first African to be elected to the FIFA Executive Committee. Moustafa Kamel Mansour also succeeded former player and referee Youssef Mohamed as CAF General Secretary.
An Extraordinary meeting was held on August 21, 1960, in Rome, with delegates from Ghana, Morocco and Tunisia also in attendance. Several issues, from the creation of an Executive Committee to a revision of the statutes were discussed. It was agreed that the next meeting be held in November in Cairo with Egypt shouldering the expenses of all delegates. However, it was not till 16 February 1961 that the Congress took place. General Moustafa was re-elected President while Mourad Fahmy took over as General Secretary. It was also decided that each national association pay an annual affiliation fee of 50 Egyptian pounds.
During the fourth Congress in Cairo in 1961, Ydnekatchew proposed the Headquarters of the Confederation be moved to Addis Ababa. Further to the main objective of ensuring a responsible Secretariat; his proposal was also the first effort for equitable distribution of duties, powers and benefits in the Confederation. Ydnekatchew hoped new members Ghana and Tunisia would support this logical proposal, but for reasons of election politics, they preferred not to challenge the status quo.
Egypt aids the CAF financially.
Fahmy had to start from the scratch as the organisation did not have money and was even indebted to a printing company. It also did not have a staff. The EFA would later rent two rooms of its new office located on the Nile to CAF courtesy of the goodwill of both Fahmy and Mostafa who were both top officials of EFA. EFA also settled CAF's utility bills while the Egyptian Olympic Committee granted this new organisation 2,000 pounds a year.
At the Extraordinary General Assembly in Addis Ababa, General Mostafa defeated Tessema to become a FIFA Vice-President while Ghana's Ohene Djan got on the FIFA Executive Committee also at the expense of Tessema.
Sir Stanely Rous attends CAF 3rd Extraordinary General Assembly in Cairo.
A watershed gathering of this young confederation took place on January 23 and 24 1963 when Moustafa succeeded in getting the Egyptian government to bankroll the accommodation and travel expenses of visiting delegates. Therefore a record 23 national associations attended alongside FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous. Several ground-breaking decisions were taken at this meeting. First, the continent was divided into six geographical zones and the CAF Executive Committee was expanded to take in 12 representatives. Djan and Tessema emerged as Vice-Presidents and a new set of statutes was adopted and published.
African Cup of Champions Clubs is born.
At the next General Assembly in Accra, on November 22, 1963, a decision was taken to create a new competition for clubs the African Cup of Champions Clubs.
A year later, during the Congress in Tokyo, on the eve of the 1964 Summer Olympics, a counter proposal co-sponsored by Ethiopia, Egypt and then new member Ghana, calling for the expulsion of Apartheid South Africa, surprisingly won the majority vote for the reduced, but equally effective suspension of Apartheid, reversing the 1963 decision. Thereafter, ceaseless efforts by Sir Stanley to change this new status were successfully blocked by Africa. As many as 25 African countries were represented during this congress, Djan was re-elected to the FIFA Executive Committee.
Head of the Algerian delegation to the Seventh CAF General Assembly in Tunis, on November 11, 1965, Dr. Mohammad Maouche, criticised the structures of the organisation leading to the formation of a study committee to make amendments to the statutes and submit them at the Extraordinary Assembly in London in July 1966.
Tense FIFA-CAF relationship.
Although the protracted battle on the issue of Apartheid had caused numerous disagreements in successive FIFA Congresses; none came near to a breaking point as the scheme encouraged by Sir Stanley Rous, to establish a separate FIFA recognized regional Southern African Confederation, consisting mainly, of South Africa, Rhodesia, Mauritius, Madagascar, Botswana and Malawi, with the obvious intent of facilitating unchallenged readmission of Apartheid.
African Football leaders came across copies of the confidential communications on the issue and made it clear to Sir Stanley during an informal discussion just before the opening of the 1966 Congress in London, that all African Associations would walkout of the Conference Hall, if FIFA was not to withdraw its unofficial support to the divisive establishment of two independent Confederations in one continent. In a compromise last minute arrangement Sir Stanley retreated, avoiding the eminent walkout by all African Associations from this Congress and the ensuing publicity it would have provoked. This was a point in time when FIFA-CAF relations were strained to the limit, subsequent to the already declared African boycott of the 1966 FIFA World Cup hosted by England, refusing to share a single place with Asia. This was why, North Korea, winners of the Asian qualifiers got automatic spot in the finals, representing the two continents.
Suspension of Rhodesia.
The other notable contentious issue in successive meetings was the demand by most African nations for the suspension of Rhodesia. The African Football Confederation was again the first International sports institution to expel the Rhodesia Football Association from membership, only four days after the country's unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Five years later, the effort to expel Rhodesia from FIFA was taken to the Congress in Mexico City, 1970; Ydnekatchew Tessema was accompanied by renowned Ethiopian lawyer, and member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation, Tafari Benti, who assisted in preparing a legal case against Rhodesia's continued FIFA membership. African National Associations threatened to walk out if the congress did not endorse the Ethiopian argument. Concerned with the possibility of a last minute African boycott, Mexico, together with its supporters, voted in favor, thereby ensuring Rhodesia's suspension by a large majority vote.
As a result of a military coup d'état in Ghana, Djan was banned from any public gathering and was refused to travel to London. He was replaced by Tessema on the FIFA Executive Committee and a new statutes was adopted in July 1966. Among other things, the statutes stipulated the creation of six standing committees with the most important being the Organising Committee headed by Tessema.
Abdel Halim Mohammad becomes president.
The capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, hosted the Eighth CAF General Assembly on January 10, 1968. General Moustafa was not present and so lost his position to Dr. Abdel Halim, who was voted unanimously after Dr. Ahmad Bakr of Egypt withdrew his own candidature. Rito Alcantara from Senegal became Vice-President and was elected to the FIFA Executive Committee, as a third member, in case it was approved by FIFA. Tessema was re-elected to same position. CAF also agreed to collaborate with Supreme Council of Sports in Africa (SCSA) while also keeping its own independence.
But two years after these elections, the constituency protested that Dr Halim was not doing much towards the promised reforms. Thus, during the seventh edition of the Nations Cup in the Sudan 1970, twenty member associations signed a petition demanding the establishment of a special committee for thorough review and amendment of the statutes. Ydnekatchew Tessema was again elected chairman of this committee which included, Dr. Maouche (Algeria), Hamici (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Karrar (Sudan), Matthia (Togo), Mwade Wade (Senegal), and Chief Mensah (Ghana).
Africa demands FIFA gate income.
Later on, during FIFA Congress in Mexico prior to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Ethiopia proposed that FIFA should collect gate income percentage from matches between the four British associations (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland), so long as these Associations enjoy the privileges of four votes in the Congresses and four representations in the World Cups. This motion was defeated by 34 to 33 votes. Two years later, during the 1972 congress in Paris, the same motion on the four British Associations, presented by Uruguay, was adopted unanimously.
Senegal call for change.
FIFA President Rous was at the assembly in Yaoundé, as well as 28 national associations. A proposal by Senegal for an ad hoc committee to prepare a technical development programme that will help raise the standard of refereeing on the continent was approved. The proposed amendments to the statutes were adopted by the assembly following the support of 22 of the associations present.
Considering the noticeable interference by some elements from within and outside of the continent, who were striving to exploit this misunderstanding to further divide and weaken the Confederation, and thereby disrupt the necessary unity for the then nearly accomplished tasks of expelling Apartheid South Africa from FIFA, and achieving Africa's rightful places in the global body, Ydnekatchew Tessema, preferred not to publicize the works of the ad hoc committee. The situation was handled as an internal problem of the African Football Confederation that can only be resolved by its own general meeting.
Accordingly, the new statutes, quietly and cautiously, drafted by this ad hoc committee, were submitted to the Congress in Yaoundé. The assembly refused to discuss the amendments in detail and again empowered Ydnekatchew to preside over a new sub-committee entrusted with double checking the recommended changes. This committee worked until four o'clock in the morning and presented the final version to the Congress the next day.
The Congress in turn worked until five O'clock in the morning and adopted the new constitution of the Confederation. After two sleepless nights, the legislative for the first time asserted that it is in effect the supreme authority of the Confederation.
Tessema rules CAF.
During Yaoundé's assembly CAF President Dr. Abdel Halim Mohammad lost his seat to Tessema by 15 voices to 12, though it was said that Sir Stanley Rous, who supervised the elections, openly supported Dr. Abdel Halim during the elections. Professor Rene Essomba became first Vice-President while Alcantara was second Vice-President. Dr. Abdel Halim and Alcantara were elected to the FIFA executive committee. Egypt maintained the headquarters together with the African vice Presidency in FIFA. With Tessema as President and Mourad Fahmy as General Secretary, CAF broke new grounds.
Tessema did not inherit a ready made Confederation; peace in the Confederation and total focus on the overall developmental works of the Continent's football, prevailed only after this historic Congress in Yaoundé 1972. This is why he is still viewed by connoisseurs of the Confederation's history, as the most successful African football leader; who had resolved all early detractive problems and directed total focus towards the development of the game, not only for his era, but also, for the future of the continent's most popular sport.
It must be said here, that the differences due to this lengthy and detractive controversy; were confined to conference tables. The pioneers had always maintained enviable, mutual respect and brotherhood in their personal relationships.
In the following years, the continuous inclusion of newly liberated African countries strengthened the Confederation's position in the FIFA congresses, but, this positive development was accompanied by the undesirable by-product of Colonialism; the division between Arab Africa, Francophone Africa and Anglophone Africa, maintaining the "One Africa" motto began to be more and more complicated. This was, and still is, a challenge to unity in African football.
Tessema's quote controversy.
“CAF does not need any financial support. Its budget is very healthy and its receipts exceed its expenses every year,” declared a bullish Tessema in 1986. Yet, there is some controversy upon what was published in the February 2007 special edition of the CAF magazine 'CAFOOT' as The Tessemas official website denys such quotation, stating that ""The authors and/or publishers, can not produce a single evidence to substantiate this quotation. It is deliberately out of context and dishonest. Yidnekatchew had on several occasions since the beginning of unseen before revenue from live TV broadcast of the Cup of Nations, in Libya in 1982, declared, "CAF'S budget is healthy, and its receipts exceed its expenses every year", but, he had never said '""C.A.F. does not need any financial support"!!"
"In fact, until his last FIFA Congress, in Mexico 1986, he had fought to increase Africa's share from FIFA revenues. He had gone as far as demanding the need for the revision of the statutes of FIFA; one of the Major objectives being, the equitable distribution of its revenue among all the Confederations. This meant reducing from powerful Europe to increase Africa's share.""
New clubs competition evolved.
In 1975, the African Cup Winners' Cup was founded while three years later an African youth competition was first organised. In 1985, CAF organised a qualifying tournament for boys less than 16 years. The finances of the confederation improved remarkably as a result of an increase in the number of the competitions it organised. In 1982, CAF even sold the television and publicity rights of the Cup of Nations.
Tessema names Hayatou as a successor.
Eight months after 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, Tessema explained the nature of his illness to member associations of the African Football Confederation, and successfully appealed to them to vote for Omar Sey of Gambia in his place, in the 1988 elections; which he very well knew would be after his life. A few months later, this succession plan was complicated with the unexpected appointment of Omar Sey as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Gambia. However, Ydnekatchew was not prepared to give-up, easy; when the newly appointed Minister, visited Addis Ababa for a meeting of the Organization of African Unity, in June 1987, he invited him home and made one final effort to convince him to resign from his government position and run for the presidency of the Confederation. Omar did not offend his ailing colleague with an outright no, he said he would try, but also explained the difficulty and possible implications of submitting a resignation to his Head of State. At the end of this meeting, Ydnekatchew did not take time to announce his second choice, Issa Hayatou, in defending his surprise choice; he said that though being a newcomer to the Executive Committee, Issa was still better than any other potential candidate.
Only days before he died, he invited the First Vice President Dr. Halim, and the Secretary General Moustafa Fahmy, to Addis Ababa, and repeated to both of them that Issa was now the most appropriate choice for the job. Though in vain, he also pleaded with veteran Dr. Halim, to abandon his ambition to the presidency and take the responsibility of ensuring elections, free of external influences.
It is however not known, if the early support of by then already deceased Ydnekatchew had helped Issa win his first election at the Congress in Casablanca, seven months later.
Hayatou's era.
Issa Hayatou, who was President of the Fédération Camerounaise de Football (FECAFOOT) from 1986 to 1988, succeeded Tessema as CAF President at the General Assembly in Casablanca, in 1988. During the elections, Hayatou grabbed 22 votes as against 18 votes for the Togolese challenger Godfried Ekoué.
Under Hayatou' s leadership, African football has made giant strides. Until 1990, the African Cup of Nations paraded only eight finalists. However, through Hayatou's initiatives, this number has increased first in 1992 to 12 and since 1996 to 16 teams.
The Emergency Committee of the executive office of the African Football Confederation met on November 17, 2008, in Douala, Cameroon. The committee endorsed the candidatures for the forthcoming elections on the Executive Committee of CAF and FIFA to be held during the Congress in February 2009 in Lagos, Nigeria. Mr. Issa Hayatou, will go through the elections unopposed.
Today, CAF has 55 members, two members more than African Union as regard to Réunion and Zanzibar the CAF's associate members, unlike Western Sahara who is a member of the African Union but not of CAF.
CAF celebrates 50-year anniversary.
In 2007, CAF celebrated its 50-year anniversary through organising a series of festivals in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and South Africa so as to pay tribute to the four founding members.
CAF who was born on February 8, 1957 in Khartoum started celebrating his anniversary on February 7, 2007 in Cairo, through organising a Gala international friendly match between Egypt, the 2006 African Cup of Nations champions and Sweden to raise funds for charity. Egypt won the match 2:0, scored by Ahmad Fathy and Amro Zaki
During second part of the celebration CAF returned to its birthplace in Khartoum for its 28th General Assembly, the supreme authority of CAF. A forum on the future of African football and CAF member national associations’ General Secretaries workshop were organized by the African football continental body. A very successful congress, presenting a historical documentary, "The Anniversary Book, which was put together in a short time.
The third part of the celebration took place in Addis Ababa where the 2006 CAF Super Cup final took place, winner of CAF MTN Champions league and winner of CAF Confederation Cup. The match was played on February 18 between Al Ahly ( Egypt) and Étoile Sportive du Sahel (Tunisia) in Addis Ababa Stadium. Al Ahly won the match 5:4 on PSO after 0:0 draw during full-time.
The fourth and last part of the celebrations took place seven months later in South Africa with the annual CAF meeting and a Gala night as well as attending the international match between South Africa and Zambia in the qualification round for 2008 African Cup of Nations.
During its annual Awards nights in December 2007, the African football Confederation, in collaboration with Globacom, will reward the 10 best African players in the last 50 years.

Tysoe

Tysoe is a civil parish located in Warwickshire, England, north-west of Banbury. The three main settlements in the parish, Upper, Middle and Lower Tysoe are on a hill, hence the respective village names. Upper and Middle Tysoe have now merged, whereas Lower Tysoe is still separate, a little further north. The estimated population of the parish is 1,050, based on the 2001 UK Census.
The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and dates back to the 11th century. All three of the villages contain several 17th century buildings, especially Middle Tysoe which was once the main village of the parish. The local village primary school was opened in 1859 and has been extended in the 1980s and 2005. Compton Wynyates country house is just one kilometre south of the village. Joseph Ashby, the agricultural trade unionist, was born in the village in 1859; his biography was written by his daughter Kathleen Ashby, teacher and historian.
The parish once contained a hill figure, the Red Horse of Tysoe, which was recorded as early as 1607 but which is now lost.

St Julian's Church, Argelia

The St Julian's Church (in Spanish, "Iglesia de San Julián") is a colombian gothic revival church in Argelia (Department of Antioquia). The church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sonsón–Rionegro.
History.
In 1902, the bishop of Medellín, Joaquín Pardo Vergara, created the St Julian vice-parish ("Viceparroquia de san Julián"), which had approximately 3,000 inhabitants, and a simple straw chapel. That chapel was built by the Sonsón's priest, Daniel Florencio Sánchez, with the parishioner’s help. On June 26 of the same year, Juan Manuel Contreras is appointed as vice-parson. Like others, the St Julian vice-parish was created as a part of the parish of Sonsón.
On July 29 of 1903, Pardo Vergara, the first archbishop of Medellín, made a pastoral visit, but He was not in San Julián (now, Argelia). In the visit, the archbishop gave an authorization to the parson; present the inused ornaments to the vice-parish. Among that, a harmonium, the first in Argelia, played by the young Nacianceno Ramírez Pavas, future organist of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medellín for more than forty years.
One of the first goals of Contreras, was to build a church capable of accommodating all the parishioners. He requested the permission of the prelate, who immediately granted that. A directive assembly was created, with Juan Manuel Contreras as the president, Nazario López as vice-president, Vicente Flórez as treasurer, Primitivo Giraldo as secretary, and Críspulo Alzate as councilman, the same post of Ramón María Toro.
On August 23 of 1903, the first stone was laid with special solemnity and the accompaniment of Abel María Naranjo, foreign vicar and parson of Abejorral; Isaac Ángel, co-assistant of Sonsón; and Isaac Cardona, parson of Aquitania.
Argelia (old San Julián) was visited by the archbishop Manuel José Caicedo on August 28 of 1907, became himself in the first prelate visiting the vice-parish. In the epoch of the visit, the church was not initiated, excepting the “tapias” (walls) because the people preferred erect the curate’s home (casa cural). Caicedo encouraged the inhabitants of the village to contribute with the building, with money or personal work; giving priority to the church.
Towards the middle of 1911, a second pastoral visit was made by the archbishop Caicedo, Contreras was the vice-parson yet. In a certificate dated on 15th of the same month, the prelate mentions a beautiful guard gave by some local residents.
Thanks of the parson of Sonsón, Tiberio de Jesús Salazar y Herrera (future archbishop of Medellín), who made the suggestion, Caicedo promoted Contreras as co-assistant on April 25 of 1913. Nevertheless, Contreras died on July 6 of the same year. Contreras was followed by Salvador Vargas the same year, on May 25. Alzate, who designed the first emplacement of Argelia, was the director of the construction; and after, in August 1918, the archbishop created the parish of Argelia mediating his own decree. On April 29 of 1923, the people began the main facade using granite, obtained in a near quarry with the direction of Juan de Dios Díaz. On March 13 of 1927, the facade was almost finished, and the inside had the actual main altar.
In 1937, Vargas was removed and Alberto Londoño was named as his replacement. Vargas was the parson for nearly seven years and replaced the old doors by new best doors, and the brick floor was replaced by tiles. Furthermore, the clock was added, bought for $&nsbp;180. Originally, the clock was property of the Sonsón’s church, and later, part of the Jesus’s chapel (Capilla de Jesús), whose chaplain was Ramón Elías Botero. Vargas bought the chairs too.
Londoño was replaced by Mario Ángel, and He by Antonio Ángel in 1956. Antonio Ángel bought the via crucis, the lamps and the candelabrums. On March 18 of 1957, the Diocese of Sonsón was created (today, the Diocese of Sonsón-Rionegro), and the parish was became in part of the new diocese.

Hill people

Hill people is a general term for people who live in the hills and mountains. There are hill people around the world, many of whom live in stone houses and herd goats, sheep or camelids or have small farms. Musical instruments of the hill people, such as various forms of bagpipe and horn are notable for their ability to be heard at great distances. The hill people are often divided into tribes that have a tradition of feuding among each other while resisting control by any central government. Often the hill people are minorities in their countries, and are divided by political borders.
Africa.
Drakensberg.
The Drakensberg are the highest mountain range in Southern Africa, rising up to in height. The people of these mountains are mostly Bantu-speaking people who moved into the area from the north a thousand years ago, displacing the original Khoisan people. They include the Swazi, Xhosa and Zulu. Traditionally these people lived by cattle herding and small-scale farming, growing crops such as sorghum, maize, corn, pumpkins, beans and vegetables.
At the time the Europeans reached this part of South Africa (around 1830), the Zulu were temporarily in the ascendancy after a series of wars between the people of the region. The region is divided between South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, but the people move relatively freely between these states.
Ethiopian Highlands.
Ethiopia has a high central plateau that varies from 1,800 to 3,000 m (6,000 to 10,000 ft) above sea level, with the highest mountain reaching 4,533 m (14,872 ft). Near the equator but high up, the climate is temperate all year round. The heavy rains from June until mid-September feed the Blue Nile, which waters Egypt.
The country's population is highly diverse. Most of its people speak a Semitic or Cushitic language. The Oromo, Amhara, and Tigray make up more than three-quarters of the population, but there are more than 80 different ethnic groups within Ethiopia, including Somali, Gurage, Sidama, Wolayta, Afar, Hadiya and Gamo. Principal crops include coffee, pulses (e.g., beans), oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Many of the people traditionally herded cattle, goat or sheep.
The Ethiopian state is ancient, dating back to at least the Aksumite Empire (which officially used the name "Ethiopia" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots). The Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt (roughly 743-656 BC) was actually an Ethiopian dynasty. Despite two attempts at conquest by the Italians, the country has remained independent for almost all its history. The Coptic Christian church has a long history in Ethiopia, founded in 316 AD by a Meropius, Christian philosopher from Tyre.
Atlas and Rif.
The Atlas is a mountain range across a northern stretch of Africa extending about through Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, or the Maghreb. The highest peak is Jbel Toubkal, with an elevation of in southwestern Morocco. The second highest mountain is the M'Goun of .
The population of the Atlas Mountains are mainly Berber tribes, speakers of an Afro-Asiatic language, including the Kabyle, Chaoui, Mozabite, Riffians, Chleuh, Sous, Tuareg and Zenata. Although nominally subject at times to Carthage, the Roman Empire, the Fatimid dynasty of Egypt (who originated in this area), the Ottoman Turks and more recently the French, for most of their history the tribes of the Atlas mountains have effectively been independent.
Most Berbers are farmers, living in mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, but the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara are nomadic. The Berbers are sometimes treated as minorities in their countries, which are dominated by their Arabic-speaking relatives nearer to the coast.
Europe.
Pyrenees and Galicia.
The Pyrenees are a range of mountains in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain. Lower mountains extend to the west into Galicia. The inhabitants speak Spanish, French, Catalan (in Catalonia and Andorra), and the Basque language. A few speak the Occitan language (the Gascon and Languedocien dialects in France and the Aranese dialect in the Aran Valley), and Aragonese.
It is thought that Basque people are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by Strabo and Pliny, including the Vascones, the Aquitani and others. Their language is quite distinct from the Indo-European languages spoken in most of Europe, and possibly (although there is much debate) is related to Northeast Caucasian languages. The Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or ETA is an illegal and armed Basque nationalist, terrorist and separatist organisation. Founded in 1959, it evolved from a group advocating traditional cultural ways to a paramilitary group demanding Basque independence.
Alps.
The Alps are one of the great mountain ranges of Europe, stretching from Austria and Slovenia in the east; through Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany; to France in the west. The highest mountain is Mont Blanc, at 4,808 metres (15,774 ft), on the Italian–French border. The people of the Alps speak German, French, Italian, Slovene and Romansh. The German spoken in the German speaking part of Switzerland is a range of Swiss dialects.
Early Alpine tribes included the Helvetii and Alemanni. The Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps founded by three cantons in 1291, later expanding to form the nucleus of modern Switzerland. Disciplined Swiss mercenaries armed with pikes gained a formidable reputation during the perennial European wars of the Middle Ages.
In the Swiss peasant war of 1653 the people rose up against the nobles and authorities. Although defeated, the revolt resulted in reforms that prevented the rise of absolutism as in other parts of Europe. The Swiss to this day have an unusual form of government where almost all major decisions are voted upon by the people.
The Alpine people have at times been subject in part or whole to neighboring countries, but many in the central Alps maintained the independence of their communities until 1848, when they combined into the federal state of Switzerland.
Scottish Highlands.
The Scottish Highlands include the rugged and mountainous regions of Scotland north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault. They are inhabited by people of the Scottish Gaelic culture, although most now speak English. Traditionally the people lived by crofting, or small-scale farming, growing crops such as oats, barley and kale, and supplemented their diet with fish and red deer.
On festive occasions, the people eat haggis, made from a sheep's heart, liver and lungs, minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and boiled in the animal's stomach for three hours. The haggis was immortalized by the lowland poet Robert Burns in his "Address to a Haggis".
The Scottish clans have a tradition of feuding among each other and resisting the authority of the central government based in the lowland city of Edinburgh. They are a martial race. The Highland regiments went to war wearing tartan kilts accompanied by bagpipe players – a sight and sound calculated to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.
Balkans.
The Balkan Mountains run 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and eastern Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Stara planina are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev (2,376 m).
Lying between Austria, Italy, Turkey and the Ukraine, the Balkans have had a turbulent history. At different times different parts of the Balkans were controlled by the Macedonian, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Austrian empires.
The Balkans are home to people speaking Slavic languages (Serbs, Croats, Bulgarians and Macedonians), Romanian (related to Italian), Turkish, Greek, Albanian and other languages. Through its history many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them Thracians, Illyrians, Romans, Pechenegs, Cumans, Avars, Celts, Germans and various Germanic tribes. In addition to language, the people are divided by religion, adhering to the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Moslem religions among others.
Asia.
Caucasus.
The Caucasus Mountains is a range between the Black sea and the Caspian sea. It is home to Europe's highest mountain (Mount Elbrus). Modern countries of the Caucasus are Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Adyghea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay–Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Krasnodar Krai and Stavropol Krai, all parts of the Russian Federation, and the independent countries of Georgia (including the disputed Abkhazia and South Ossetia), Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey.
The people of these mountains have very diverse origins, with cultures influenced by periods of Turkic, Iranian and Russian control. Some, including the Georgians and Armenians, are mostly Christian, while others are Muslim in religion.
Hindu Kush and Balochistan.
The Hindu Kush is a mountain range located between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is the westernmost extension of the Pamir Mountains, the Karakoram Range, and is a sub-range of the Himalayas. Lower mountains including the Sulaiman Range extend south to the Arabian Sea.
The people of this region are generally speak Indo-Iranian languages such as Pashto, Balochi, and languages of the Dardic and Nuristani groups. The Brahui people speak a Dravidian language. There are many distinct tribes. The history of the region has been turbulent, lying in the path of invasions from the Persians, the Greeks under Alexander the Great, the Arabs, Mughals and British. Given the rugged geography, central governments have generally had limited control over the tribes, a situation that persists to this day.
Pamirs.
The Pamir Mountains are in Central Asia, formed by the junction of the Tian Shan, Karakoram, Kunlun, and Hindu Kush ranges. They are among the world's highest mountains and in Victorian times they were known as the 'Roof of the World'. The people of this region are mostly Turkic people, and speak Pamir languages, Tajik (closely related to Persian), Uzbek and Kyrgyz.
Himalayas.
The Himalayas lie between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau, thrown up by the collision of two tectonic plates. They include world's highest peaks including Mount Everest and K2. The Himalayas stretch across Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
People have filtered into the mountains from the northern plateau and from the southern plains and intermingled. They mostly speak Tibeto-Burman languages such as Gurung and Nepal Bhasa or Indo-Aryan languages such as Shina, Kashmiri, Dogri, Pahari (which means "language of the mountain people"), Kumaoni, Nepali and Asamiya. The Gurkha people of Nepal are well known for their history of bravery and strength, and still serve in foreign armies such as the British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas and the Indian Army's Gorkha regiments.
Fruit, vegetables and sheep flourish in the fertile valley of Kashmir. The people have evolved the unique and famous Kashmiri cuisine with Iranian, Indian and Turkic origins. While the stricter Hindus may restrict themselves to rice with vegetables, curd, milk and fresh fruit, the Muslims eat pilaf and mutton stuffed with spices, apricots stuffed with mutton, roast kid, fish and honey rice.
Further east, a typical Nepalese meal includes "Dal", a spicy lentil soup, served over "bhat" (boiled rice) with "tarkari" (curried vegetables) together with "achar" (pickles) or "chutni" (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients). In the hills of Nepal, people enjoy their own kind of music, playing sarangi (a string instrument), madal (a hand drum) and flute. They also have many popular folk songs known as lok geet and lok dohari.
South-East Asia.
The mainland portion of Southeast Asia consists of Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam, and Assam in India. The hills of this region include tribes of Tibeto-Burman peoples including the Akha, Bodo-Kachari, Lahu, Karen, Hmong Mien, Mizo and Lisu. It is thought that they drifted down into the area from Tibet.
Many of the tribes are spread across more than one country - the Karen people live in Burma and Thailand, the Zou people live in Burma and India, and the Akha people live in small villages among the mountains of China, Laos, Burma, and northern Thailand. They often retain their traditional way of life but are under increasing pressure to do so. As minorities, they tend to be less well off than the majority of people in the countries where they live.
An interesting theorisation about the Hill people from this region is "Zomia". Zomia (geography) is a geographical term coined in 2002 by historian Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam to refer to the huge massif of mainland Southeast Asia that has historically been beyond the control of governments based in the population centers of the lowlands. The massif arose during the Alpine orogeny, when the African, Indian and Cimmerian Plates, and smaller Asian terranes, collided with that of Eurasia. The name is from Zomi, a term for highlander common to several related Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the India-Bangladesh-Burma border area.
The exact boundaries of Zomia differ among scholars: all would include the highlands of north Indochina (north Vietnam and all Laos,) Thailand, the Shan State of northern Burma, and the mountains of Southwest China, others extend the region as far West as Tibet, north India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. These areas share a common elevated, rugged terrain, and have been the home of ethnic minorities that have preserved their local cultures by residing far from state control and influence. Other scholars have used the term to discuss the similar ways that Southeast Asian governments have handled minority groups. Once such is Yale University Professor James C. Scott, who address the issue in his 2009 book "The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia". From the Preface:“tribes seen from the valley kingdoms as “our living ancestors,” “what we were like before we discovered wet-rice cultivation, Buddhism, and civilization” on the contrary best understood as runaway, fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia, been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the valleys — slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare.” 
The region covers more than 2.5 million square kilometers known as the "Southeast Asian Massif" and comprises nearly one hundred million marginal peoples. This large area is inside the fringe of nine states and at the middle of none, stretching across the standard regional designations (South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia); along with its ecological diversity and its relation to states, it arouses a lot of interest. It stands for an original entity of study, a type of international Appalachia, and a different way in which to study regions.
Thailand.
A 2013 article in Bangkok Post said that "Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders _ criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land".
New Guinea Highlands.
New Guinea, located just north of Australia, is the world's second-largest island. A central east-west mountain range dominates the geography of New Guinea and contains the highest mountains in Oceania, rising up to 4884 m high. The island is populated by very nearly a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. They fall into one of two groups, speakers of the Papuan languages and later arrivals who speak Austronesian languages.
The gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm/yr (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. The people use complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Native gardeners are as or more successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops. Early garden crops – many of which are indigenous – included sugarcane, Pacific bananas, yams, and taro, while sago and pandanus were two commonly exploited native forest crops. Today's staples – sweet potatoes and pigs – are later arrivals.
The people of New Guinea were traditionally warlike, with constant feuds over territory, although violence has greatly reduced in recent years.
Americas.
Appalachians.
The Appalachian Mountains are a vast system of mountains in eastern North America. Before the Europeans reached the area around 1650, the mountains were inhabited by Algonquian people; speakers of Iroquoian languages such as the Cherokee; and Siouan people such as the Occaneechi, Tutelo and Monacan. The European invaders were ruthless in their treatment of these hill people, many of whom they killed or forced to move into unfamiliar territory to the west. Many others died of diseases such as smallpox introduced from Europe. Few of the early inhabitants remain.
Some of the people who live in the mountains today retain distinct cultural characteristics. The Hatfield-McCoy feud (1878–1891) involved two warring families of the West Virginia–Kentucky backcountry along the Tug Fork River, off the Big Sandy River. Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families. The 1972 film Deliverance depicted the hill people as backward and hostile to outsiders, and the film implies some of them are inbred – a stereotype of the "Hillbilly" culture.
Rocky Mountains.
The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from northernmost British Columbia, in Canada, to New Mexico, in the United States. The range's highest peak is Mount Elbert in Colorado at 14,440 feet (4,401 meters) above sea level.
As the Europeans continued to move west, they took most of the lands of the people who lived in the Rockies, forcing the Ute, Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Yaqui and other tribes to assimilate or move onto reservations. Some adapted to farming or sheep herding, but they are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups in the USA.
The Ancient Pueblo Peoples who lived in the present-day Four Corners area of the Southwest United States were noted for their distinctive pottery and dwelling construction styles. The cultural group is often referred to as the Anasazi. Some of their unusual cliff dwellings still stand today.
Western United States.
Ishi (c. 1860 – March 25, 1916) was presumed to be the last member of the Yahi people, the last surviving group of the Yana people in the U.S. state of California. What is now the Western United States has long been home to indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, who live mainly in desert regions and share characteristic with hill people.
Mexican Sierras.
The American Cordillera in Mexico includes the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre del Sur. The mountain valleys have a temperate climate and fertile soil, and were the cradles of Mesoamerican civilizations that flourished long before Europeans discovered the area, including the Olmec, Teotihuacán, Toltec, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec cultures. The bold patterns and deep saturated colors of the Mesoamerican artists are echoed in modern Mexican art and architecture.
After the Spanish invasion of 1519, led by Hernán Cortés, most people eventually adopted the Spanish language, but there remain many groups who retain their original languages and live traditional ways of life. These include the Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomí, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Mazahua, Mazateco, Chinantec, Purépecha, Mixe and Tlapanec.
The traditional Mexican diet is based on Maize, beans, Chili peppers, Tomatoes, Cactus and other native plants, supplemented by iguana, rattlesnake, fish and venison. Mexican cuisine today is one of the most rich and varied in the world. Before the Spanish came, the inhabitants of the land used drums, flutes, maracas, sea shells and voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico.
Andes.
The Andes form the world's longest exposed mountain range, a continuous chain of highland along the western coast of South America. The range is over long, 200–700 km (300 miles) wide (widest between 18° to 20°S latitude), and of an average height of about 4,000 m (13,000 ft).
Before the Spanish invasion led by Francisco Pizarro in 1532 the Andes were primarily inhabited by Quechua peoples such as the Inca, Chancas, Huancas and Cañaris in the north, and Aymaras further south. Their economy was based on the potato crop, which originated in the area, and the llama and alpaca, used for their wool and meat. Unlike most mountain people, the inhabitants of the Andes appear to have been generally unwarlike.

<doc id="20709007" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20709007" title="Solid surface">
Solid surface

Solid surface is a man-made material usually composed of marble dust, bauxite, acrylic or polyester resins and pigments. It is most frequently used for seamless countertop installations.
Performance characteristics.
Solid surface is a non-porous low-maintenance countertop surface. It can mimic the appearance of stone, wood and other naturally occurring materials, and can be joined invisibly by a trained craftsman. Typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops, solid surface can also be cast into a variety of shapes, including sinks, shower pans and bathtubs. Sheet goods can also be heated and bent into three-dimensional shapes using a process called thermoforming, which adds to the versatility of the product. Color and design flexibility are key factors when choosing engineered composites over natural stone.
In a residential setting, solid surface can be used as kitchen countertops, bathroom vanity tops, and shower and tub surrounds. Countertop fabricators typically join solid surface sheets into desired shapes using a two-part adhesive, after which the cured joint is machined flat. The same method is used to create extra thick edges, which can be machined using tools and techniques similar to those used to work hardwoods.
A major appeal of solid surface is its seamless nature. Engineered composites have a gel coat surface finish which makes them impervious to bacteria, staining and most of the problems inherent in natural stone. Solid surface sinks can be joined to the countertop surface with no gaps, which eliminates areas for water to collect and bacteria to grow. Integral backsplashes can also be created that follow the contours of the wall “seamlessly” and without gaps.
Should the material become scratched or broken, solid surface can, in most cases, be repaired quickly by a certified solid surface repair company or trained fabricator. Because the surface is solid throughout, a countertop that has undergone years of wear and tear can be refinished. The installed product is available in a variety of finishes, ranging from matte to high-gloss, although most manufacturers recommend a matte or satin finish for ease of maintenance.
Availability.
Solid surface is available in hundreds of colors and visual textures, ranging from solid colors to marbleized, granite effect or wood grain. Cultured marble, cultured granite, and cultured onyx describe solid surfaces colored to resemble natural stone. Dozens of multinational companies manufacture solid surface sheet goods and sinks for the world market; and hundreds of smaller, regional manufacturers produce for local markets. 
Although solid surface faces competition from natural stone and quartz surfacing, the material is popular in Asia, particularly in residential new construction. An emerging market for solid surface is in commercial and industrial settings, where its non-porous characteristics, combined with durability, renew-ability and form-ability make it the material of choice for many designers and architects. Also appealing, is the wide range of colors and textures, as well as the ability to custom-color the material for large projects. Hospitals, in particular, employ large amounts of solid surface for sinks, showers, nursing stations and wall cladding, because its seamless properties eliminate gaps and crevices that harbor harmful bacteria.
Manufacture.
Solid surface is manufactured by mixing acrylic or polyester resin with powdered bauxite filler and pigments. The material chemically cures and is heated to 60°C or more. Cured material is then cut in sheets or shapes and sanded on one or both sides depending the brand used. Sometimes the material is brought to 160°C and cooled, to improve its heat resistance.
Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be mixed one sheet at a time using different formulations, effects and appearances. Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be injected into molds to produce various solid decorative design figures.
Since first being introduced by Dupont in 1964 under the name of Corian, other manufacturers have also introduced their brands as well. Other brands include CMMA Solid Surface, Avonite, Meganite, Wilsonart, Visioneer, Formica, Mystera, Karadon, Swanstone and others.
Solid-surface manufacturing companies may be members of the trade organizations American Composites Manufacturers Association and ICPA (International Cast Polymer Association). These organizations identify the product under the "brand" of MasterCast Engineered Composites.
Fabrication.
A "surface fabricator" shapes and installs functional and decorative surfaces, usually in buildings. Surface fabrication, as a distinct professional enterprise, usually involves complex tasks of surface shaping. A leading case is countertop fabrication.
Materials.
For interior spaces, surfaces include solid coverings or decking for floors or walls, and countertops for kitchens, bathrooms, and workspaces. Natural surfaces are composed of naturally occurring materials like wood, stone, mineral, clay, gum and resin. Synthetic surfaces contain, in addition to any natural materials, man-made substances such as metal alloys or polymers. Solid surfaces are synthetic surfaces manufactured from polymeric materials.
Tools.
Tools of surface fabrication include routers, drills, templates, clamps, ovens, suction cup grips, and table saws. Larger surface fabricators may also use CNC routers. For all but the simplest jobs, surface fabrication usually takes place in the workshop, after which the finished product is assembled and installed at the work site. Installation of multi-part surfaces, such as "L" and "U" shaped countertops, often involves complex work with specialized tools, to create a seamless result.
Applications.
Solid surfaces is used in the following environment:
Solid surface is priced to compete with natural stone or quartz surfacing. It is available in many colors and patterns. The material can be formed to shape, which makes it appealing to commercial and industrial designers. Specialist fabricators possess the skills and knowledge necessary to provide advice and customer service. 
Certain high-heat applications (anything above 400 F /200 C) are discouraged, due to the danger of cracking. Because scratches in solid surface appear white to the human eye, most dark colors are not recommended for high use areas.

Russ Tobin was described as a good looking man, 6 feet tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. At the beginning of the books he is reported to be 22 years old. He was a bit of a ladies' man, often seducing as many as four women per book. Tobin did not settle down with any of them though, preferring one night stands. He did come across one or two women that he briefly fell in love with, but his love of travel (and most certainly of meeting and conquering new women across the globe) meant that he basically ran from those kinds of relationships.
Tobin had lots of different jobs. He started out as a sewing machine salesman, went on to becoming a debt collector, had a brief career in TV ads for selling washing powder, and then started to work and travel overseas. He was a courier (which was the equivalent of a tour guide) on the Spanish isle of Majorca. He worked as a safari guide in Kenya, a Santa Claus in Canada, a male escort in Australia, and finally a film star in Hollywood.
Tobin's exact global itinerary throughout the series of novels is Liverpool; London; Majorca; Nairobi; Nassau; Miami; New York; Toronto; Las Vegas; Tahiti; Sydney; Ireland; Los Angeles; and Brighton.
Friends of Tobin's.
Tobin had several friends in the series, most notably a larrikin Aussie called Buzz Malone. Frequently, Tobin gets into trouble with his mates, usually running from the police, or getting into a fight in a bar. They usually save one another from any scrapes they get into.
Also, Tobin and his friends often pick up two girls in a bar or a nightclub, (but they sleep with them in different rooms- Tobin is not that close with his mates!)
Tobin On Screen.
Although several deals were discussed in 1970s to adapt the Russ Tobin novels for the screen, nothing was ever finalised. However, in 2008 Pillay Evans Productions signed an agreement to begin production of a film called "Make Way For Tobin".

Euspira catena

Euspira catena, previously known as Natica catena, common name the large necklace shell, is a medium-sized species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Naticidae, the moon snails. 
Description.
The rounded shell is thin and polished and brownish-yellow, with a row of reddish markings just below the suture of the last whorl. It can grow to about and has a short spire and seven rounded whorls separated with distinct sutures. The lowest whorl occupies about 90% of the volume. It has a large umbilicus and the operculum is ear-shaped and spirally wound. The foot is cream coloured and very large, partially covering the shell when the animal is moving. The head has two long flattened tentacles and a short snout with extensible proboscis. The large necklace shell might be confused with a similar but smaller species, the common necklace shell ("Euspira pulchella").
Distribution.
The large necklace shell is found on the coasts of Northwest Europe, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Skagerrak and in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean.
Biology.
The large necklace shell lives buried in the sand and gravel of the lower shore and the neritic zone to depths of 125 metres. It feeds on bivalve molluscs, penetrating their shells with its proboscis and sucking out the contents.
Egg capsules are laid in a spirally wound collar of jelly embedded with sand grains. The remains of these may be found on the beach.

Iraq–Serbia relations

Iraqi–Serbian relations are foreign relations between Iraq and Serbia. Iraq has an embassy in Belgrade, and Serbia has an embassy in Baghdad.
In recent times, relations between Iraq and Serbia consist of mostly military trade. In 2010, Serbian foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić said after talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki that Serbia and Iraq share a common stance on international law and issues of territorial integrity and sovereignty.
History.
Yugoslav relations with Ba'ath-era Iraq.
The state of Yugoslavia established a large engineering and technology presence in Iraq from when Saddam Hussein entered office in his country. Upon the 2003 Iraq invasion, Western military analysts referred to maps and advice from former engineers of the now-defunct Serbian company Aeroinzenjering, which had built Saddam Hussein's underground bunkers along with many airports in Iraq by the 1980s. 
Later on, in the 1990s when FR Yugoslavia was isolated by Western sanctions, Belgrade-based Yugoimport designed and built Ba'ath party headquarters in Baghdad along with an additional five underground bunkers for Saddam Hussein; Yugoimport's blueprints of the bunkers in which Hussein and loyalists hid during the United States merited enough importance that they were handed over to the United States when the invasion began.
A rumor was speculated by the media in 1999 during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia when Serbia's Slobodan Milošević and Iraq's Saddam Hussein allegedly negotiated a discreet military alliance that would improve their ability to defy the West and withstand Allied bombing attacks, along with low-profile support from Russia and China, according to reports from London.
Boka Star seizure.
In 2002, a Yugoslav ship "Boka Star", owned by a Montenegrin named Marko Balić was seized by the United States Navy after it was tipped off to have a large weapons shipment to Iraq. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was one of the only countries in the world to have continued military shipments to Iraq during sanctions against Iraq and the Hussein regime. The shipment was attempted just a year before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Trade.
In March 2008, Serbia signed a $235 million-dollar deal to export weapons and military equipment to Iraq. The deal included the delivery of 20 Utva Lasta aircraft to the Iraqi Air Force, all of which were delivered by early 2012. Information was presented by Serbia's defense minister Dragan Šutanovac. The two nations also stated the wish to plan to bolster defense ties, which would possibly include joint weapons production.

Knud Agger

Knud Agger (26 September 1895 – 2 February 1973) was a self-taught Danish painter. After a series of paintings from everyday life, he became ever involved in painting his family, home and garden at Helsingør in the north of the island of Zealand. With time, his work took on a visionary and strongly existentialist character.
Biography.
Knud Agger was originally from Holstebro in Jutland but moved to Copenhagen to study architecture at the architecture school of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. He returned to his native region in 1928 to paint landscapes of Limfjorden and Venø. In 1929, he moved to Helsingør where he remained until his death in 1973.
In 1939, he completed three large paintings to be hung in the new state high school at Struer. One of the paintings shows the town of Struer and its harbour, the two others present scenes from Klovvig on the island of Venø. After the war, Agger frequently returned to his summerhouse on Venø where he worked on numerous landscapes and sketches until heart problems put an end to his journeys there in 1965. 
In his later years, he focused increasingly on using stones he had found on Venø as a basis for his skies. With time, the stones totally dominated his work. One of the paintings earned him the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1971.
Knud Agger's final work was an 8m tall stained glass window at Abildgård's Church in Frederikshavn.

Planine

Planine () is a work of prose fiction, generally considered to be the first Croatian novel. It was written by Petar Zoranić in 1536 and published posthumously in Venice in 1569. 
The story tells about a poet's imaginary seven-day journey across Croatian mountains on which he embarks in order to forget his love miseries. But, the principle line of the story is patriotic in character. It is composed of 24 chapters, and the introductory contains a dedication to Matej Matijević, the canon of Nin.
Plot summary.
The main hero is the shepherd Zoran (i.e. Zoranić himself), which for seven years has been suffering from unrequited love towards a maiden Jaga. One morning, wandering around, he arrives to a well called Vodica, having gotten bored with his life. Suddenly from a well a fairy Zorica (Napeja) appears, advising him to go for the mountains to find a particular plant which will cure his love pain. Then on a golden apple he makes a notice of a beautiful fairy Grace (Milošća) which transfers him across the seas to Podgorje, where he continues the journey by himself. But, soon he runs into a beast, from which Grace saves him and leads him by safer pathways. Afterwards, he arrives to the Gates of hell (Paklenica), where the fairy tells him a tale on a young maiden Bura. 
The next day Zoran meets a company of shepherds with whom he spends the next three days. On the fifth day, Zoran hears from shepherds a story on the origin of Velebit and heads further to the east. There he discovers a small group of shepherds that complains of being attacked by the wolves from eastern sides (i.e. Turks), which has caused many of the shepherds to flee those areas. The next day Zoran is contacted by a fairy Consciousness (Svist) who directs him to the fairy Dinara. Dinara frees him by her magic powers from his love sufferings. Then Zoran dreams a vision of four fairies in a "gardens of Glory" ("perivoj od Slave"). These are the fairies Latinness (Latinka), Helleness (Grkinja) and Croatess (Hrvatica). While the first three hold in their arms a handful of golden apples (the symbol of a literary piece), the fairy Croatess is poor and makes a complaint on the small number of literary pieces written in folk language. The sixth day Zoran heads for home, but on his way he meets Dinara's daughter, fairy Krka, which drives him across Knin, Skradin and Šibenik down to the mouth of Krka (where she makes her disappearance). Thence, fairy Grace returns him back to Zaton, the place of his departure. There he finds a grave of Juraj Divnić, the bishop of Nin, and swears to follow the path of Lord's love.
Meaning and edification.
Zoranić lived in times of a great danger from invading Ottoman Turks, and that consciousness has inspired his work; it pervaded it with patriotic fervour, against which all poet's personal sufferings, wishes and troubles pale and retreat.
It is a pastoral-allegorical novel (a very common type of prose in that period), written mostly in prose but with many passages in verse. Typologically it's a unique piece of its kind in Croatian literature, with motifs borrowed from Latinate and Italian literatures, with clearly discernible influences of Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, Jacopo Sannazaro, as well as domicile writers such as Marko Marulić and Croatian "začinjavci".
"Planine" are in fact an allegory: they are a dream, transferred to the alleged Zoran's path from Nin across the sea to Starigrad under the Velebit, and thence uphills, over Paklenica, across the Velebit, and from Lika to Dinara, where he would by the river of Krka settle down to Šibenik and thence by the sea back to Nin. Accompanied by stanzas of Petrarchan and pastoral voice, Zoranić's novel, imbuing with life an Arcadian idyll, echoes with "sorrowful shpard's tune of dispersed legacy" ("tužbenim pojem pastirov od rasute bašćine"), but it also answers the call of fairy Croatess in the gardens of glory (chapter 20): she objurgates Croats who "many sapient and lettered are, who thyself and their tongue joyously appraise and deck apt are" ("mnozi mudri i naučeni jesu, ki sebe i jazik svoj zadovoljno pohvaliti i naresiti umili bi") but are ashamed of their Croatian language ("jezika hrvackoga") and rather prefer to write in a foreign tongue. So Zoranić, three centuries before the advent of the Illyrian movement, made a defense of the Croatian language, which is one of the most important attributes of this piece.

<doc id="20709270" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20709270" title="Child sex ratio">
Child sex ratio

In India, the Child Sex Ratio is defined as the number of females per thousand males in the age group 0–6 years in a human population. Thus it is equal to 1000 x the reciprocal of the sex ratio (ratio of males to females in a population) in the same age group, i.e. under age seven. Obviously an imbalance in this age group will extend to older age groups in future years. Currently the ratio of males to females is generally significantly greater than 1, i.e. there are more boys than girls.
According to the decennial Indian census, the sex ratio in the 0-6 age group in India went from 104.0 males per 100 females in 1981, to 105.8 in 1991, to 107.8 in 2001, to 109.4 in 2011. The ratio is significantly higher in certain states such as Punjab and Haryana (126.1 and 122.0, as of 2001).
Impact of skewed ratio.
The impact of the current skewed sex ratio with more male children than females is already being felt in some parts of India, and is likely to continue to be so felt:

Donald Brown (American football)

Donald Eugene Brown II (born April 11, 1987) is an American football running back for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League. He was the starting running back for the University of Connecticut Huskies from 2006 to 2008.
High school career.
Brown attended Red Bank Catholic High School in Red Bank, New Jersey. During his senior year, Brown rushed for 2,032 yards and 27 touchdowns. Considered a three-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Brown was listed as the No. 53 running back prospect in the nation in 2005. He picked Connecticut over Wisconsin on December 8, 2004.
College career.
Brown signed a national letter of intent to enroll at UConn on February 2, 2005. He would conclude his collegiate career as the all-time leading rusher for Connecticut with 3,800 yards. After rushing for over 2,000 yards in his junior year, Brown decided to forgo his senior year to enter the 2009 NFL Draft.
2006 season.
Brown entered his redshirt freshman season in 2006 as a kickoff returner and second string running back behind senior captain and incumbent starter, Terry Caulley. Brown showed flashes of his running ability in the first game of the year, when he rushed for 118 yards on only 9 carries, including a 53 yard touchdown run, against Rhode Island. He would play primarily on special teams for the first half of the year. However, when Caulley went down with an injury before Connecticut's game against Rutgers on October 29, Brown was asked to make his first career start at running back. He made the most of this opportunity, as he rushed for 199 yards on 28 carries and 2 touchdowns. This performance proved to be too good to ignore, as he was awarded the starting job for the rest of the season. Brown had his best outing of his freshman campaign in the next game when he rushed for 205 yards on 43 carries with 3 touchdowns (1 receiving) in Connecticut's 46–45 double overtime win over Pittsburgh. Brown would average 134 yards per game in the five Big East games that he started. He finished the year with 896 yards and 9 touchdowns (2 receiving), which was good enough to award him with a 2nd team All Big East nomination.
2007 season.
Brown began his sophomore season with heightened expectations brought on by his very successful rookie campaign. However, nagging injuries combined with the emergence of fellow sophomore Andre Dixon would hamper his sophomore season. He would finish the year with 821 yards and 8 touchdowns, which was good for second on the team, behind Dixon. Twice, Brown ran for 100 yards in a game (against Rutgers and West Virginia) and just missed two more by rushing for 99 yards against Duke and Syracuse.
2008 season.
A pre-season ankle injury to Dixon would cement Brown as the Huskies starting running back for the start of his junior season. It would be a position that he would not relinquish. Brown would begin the year with eight straight 100 yard games and would twice eclipse the 200 yard mark (against Temple and Virginia). He arguably had his best performance in the second game of the year as he rushed for 214 yards on 36 carries and the game's only touchdown against Temple, in a game played in a monsoon due to Tropical Storm Hannah. Included in his 214 yards was every one of Connecticut's 25 yards in overtime. Brown rushed for 150 yards in the eighth game of the season at home in a 40–16 Connecticut victory over eventual Big East champion Cincinnati. These 150 yards increased his season total to 1,324, which set a new Connecticut single-season record. The old tally of 1,262 had been set by Tory Taylor in 1995. Brown needed only eight games to break Taylor's record. Brown continued his record breaking season in the tenth game at Syracuse. In that game, he rushed for 131 yards on 31 attempts. A 49-yard touchdown run in the second quarter would allow Brown to surpass Caulley as Connecticut's all time leading rusher. Brown would finish the regular season with 1,822 yards, which placed him first for rushing in the NCAA Division I FBS. His performance awarded him the Big East Offensive Player of the Year. On January 3, 2009, Brown was named Player of the Game in UConn's 38–20 victory over the University at Buffalo in the 2009 International Bowl in Toronto. He finished the game with 261 yards rushing (208 in the first half) and a touchdown. He finished the season with 2,083 rushing yards, becoming only the 14th player in FBS history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. On January 8, 2009, Brown was named Eastern College Athletic Conference Player of the Year.Following the International Bowl, Brown announced his intention to enter the 2009 NFL Draft.
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
Brown was considered one of the top three running back prospects available in the draft (alongside Knowshon Moreno and Chris Wells) and drew comparisons to Willie Parker. He was drafted with the 27th pick in the 2009 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts. Brown became the first Connecticut Husky ever to be picked in the first round of an NFL Draft.
Indianapolis Colts.
Brown signed a five-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts on August 2, 2009. In his first action as a member of the team, Brown ran for 58 yards on five carries against the Minnesota Vikings in the first week of the preseason.
He scored his first touchdown on September 21, 2009 against the Miami Dolphins in a 27–23 Colts win. On December 19, 2010, Donald recorded his first 100+ yard game in a 34–24 win against the Jaguars.
Brown saw increased playing time during the 2011 Regular Season. He had his best game as a professional in a Week 15 27–13 win over the Tennessee Titans when he rushed 16 times for 161 yards and scored a touchdown on an 80-yard run in the fourth quarter to seal the first victory of the season for Indianapolis.
Brown's 2012 season was hampered by some nagging injuries and the showing of rookie back Vick Ballard. He wasn't very effective the entire season, posting no 100 yard games and only one rushing touchdown.
Brown was originally not a starter for the Colts in the 2013 season. However, due to injuries and lack of production from other running backs Brown was named the starting running back against the Tennessee Titans in Week 13. He ran for 54 yards and a touchdown. He would remain the starter for the remainder of the regular season.

Reo Coordination Language

In computer science, Reo is a channel-based exogenous coordination language.
Overview.
In the context of distributed application, correctness and validity of single processes does not imply the correctness of the whole system. In such systems, the communication between the processes is of a high importance. These communications can be implemented within the process but the maintenance of such built-in communications can be a problem. However, communications and interactions protocols can be specified using coordination languages. 
Reo is a coordination language designed and proposed by Farhad Arbab at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in 2001. The first formal semantics of Reo was developed by Farhad Arbab and Jan Rutten in terms of a coalgebraic model of streams. Christel Baier et al. introduced Constraint Automata to express the operational semantics of Reo. Reo constitutes a strategic long-term research activity of the SEN3 research group at CWI.
A typical Reo model consists of connectors. A more complex connector can be built up using simpler connectors. In each channel there exist a number of Channels and Nodes.
Two nodes communicate through a channel which has two ends. A channel end can be source or sink depending on accepting or dispensing data into / out of its channel. The behaviour of a channel specifies how the channel affect the data flow through its ends which defined by its type. An effect of this type can be, for example, the content, the conditions for loss, and/or creation of data go through the channel ends, or the atomicity, exclusion, order, and/or timing of their passage. 
There is no limitation on the behaviour of a channel. Therefore, new types of channels can be used simultaneously with other channels in a model.
Tool support.
The current implementation of Reo tool is developed in the Scala programming language, and runs on JVM (Java). A more detailed description, with the code, examples, and documentation, can be found in the Reo tool web page.
Animation.
Animating the Reo circuit is a good way to better understanding its behaviour. Such examples can be found in a repository of Reo connectors.
Model checking.
Reo models can be checked using model checker Vereofy and the mCRL2 toolset.

This is a list of members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly between the 25 March 1916 election and the 31 May 1919 election. At the 1916 election, no party won a majority, and the Liberals' Walter Lee became Premier of Tasmania. During the term, the Liberal Party converted into the new Nationalist Party, and the Labor Party split over conscription. However, most of the Parliamentary Labor Party stayed with the executive, and the two MHAs who left the Party switched to federal politics. The state of flux, however, resulted in four seats switching from Labor to Nationalist at by-elections and recounts.
All members listed here as Nationalists who held office prior to 1917 were previously known as Liberals.

FDR Suite at Adams House, Harvard University

The FDR Suite (often abbreviated fdrsuite) is a set of rooms at Adams House, Harvard College that were occupied by the 32nd president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from 1900-1904. Currently under restoration, the Suite is being refurbished as a living museum and memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
Background.
In January 1900, 18-year old Roosevelt and his Groton friend Lathrop Brown engaged rooms in Westmorly Court, (now B-Entry of Adams House). Built in 1898 and designed by the noted architects Warren and Wetmore (who also were responsible for Grand Central Station in New York) Westmorly was the newest and most luxurious building on what was called Harvard's Gold Coast, an area of luxury apartments for wealthy University students. The first floor suite chosen by FDR was equipped with all the latest innovations – central steam heat, electricity, a modern "hygienic" bathroom, and contained over of living space spread across four rooms, with 14' ceilings, French doors, and a working fireplace – all this when only a few buildings at the College enjoyed such modern conveniences. The rooms were meticulously decorated in high Edwardian style by FDR's mother Sara Delano Roosevelt and FDR himself, and were used by FDR during his entire four years at Harvard.
After FDR left Harvard, the rooms were occupied by a succession of students until 1961. In June 1961, during Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to the College, the former first lady dedicated a plaque commemorating FDR's time there, and the rooms were converted into a study, officially named the "The FDR Suite". After a brief return to student housing in the early 2000s, the rooms were finally set aside in perpetuity with the intention of creating Harvard's first memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The Restoration Plan.
Currently, the Suite is the subject of an ambitious restoration plan. The goal is to return to the rooms to their original appearance, complete with period furnishings, fixtures, wall coverings, and ephemera relating to FDR and Harvard life in 1900. When completed, the FDR Suite will be the only existing memorial to the former President at Harvard, as well as a vibrant document of College student life at the turn of the twentieth century. 
The project's honorary chair is Drew Gilpin Faust, President of Harvard University; the project's chair is Judith Palfrey M.D., the master of Adams House, guided by a scholarly advisory board that includes, among others, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and Dr. Cynthia Koch, Director of the FDR Presidential Library and Museum at Hyde Park; in addition, Dr. Palfrey is assisted by a Committee Board, which includes, among others: James Roosevelt, FDR's grandson; Rev. George Salzmann, Harvard Catholic Chaplain to the Graduate and Professional Schools; and Adams House alum, Michael Weishan, the former host of the Victory Garden on PBS.
The initial restoration of the FDR Suite is expected to begin in 2009 and be completed in 2012. The Suite will be used as overnight quarters for official Harvard University guests, presidential scholars, and invitees of Adams House. As a museum, the Suite will be open by appointment to members of the greater Harvard Community; the Suite may also, depending on the resolution of various security concerns, eventually be opened to members of the general public on one or two days per year outside of the school term.

South Kyme

South Kyme is a small village and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is located south-east from North Kyme which is itself from Billinghay.
South Kyme contains a public house, The Hume Arms, and a golf club. The River Slea, which is called the 'Kyme Eau' from Ferry Farm a mile or so to the north of South Kyme, runs parallel to the main road passing under three bridges and eventually flows into the River Witham at Chapel Hill. The river was once navigable by the Sleaford Navigation from the Witham to the market town of Sleaford.
The heritage of the village blacksmith can be traced back 200 years. The South Kyme emblem is a Kingfisher, modelled as a wooden sculpture by Simon Todd.
The church is dedicated to Saint Mary and All Saints and is a Grade II* listed building which dates from at least 1196 as the former Augustinian Kyme Priory. The church today consists of the south aisle and part of the nave of the former priory. 
On a site to the west of the village stands the Grade I listed Kyme Tower for which the village is best known. This was a mediaeval castle which is believed to have been built between 1339 and 1381 by Gilbert de Umfraville third Earl of Angus and Lord of Kyme. Most of the building was demolished around 1720–1725 leaving only the single ashlar (stone block) tower.

Located at Japan’s second city of Osaka ), Osaka Guard District was responsible for guarding the approach to the old capital of Kyoto, the Kansai industrial zone, port of Kobe and the Inland Sea of Japan. 
History.
The were considered second tier naval bases, similar to the first tier , with docking, fueling and resupply facilities, but typically lacked a shipyard or training school. They tended to be established by strategic waterways or major port cities for defensive purposes. In concept, the Guard District was similar to the United States Navy Sea Frontiers concept. the Guard District maintained a small garrison force of ships and Naval Land Forces which reported directly to the Guard District commander, and hosted detachments of the numbered fleets on a temporary assignment basis.
Osaka, a strategic port city and location of several shipyards was initially ranked as a third echelon naval port or reporting to the Kure Naval District. The military base itself was established in 1939, but was little more than a base in name only, and was intended to form an administrative structure as legal representative of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Osaka area. It lacked in any base facilities, not even a repair yard, fueling depot or stores, and it relied on civilian-owned port facilities to service passing warships. Nonetheless, it was raised to the status of Guard District on March 13, 1940.

Life and death.
Anne was the oldest of four siblings. Her parents were wealthy. Anne's father was Count Jacques de Guigné, second lieutenant in the 13th Battalion, Chambéry of Chasseurs Alpins. Anne's mother was born Antoinette de Charette on September 19, 1886, the great-niece of François de Charette, the well-known General who led the soldiers of France in the Battle of Patay. Anne's maternal grandmother Francoise Eulalie Marie Madeleine de Burbon-Busset was a direct descendant of the sixth son of King Louis IX of France, Robert, Count of Clermont.
On July 29, 1915, when Anne was four years old, her father was killed in action in World War I. Before her father's death,
everyone knew her to be a spoiled and capricious child who was jealous of her little brother Jacques ("Jojo") and younger sisters Madeleine ("Leleine") and Marie-Antoinette ("Marinette") and deeply proud. From the day of her father's death, Anne decided to become kind and obedient in order to please and console her mother. The change was immediate. She was only four years and three months old at the time, but between her and Jesus arose, through an extraordinary gift of grace, an intense conversation of love. There was born inside her the desire to prove to Jesus how much love she had for him, offering Him many sacrifices, including the pain and suffering she had to endure when she became gravely ill with meningitis on December 19, 1921.
Anne died peacefully at 5:25 a.m. on January 14, 1922.
Cause for beatification.
She was declared Venerable on March 3, 1990 by Pope John Paul II.

Sister Gargi

Sister Gargi (; June 23, 1912 – January 20, 2004), born Marie Louise Burke, was a writer and an eminent researcher on Swami Vivekananda, and a leading literary figure of the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement. Sister Gargi was introduced to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement in 1948 by Swami Ashokananda. She is known for her six volume work, "". Her "New Discoveries" are considered as indispensable for Swami Vivekananda research.
Religious life.
Sister Gargi was born as Marie Louise Burke in 1912 in the United States. In 1948, she was introduced to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement by Swami Ashokananda. In 1957, Advaita Ashrama published her biography of Swami Vivekananda, "" in two volumes, well known in the Vedanta circles, and the book was later published in six volumes in 1983—87. She also wrote articles in Vendanta journals.
In 1974 in India, Burke took her vows of "Brahmacharya" from the Ramakrishna Mission. At that time she was given the monastic name "Gargi" (this name was inspired by Vedic scholar Gargi). In 1983, Burke was awarded the first Vivekananda Award by the Ramakrishna Mission for her research works on Swami Vivekananda. Later she took her final vows of "Sannyasa", and was given the name Pravrajika Prajnaprana.
Burke continued writing even in her 90s and continued staying at Vedanta Society of Northern California in San Francisco. She died on January 20, 2004 after suffering from cancer, at the convent of the Vendanta Society in San Francisco.
Literary career.
Sister Gargi was encouraged to write by her teacher, Swami Ashokananda. He asked her to write about Swami Vivekananda, but told her she could write about himself when she was finished with her work on Vivekananda.
"Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries".
"Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries", a series of biographical books, were Sister Gargi's most prominent work. This series of book was first published in two volumes in 1957. In 1983-87 these series was republished in six volumes. Swami Vivekananda spent a number of years teaching and lecturing in the West (specially in America and England). Sister Gargi researched for many years and then published her findings in these works.
She wrote about Vivekananda's spiritual quest— "Quite literally, he planted the seeds of spirituality deep in the hearts of innumerable human beings, changing the course of their lives forever... He was a prophet who prepared us to meet the modern age, which not only needs philosophy or Vedanta to solve its many and complex problems but requires thousands of spiritually awakened people to put that philosophy into practice and make it a living force in the future history of the world."
Books on Swami Ashokananda.
Sister Gargi wrote multiple books on the life of Swami Ashokananda (1893—1969), a monk of the Ramakrishna Order who spent his life expanding the Ramakrishna—Vivekananda movement in northern California. Ashokananda was Sister Gargi's teacher who initiated her into the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement in 1948.
In 2003 her book "A Heart Poured Out: A Story of Swami Ashokananda" was published. In this book she discussed the life of Swami Ashokananda. She explained the reason of writing a book on Ashokananda in this book's preface—
Why, then, have I tried to write about Swami Ashokananda, who habitually dwelt in high altitudes of the Spirit where we cannot or think we cannot, follow? I write about him because in whatever height he had has moorings, his heart beat in tune with that of every human being who aspires upward, and he led us with a firm and unerring hand into his own realm, where, he was convinced, we all belong. In short, I have written about him because he was an authentic spiritual teacher whom each of us can benefit by knowing.
In the 2004 book "Shafts of Light: Selected Teachings of Swami Ashokananda for Spiritual Practice", Gargi presented Swami Ashokananda ideals and selected teachings. The 2003 book "A Disciple's Journal: In the Company of Swami Ashokananda" had autobiographical components.
Other books.
"Swami Trigunatita: His Life and Work" was published from Vedanta Society of Northern California in 1997. In this book she discussed the life and works of Ramakrishna Order monk Swami Trigunatitananda. In the book "Vedantic Tales", published from Advaita Ashram in 2000 she narrated tales of Vedanta and ancient India.
Sister Gargi's 2003 book "A Disciple's Journal: In the Company of Swami Ashokananda" tells of her personal experiences during her spiritual instruction from Swami Ashokananda, from 1950 until his death in 1969.

A. Hyatt Mayor (1901-1980) was an American art historian and curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a leading figure in the study of prints, both old master prints and popular prints.
A. Hyatt Mayor's father was marine biologist Alfred Goldsborough Mayor (1868-1922) and his mother was sculptor Harriet Hyatt Mayor. Mayor came from an artistic family; his mother's sister was the well-known sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, and her husband was art patron Archer Milton Huntington, founder of the Hispanic Society of America in 1904.
Mayor received his B.A. from Princeton University (1922) and then received a Rhodes scholarship, which he used to earn his second bachelor's degree at Christ Church College at Oxford in 1926. The next few years he spent in Florence, Italy and at the American School of Classical Studies. Upon returning to the United States he embarked on a literary career, working on Hound & Horn. 
He married Virginia Sluder in 1932 and then joined the Department of Prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, becoming curator of the department in 1946. He had to follow the massive figure of William Ivins, Jr., whose curatorship had lasted 30 years. 
His tenure was marked by significant acquisitions of engravings, woodcuts, and other printed material, some by then-unknown artists who proved later to be eminently collectible. Many European collections became available after World War II, and there were notable acquisitions, especially from the collection of the Prince of Lichtenstein. He also expanded the concept of collectible prints to include wine labels and cigarette cards. In 1952 he published "Prints and People: A Social History of Printed Pictures", which has remained continuously in print.
In 1966 he retired from the Museum as curator emeritus and directed his efforts to various art-related projects and writings, in particular his translation and updating of the catalogues of Max Lehrs and the initiation, with Anthony Blunt and others, of the massive and still ongoing "Illustrated Bartsch" series of print catalogues. In 1955 he had succeeded his uncle Archer as president of the Hispanic Society and he continued to serve until 1980. He also served as a trustee of the American Federation of Arts and of Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina. He was awarded a Boston Museum Award in 1971.
Among other accolades he received, French poet St. John Perse once said that "Hyatt Mayor was the only American who spoke classic French in such a way that Diderot or Voltaire could have taken him for a Frenchman," and New York Times columnist John Russell called him "one of the most remarkable men who ever held a curatorial post."

Head of a Philosopher

The Head of a Philosopher is a 5th-century BC ancient Greek bronze sculpture produced in Magna Graecia. It is part-damaged, lacking its laurel wreath, left eye and the hair on the back of its head, while the mangled fragments of a hand and a cloak were found with it, which has led to the head's identification as a philosopher. It was discovered in 1969 in a wreck off Porticello beach at Cannitello, north of Reggio Calabria. It is now held at the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia in Reggio.

"A New Day" is a non-album single by Killing Joke. It was released in July, 1984, under E'G Records as a 12" and 7" single. This is the first non-album single by Killing Joke to produce a music video. The 12" single featured a dub mix of "A New Day" as an A-side, and "A New Day" was a B-Side. The 7" single featured a shorter version of "A New Day" as an A-Side and "Dance Day" was a B-Side. A completely different version of "A New Day", which was not a mix, later appeared on the 2008 reissue of Killing Joke's fifth studio album, "Night Time".

Dieter Kesten

Dieter Kesten (9 June 1914 — 3 April 1945) was a Sturmbannführer (Major), in the Waffen-SS during World War II who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The Knight's Cross was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by soldiers of Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Dieter Kesten was born on 9 June 1914 at Gelsenkirchen. He volunteered to join the SS in September 1933, and served with the 7th and 79th Standarte, before being selected to become an officer and was posted to the SS-Junkerschule at Braunschweig in April 1936. After graduation he was posted to II.Battalion, "Germania" Regiment, becoming the Ordonnanz offizier on the regimental staff.
World War II.
In May 1940 Kesten left the regiment to become adjutant to SS-Brigadeführer Fritz Herrmann, the future commander of SS Division "Nord", until December 1940. He also occupied the same position for the commander of the Waffen-SS Ost.
In May 1941 he was posted to the newly formed Kampfgruppe "Nord", again as the adjutant until May 1942, when he returned to the "Das Reich" Division.
Kesten was given command of 1st Company, SS Regiment "Langemarck" (27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck) and later was made the divisional adjutant. He transferred to 2nd SS Panzer Regiment as the commander of 6th company until November 1943. It was while in command of 6th Company that he was awarded the Knight's Cross.
During the Battle of Kursk, "Das Reich" had been transferred south to oppose the Russian counterattack across the Mius River, and destroyed 391 tanks and (Samokhodnaya ustanovka (self propelled guns)) from 30 July to 21 August 1943. "Das Reich" then moved to the outskirts of Kharkov, where it was involved in even heavier fighting. Its Panther battalion first saw combat on 22 July, around Starja-Ljubotin and Kommuna, knocking out 53 Russian tanks. The next day, 12 kilometers west of Kharkov, the platoon of Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) Karl Mühleck broke up a Russian tank assault. He alone destroyed seven tanks. On 24 July, Kesten's 6th Company, newly supplied with side-skirted Panzer IVs, battled 60 T-34s between Udy-Bogens and Orkan, south west of Kharkov, which had fallen to the Russians on the previous day. Kesten's panzers knocked out 29 of the 60 tanks. Karl Mühleck and Kesten would later receive Knight's Crosses for these actions.
Kesten was later given command of the II. Battalion, 2nd SS Panzer Regiment in November 1943. He was killed in action near Möllersdorf, south of Vienna, on 3 April 1945.

Extreme helium star

An extreme helium star (abbreviated EHe) is a low-mass supergiant that is almost devoid of hydrogen, the most common chemical element of the Universe. Since there are no conditions where stars devoid of hydrogen can be formed from molecular clouds, it is theorized that they are the product of mergers of white dwarfs, one of the helium type (DB or DO), and another of the carbon-oxygen rich type (DQ).
Extreme helium stars form a sub-group within the broader category of hydrogen-deficient stars. The latter includes cool carbon stars like R Coronae Borealis, helium-rich spectral class O or B stars, population I Wolf-Rayet stars, AM CVn stars, white dwarfs of spectral type WC, and transition stars like PG 1159.
The first known extreme helium star, HD 124448, was discovered in 1942 by Daniel M. Popper at the McDonald Observatory in Austin, USA. This star displayed no lines of hydrogen in its spectrum, but strong helium lines as well as the presence of carbon and oxygen. The second, PV Telescopii, was discovered in 1952, and by 1996 a total of 25 candidates had been found. (This list was narrowed to 21 by 2006.) A common characteristic of these stars is that the abundance ratio of carbon to helium is always in the range of 0.3 to 1%. This is despite wide variation of other abundance ratios in EHe stars.
The known extreme helium stars are supergiants where hydrogen is underabundant by a factor of 10,000 or more. The surface temperatures of these stars range from 9,000–35,000 K. They are primarily composed of helium, with the second most abundant element, carbon, forming about one atom per 100 atoms of helium. The chemical composition of these stars implies that they have undergone both hydrogen and helium burning at some stage of their evolution.
Two possible scenarios were proposed to explain the composition of extreme helium stars.
Examination of element abundances from seven EHe stars agreed with those predicted by the DD model.

Carl Locher

Carl Locher (21 November 1851 - 20 December 1915) was a Danish realist painter who from an early age became a member of the Skagen group of painters.
Biography.
Carl Locher was born on 21 November 1851 in Flensburg in the Duchy of Schleswig which was then part of Denmark. From an early age he took an interest in ships and received his first training from his father who painted ship portraits for a living. After the father died, Carl continued his business for a short while and went on several voyages with ships of the Royal Danish Navy. Struck by the grandeur of the Atlantic Ocean, a voyage to the Danish West Indies made a particular impression on him.
Even before he began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in 1872, he was encouraged by Holger Drachmann to spend a couple of months in Skagen, the artists colony in the far north of Jutland. He quickly completed paintings of the beach, some with fishing boats or wrecks. He also became interested in the horse-drawn carriage which travelled along the beach on its journey from Frederikshavn.
In the 1870s, Locher continued his studies in Paris but he visited Skagen whenever he was back in Denmark. Ultimately he had a house built there where he lived until his death. 
Supported by the State, he opened an etching school for Danish artists in Copenhagen where he taught until 1900. Skagen painters such as Anna Ancher and Michael Ancher and P.S. Krøyer attended the school.

<doc id="20709759" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20709759" title="Battle of the Sagra">
Battle of the Sagra

The Battle of the Sagra was fought in the 6th century BC between the Greek cities of Locri Epizefiri and Croton. The battle took place along the Sagra river. This river cannot be precisely identified, but may be the present-day Torbido or the Allaro, in the Province of Reggio Calabria, southern Italy.
Background.
A coalition of the cities Metapontum, Sybaris and Croton had besieged and captured Siris. According to Justin Croton attacked Locri afterwards because the latter had sent aid to Siris when it was under siege. It has been suggested that Justin was wrong and that strained relations between Locri and Caulonia were the cause instead. Because the foundation of Caulonia was supported by Croton, the conflict between Locri and Croton developed. An explanation which incorporates both possibilities is that Locri attacked Caulonia while Croton was occupied with the siege of Siris.
Battle.
The date of the battle is uncertain and proposals for it vary widely, ranging from the end of the seventh century BC to after 510 BC. Peter Bicknell proposes a more specific date of either 580 or 576 BC, but most scholars date the battle to the middle of the sixth century BC. Some have considered the inscriptions on a bronze trophy from Olympia to be related to the battle. The inscription reads: "the citizens of Hipponium and Medma and Locri dedicated as booty from the Crotoniates". Bicknell thinks this inscription refers to a later conflict because Hipponium was acquired by Locri fairly late. He suggests a date of 500–480 BC for the trophy because Locri took Temesa from Croton around this time. In advance of the battle Locri requested help from Sparta, but the Spartans replied that they should seek help from the Dioscuri, who according to legend helped them defeat Croton. 
According to Strabo the city Rhegion was allied with Locri and sent a contingent to their aid. He gives 10,000 men as the size of their army, but it is not clear if this includes or excludes the Rhegians. He provides a number of 130,000 for the army of Croton. Justin mentions a number of 15,000 Locrians versus 120,000 Crotoniates. Because Justin makes no mention of the Rhegians it is thought that they numbered 5,000 based on Strabo's numbers. The very large size of the Crotoniate army must have been a severe exaggeration. Justin and Strabo claim the news of the battle reached the Peloponnese in a single day.
Aftermath.
In Justin's account Pythagoras arrived in Croton after the battle and instituted an austere regime. Strabo attributes the decline of Croton to the heavy casualties it suffered during the battle. For Locri it was instead the start of a more and more aggressive policy towards neighbouring cities, subsequently leading to a rupture in its alliance with Rhegion. There is evidence that a cult to the Dioscuri was present in Locri in the beginning of the fifth century BC, which probably began as a result of the battle.

Prior to his current position Gerard served as president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council. 
Gerard was formerly president of the McLean, Virginia Stake of the LDS Church and chairman of the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He is currently an Area Seventy in the North America Northeast Area and member of the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy, recently serving alongside J. W.

Gerard sits on the Council on American Politics, which brings leaders from the forefront of today's political and communications arena together to address issues facing the growth and enrichment of GW’s Graduate School of Political Management.
In August 2012, "Politico" reported that Gerard "gets mentioned as a possible chief of staff or Energy secretary" in a potential Romney administration.
In the Huffington Post, there was the comment:"I could see Romney calling on Gerard in a role such as White House chief of staff and in the transition," said one veteran energy lobbyist who knows Gerard. But the lobbyist added that placing Gerard "in a Cabinet position such as Energy or Interior seems a little far-fetched given his years of work representing Big Oil." A top Republican lobbyist also cited Gerard's long work for the industry as an obstacle to confirmation, but said that his power within the administration would nevertheless be immense.

Rugby league in Western Australia

Rugby league in Western Australia describes the minority sport of rugby league, as it is played at amateur level in Western Australia. The state was once represented at national level, by the Western Reds/Perth Reds until it was decided they would not be included in the new National Rugby League of 1998 following the Super League war. Today, the WA Reds compete in the Bundaberg Red Cup and are aiming for eventual re-inclusion in the National Rugby League.
History.
The Western Australia Rugby League was formed in 1948 with Fremantle, Perth, South Perth and Cottesloe as the foundation clubs. In 1950 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control sent ex Kangaroos hooker Arthur Folwell to Western Australia to try to promote the game.
Although touring Great Britain and French rugby league teams had played tour matches in Perth, it was not until the late 1980s that the New South Wales Rugby League played games there. In August 1989, the NSWRL played the first game outside New South Wales or Queensland, with a crowd of 21,992 watching Canberra play Canterbury at the WACA.
Subsequent fixtures between 1990 and 1993 were equally well supported, and the League realised that a Perth team could be successful. Perth's application for the Winfield Cup was accepted on 30 November 1992, along with the South Queensland Crushers, the North Queensland Cowboys and the Auckland Warriors. The early tip for the nickname of the Perth side was Pumas, but the Red Kangaroo, Western Australia's best-known native animal, was chosen and the team became known as the Western Reds, with the colours of Red, Black, Yellow and White.
Western Australia's first rugby league team to play in a national competition were the Western Reds, who played in the 1995 and 1996 seasons of the Australian Rugby League. In 1997 they changed their name to the Perth Reds and joined the Super League as inaugural members.
Despite showing some promise (particularly in the underage competitions) the Reds were not invited to join the National Rugby League in 1998 as part of the agreement to end the Super League war.
In 2007 the Western Australia Rugby League re-formed the team as the WA Reds to compete in the Jim Beam Cup from 2008, with a view to entering the National Rugby League competition in 2012. Their home ground is Members Equity Stadium.
On 14 February 2009 Members Equity Stadium in Perth played host to the first NRL pre-season match for the year between St George-Illawarra Dragons and Sydney Roosters. The match was a one sided affair but a great stepping stone for WA Rugby League with just under 10,000 supporters in attendance.
On Saturday 13 June 2009 at Members Equity Stadium, Perth the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Melbourne Storm played at in front of a crowd of 15,197. The Melbourne Storm ran out winners 28-22 in a very successful night for organisers of the Rabbitohs who took their home game to Perth, the NRL and the WARL (Western Australia Rugby League), who now have even more reasons to seriously consider a bid to have the WA Reds back into the Elite Rugby League Competition (NRL). The Rabbitohs again hosted one of their home games in Perth 2010, on the back of the success of the 2009 encounter, again against the Storm. In 2011, the Rabbitohs' opponents were the Brisbane Broncos, and the match was won by the Rabbitohs by a narrow score of 16-14 after the Rabbitohs scored two tries in the first ten minutes. The match was played on a Friday night, a rarity in such a foreign territory for the NRL.
Governing body.
The Western Australia Rugby League (WARL) is responsible for administering the game of rugby league in Western Australia. Western Australia is an Affiliated State of the overall Australian governing body the Australian Rugby League.
Competitions.

The Canthyloscelidae are a small family of midges closely related to the Scatopsidae.
Adults are small to medium-sized (2.5-9.0 mm) flies, relatively stout, usually dark coloured Nematocera with stout legs. They are associated with ancient woodland. Larvae are xylosaprophagous and live in the moist, rotting wood of stumps and fallen trees.
Most are considered endangered due to the vulnerability of their habitat.
There are 15 described species worldwide from New Zealand, North America, South America, Japan and Russia. The 3 species in Europe are suspected to be introductions. There is one know fossil species from the Jurassic.
Systematics.
Originally considered to be two separate families, the Synneuridae and the Canthyloscelidae. Haenni placed the Synneuridae as the subfamily Synneurinae. A phylogenetic reclassification by Amorim has reduced the Synneurinae into a synonymy of Canthyloscelinae.

As such, he replaced Nick Fury on the back of the packaging. Artwork was now done by Mike Deodato. Starting with this series, all single carded figures included figure stands.

Thiemo de Bakker who was ranked at #242 in the world rankings and one of only two Dutchmen in the competition,lost his first round tie against Andreas Seppi. The other home player, Jesse Huta Galung, gave seventh seed Jo Wilfried Tsonga a real game but lost out on two tie-breaks. Andy Murray beat former top three player Ivan Ljubičić while Gaël Monfils took the first set against Swiss player Stéphane Bohli before his opponent had to retire injured. 
Seeds began to fall in the second round: Nikolay Davydenko, Gilles Simon and David Ferrer exited the competition with defeats to Julien Benneteau, Mario Ančić and Mikhail Youzhny respectively.

Dick Southwood

Leslie Frank "Dick" Southwood (18 January 1906 – 7 February 1986) was an English rower who competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics and in the 1936 Summer Olympics representing Great Britain.
Southwood was born in Fulham and was educated at Latymer Upper School. He initially joined Auriol Rowing Club but Jack Beresford spotted his sculling potential and persuaded him to join Thames Rowing Club. He competed unsuccessfully in the Wingfield Sculls in 1931. In 1932 he competed in the single sculls rowing for Great Britain at the 1932 Summer Olympics but in the final suffered an attack of cramp in the shoulder and finished fourth. He won the Wingfield Sculls in 1933, beating the holder Denis Guye.
In 1936 Southwood partnered Jack Beresford in the double sculls for Great Britain rowing at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. With Adolf Hitler watching, Beresford and Southwood came from a length down to pass the Germans with 200 metres to go and won the gold medal. Beresford thus won his fifth Olympic medal and wrote later that it was "the sweetest race I ever rowed."
Beresford and Southwood paired up again in 1939 in the centenary double sculls at Henley Royal Regatta. They dead-heated with Scherli and Broschi of Trieste, who were the reigning European champions.
Southwood died in Little Wittenham,Oxfordshire at the age of 80.

Fruits of Fascism

The Fruits of Fascism: Postwar Prosperity in Historical Perspective is a 1990 book by a professor of International Affairs, Simon Reich.
It describes the difference in the economic success of nations in post World War II Europe. The book links the effects of globalization of democratic nations and contrasts them with the economic growth of non-globalized nations which emerged from fascist regimes.
It implies that globalization by international mergers of privately owned corporate legal bodies might form the basis for future tyranny through the monetary system.

Åkerblom Movement

The Åkerblom Movement was an evangelical movement often described as a sect active in Finland in the late 1910s and early 1920s. The movement was most active in Swedish speaking Ostrobothnia, but it attracted people also in the south of Finland. The leader of the movement was the young girl Maria Åkerblom from the village of Snappertuna in Uusimaa.
The sect has its roots in Snappertuna in 1917, when it is said that twelve-year-old Maria Åkerblom received prophesies from God. Åkerblom was struck by sickness and as she fell asleep, she started to preach. She delivered her speeches in trance. This happened several times, and Åkerblom became famous. Services with Åkerblom preacheing became more and more popular and her reputation spread throughout Finland. She started to travel around in Finland preaching. 
Åkerblom's sermons attracted most people in the northern parts of Ostrobothnia, especially in the Kokkola-region and the village of Teerijärvi. In the beginning no problems occurred as the movement started spreading in the region. Later, though, the members of the movement were accused of several different crimes, for instance shooting a policeman, stealing and physical violence.
The movement grew larger in the early 1920s, in spite of all the accusations made against it. The leaders of the movement decided that all the members should sell all their belongings and give it to the sect. The movement's aim was to move to the holy land of Israel.
The Åkerblom Movement did not make it that far, though. In the 1920s it fell apart because of all the accusations and trials it went through. Some members remained close to Maria Åkerblom, but the vast majority returned to normal life.

Henry Burns

Henry Lee Burns (born March 2, 1947) is Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 9 in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana. He also owns and operates the Wooden Spoon bakery in Bossier City and is a thoroughbred owner and breeder.
Background.
A former member of the Bossier Parish School Board and a well-known area raconteur, Burns often lectures at public schools on the keys to success in life, with emphasis on perseverance.
Until the late 1980s, Burns was an independent petroleum and natural gas operator. When the business failed, he launched his bakery despite the odds against success and his having to learn the business from scratch. "I went from crude oil to Crisco oil," Burns said, noting that his accountant, bankers, and attorney told him that he had too much debt for his venture to succeed. Nevertheless, the Wooden Spoon had some success: "No one knew I was down and out because I had a smile on my face and never stopped." Burns said that the bakery succeeded because "people respond to cookies . . . a reminder of their childhood."
Burns received his Bachelor of Arts degree in upper elementary education from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches and his Master of Arts in education administration from Pepperdine University, a Churches of Christ institution in Malibu, California.

Laurits Tuxen

Laurits Tuxen (9 December 1853 – 21 November 1927) was a Danish painter and sculptor specialising in figure painting. He was also associated with the Skagen Painters. He was the first head of Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler, an art school established in the 1880s to provide an alternative to the education offered by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.
Biography.
Tuxen grew up in Copenhagen and studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Art where together with P. S. Krøyer he was considered to be one of the best painters. 
He first visited Skagen in 1870, returning on several occasions. In the 1880s and 1890s, he travelled widely painting portraits for Europe's royal families including Christian IX of Denmark, Queen Victoria and the Russian royalty. In 1901, after the death of his first wife Ursule de Baisieux from Belgium, he married the Norwegian Frederikke Treschow and shortly afterwards purchased Madam Bendsen's house in Skagen in the north of Jutland, converting it into a stately summer residence.
In 1914 he made a study trip to Greece to paint the entry of George I of Greece into Salonika, for the Christian castle. He made lively and well-characterized portraits, among them his self-portrait in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and portraits of P. S. Krøyer, in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. He also made portraits in sculpture, including a portrait group of Krøyer and Michael Ancher.
Tuxen went on to paint a number of landscapes in and around Skagen, but also completed a number of paintings of his family, friends and garden flowers.
Exhibitions.
Tuxen painted mainly landscapes in Skagen, but also portraits of European royal personalities, namely Christian IX of Denmark, Queen Victoria, Czar Nicolas II, etc. Some of his works are exhibited at:

Destarch

Destarching occurs when part of a plant is "deprived of starch, as by translocation". 
It is also the process of eliminating starch reserves in a plant for experiments concerning photosynthesis. This is done by leaving the plant subject to experiment in a dark place with no light. Due to the lack of photosynthesis in this place, stored starch is used up, thus the plant is destarched.

Beyond Thirty and The Man-Eater

?
Beyond Thirty and The Man-Eater is a collection of two short novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs which were long among the rarest of his published works. Both were written in 1915; "The Man-Eater", a jungle adventure, was first published as a serial in the "New York Evening World" newspaper from November 15–20, 1915, while "Beyond Thirty", a science fiction story, was first published in "All Around Magazine" in February 1916. Neither work appeared in book form in Burroughs' lifetime. The first book versions were limited editions were issued by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach's "Fantasy Press" fanzine in 1955; the two works were then published in a combined edition under the present title by Science-Fiction & Fantasy Publications in 1957, through which they first reached a wide readership. Both works have since been published separately.
Plot.
"Beyond Thirty".
The story was heavily influenced by the events of World War I, and reflects U.S. sentiments at the time of writing. When the war broke out, Americans were predominantly isolationist and wary of being drawn into a European war. Burroughs imagines a future two centuries onward in which that view prevailed and the western hemisphere severed contact with the rest of the world. Consequently, the eastern hemisphere has exhausted itself in war and Europe descended into barbarism while while the Americas, sheltered from the destruction, have continued to advance and joined peacefully into the union of Pan-America. By the twenty-second century the entire world east of the 30th meridian west and west of the 175th meridian east has become "terra incognita" to Pan-America.
In 2137, Pan-American Navy Lieutenant Jefferson Turck is commander of the aero-submarine "Coldwater", tasked with patrolling the 30th meridian from Iceland to the Azores. Disaster strikes when the vessel's anti-gravitation screens fail, dooming it to wallow upon the surface of the ocean, and the engines fail, leaving it adrift. As its wireless radio has failed as well, Turck cannot even summon help. It is implied that the perfidy of the "Coldwater"’s second officer is behind its misfortunes, as well as the abandonment Turck and three companions at sea in a small boat in the course of its repairs.
Adrift, Turck and his companions are forced to make shore in forbidden England. Turck falls into the hands of raiders from the Abyssinian Empire, a black super-state ruling all of Africa, most of Europe, and the Arabian peninsula. While the Abyssinians' technology is roughly equivalent to that of the nineteenth century, the white savages that populate Europe in Turck’s time are no match for them. The Abyssinians consider whites a lower order and take them as slaves. Turck too is pressed into slavery. Becoming the personal servant of an Abyssinian colonel he is treated better than many of his fellow slaves, but is rankled by his status.
Turck's master takes him to the court of the Abyssinian Emperor, Menelek XIV. Menelek is portrayed as gross and cruel, perhaps once a great man, but now corrupted by power. Turck watches powerless as white slave women are offered to the emperor for his harem, including the heroine Victory, queen of the primitives of England. Eventually Turck succeeds in rescuing Victory and makes his way with her to the rival empire of China. Communications between the hemispheres are re-opened, with commerce to follow, and Turck, despite violating the edict against crossing the 30th meridian, is hailed as a hero in Pan-America.
"The Man-Eater".
Jefferson Scott, Jr. and Robert Gordon, hunters in the Belgian Congo, are thrown together with missionaries Sangamon and Mary Morton and their daughter Ruth. Scott marries Ruth, and Gordon is entrusted with stock certificates to be taken back to Scott's father in America. Later Scott and the elder Mortons are killed by the native Wakandas; Ruth and her daughter Virginia are saved by Belgian forces and afterwards return to America to live with Scott's father. The stock certificates, meanwhile, have gone astray, with only a single sheet of paper having been delivered to the elder Scott. Nineteen years pass.
On the death of Jefferson Scott, Sr., Virginia Scott is to inherit the estate, but the will cannot be located, and Scott Taylor, her grandfather’s disinherited nephew, appears to claim a half share. Proposing to Virginia in an effort to obtain it all, he is rebuffed, whereupon he disputes her right to any of the estate, pretending she is illegitimate. Ruth attempts to prove her marriage to Virginia's father by writing to Robert Gordon, who witnessed the ceremony, but he is now deceased. Her appeal reaches his son Dick Gordon instead. Moved but unable to provide the desired proof, Gordon writes back of his intention to sail to Africa to seek documentation of the marriage there. Taylor intercepts the letter and follows him with the intention of murder. Discovering this, Virginia also sets out for Africa.
Gordon reaches the ruins of the old mission and finds there a sealed envelope, with which he begins his trek back to the coast. Taylor and his confederates Kelley and Gootch await him in ambush in a native village. They kill a lioness, whose mate the natives take captive in a pit trap. Virginia arrives at the village and is imprisoned by the villains. Meanwhile, Gordon discovers and frees the captured lion, which then returns to the village seeking the killers of its mate. The lion arrives just as the villains are about to rape and kill Virginia, and kills Gootch while others flee. Virginia escapes but is stalked by a hyena. Gordon, who happens to be nearby, hears her scream and shoots the beast. She warns him against Taylor, who then appears with Kelley, seeking her. Seizing Gordon’s gun, she wounds Taylor and drives the villains off. They return to America and separate, Gordon somehow neglecting to give her the envelope. Meanwhile, the lion has been captured by hunters and sold to an itinerant American circus, in which he is billed as "Ben, King of Beasts, the Man-Eating Lion."
Realizing his omission, Gordon visits the Scott home to deliver the envelope to Virginia and Ruth, unaware that Taylor and Kelley have returned from Africa and still plan to kill him. He finds the Scotts absent from home, their return delayed by a train wreck. Ben, who was also on the train, is freed by the wreck and turns up at the house, where he detects the scents of both his rescuer Gordon and the two villains. Encountering the latter, he kills Kelley and pursues Taylor to Gordons room. There Taylor struggles with Gordon and overcomes him, taking the envelope before fleeing from Ben. The lion follows, overtaking and killing Taylor within sight of the returning Scott's.
Gordon, pursuing Taylor, recognizes Ben and protects him from the armed party that arrives to kill the escaped lion. He buys Ben from the circus, intending to give him a new home in a zoo. The mysterious envelope, finally opened, proves to contain the long lost stocks, not the hoped for marriage certificate. The latter turns up, together with the missing will, in a cupboard in the Scott house, having been secreted there by Jefferson Scott, Sr. The certificate was evidently the paper Gordon's father had delivered to the elder Scott instead of the stocks. Dick Gordon and Virginia Scott declare their love for each other and decide to marry.

<doc id="20710669" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20710669" title="Greeks in Lebanon">
Greeks in Lebanon

The Greek presence in Lebanon is dated to ancient times, and the Phoenicians and Greeks (both maritime peoples) shared close ties. The Greek alphabet, for example, is derived from the Phoenician one. The Greek presence is attested by several place names, and the close ties between Greeks and the Lebanese Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic communities.
History.
In ancient times Lebanon was the site of several Greek colonies. Following Christianization Greek culture remained a strong influence, waning as the centuries passed, though not disappearing. The city of Amioun (possibly from the Semitic word for Greeks, "Yunan"), capital of the Koura District (in turn from the Greek "χωριά", "villages") in the north of the country is a living testament of that. Following the 2006 invasion of Lebanon by Israel most Greeks have fled the country, although there remains a Greek community in Beirut as well as in the aforementioned Koura District.
Greek Muslims in Lebanon.
There are about 7,000 Greeks living in Tripoli, Lebanon. The majority of them are Muslims of Cretan-Turkish origin and some of them are of Greek Muslim origin. Records suggest that the community left Crete between 1866 and 1897, on the outbreak of the last Cretan uprising against the Ottoman empire, which ended the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Many Greek Muslims of Lebanon somewhat managed to preserve their identity and language. Unlike neighbouring communities, they are monogamous and consider divorce a disgrace. Until the Lebanese Civil War, their community was close-knit and entirely endogamous. However many of them left Lebanon during the 15 years of the war. By 1988, many Greek Muslims from both Lebanon and Syria had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation. The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility, and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece.

American Documentation Institute

The American Documentation Institute (ADI) was founded by Watson Davis (1896-1967) in 1935 as "Documentation Institute" which changed its name to the American Documentation Institute in 1937. In 1968 it changed its name to American Society for Information Science, which again in 2000 changed its name to the present: American Society for Information Science and Technology
Watson Davis was one of the first Americans to take an interest in how the terms “document” and “documentation” were being used in Europe.
ADI early on worked toward the development of microfilm readers and cameras. Their first microfilm laboratories were located in the U.S.Department of Agriculture Library in Washington, DC and the Institute distributed materials through the newly created Bibliofilm Service. In 1954, the Photoduplication Service at the Library of Congress took over the operation and became the source point for distributing ADI materials. In many respects, the ADI goal for the easy dissemination of information was a precursor to housing data sets and related content in digital repositories accessible via the Web. 
ADI decided in 1950 to create a journal modeled after the defunct "Journal of Documentary Reproduction", which had been published by the American Library Association from 1938 to 1942. ADI published the journal "American Documentation". from 1950 until 1968, when ADI changed its name as an organization and renamed "American Documentation" as the "Journal of the American Society for Information Science". In 2000, the society changed names again, and the journal followed suit, becoming the current Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology.
In 1966, ADI began publication of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology. Its successor organizations continued publishing the annual review under that title until 2011.

Corbett Hospital

Corbett Hospital is a National Health Service (NHS) hospital run by Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust located in Amblecote, Stourbridge, West Midlands, England. The current hospital is an out-patient centre which opened on 25 May 2007 in a ceremony conducted by Tony Blair as part of his farewell tour before resigning as Prime Minister. 
The original Corbett Hospital closed in 2005 after 112 years in use. 
The new building is situated within the grounds of the original one, which was demolished in late 2007.
History.
George Mills.
Parts of the hospital are up to 300 years old. Prior to being a hospital, the seven bedroom mansion was known as The Hill and was the home of Mr. George Mills. George Mills was a glass manufacturer who was a partner in the Albert Glass House situated in Wordsley. He committed suicide on 13 November 1885 after several years of mental illness. He left debts of £11,344-12s-6d, and even though the house was in a poor state of repair it was eventually sold to pay of the liabilities.
John Corbett.
John Corbett, who spent his youth living at the Delph, made his fortune producing salt at Stoke Prior, Worcestershire and, perhaps remembering his youth, purchased the rather rundown house in December 1891. He repaired and refurbished the house, changing its use into a hospital., and endowed it to the local people on 31 July 1893, with a sum of £2,000 for endowment (since increased by public subscription to £5,000) and two sums of £500 towards the repairs fund and furnishing. John Corbett never lived at The Hill.
Training school.
The Corbett Hospital Preliminary Training School was opened in 1948 on the formation of the National Health Service, providing accommodation for 12 medical students.
Accident and emergency unit.
An accident and emergency unit was opened in 1965, but closed 20 years later following the opening of a new unit at Russells Hall Hospital which also replaced that at Dudley Guest Hospital. This enabled the old outpatient department, which had previously accommodated the accident and emergency unit, to be converted into a 17-bed hospital ward.
As recently as the late 1990s, there was widespread local campaigning for the return of accident and emergency facilities at the Corbett, on the grounds that such a facility there would have reduced the waiting time for people around Stourbridge needing the service.

Before long they come to realise that they actually can't stand each other, but the resulting split is far from amicable. Things come to a head when Jin-ah refuses to return the pendulum from Sang-min's beloved clock, and their petty squabbles degenerate into life threatening violence.
Release.
"Venus and Mars" was released in South Korea on 12 December 2007, and on its opening weekend was ranked fourth at the box office with 164,750 admissions. The film went on to receive a total of 382,422 admissions nationwide, and as of 27 January 2008 had grossed a total of $2,316,750.

Cyano radical

The cyano radical is a radical with molecular formula ·CN. The cyano radical was one of the first detected molecules in the interstellar medium and has helped the field of astrochemistry a great deal. The first discovery was performed with a coude spectrograph which was made famous and credible due to this detection. ·CN has been observed in both diffuse clouds and dense clouds. Usually, CN is detected in regions with hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen isocyanide, and HCHN+ since it is also used In the creation and destruction of these molecules.
Physical Properties.
The cyano radical is best depicted as a combination of two resonance structures: the structure with the unpaired electron on the carbon is the minor contributor, while the structure with the unpaired electron on the nitrogen (the isocyano radical) is the major contributor. The charge separation in the isocyano radical is similar to that of carbon monoxide.
·CN has a dipole moment of 1.45 Debye and a 2Σ ground electronic state. The selection rules are:
Where "N" is the angular momentum, "S" is the electric spin, and "I" = 1 is the nuclear spin of 14N.
Detections of ·CN.
·CN was first detected In 1941 by A. McKellar In the interstellar medium.
The coude spectrograph and a telescope were used to observe ·CN's interstellar lines and ultraviolet spectra. Use of the spectrograph proved McKellar's findings to be correct and also made the spectrograph famous. In 1970, ·CN's first rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 was detected In the Orion Nebula and W51. The first detection of ·CN in extragalactic sources were seen toward Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), IC 342, and M82 In 1988. These emission lines seen were from N=1 to N=0 and N=2 to N=1. In 1991, the ·CN vibration-rotational bands were observed in a king furnace at the National Solar Observatory using a McMath Fourier-Transform spectrometer. The observed 2 to 0 lines show an extreme hyperfine structure. In 1995, the rotational absorption spectrum of ·CN in the ground state was observed in the 1 THz region, and most of the lines were measured in the range of 560 to 1020 GHz. Four new rotational transitions were measured; N=8 to N=8, J=15/2 to J=17/2 and J=17/2 to J=19/2; N=7 to N=8, J=15/2 to J=17/2 and J=13/2 to J=15/2.

St Mellion

St Mellion () is a village and rural civil parish in east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The parish is three miles (5 km) south of Callington and is in the St Germans Registration District. The population in the 2001 census was 377. To the north, the parish is bordered by Callington and St Dominick parishes, to the east and south by Pillaton parish, and to the west by St Ive parish.
The parish name is taken from St Melaine, a 6th-century bishop of Rennes, Brittany.
Parish church.
The church of St Melanus stands in the village of St Mellion (the largest settlement in the parish) at . The older part of the church is the south side which was built in the 14th century whereas the north side is of the late 15th century and was built of granite. There is a fine series of monuments to the Corytons: these include a brass to Peter Coryton and his wife and 24 children, 1552, and two elaborate sculptural compositions to William Coryton, 1651, and Sir William, 1711 (both in a style characteristic of the early 17th century).
Notable sites.
St Mellion is also the location of Pentillie, a 17th-century castle and estate which has been the seat of the Coryton family since 1698. They had previously had an estate at West Newton Ferrers, also in St Mellion. The manor of Newton Ferrers (Niuuetona, Niweton, Niwetone) was mentioned in the Domesday Book, 1086. The present house was built about 1686-1695 (these dates being on the gatepiers) for Sir William Coryton. It is a plain granite mansion of two storeys: the centre is of seven bays and there are two projecting wings of two bays each. It is the earliest Cornish mansion in the classical style (i.e. with no Tudor survivals). Two thirds of the house were gutted by fire in 1940; of this some has been rebuilt while the rest remains as a ruin. The St Mellion golf course is also in the parish.
Crocadon Quarry, a small Site of Special Scientific Interest noted for its geological interest, is located 200m east of St Mellion village.
