Struve won his next fight at UFC 99, over Denis Stojnic. Struve was cut open by hammerfists from Stojnic while on his back in the first round and, despite bleeding profusely, persevered in the second round and gained Stojnic's back, eventually locking in a rear naked choke to win by submission at 2:37 of the second round.
Struve defeated previously undefeated UFC newcomer Chase Gormley on October 24, 2009, at UFC 104 (also winning the "Submission of the Night" award).

In the second round Struve began to open up, mixing in a body-clinch take-down while piecing together striking combinations. He landed a left hook, inside leg kick, left hook & right uppercut in quick succession to drop a stunned Herman, proceeding to mount his opponent and deliver strikes until forcing the referee's intervention.
Struve was expected to face Mark Hunt on May 26, 2012 at UFC 146 but, on May 17, 2012, Hunt withdrew from the bout due to an injury and was replaced by Lavar Johnson. Struve quickly submitted Johnson in the first round with an armbar, earning his third "Submission of the Night" bonus.

Basil Travers

Basil Holmes 'Jika' Travers (7 July 1919 – 18 December 1998) was an Australian sportsman who played in the England national rugby union team and played first-class cricket with Oxford University. 
Travers, a Shore old boy, moved from Australia to England in 1940 to study on a Rhodes Scholarship. He was capped six times in total for England, the first in the 1947 Five Nations Championship, which England were joint winners of, where he played in their games against both Ireland and Wales. He also played in a friendly against his home country in 1948, as well as making appearances in the 1948 and 1949 Five Nations. The only points of his international career came courtesy of two conversions in a Test against Scotland.
An all-rounder at cricket, he was a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler. Travers scored 718 runs at 25.64 and took 48 wickets at 30.20 from his 24 first-class matches. All but one of those matches were for Oxford University, with the other coming in a match for the Free Foresters Cricket Club when he swapped sides and played against the University. Although he never scored a century or managed a five wicket haul, Travers made four half centuries and had best figures of 4/65. 
One of Travers' biggest tests came on his first-class debut, when he had to bat and bowl against India in 1946. Oxford batted first and Travers was dismissed for just 13 by Vinoo Mankad, in what would be his only innings of the match.

Hugh Myers

Hugh Edward Myers (January 23, 1930 – December 22, 2008) was an American chess master and author. He won or tied for first in the state chess championships of Illinois (1951), Wisconsin (1955), Missouri (1962), and Iowa (1983), as well as the USCF Region VIII (Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska) championship (1983). He played first board for the Dominican Republic in the 1968 and 1976 Chess Olympiads.
Myers is best known for his writings on unusual chess openings such as the Nimzovich Defense (1.e4 Nc6). The eccentric opening 1.c4 g5 is known as Myers' Defense because of his advocacy of it in his writings and games. Myers wrote numerous editions of his book on the Nimzovich Defense, as well as three other books on the openings. He edited and published the "Myers Openings Bulletin" in 1979–88 and the "New Myers Openings Bulletin" in 1992–96.
Myers also involved himself in the controversy over FIDE President Florencio Campomanes' termination of the 1984–85 World Championship match between Karpov and Kasparov, and was instrumental in helping Campomanes secure reelection in 1986.
Chess career.
Myers was born in Decatur, Illinois on January 23, 1930. At age 10, he learned to play chess from "Lasker's Manual of Chess", a famous treatise by former World Champion Emanuel Lasker. The book had a lasting influence on him, including Lasker's "encouragement regarding the openings, 'the ground trodden above is yet rather new, and you may explore it as well as anyone else.' " After his father brought home the December 1943 issue of "Chess Review", Myers began visiting the Decatur Chess Club weekly. In 1946, he played in his first chess tournament, finishing second in the Decatur high school championship.
Myers majored in history and political science at Millikin University, graduating in 1951. While in college, he became obsessed with chess. In 1950–52, he won the Decatur city championship thrice consecutively by lopsided scores, scoring 14.5 out of 16 possible points, 15 out of 16, and a perfect 14 out of 14, respectively.
In 1951, Myers tied for first in the Illinois championship with Kimball Nedved and John Tums, each scoring 6 out of 7 possible points in the Swiss system tournament, but Nedved won on Sonneborn-Berger tiebreaking points. Myers then challenged Nedved to a match, which Myers won in 1952 with 3.5 out of 4. Myers won the 1955 Wisconsin state championship with 6.5 out of 7, drawing in the last round with Arpad Elo. In 1962, Myers won the Missouri Open championship on tiebreak over J. Theodorovich of Toronto, each scoring 5 out of 6.
From 1965 to 1968, Myers was the top-rated player in the Dominican Republic. He played first board for its national chess team at the Chess Olympiads at Lugano 1968 (scoring 4 wins, 5 draws, and 6 losses) and Haifa 1976 (scoring 3 wins, 3 draws, and 5 losses).
In 1983, Myers tied for first with Mitch Weiss in the Iowa State Championship, a round robin, each scoring 3.5 out of 4. Later that year, Myers and Weiss also tied for first in the USCF Region VIII (Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska) championship, each scoring 4.5 points in the 5-round Swiss. In 1994, Myers played third board for "Fear Itself", the team that won the U.S. Amateur Team Championship.
Myers died in Davenport, Iowa on December 22, 2008.
Chess strength.
Myers achieved an Elo rating of 2350 while living in the Dominican Republic. In the United States, he first attained a rating over 2200 (National Master level) in 1983 and kept it over 2200 for ten years. Between 1993 and 2003, his rating fell from 2219 to 2054.
Chess writing and contributions to opening theory.
Myers is best known for his writings on unorthodox chess openings. He published the books "New Strategy in the Chess Openings" (1968), "The Nimzovich Defense" (1973; French edition 1979; revised editions 1986, 1993, and 1995), "Reversed King Pawns, Mengarini's Opening" (1977), and "Exploring the Chess Openings" (1978). His most important opening work was on the Nimzowitsch Defense, on which he was considered the foremost authority. Myers' autobiography, "A Chess Explorer", was issued in 2002.
From 1979–88, Myers edited and published 38 issues of the "Myers Openings Bulletin". Nine double-sized issues, called the "New Myers Openings Bulletin", came out in 1992–96. The ChessBase.com obituary of Myers observes that in the "Myers Openings Bulletin", Myers offered: 
"...a remarkable diet of deeply-researched openings articles (no opening seemed too abstruse for consideration), historical features, book reviews and topical commentary. He included contributions from many writers who later gained prominence in their own right, and the Bulletin built up a loyal, affectionate readership throughout the world."
FIDE Master Allan Savage observes that the "Bulletin" "became a cause celebre for practitioners of unusual openings, a forum for airing of opinions of diverse chess writers, and a target for those conformists who would malign the very existence of offbeat ideas." Savage calls Myers "a trailblazer, iconoclast, original thinker, curmudgeon, and at his peak, a strong master".
Probably Myers' best-known contribution to opening theory is the eccentric line 1.c4 g5, a sort of Grob's Attack (1.g4) with colors reversed. It has become known as Myers' Defense because of his advocacy of it. When Myers discussed it in "New Strategy in the Chess Openings" his publisher, without consulting him, inserted in the book the remark, "I can't believe that 1.c4 g5 is good for Black. There is no need to even give the reasons for my opinion; the move 1.-- g5 violates chess principles as I learned them." International Master John L. Watson, an authority on the English Opening, wrote that this variation "has become the theoretical property of Hugh Myers, who has both played it and published proposed improvements." Watson opined that the line "seems playable", but it is largely ignored in general opening manuals. It is not mentioned at all in the current edition of "Modern Chess Openings" (2008), the "Encyclopedia of Chess Openings" (1996), or "Batsford Chess Openings 2" (1989), and it receives only a brief footnote in "Nunn's Chess Openings" (1999). In the first edition of "Batsford Chess Openings" (1982), future World Champion Garry Kasparov famously dismissed 1...g5 with the remark that, "Chess is not skittles."
Chess controversy and politics.
In 1985 and 1986, Myers wrote in the "Myers Openings Bulletin" about FIDE President Florencio Campomanes' controversial decision to terminate the 1984–85 Karpov–Kasparov World Championship match after 48 games, and schedule a new match later in 1985. Myers argued that the decision to stop the match and start afresh was in Kasparov's interest, since he had been trailing and would have needed three more victories to win the match, while Karpov needed only one. Chess historian Edward Winter later wrote, "This reasoning, originally voiced by hardly anyone except ... Myers, is now gaining ground." Myers also asserted that Kasparov’s statements, which suggested that Campomanes had terminated the match at Karpov’s behest and over Kasparov’s opposition, were duplicitous.
In 1986, Campomanes hired Myers to write the bulletins at the Chess Olympiad later that year in Dubai, and to work for Campomanes' reelection as FIDE President. Campomanes' opponent was Lincoln Lucena, whose running mate was Raymond Keene, a candidate for General Secretary of FIDE. Myers wrote a series of ten bulletins for distribution to national chess federations, entitled "F.I.D.E. Facts", that criticized Keene, as well as Lucena supporters such as Kasparov and David Levy. The November 1986 issue of "CHESS" magazine contained a written response, drafted by Myers and signed by Campomanes, to Keene's charges against Campomanes. Myers also created a cartoon that portrayed Lucena as a marionette controlled by Keene and Levy. Just before the election, Lucena withdrew, ensuring Campomanes' victory. Myers took credit for Campomanes' reelection, writing, "It could be reasonably argued that Campomanes was either a good guy or a bad guy, but I'm proud that discovering the truth and telling it proved that his opponents were worse."
Notable games.
Myers won the following game against an extremely strong American junior who won the World Junior Chess Championship later the same year with the only perfect score in its history and was awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE in 1960. Hans Kmoch annotated it in "Chess Review". Myers included the decisive moment of the game on the cover of his autobiography "A Chess Explorer". 
Myers–William Lombardy, Manhattan Chess Club championship semifinal, New York, 1957: 
1.g3 Nf6 2.Bg2 d5 3.Nf3 Bf5 4.c4 c6 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 Bc8 7.0-0 e6 8.Nc3 Nc6 9.d4 Bd6 Here and on his next few moves Black plays strangely, initiating complications before having castled.

Myers considered the following game one of his best. It shows his unconventional approach to the openings, with both of his rook pawns moved by move six. This game was also annotated by Kmoch, in "Chess Life & Review".

American Progress

The American Progress was an American newspaper founded by Democratic Louisiana Governor Huey Long in March 1930 as the Louisiana Progress to promote his political aims and attack his opponents. He forced state employees to subscribe and distribute copies, plus state agencies had to place ads.
The paper was renamed in 1935 and went national to promote then Senator Long's Share Our Wealth program and his ambitions for running for the presidency of the United States in the 1936 election. It was mailed free to his followers and circulation varied from 300,000 to 1.5 million for special issues. The paper was paid for by contributions from the Long political machine in Louisiana.
After Long's assassination in 1935, the paper was taken over by Governor Richard W. Leche and then bought by his successor Earl Long. The paper shut down in March 1940 after Long lost his reelection bid.

Thomas Pryce-Jenkins

Dr. Thomas John Pryce-Jenkins (1 February 1862-6 August 1922) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for London Welsh and county rugby for Middlesex. Pryce-Jenkins represented Wales twice but he is more notable within the field of rugby for being a founding member of London Welsh.
Personal history.
Pryce-Jenkins was born in 1864 to the rector of Llanllwch, a village outside Carmarthen in South Wales. He was educated at Llandovery College and later Cambridge University. After leaving university, Pryce-Jones took time away from education and joined a touring theatrical company. After four years he returned to London and completed his medical studies, setting up a surgery at Hills Place behind the Palladium. A strong athlete he turned his amateur interest in games into his medical speciality, treating athletic injuries. Notable patients included runners Alfred Shrubb and Reggie Walker. He would later treat players from London Welsh never charging them for his services.
Pryce-Jenkins took a leading role in the formation of the London Welsh Battalion at the outbreak of World War I, and became a medical advisor at the London Depot. Pryce-Jenkins was also an amateur writing, completing several short stories and a play, 'Sands of Time'.
Pryce-Jenkins died in 1922 at the age of 58, he was buried at Marylebone Cemetery.
Rugby career.
In 1885 a group of rugby enthusiasts met to form a rugby club within London, specifically for Welsh players. An informal meeting took place that year, followed by an official formation at the Arlington Hotel in Fleet Street on June 24. Pryce-Jenkins was one of those present and became a member of the first committee.
Although representing other clubs before this time, Pryce-Jenkins played the majority of his club rugby for London Welsh, and was still playing for the club when he was selected to represent Wales in 1888. His first cap was against Scotland under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, and Pryce-Jenkins scored the only points of the game when he ran half the length of the pitch to score in the first half. Wales are then reported to have killed the game by lying on the ball or kicking it continually out of touch. His second and final international match was an away trip against Ireland, which Wales lost.

Alexander Ossovsky

Alexander Vyacheslavovich Ossovsky (, July 31, 1957) was a renowned Russian musical writer, critic and musicologist, professor at Saint Petersburg Conservatory, pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and friend of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Siloti and Nikolai Tcherepnin.
Biography.
Alexander Ossovsky was born on March 31, 1871 in Kishinev, Bessarabia, Russian Empire into the family of Vyacheslav Stepanovich Ossovsky, who was a Department Chair in the Odessa Court; his mother was Yevgenia Cherkunova. The composer Mykola Vilinsky was his cousin. Ossovsky graduated from the Law School at Moscow University (1893). 
After graduation he worked at the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. From 1896-1898 studied at Saint Petersburg Conservatory. From 1900-02 he studied composition with the composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1894 Ossovsky started his career as a talented and prolific musical writer, musical critic and musicologist. In 1915-18 and 1921-52 Ossovsky was a professor at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (then Leningrad Conservatory), and in 1937 he became a Deputy Director there. 
He was one of the founders of “Muzykal’nyi Sovremennik” (“Musical Contemporary”) magazine in Saint Petersburg (1915–17). From 1923 to 1925 Ossovsky was the Director, and from 1933-1936 the Art Chair, at the Leningrad Philharmonic. From 1943 to 1952 he was Director at the Leningrad Music and Theater Research Institute. In 1931-33 he worked at the State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad.
Ossovsky maintained close ties with the composers of Belyayev's Circle and had become friend and colleague with a number of the members of Russian musical elite, including Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Siloti and Alexander Glazunov. He contributed extensively to Siloti's concert programs as a writer, editor and critic.
In 1911 he helped Sergei Prokofiev to publish his first works by writing a special letter in strong support of the composer to the Russian publisher P. Jurgenson. The same year, in Kiev, Rachmaninoff at the request of Ossovsky auditioned Ossovsky's cousin, Ksenia Derzhinskaia (1889–1951), and helped to launch her opera career; she became an eminent Russian singer and prima donna at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Ossovsky was a friend of the composer Nikolai Tcherepnin and mentored his son – also a famous composer, Alexander Tcherepnin - during the early years of his career.
Ossovsky died in 1957, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). He had written a series of papers and monographs dedicated to research and analysis of the works of such outstanding Russian composers as Mikhail Glinka, Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov and others. He was one of the first musicologists who introduced music of Bach, Rameau, Corelli, Vivaldi and Wagner to the Russian public. His memoir of Rachmaninoff is of special interest and value, because he gives first-hand accounts of, and insights into, many important events in the biographies of Rachmaninoff and other musicians. Ossovsky’s works are frequently cited in many Western publications about Russian composers and their music.

On 26 May 2004, National Sorry Day, Susan Rankin, peacefully re-occupied crown land at Franklinford in central Victoria, calling her campsite the "Going Home Camp" as it is a site of significance to the Dja Dja Wurrung. Rankin asked the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment to produce documents proving that the Crown has the right to occupy these lands. According to the 2 June 2004 Daylesford Advocate, local DSE officers admitted they "cannot produce these documents and doubt that such documents exist". Police later arrested her and took her to Ballarat, but no charges were pressed.
In 2007 Susan Rankin embarked upon a 1,500 kilometre "Sacred Life Walk" from Adelaide to Uluru in a bid to "bring world-wide focus on Mother Earth’s changes and the continued deplorable treatment and living conditions of Aboriginal Peoples in the homelands of her Ancestors."

Gebouw Delftse Poort

Gebouw Delftse Poort () is a twin-tower skyscraper complex at Weena 505 next to the Rotterdam Centraal railway station in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Tower I is with 41 storeys, and Tower II is 25 storeys. Until May 2009, Tower I was the tallest office tower in the Netherlands. Both towers are built over a 4-storey multifunctional podium which adjoins the Rotterdam central station. The entire complex has 28 elevators. The gross floor area in the complex is 106,000 square metres and the offices occupy .
It was constructed between 1989 and 1992. The cost of the construction was NLG240 million, or about €110 million. Due to a metro tunnel running underneath the complex, advanced construction methods were required, allowing only a single underground floor to be built. Since the main user of the building is the Dutch Company 'Nationale-Nederlanden' (National-Netherlands) the building is also known as 'Nationale-Nederlanden building'. Nationale-Nederlanden is the local insurance branch of ING Insurance.
Until 2004, a race up the building's stairs was organised.

Mariya Ocher

Mary Ocher (""Oh-chur"", born November 10, 1986) is a singer-songwriter, poet, director and artist. She was born Mariya Ocheretianskaya (Russian: Мария Очеретянская, Hebrew:מאריה אוצ'רטיאנסקי) in Moscow, an only child to a voice and puppet theater actor father and an unemployed engineer mother both of Jewish/Ukrainian descent. Her family immigrated to Israel in 1991, first to a kibbutz in Negev and several months later to Tel Aviv.
While studying at a religious Jewish school in Israel, she was forced to change her name to Miriam for several years. In her teenage years, she studied film in an art high school in Tel-Aviv, which she then left at the beginning of the 12th grade. At the age of 18, she adopted Ocher as a last name.
Ocher's grandmother, Julia, was married to prominent Russian author Natan Eidelman, in the last years before his death.
At age 14, she had recorded her first song, produced by Idan Raichel, who later went on to become a successful mainstream world-music producer. Amusingly, out of the same film-class in high-school sprung members of the synthpop act "Ne'arei Poster" (Poster boys) and one-half of the hip-hop duo "Cohen@Mushon".
Work.
In December 2006, she formed a band, Mary and The Baby Cheeses, in Tel Aviv, and in October of the following year, the band moved to Berlin, where she would later change the entire line-up. The band produced several DIY releases, the most notable being a collection of studio recordings titled "Analog music for a digital generation". In December 2008, she released a solo album recording titled "War Songs", with 13 acoustic apocalyptic folk songs about war, crime and other related themes.
In mid-2009, she released several poems, and the "The Origins of Evil", a photography project which has been published in several on-line and printed magazines.
In April 2009, she organized "The Queens and The Rebels (of Unpopular Culture)" Festival for theatrical music/performance art and multimedia at the legendary Tacheles complex in Berlin. The second edition of the festival was held on April 18, 2010 at the RAW Temple, Berlin.

The film is about a late-1970s avant-garde movement.
In March 2011, Ocher was asked to participate in a campaign for Lomography, "LomoAmigo", to shoot everyday situations for several months with their analog cameras.
She participated in group exhibition "Zum Schein", at the "Neurotital" gallery/Berlin, and another at "Quai de la Batterie" (Battery Key) in Arras, France.
On December 2, 2011, "Haute Areal" released a 7" EP with four new tracks: 
King khan's version of "The sound of war", the synthpop "Address Yourself Entirely to Me", "Man of 1000 Faces" and "Ugly, Ugly Girls" - the latter two from the "War Songs" sessions.
On December 18, 2011, they created a site-specific installation titled "Restaurant".
She also accompanied musically the short play based on Andy Warhol's autobiography with German actor Peter Pagel at the Hans Otto Theater in Potsdam.
In June 2012, she was asked to join Ned Collette + Wirewalker's Australian tour.
And on 30 June 2012 she played the most notorious of German festivals, the Fusion festival.
In October 2012, Ocher went on tour with the German bestseller author Sibylle Berg, alongside actors Katja Riemann and Matthias Brandt to promote Berg's new book "Vielen dank für das Leben" ("Many Thanks for Life"). 
The tour visited most large German cities, as well as Zurich (Switzerland), and it was entirely sold-out. Along the shows, a video was made for the song "The final embrace (Toto's song)" (Toto is the main character in the book, of which Ocher resonates on stage).
On October 6, her new band with two drummers, "Your Government" premiered at the performance festival "Foreign Affairs” at the Berliner Festspiele.
The second album, "EDEN", produced by King Khan of King Khan and the Shrines and The King Khan and BBQ Show came out on Buback on 14 June 2013. The first single "Baby Indiana" was released on 1 June 2013 and second single, "The Android Sea" on 28 July 2013.
Due to the unusual amount of videos that were made for the album, they were released once a week, for 2 months. The music video for "Baby Indiana" featured King Khan, Jessie Evans, Drop Dead festival's Polina Y and Art Stars' Nadja Sayej.

Tito Vespasiano Strozzi

Tito Vespasiano Strozzi (Ferrara, 1424 – ca. 1505) was a Renaissance poet at the Este court of Ferrara, who figures as an interlocutor in Angelo Decembrio's "De politia litteraria" ("On literary polish").
A member of the Strozzi family exiled from Florence, son of Giovanni, who served in Ferrara as Niccolò III d'Este's commander, Tito was a patrician of Ferrara, where he was educated in humanistic culture. He was a courtier of successive dukes of Ferrara, Leonello, Borso, and Ercole d'Este, and was entrusted with several important posts in the civil magistrature. He was the official champion of the Duke of Ferrara (1473), served as Governor of Rovigo and the Polesine (1473–84) then "Giudice dei Savi" (1497-1505), in which post he was succeeded by his son Ercole Strozzi. Strozzi was included in the entourage that accompanied Borso to Rome, March 1471, to be elevated from "marchese" to "duca di Ferrara" by Pope Sixtus IV Della Rovere.
His portrait in profile, bearing the signature of Baldassare d'Este (natural son of Niccolò III d'Este) and the date 1499, was in the collection of .
Works.
He is more remembered for his humanistic compositions in Latin and some sonnets in Italian. He is said to have spent a lifetime polishing the amorous verses written in the first flush of his youth. His literary style was formed at Verona under the guidance of Guarino. 
Among his works are the six books of the "Eroticon", a series of elegies in refined Latin verse fusing Latin classical training with the spirit of Petrarch. A fine illuminated manuscript of them, with gold initials and illuminated margins, was purchased by the humanist Celio Calcagnini from the extensive former library of the Aragonese kings of Naples, dispersed by Isabella del Balzo, the deposed queen. 
His heroic "Borsiade" celebrating his patron Borso d'Este is lost, save a few fragments. There are also epigrams, and sermons. His collected "opere" were published by Aldus Manutius in 1513, together with works of his son, under the title "Strozii poëtae pater et filius".

2008–09 Biathlon World Cup – Relay Men

The 2008-09 Biathlon World Cup/Relay Men started on December 14, 2008 in Hochfilzen and will end on March 15, 2009 in Vancouver. Defending titlist is the Norwegian team.
Competition format.
The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski , each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.).

Seigokan

Seigokan (正剛館) is the Goju-Ryu Karate-do organization founded in 1945 by Seigo Tada (1922-1997) Hanshi (8th Dan). With its Hombu Dojo (headquarters) in Himeji, Japan, the "Seigokan All Japan Karate-do Association" (SAJKA) — its official name — has branches in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), India, Italy, the Philippines, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the United States, England, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.
Master Seigo Tada was a pupil of Chojun Miyagi and the head of the Karate Club at Ritsumeikan University. In the 1960s, Seigokan was considered the most important Goju-Ryu Association (Kai-Ha) in Japan, with more than 200,000 members. 
Seigokan includes two unique kata created by Seigo Tada — Kihon-Tsuki-no kata and Kihon-Uke-no kata — in addition to the traditional Goju-ryu kata Sanchin, Tensho, Gekisai Dai Ichi, Gekisai Dai Ni, Saifa, Seienchin, Seipai, Shisochin, Sanseru, Seisan, Kururunfa and Suparinpei.
The Seigokan curriculum also includes Yakusoku Kumite (set sparring techniques) in the variants 1 to 7 of Zenkutsu and 1 to 7 of Shikodachi, as well as seven Torite (grappling and striking techniques). Today, SAJKA is directed by Sandaime Kancho — or Soke Seigo Tada III — who succeeded Mrs. Okamoto Michiko (Seigo Tada II), the widow of Seigo Tada Hanshi. 
The most well-known Seigokan member is Ms. Atsuko Wakai, four-time WKF Women's Kata World Champion. Two senior members of Seigokan took important roles in continental and world karate affairs. The late Jose Martins Achiam 7th Dan (1944-2008) was an Executive Committee Member of World Karate Federation (WKF) and Secretary General of Asian Karatedo Federation (AKF). Bill K.S. Mok (7th Dan) was an Executive Committee Member of World Karate Federation 2004-2010 and Secretary General of Asian Karatedo Federation 2008-2010. The European Seigokan Chief Instructor is José Manuel Guerreiro Santana (6th Dan), twice World Seigokan Kumite Champion in 1998 and 2004, from Portugal Seigokan. The Italian Seigokan Chief Instructor is Shihan Francesco Cuzzocrea (6th Dan), from Reggio Calabria (Italy).

Albert Norden

Albert Norden (4 December 1904, Myslowitz - 30 May 1982) was a German communist politician. He went into exile during Nazi rule. He returned to Germany after the war, and became an important politician in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). A writer of several works, Norden authored the 1965 "Braunbuch".
Early political activity.
In 1919 he joined the Young Communist League of Germany. The following year he became a member of the Communist Party of Germany. From 1923 onwards, he held editorial positions in various communist publications. Between 1931–33 he was the editor of "Rote Fahne" ('Red Flag').
In exile.
In 1933 Norden emigrated to France. He also spent time in exile in Denmark and Czechoslovakia. In 1938 he returned to France. Norden was detained in France 1939-1940. In 1941, he was able to emigrate to the United States. During World War II, his father died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
In exile in Paris and New York he worked with various popular front publications. He wrote some chapters, dealing with the international linkages of the German NSDAP, in the widely read 1933 "Braunbuch über Reichstagsbrand und Hitlerterror" ('Brown Book on Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror'). In October 1946 he returned to Berlin, where he became editor of the weekly "Deutschlands Stimme" ('Voice of Germany').
Political career in East Germany.
In 1949 he was assigned as head of the Press Section of the Information Department of Ministerial Council of the German Democratic Republic, working under Gerhart Eisler. In December 1952 he was purged from his position in the Press Department, but obtained a professorship at Humboldt University.
In 1954 he became director of the National Council of the National Front for a Democratic Germany. He would also become director of the Committee for German Unity. In 1955, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). He was elected as one of the secretaries of the Central Committee. In 1958 he became a member of the Politburo of the party.
Norden served as head of the Agitation Committee of the Politburo, 1955–67. He was in-charge of the Information & Foreign Department of the Politburo until 1979. In 1958 he became a member of the "Volkskammer" (People's Chamber, the parliament of the GDR). In 1960 he became the head of the 'West Commission'. In June 1965 Norden suggested that regional elections in the German Democratic Republic should be open for alternate candidates.
In 1963 Norden became a member of the National Defense Council, a post he held until 1979. In 1976 he became a member of the State Council. In April 1981 the then ailing Norden was left out of the Central Committee and Politburo at the 10th SED party congress. In the same year he left the "Volkskammer" and State Council positions.
Brown Book.
After the war Norden argued in several publications, articles and speeches that there was a direct continuation between the Hitler and Adenauer governments. In 1965 the National Front published a work by Norden, "Braunbuch" ('Brown Book'), in which he accused over 1,900 politicians, state officials and other prominent persons in West Germany of having worked for the Nazi regime in the past. The book became a reference in the West German New Left, which increasingly had begun to question the official histiography on the Nazi period.
Religious identity.
Norden was born in a Jewish petty bourgeois family. His father was a rabbi. As an adult, Norden declined to identify himself as a Jew. He was however, one of the most prominent persons of Jewish origin in East German society.

<doc id="20838746" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20838746" title="Chronic endothelial injury hypothesis">
Chronic endothelial injury hypothesis

The chronic endothelial injury hypothesis is one of two major mechanisms postulated to explain the underlying cause of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), the other being the lipid hypothesis. Although an ongoing debate involving connection between dietary lipids and CHD sometimes portrays the two hypotheses as being opposed, they are in no way mutually exclusive. Moreover, since the discovery of the role of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the two hypotheses have become tightly linked by a number of molecular and cellular processes.
Origins of the hypothesis.
Ross and Glomset initially proposed that endothelial cell uncovering was the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. Other hypotheses have associated the role of infectious agents ("e.g." cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori) in inflammatory responses in the arterial wall. Currently, most research seems to focus on inflammatory processes which associate endothelial dysfunction with lipoprotein accumulation.
The inflammatory process.
The first phase of the inflammatory process is marked by the accumulation of lipid and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles beneath the endothelium. This is followed by the attachment of leukocytes, monocytes, and T-lymphocytes to the endothelial cell surface. Leukocytes migrate to the subendothelial space and aggregate within the intima. 
In the presence of elevated levels of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), monocytes are converted to activated macrophages. Macrophages accumulate modified lipid particles and become foam cells. The formation of foam cells and their continued accumulation in the intima lead to the formation of fatty streaks. Continued cell migration and proliferation eventually result in the formation of a fibrous plaque.
The role of oxidized LDL.
Once LDL accumulates in the subendothelial space, it tends to become modified or oxidized. This oxidized LDL plays several key roles in furthering the course of the inflammatory process. It is chemotactic to monocytes; oxidized LDL causes endothelial cells to secrete molecules that cause monocytes to penetrate between the endothelial cells and accumulate in the intima.
Oxidized LDL promotes death of endothelial cells by augmenting apoptosis. Also, through the activation of collagenases, ox-LDL contributes to a process which may lead to the rupture of the fibrous plaque Oxidized LDL decreases the availability of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which, in turn, increases the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium. Moreover, NO is involved in paracrine signalling between the endothelium and the smooth muscle that maintains vascular tone; without it, the muscle will not relax, and the blood vessel remains constricted. Thus, oxidized LDL also contributes to the hypertension often seen with atherosclerosis.
Implications for the treatment and prevention of arteriosclerosis.
The role LDL plays suggests two different approaches to treatment and prevention. The first approach involves discouraging the accumulation of LDL by lowering the levels of serum LDL, an idea more closely associated with the lipid hypothesis. A major breakthrough involved the discovery of statins, a class of drugs which help to clear LDL from the bloodstream. It has been demonstrated conclusively that elevated levels of LDL are associated with higher risk of mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD); it has also been shown that statins substantially lower the risk of mortality in patients with high LDL.
A second approach would be to discourage the oxidation of LDL, thereby breaking the inflammatory cycle. Lipoproteins consist of a packaging of triglycerides and esterfied cholesterol within a monolayer shell consisting of phospholipids and a class of proteins called apolipoproteins. The phospholipds are amphipathic, consisting of a hydrophobic tail which faces inwards, binding with the triglycerides and cholesterol, and a hydrophilic head which faces outwards, making the lipoproteins water soluble.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contained in the outer shell make the lipoproteins especially susceptible to oxidation. However, lipoproteins also contain antioxidants which protect the components, vitamin E and carotenoids being the two major naturally-occurring antioxidants in human lipoprotein.
Although some studies have shown positive results following anti-oxidant therapy with vitamin C, vitamin E therapy has attracted the most public attention. There have been some positive results, though recent studies have shown no benefit for antioxidant therapy on mortality among patients at risk for CHD.,
Implications for diet: Dietary lipids and LDL levels.
An early incarnation of the lipid hypothesis which focused on hypercholesterolemia lead to the suggestion that mortality from CHD might be reduced by controlling dietary input of cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated that increasing dietary cholesterol leads to an increase in both total cholesterol (TC) and LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C), however it also leads to increases in the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), offsetting the effect of the increase in LDL-C. Epidemological studies which attempted to correlate dietary cholesterol with risk of mortality in CHD have produced mixed results.
Recent studies have focused more on the ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet. It has been demonstrated that intake of SFA raises TC in humans, whereas PUFA lowers TC; however SFA also increases the level of HDL-C, once more offsetting the effect of increased TC. Studies of individual fatty acids show that some SFAs, "e.g." stearic acid and palmitic acid have little effect of LDL-C levels; stearic acid actually "lowers" the LDL/HDL ratio due to a greater increase of HDL-C levels relative to TC. 
Epidemiological studies designed to test the relationship between high SFA/PUFA ratios and CHD mortality have tended to produce mixed results. Two recent studies provide an example of this lack of consensus: a study from Poland correlated a decline in CHD mortality with a decrease in the ratio of SFA to PUFA in the population's diet following the collapse of communism. Yet a large population study from Sweden covering roughly the same time period showed "no" association between fat intake and CHD.
The AHA guidelines and the beginning of a controversy.
The early studies associating the ratio of dietary SFA and PUFA with TC levels led the American Heart Association (AHA) to promulgate a set of dietary guidelines which included the recommendation to replace saturated fats found in dairy and meat products with polyunsaturated fats found in natural vegetable oils such as those derived from "corn, cottonseed, and soya". This first set of recommendations, published in the Journal "Circulation" in 1961, specifically sanctioned the use of products containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, "i.e." margarine and vegetable shortening. Despite the lack of uncontrovertable epidemiological evidence of their effectiveness, these initial guidelines received widespread acceptance among the medical community in the US. 
The suggestion to replace saturated animal fats with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils lead to a reaction which will be discussed below. However, is important to note that the AHA's dietary guidelines have undergone several revisions since the initial report. Although the most recent (2006) guidelines still recommend reducing the consumption of saturated fat, they no longer suggest switching to polyunsaturated fats. Moreover, the guidelines now recommend "minimizing" the intake of partially hydrogenated fats while increasing the consumption of fish and other sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, the position of the AHA is now much closer to that of its critics.
Criticism of the AHA guidelines: the “Cholesterol Skeptics”.
Critics of the AHA dietary guidelines point out that incidence of CHD in the US increased markedly during a 60 year period beginning in 1910. During the same period, consumption of saturated fat fell, while consumption of processed vegetable oils rose more than 400%. (Much of the evidence presented to support this claim of a large increase in incidence of CHD in the early part of the century is anecdotal. Statistics covering the period from 1950 to 1980 show that mortality from CHD in the US, although much higher than in most other countries, began to decline slowly after 1966 (mortality in the UK, although initially much lower than in the US, rose continuously during this period). These are "mortality" figures; the downward trend in the US probably reflects improvements in survival rate and not a decrease in "incidence".)
This observation led some critics to "invert" the AHA guidelines. They stress benefits of dietary SFA, citing presence of natural antioxidants in animal fats, while encouraging people to avoid foods containing processed vegetable oils. They focus on deleterious effect of dietary PUFA, often mentioning two factors: (1) the vulnerability of PUFA to oxidation and the formation of free radicals, and (2) the high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA in the more common vegetable oils—those derived from “corn, cottonseed, and soya”. Their considerations are not limited to CHD, they point to an entire litany of inflammatory disorders which can be linked to diet and the consumption of processed vegetable oils. Some critics also question the "safety" of cholesterol-lowering drugs, suggesting that CHD is best controlled using a combination of diet and exercise. 
This preoccupation with inflammatory processes has led some authors to popularize the chronic endothelial injury hypothesis. They also criticize the “lipid hypothesis”; however, for the most part, what is being criticized is not the lipid hypothesis itself, but a set of dietary guidelines that evolved from it. The debate is not (or should not be) about "validity" of the two hypotheses, but rather the "relative benefits" of two different therapeutic approaches: whether it is more productive to concentrate on lowering LDL levels or to focus on the underlying inflammatory mechanisms.
Many of these critics appeal to a popular, anti-establishment audience. At the most radical end of this spectrum, a number of books have been written which suggest the existence of a conspiracy between the “medical establishment” and “financial interests”, "i.e." the food-processing industry and drug companies.

Hugh Shaw (football manager)

Hugh Shaw was a Scottish association football player and manager, most notably with Hibernian. He played for Hibs during the interwar period, making his debut during the 1918–19 season. Shaw played as a half-back in the Hibs side that reached the Scottish Cup Finals of 1923 and 1924, losing to Celtic and Airdrie respectively.
Shaw was hired as Hibs' trainer by Willie McCartney after he was appointed manager in 1936. Hibs had fallen on hard times in the early 1930s, having suffered relegation for the first time in 1931 and then struggling to regain and retain Division One status. Through the late 1930s and the Second World War, McCartney built the great Hibs side that would largely dominate Scottish football in the late 1940s and early 1950s. With Hibs on top of the league midway through the 1947–48 season, however, McCartney collapsed during a Scottish Cup match and died later that night. Although Matt Busby was linked with the job, Shaw was appointed as manager within the week, as Hibs faced a match against their main challengers, Rangers. Hibs won that match 1–0 with a goal in the last minute and went on to win the league title.
Shaw completed the Famous Five forward line by introducing Bobby Johnstone to the team in 1948, with all five playing together for the first time on 21 April 1949. He guided the team to further league titles in 1951 and 1952, while narrowly missing out in 1950 and 1953. The team also entered the first European Cup competition, reaching the semi-final.
The forward line was broken by the sale of Bobby Johnstone to Manchester City in 1955, and the remaining players were starting to age. Hibs continued to do well in reserve team football, but many of those players failed to impress in the first team, with the brilliant exception of Joe Baker. Therefore Shaw had to take some of the blame for the failure to replace the great side. After the team struggled at the start of the 1961–62 season, Shaw resigned in November 1961. He then had a brief spell as Raith Rovers manager.
In 2003, the "Sunday Herald" newspaper listed Shaw as 31st in their list of the 50 greatest Scottish football managers, noting his "sense and man-management skills".

Roderigue Hortalez and Company

Roderigue Hortalez and Company was a fictitious business set up in July 4, 1776 by Spain and France House of Bourbon, after entering into a secret agreement with the colonists to support them in their rebellion against England. promise of secret support from both Spain and France surely gave confidence to the colonists prior to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The ruse was organized by Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, a playwright, watch-maker, inventor, musician, politician, fugitive, spy, publisher, arms-dealer, and revolutionary. Weapons and materials were procured to help the Americans fight the British, enemies of France at the time, through the fake business.
Background.
The Seven Years' War had gone badly for France, which had lost nearly all of her North American colonial possessions and had been militarily humiliated by the British. Spain, who had been an ally of France late in the war, had lost the strategically important territory of Florida. Britain, meanwhile, had expanded its colonial territories across large areas of North America.
In 1773, a jealous nobleman got into a scuffle with Beaumarchais, resulting in the playwright spending ten weeks in jail and losing his citizenship rights. He pledged his services to Louis XV and Louis XVI in order to restore his civil rights.
In 1774, Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes was appointed the foreign minister of France by Louis XVI. Vergennes was strongly anti-England, at one point declaring "England is the natural enemy of France." His chance to strike at Britain came through Pierre Beaumarchais.
The company in operation.
Beaumarchais, working as a secret agent, had traveled to London in pursuit of a cross-dressing agent of Louis XVI, who had threatened the King with blackmail. During that period Beaumarchais fell in with the dissolute crowd that surrounded John Wilkes, the Mayor of London. There he received a letter from the Continental Congress, delivered by Arthur Lee. In it Congress suggested to his government that it encourage the rebellion in the thirteen colonies by sending secret military aid disguised as a loan. Beaumarchais believed Britain's economy would be significantly crippled without the thirteen colonies. Louis XVI and Vergennes agreed. Spain, whose colonies in the Caribbean and on the Mexican Gulf were threatened by a Florida in the control of a rapidly growing and aggressive power, promised to provide matching contributions. Both states were unwilling to openly show their support, at least until after the rebellion had successfully begun. Beaumarchais was given one million livres by France and one million livres by Spain in May 1776 to start for the Roderigue Hortalez and Company to secretly finance the American Revolution.
Before the Declaration of Independence was even signed, weapons and other necessities were already flowing via the ostensibly neutral Dutch island of St. Eustatius. Muskets, cannons, cannon balls, gunpowder, bombs, mortars, tents, and enough clothing for 30,000 men were sent. This assistance kept American hopes alive during the spring of 1776.
Hortalez & Co. conducted business with the Americans from France through Connecticut merchant Silas Deane, who was sharing a covert trade agency with Thomas Morris the half-brother of Robert Morris (financier). Because this business did not include Arthur Lee, Lee then made it a point that Beaumarchais would never be paid for the goods he provided. He did this, not to harm Beaumarchais, but to deprive a political competitor his commission. As a result of Lee's actions, Deane lived in disgrace and poverty for years, and eventually died trying to prove that he was due the money.
Opposition.
The only major opposition to the plan came from French minister of finance Baron Turgot. He insisted that American independence would occur whether or not France financed the rebellion. He said the funding would add to the already heavy burden of a general French military and naval buildup and would lead to bankruptcy. Turgot eventually resigned in protest.

Inravisión

The Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisión (Inravisión) was Colombia's national public broadcasting organization between 1964 and 2004. It was created by Decree 3267 of 20 December 1963, which declared that from 1 April 1964 the country's public radio and television broadcasting service would be provided by Inravisión, "a public company with financial, administrative, and legal autonomy".
Among Inravisión's functions were to organize contracts with the "programadoras", the companies who produced programs and aired them on the national networks; develop and execute the plans and projects adopted by the Colombian Ministry of Communications; and offer official educational, cultural and informational services through the country's radio and television infrastructure. In 1993, it also assumed the duties of screening programs, which "programadoras" were required to send 72 hours in advance, for purposes of determining if the programs were suitable for viewing by minors.
In the 1990s, Inravisión was wracked by continual technical problems, which included a 30-minute nationwide outage of all three channels in June 1995, described at the time as "the biggest rough patch in Inravisión's 41-year history"; commercials that didn't air in correct color; signal reception deficiencies, even in major cities such as Cali; poorly calibrated cameras; leaks in the studio buildings; commercials airing for the incorrect newscast; and a 77-minute outage of all three channels in December 1995.
Inravisión was liquidated at the end of 2004, during the first administration (2002–2006) of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez. Contributing factors to the decision included the company's growing pension liabilities (600 billion Colombian pesos), its out-of-date technology, and the "programadoras" crisis, which left Canal Uno in a failed financial state and forced the state to operate Canal A as Canal Institucional. At its closure, Inravisión had 411 employees. Audiovisuales, the state "programadora", was also liquidated.
It was succeeded by Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia (RTVC).

Plaza Apartments (Cleveland, Ohio)

The Plaza Apartments is a historic five-story apartment building located in the Central neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Built in 1901, it was designed by the architectural firm of Steffens, Searles & Hirsh, which built many middle-class apartment buildings in the Cleveland era around the turn of the twentieth century. It features a primarily brick facade; stone appears in the exterior, and the foundation is stone. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1984, being included primarily for its architectural significance. Other historic buildings surround the Plaza Apartments: it was added to the Register as part of the "Upper Prospect Multiple Resource Area," and the Register-listed Jeremiah Ensworth House is located next door. Located just a quarter of a mile (400 m) from the Cleveland State University campus, the Plaza Apartments remains an active apartment building today, although named the "Plaza Suites."

Transport in Berlin

Berlin has developed a highly complex transportation infrastructure providing very diverse modes of urban mobility. 979 bridges cross 197 kilometers of innercity waterways, of roads run through Berlin, of which are motorways.
Long-distance rail lines connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany and with many cities in neighboring European countries. Regional rail lines provide access to the surrounding regions of Brandenburg and to the Baltic Sea.
Road transport.
In 2006, 1.416 million motor vehicles were registered in the city. With 416 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants (587/1000 in Germany), Berlin as a German state and as a major European city has one of the lowest numbers of cars per capita.
Autobahn links.
Berlin is linked to the rest of Germany and neighbouring countries by the country's autobahn network, including the:
All of these autobahn terminate at the A10 Berliner Ring, a autobahn that encircles the city at some distance from the centre, and largely in the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Central Berlin is connected to the A10 by several shorter autobahns:
The A111, A113 and A115 connect with the A100 Berliner Stadtring, an autobahn that forms a half circle to the west of the inner city, and is one of the busiest motorways in Germany. There are plans to extend this motorway to form a full circle around the inner city.
Cycling.
Berlin is known for its highly developed bike lane system. Around 1,500,000 daily rides account for 13% of total traffic in 2008. The Senate of Berlin aims to increase the number to 18-20% of city traffic by the year 2025. Riders have access to of bike paths including some of mandatory bicycle paths, of off-road bicycle routes, of bike lanes on the roads, of shared bus lanes which are also open to bicyclists, of combined pedestrian/bike paths and of marked bike lanes on sidewalks. A system of bike-sharing stations across the city cetre is being implemented by Deutsche Bahn since 2011, starting in Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte
Water transport.
Berlin is linked to the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the River Rhine by an extensive network of rivers, lakes and canals. An equally extensive network of waterways exists within the city boundaries, providing local access and various short-cuts. The waterways accommodate a mixture of commercial traffic, sightseeing tour boats, ferries and a large fleet of private leisure boats.
The waterways of Berlin.
Berlin city centre is located on the River Spree, which runs roughly east to west across the city. The River Dahme joins the Spree at Köpenick, in the city's eastern suburbs. At Spandau the Spree joins the River Havel, which flows roughly north to south along the city's western boundary. To both east and west of the centre of Berlin, all three of these rivers flow through substantial chains of lakes. These include the Tegeler See and Großer Wannsee to the west, and the Müggelsee, Langer See, Seddinsee and Zeuthener See to the east.
The Elbe–Havel Canal links the River Havel downstream of Spandau with both the River Elbe, which flows into the North Sea at Hamburg, and with the Mittelland Canal, which stretches across Germany to a network of canals that provide a link to the River Rhine. Both the Oder–Havel and Oder–Spree canals provide routes from the Berlin area to the River Oder, which flows into the Baltic Sea near Szczecin and provides links to Poland. The Oder-Havel Canal links with the River Havel north of Spandau, whilst the Oder-Spree Canal links with the River Dahme east of Köpenick.
The most important canals within Berlin run roughly east to west between the rivers Spree and Havel. The canal system to the north of the Spree begins with the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal, which runs from the Spree near the Hauptbahnhof to the River Havel above Spandau. The Westhafen Canal and the Charlottenburg Canal, both near Charlottenburg, provide further connections between the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal and the River Spree. 
The main canal to the south of the Spree is the Teltow Canal, which runs from the Dahme south of Köpenick through the southern part of Berlin to an arm of the Havel just east of Potsdam. A shorter canal, the Landwehr Canal, parallels the Spree through the centre of Berlin. It begins at the Spree between Treptow and Kreuzberg and rejoins the Spree in Charlottenburg. The Neukölln Ship Canal connects the Landwehr Canal with the Teltow Canal; while the Britz Canal connects the Teltow Canal with the Spree at Baumschulenweg.
Whilst not within Berlin, the existence of the city and its partition led to the construction of the Havel Canal in 1951-2. This canal provides an alternative route between Hennigsdorf and Paretz, both then in East Germany, and avoids the stretch of the River Havel that was under the political control of West Berlin. 
Waterborne traffic.
Berlin's largest port is the Westhafen ("west port"), in Moabit (Mitte), with an area of 173,000 m² (42.75 acres). It lies at the intersection of the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal and the Westhafen Canal. It handles the shipping of grain and pieced and heavy goods. The Südhafen ("south port"), which actually lies along the Havel in Spandau, in far western Berlin, covers an area of about 103,000 m² (25.5 acres) and also handles the shipping of pieced and heavy goods. The Osthafen ("east port"), with an area of 57,500 m² (14.2 acres), lies along the Spree in Friedrichshain. The Hafen Neukölln, with only 19,000 m² (4.7 acres), is located along the Neuköllner Ship Canal in Neukölln. It handles the shipping of building materials.
Sightseeing boats operate on the central section of the River Spree and its adjoining waterways on a frequent basis. Common tours operated include short tours on the River Spree in the city centre, and a three hour circuit of the city centre via the River Spree and the Landwehr Canal. Other sightseeing boats operate on the various lakes to the east and west of Berlin.
Several ferry services operate on and across Berlin's waterways (see "ferries" below).
Public transport.
Berlin's local public transport network consists of several integrated systems. These include the U-Bahn and S-Bahn urban rail systems, regional railway services, a tramway system, a bus network and a number of ferry services. There are a large number of common interchange stations between the different modes.
All these services form part of the common public transport tariff run by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB). This covers the city of Berlin and approximately beyond the city boundaries. The area is split into three zones. Zone A is the central parts of the city (inside the Ringbahn), and zone B is the outer parts of Berlin City. Zone C covers an area beyond the city boundaries. 
Ticket fares have a slight price difference between these three zones. For instance, in June 2012, a one-day ticket for zone A+B was priced at €6.30, a zone B+C one-day travel ticket was €6.60, and for all three zones A+B+C, the price was €6.80.
U-Bahn.
The U-Bahn is an urban rapid transit rail system, and is entirely within the city borders. Whilst the majority of the system is underground, significant sections operate on elevated tracks or at street level. It is operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), the city owned municipal transport operator, and uses the common public transport tariff managed by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB).
The U-Bahn now comprises nine lines with 173 stations and a total length of . Trains run every two to five minutes during peak hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes in the evening and on Sunday. They travel 132 million km (83 million mi), carrying 400 million passengers, over the year. 
The first line of the U-Bahn opened in 1902, and construction has continued spasmodically since then, with the most recent line opening in 2009. The first four lines to be built were built with a narrower profile and a slightly different electrification method to the later lines. This is most noticeably seen in the narrower trains on the earlier lines, and rolling stock cannot easily be interchanged between the two groups of lines. 
During the division of the city, the U-Bahn system was itself partitioned. One line – the U5 – was entirely within East Berlin, and another – the U2 – was operated in two sections, one by each of the two sides. The remaining lines were nominally within West Berlin, although two of them passed under East Berlin without stopping, except at the Friedrichstraße station, which served as a transfer point and border crossing.
Whilst the city remained partitioned, there was major expansion of the U-Bahn in the west, driven both by the availability of funds from commercially successful West Germany and by the desire to provide alternatives to the East German run S-Bahn. Since reunification, expansion has been less fast.
S-Bahn.
The S-Bahn has aspects of both rapid transit and commuter rail operation. Historically it developed from commuter services provided by main line railway operators, but now runs on tracks that are separate from, but often parallel to, other trains. Most of the system is operated at ground level, but there are significant sections of elevated tracks and tunnels. It has a somewhat longer average distance between stations than the U-Bahn, and it also serves some of the closer suburbs in Brandenburg. It is operated by a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, the national rail operator, and uses the common public transport tariff managed by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB).
The S-Bahn now comprises 15 routes with 166 stations and a total length of . Over much of the network more than one route provides service over the same tracks, and these routes all feed into one of three core lines: a central, elevated east-west line ("the Stadtbahn"), a central, mostly underground north-south line ("the Nord-Süd-Tunnel"), and a circular, mostly elevated line ("the Ringbahn"). 
The "Stadtbahn" carries both S-Bahn trains and regional and long-distance trains, on two separate pairs of tracks. This line passes through most of the city's long-distance and regional train stations, including Berlin Zoologischer Garten, Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Friedrichstraße, Alexanderplatz, and Berlin Ostbahnhof. The "Ringbahn" forms a circle around the inner city and crosses the Stadtbahn at Westkreuz ("west crossing") and Ostkreuz ("east crossing"). The "Nord-Süd-Tunnel" intersects the "Stadtbahn" at Friedrichstraße and the "Ringbahn" at Südkreuz and Gesundbrunnen.
During the East German era the S-Bahn was run by the communist state, initially even in West Berlin. As a result, and as a protest against the building of the Berlin Wall, the S-Bahn was boycotted by West Berliners, and much of the system in West Berlin eventually closed through lack of traffic. In 1984 the BVG took over operation of the West Berlin section of the S-Bahn. After reunification, the two halves of the S-Bahn were reunited under the ownership of the Deutsche Bahn.
Regional trains.
Berlin is the centre of a system of regional trains operated by Deutsche Bahn, which operate to destinations within the Berlin-Brandeburg suburban area beyond the range of the S-Bahn. There are two kinds of regional trains, the stopping "Regionalbahn" (RB) and the faster "Regional-Express" (RE). 
Unlike the S-Bahn, the network of regional trains does not have its own segregated tracks, but rather shares tracks with longer distance passenger and freight services. Within Berlin, regional services stop less frequently than S-Bahn services, especially where they run parallel to U-Bahn or S-Bahn lines.
Regional trains often continue outside the Berlin-Brandenburg suburban area, but within that suburban area they use the common public transport tariff managed by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB). This covers the city of Berlin and approximately beyond the city boundaries. These tickets are not valid on DB InterCity trains, Intercity-Express trains and international trains, even within Berlin.
Trams.
Berlin has a tram network comprising 22 tram lines serving 377 tram stops and measuring in length. All these services are operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and use the common public transport tariff run by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB).
Of the 22 BVG-operated tram routes, nine are designated as part of the "MetroNetz", which provide a high frequency service in areas poorly served by the U-Bahn and S-Bahn. These "MetroTram" tram lines are recognisable by an M prefix to their route number, and are the only tram routes to operate 24 hours a day. 
Berlin's first horse tram opened in 1865, running from Brandenburger Tor to Charlottenburg. In 1881, the world's first electric tramway was opened by Werner von Siemens in Groß-Lichterfelde, now part of Berlin. By 1910, the horse trams had been entirely replaced by electric trams. 
Prior to the division of Berlin, tram lines existed throughout the city, but all the tram lines in the former West Berlin had been replaced by bus or U-Bahn services by 1967. However East Berlin retained its tram lines, and the current network is still predominantly in that area, although there have been a few extensions back across the old border.
Besides the BVG tram routes, two further tram lines (numbered 87 and 88) cross the Berlin city boundary in order to connect suburban S-Bahn stations within the city to the Brandenburg towns of Woltersdorf, Schöneiche and Rüdersdorf. A similar line operates within the nearby town of Strausberg, whilst the adjacent city of Potsdam has its own sizable tram network. Whilst none of these lines is operated by the BVG, they all use the VBB common tariff. 
Buses.
Berlin has a network of 149 daytime bus routes serving 2634 bus stops and with a total route length of . All these services are operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and use the common public transport tariff run by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB). 
Of the BVG-operated bus routes, 17 are designated as part of the "MetroNetz", which provides a high frequency service in areas poorly served by the U-Bahn and S-Bahn. Like the "MetroTram" tram routes, these "MetroBus" routes can be recognised by an M prefix to their route number. A further 13 BVG-operated bus routes are express routes with an X prefix to their route number. 
At nighttime, Berlin is served by a night bus network of 63 bus routes serving 1508 stops and a total route length of . One night bus runs parallel to each U-Bahn line during the weektime closing hours. Most of the "MetroNetz" bus and tram routes operate 24 hours a day, and form part of both the day and night networks. Again services are operated by BVG and use the VBB tariff.
BVG bus service is provided by a fleet of 1349 buses, of which no fewer than 407 are double-decker buses. Whilst such buses are common in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, their use elsewhere in Europe is extremely uncommon.
Ferries.
Berlin has an extensive network of waterways within its city boundaries, including the Havel, Spree and Dahme rivers, and many linked lakes and canals. These are crossed by six passenger ferry routes that are operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and use the common public transport tariff managed by the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB). 
There are also a number of other ferry routes that are not managed by BVG, and do not form part of the VBB common tariff. These include passenger and car ferries serving islands within Berlin's lakes, as well as a car ferry across the River Havel. The adjacent city of Potsdam operates a ferry that is within the VBB common tariff.
Modal split.
The modal split between the major modes is a follows:
Airports.
Berlin is served by two commercial airports. Tegel Airport (TXL) is the largest and located within Berlin, while smaller Schönefeld Airport (SXF) is situated just outside of Berlin, to the south-east. Combined, they handled 22,3 million passengers in 2010. In 2011, 88 airlines served 164 destinations in 54 countries from Berlin airports, with 28 non-European connections. Tegel Airport is scheduled to close in 2013 and Schönefeld Airport will be expanded and renamed Berlin Brandenburg Airport, handling all commercial flights to and from Berlin. 
A third, Tempelhof Airport, formerly handled short distance and commuter flights. It was closed at the end of October 2008. A referendum opposing the closure could not gather the required quorum. Closure of Tegel and Tempelhof airports is a legal requirement for the opening of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport south of the Schönefeld Airport site, in order to alleviate noise pollution throughout the city.
Early aviation.
The first airport in Berlin was Johannisthal Air Field which opened on 26 September 1909. Followed shortly after by Staaken Airport around 1915, known for its two zeppelin halls and Deutsche Luft Hansa base. Then came Tempelhof Airport in 1923 and Gatow Air Field in 1934. Tegel Airport was built during the Berlin Blockade in 1948.
Tempelhof was the first airport in the world with regular passenger flights, opening in 1923 with flights to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad). Deutsche Luft Hansa started its operations from the airport in 1926, while zeppelins also frequented the airport. The airport expanded rapidly, becoming one of the largest airports in the world in the 1930s, fittingly provided with enormous halls, which are still visible today, unfinished though they may be. Tempelhof also had another first: it was the first airport to feature its own underground station.
After 1945.
Following World War II, Tempelhof was used as a U.S. Air Force base, while the Soviet air force relocated to Schönefeld, outside Berlin, during 1946. The Soviets had reached Tempelhof before the Western Allies. Gatow Air Field, which was taken over by the RAF in July 1945, was partially outside Berlin. At the Potsdam Conference it was then decided to exchange the western half of Staaken, including Staaken Airport, for the needed territory in Gatow. Staaken Airport was then used by the Soviet air force for some time to come.
In April 1948, as a result of growing tension between the Soviet and the Western Allied occupying powers, West Berlin was closed off from the surrounding Soviet sector. Supplies were flown in for over a year; enormous numbers of transport planes flew in and out of Berlin every day of this period. The capacity of the airports then in the three Western sectors was not large enough; to relieve pressure on Gatow and Tempelhof, Tegel Airport was built in the French sector. It was constructed by a labour force mainly consisting of Berlin women , under the supervision of French engineers, within just 90 days . It featured a 2400 m runway - the longest in Europe at the time. Because of special Allied bylaws, Lufthansa was not allowed to use Tegel until after German reunification.
Tempelhof was returned to civil administration in 1951, Schönefeld in 1954 and Tegel in 1960. Gatow Airport remained a military airfield, used by the RAF until 1994 and closed in 1995. Tegel, the newest airport, became the main civilian airport for West Berlin, while Schönefeld served the population of East Berlin. Since the smaller airport at Tempelhof is surrounded by urban development, it could not expand.
Berlin Brandenburg Airport.
Following German reunification in 1990, the inefficiency of operating three separate airports became increasingly problematic. Berlin's airport authority (the Berliner Flughafen GmbH, a subsidiary of the Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld GmbH) will transfer all of Berlin's air traffic to a greatly expanded airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed Berlin Brandenburg Airport. One airport would be more efficient and would decrease the noise pollution. The existing airport in Schönefeld will be greatly expanded to the south from its current state to allow this. In fact, the new airport will only have the current southern runway (the new designated northern runway) in common with the existing airport.
Berlin Brandenburg Airport is predicted to be Germany's third busiest airport when it opens, as Berlin's airports served over 22.3 million passengers in 2010. Frankfurt Airport, which served 54 million passengers in 2007, is the country's busiest airport, followed by Munich Airport, which served 34 million passengers in 2007.
Due to technical difficulties, the opening has been delayed a couple of times.

Italian General Strike

The Italian General Strike was a general strike against Benito Mussolini's power-grab with the March on Rome, in late October 1922. It was led by socialists and ended in defeat for the workers. Mussolini famously referred to this as the "Caporetto of Italian Socialism".
Rudolph Rocker, an active Anarcho-Syndicalist of this period, described the event in his book: "When in 1922 the general strike against Fascism broke out, the democratic government armed the Fascist hordes and throttled this last attempt at the defence of freedom and right. But Italian democracy had dug its own grave. It thought it could use Mussolini as a tool against the workers, but thus it became its own grave-digger."

<doc id="20838863" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20838863" title="Rotten ice">
Rotten ice

Rotten ice is a loose term for ice that is melting, disintegrating, or otherwise formed, having water, air, or contaminants between ice grains, causing the ice to be honeycombed. It forms on open water, when snowpack and ice are mixed together and other conditions. It may be transparent, causing it to look like new black ice. Though it may appear strong, rotten ice is weak — even several feet thick may not hold a person's weight (although it may hold a dog sled's weight). On land, it is difficult or impossible to climb. It melts more quickly than solid ice. Candle ice is a form of rotten ice.
One way to tell that ice is rotting would be the grey, splotchy color. Also, the thickness of ice cannot determine how safe it is, because water from underneath the ice can erode the ice and cause it to be thinner without a sign on the surface. Even thick ice may be weak, especially if it has frozen and thawed repeatedly or if it contains layers of snow. Minerals in the water make vertical veins in the ice. These veins melt much faster than the rest of the ice causing vertical channels and the ice to weaken along those channels. Many people tend to question if snow actually warms up ice, making it more likely to crack and break, or if snow actually causes ice to freeze faster. Snow will actually act like an insulating blanket. The ice under the snow will be thinner and weaker. A new snowfall can also warm-up and melt existing ice. Rotten ice is becoming more commonly found in the Beaufort Sea, near Alaska, due to different climate changes. This is concerning, because it is a sign that the amount of multiyear ice is declining, and it is being replaced with heavily decayed ice.

Temple entry conflict.
"Kannanallur Mariamman" temple located in the village was closed for entry to everyone till December 2008 due to conflicts between Dalits and non-Dalits. Communist Party of India (Marxist) had announced temple entry with Dalits on 17 December 2008 which led to the vacation of about 400 non-Dalits leaving the village and settling down in nearby hillock.
Dalits were not allowed to enter the temple despite a ruling by a district court in favour of them. Consequently, Dalits left their village and settled down in the foot hills near to the village. Upon a Government order issued by Chief minister M. Karunanidhi, on 25 December 2008, Dalits led by the district collector G Prakash and Superintendent of Police Asra Garg entered the temple despite the protest and resentment of non-Dalits, following which it is to remain open and poojas be performed on a regular basis by all.

Henry Hogbin

Henry Cairn Hogbin (16 November 1880 – 13 June 1966) was an English businessman and Liberal later Conservative politician.
Family and education.
Henry Cairn Hogbin was the son of Thomas Parker Hogbin of Tilmanstone, Eastry in Kent. He attended Montague House School and received the rest of his education privately. He married his first wife, Winfred, in 1905 and they had two sons and four daughters. Winifred Hogbin died in 1940 and in 1955 Hogbin married Jessie McKenzie Sutherland.
Career.
In business, Hogbin had interests in the agricultural chemical industry. He worked for Lawe’s Chemical Company and was later Chairman of the Allied Guano and Chemical Company. During the First World War he held a position in the Ministry of Food. He organised agricultural production and was Chairman of the Home Counties Claims Commission.
Politics.
1922.
Hogbin first stood for Parliament at the 1922 general election in Battersea North as a National Liberal i.e. a supporter of the wing of the Liberal Party led by David Lloyd George. The seat was won by the Communist candidate, Shapurji Saklatvala, who had the support of the local the Labour Party. Hogbin came second to Saklatvala, 2,021 votes behind. The Independent Asquithian Liberal, V C Albu, lost his deposit. As a portent of worse things to come in later elections, Hogbin’s meetings were disrupted by people claiming to be supporters of Saklatvala.
1923-1924.
At the 1923 Hogbin secured the nomination of the now re-united Liberal Party but his candidacy was also endorsed by the local Conservatives in order to oppose Saklatvala, who they regarded as a revolutionary and unconstitutional candidate. At one point in the campaign Hogbin discontinued holding indoor election meetings claiming this was as a result of Labour intimidation and disruption. It was also feared he would be prevented from canvassing and he had to seek the protection of the police. In the end, Hogbin’s pact with the Conservatives was just enough to ensure his victory by the narrow margin of 186 votes in a straight fight with Saklatvala. During his time in Parliament Hogbin often voted with the Conservatives against the Labour government, perhaps aware of his reliance on Tory support and votes in North Battersea. However he held his seat for just one year. In the 1924 general election Hogbin stood this time as a Constitutionalist (i.e. a Liberal with Conservative support). Again the campaign was marred by disruption and violence. On one occasion a stone was thrown through Hogbin’s car window hitting him near the eye. Hogbin’s election day organisation was disrupted and it was surmised that some potential Constitutionalist electors were discouraged from going out to vote by the prospect of rowdyism near polling stations. When the result was declared Hogbin trailed Saklatvala by 542 votes.
Conservative.
In 1926, Hogbin took the decision to leave the Liberal Party. He wrote to party leader Lord Oxford explaining that he did not believe the Liberal Party any longer represented an effective instrument for fighting what he called ‘the pernicious doctrine’ of socialism. Hogbin’s experience of co-operation with the Conservative Party was a clear factor in his decision to leave the Liberal Party and follow other politicians, most famously Winston Churchill, who had stood under the Constitutionalist banner in 1924, into the Tory Party itself. In 1927, Hogbin was chosen as Conservative candidate in the Stourbridge by-election, 1927 in Worcestershire. The sitting Tory MP, Douglas Pielou, had died and Hogbin faced a three-cornered contest with Labour and Liberal opponents. He failed to hold the seat however which was gained by Labour’s Wilfred Wellock. Hogbin did not stand for Parliament again.
Other public appointments.
Hogbin was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in 1928. He was a keen amateur sportsman, playing cricket, tennis and golf and he founded the Magistrates’ Golfing Society in 1938.
Death.
Hogbin died in a Bournemouth nursing home on 13 June 1966 aged 85 years.

Hans Jakob (Esperantist)

Hans Jakob Notz (Heidelberg, 15 December 1891 – Geneva, 1967) was a German-born Swiss Esperantist. His real name was Franz.
A student of Commerce, he moved from Heidelberg to Geneva in 1912, so that he could follow his studies. He would live in Geneva the rest of his life.
There he started to work for the World Esperanto Association, of which he had been a member since 1909. In 1934 he resigned from the role of Director, as a form of protest, and started working elsewhere. In the end, he worked in an office of the Swiss federation until he retired.
He got married two times, and had a daughter. He was a member of the Swiss Socialist Party.
Jakob and Esperanto.
In 1920 Jakob became the director of the central office of UEA; he cared after the publication of "Jarlibroj" and after the magazine "Esperanto". He became General Director of the World Esperanto Association in 1924; he left the post in 1934, when he resigned, as a form of protest, during the World Esperanto Congress in Stockholm.
Since 1936, when the association split into two branches (headquartered respectively in Geneva and London), he began once again to serve as a redactor for the Genevan association. After the reunification of the two associations, in 1947, he joined the governing council of the reborn UEA and started caring after the magazine. In 1955 he resigned from all the posts as a form of protest, but he was nevertheless awarded the title "honorary redactor".
In 1960 the governing council of UEA learnt that Jakob had been unduly taking some money from the association; a years-long judicial procedure followed suit. When Jakob died, in 1967, UEA inherited part of his money.

The 2008 Yevpatoria gas explosion took place on December 24, 2008 with an explosion in an apartment block in Yevpatoria, a Ukrainian Black Sea resort town. Within hours, the death toll stood at 22 with 10 missing. On December 26 the total number of deaths was 27 people. President Viktor Yushchenko declared December 26 to be a day of national mourning.
Government reaction.
On 27 December 2008 the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers ordered the central government agencies and the Yevpatoria administration to provide the victims of the blast and the families of those killed with new housing and all financial compensations they are entitled to by January 1, 2009. The Education and Science Ministry has been instructed to make sure that the children from the families who suffered from the incident be provided with free school instruction.
The government also ordered that tougher control measures be taken in the gas supply industry to prevent new accidents.
Gas explosions trend.
A similar gas explosion in Dnipropetrovsk on October 2007, killed 23 victims.
Gas explosions in crumbling apartment buildings are often caused by improper use or a poorly maintained infrastructure. They are common occurrences in former Soviet states, particularly in the winter, when residents use more heating.

Woolverstone

Woolverstone is a small village and civil parish in Suffolk, England located on the Shotley peninsula. It is situated about south of Ipswich, near the southern shore of the River Orwell. In 2005 it had a population of 240.
It is now home to Ipswich High School for Girls, which moved to the vacated premises of the former Woolverstone Hall School in 1992 after having been well established in Ipswich since 1878. The Woolverstone Marina and the Royal Harwich Yacht Club are also located in the vicinity.
Facilities.
The main part of the village is situated either side of the Ipswich to Shotley road (B1456). The village itself has no pubs, shops or Post Office; however it has a village hall, church and popular marina where there is a chandlery for provisions and a local bar and restaurant named Buttermans.
The area is served by primary schools at Chelmondiston, Holbrook, Tattingstone and Shotley and the nearest secondary school at Holbrook High School, which shares a site with the Peninsula Sports Centre.
There is a regular bus service (route 202) from Ipswich Old Cattle Market to Shotley Marina which passes through the village.
The parish church is dedicated to St Michael in the Church of England Diocese of St Edmundsbury & Ipswich
History.
The name Woolverstone (originally Woluestun) is supposedly derived from Wulfhere, whose “tun” or enclosure was at its beginning. There have been numerous archaeological finds in the area including flint axes and an arrowhead believed Neolithic, beaker sherds and flints from the Bronze Age, sherds and a brooch from the Romans and also a coin and brooch from the Saxons. Two separate holdings were recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086, including woodlands for 15 pigs and 10 acres belonging to the Church.
There is a very detailed account of the Parish of Woolverstone and surrounding area between 1639 to 1661 in the book entitled
The English Home Of Mr. Timothy Dalton, B.A.
Listed Buildings.
There are a number of notable buildings within Woolverstone including St Michaels’s Church (Grade II), Woolverstone House(Grade II), Berners Hall (the Village hall) (Grade II), The Widows’ Homes (Grade II), Cat House (Grade II) and Woolverstone Hall (Grade I).
The Widows’ Homes have monkeys on the roof and are said to relate to an incident where a pet monkey saved a child of the Berners family from a fire.
The Cat House (a Gothic style house) is reputed to have belonged to a man who was sympathetic to boats carrying contraband along the river. When his favoured cat died he had it stuffed and when he could see that no customs boats were patrolling the river, he put it in the window to signal that the “coast was clear.”
Woolverstone House was designed in 1901 by “arts and crafts” architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and was built for Mrs C Berners, a lay sister of the East End Sisters of Mercy. The original Gertrude Jekyll gardens have been restored and replanted and the sunken garden is also given grade II status.
Other establishments.
Woolverstone Marina is set in 22 acres of parkland on the River Orwell with the Royal Harwich Yacht Club nearby. Woolverstone Marina is one of 21 locations owned and operated by Marina Developments Limited (MDL). There are the normal marina facilities which include Buttermans Bar and restaurant and chandlery. There is also a family business based at Woolverstone Marina supplying leisure and marine products for campers, caravanners and yachtsmen.
The nearby Royal Harwich Yacht club is a Victorian yacht club formed in 1843 and has had many Royal connections; Prince Philip is the current Patron. The yacht club moved to its present site soon after the World War II after their previous premises had been demolished for the expansion of the Navy Yard at Harwich. In 1993 floating pontoons were stationed at the bottom of the club lawn which then provided the club with its own marina.
The Royal Harwich Yacht Club supports The Woolverstone Project which has Paul Heiney as Patron and provides sailing for people with disabilities at Woolverstone and the nearby Alton Water reservoir.
Spring Lodge Care Home was formerly the parsonage to Woolverstone Hall, which explains the building's grand yet tranquil appearance. This residential and dementia care home is located at the heart of the village and provides a home to 28 elderly people in its 20 single rooms and four companion rooms.

The 2008-09 Biathlon World Cup/Relay Women started on December 14, 2008 in Hochfilzen and will end on March 14, 2009 in Vancouver. Defending titlist is the German team.
Competition format.
The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski , each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.).

Macedonian numerals

Macedonian numerals are words that are used in the Macedonian language for expressing quantity. The Macedonian numerals have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neutral) and they can have articles. There are several types of numerals: cardinal numerals, ordinal numerals, collective numerals and multiplicative numerals.
Cardinal numerals.
The cardinal numerals in the Macedonian language are:
The numerals from 10 - 20 are formed by adding the suffix -наесет (-naeset) to the basic numeral. The suffix -naeset comes from the Old Macedonian suffix -на десет (-na deset).
The numerals 20, 30, 40 and 60 are formed by adding the suffix -есет (-eset, from the Old Macedonian -десет/ -deset). The numerals 50, 70, 80 and 90 are formed by adding the old suffix -десет (-deset). Notice that when we form the number 60, we do not pronounce or write the last two letters of the basic number, шест (šest) > шеесет (šeeset). The same rule goes for the number 50, in other words, we do not pronounce or write the last letter of the basic number. These two rules are used for better and easier pronunciation.
The numbers between the decimal numbers are formed on the following way: decimal number + и (and) + the basic number.
The numbers 100, 200 and 300 are formed by adding the word -сто (-sto) to the basic number. The numbers over 300 are formed by adding the suffix -стотини (-стотини) to the basic number.
The decagonal numerals are formed by adding the word -илјада (-iljada) to the basic numeral. The numbers between the decagonal numbers are formed on the same way as the numbers between the decimal numbers.
The millions and the numbers between the millions are formed on the same way as the decagonal numerals.
The further numerals are милијарда / "milijarda" (billion), трилион / "trilion" (trillion)e.t.c. and they are formed as the other Macedonian numerals.
Ordinal numerals.
The forming of the ordinal numerals depends on the gender of the numeral. To form the ordinal numerals we add -ti (m.), -ta (f.), -to (n.) to the basic numeral. Exception to this rule are the ordinal numerals first, second and third. If the basic word ends on the letter "t" and we add the suffixes for ordinal numerals, than we use both "t" letters. For the ordinal numerals "seventh" and "eighth", we reduce some of the letters of the basic number, for example: osum > osmi (eighth), sedum > sedmi (seventh).

Matt Tubbs

Matthew Stephen "Matt" Tubbs (born 15 July 1984) is an English footballer who plays for Crawley Town as a striker, on loan from Bournemouth.
Club career.
Salisbury City.
Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Tubbs played for Bournemouth as a schoolboy before joining Bolton Wanderers, where he regularly played in the reserve team. Two years later he rejoined Bournemouth on non-contract terms in 2003, before dropping into non-League football with Dorchester Town. He signed for Salisbury City in October 2003, making his debut against Fleet Town. He helped Salisbury rise through the leagues, becoming a regular goalscorer within the side. In the 2005–06 season he helped Salisbury pick up promotion and as a reward was picked out in the Southern Premier League's Team of the Year.
The following season, he was again a major part of City's success in the Conference South, scoring many important goals for the side. He scored an equaliser against Nottingham Forest in the second round of the FA Cup to take the tie to a replay, in front of the BBC cameras. He got sent off for the fourth time of the season against his former club, Dorchester Town. This resulted in a six game ban for the striker. In the Conference South Play-Off Final, he scored the winner in the 81st minute to send his side to the Conference Premier. This was the 30th goal of the season for the striker, and he was rewarded with an England National Game XI call up that summer.
He scored on his international debut, before picking up an injury which left him out of the remainder of the Four Nations Tournament. During the same summer, he was linked with a £100,000 move to Leicester City. However, he committed his long-term future to Salisbury by signing a full-time contract with the club.
In the season to follow, he scored his 100th goal for the club in a 3–3 draw against Histon, with a last minute equaliser, and finished as the club's leading goalscorer.
On 20 November 2008, Tubbs returned to former side Bournemouth on loan until the new year, in a move to reduce playing costs at Salisbury. During his time back at Dean Court, Tubbs made just eight league appearances and scored on one occasion. He was expected to sign for Bournemouth when the transfer window opened on 1 January 2009 but the move never materialised. After his return from loan, he struggled for form, scoring only three goals in the 2008–09 season.
He remained with the club, despite much speculation surrounding his future. In the 2009–10 season, he scored many goals to help the club climb out of the relegation zone after a points deduction for going into administration. 2010 saw the club demoted two leagues for 'breaking rules'. On 10 February 2010 it was announced that Tubbs had committed to a further two years to the Whites.
Crawley Town.
On 1 July 2010, Tubbs signed a two-year deal with Conference Premier club Crawley Town for a club record fee, officially undisclosed but later confirmed to be £55,000. In Crawley's FA Cup tie against Swindon Town on 27 November 2010, Tubbs scored Crawley's equaliser in the 1–1 draw. In January 2011, Tubbs scored the only goal in Crawley's 1–0 win over Torquay United in the fourth round of the FA Cup, which meant Crawley would face Manchester United in the fifth round. Tubbs played in the 1–0 loss to Manchester United in the fifth round tie on 19 February 2011. He was named in the Conference Team of the Year for the 2010–11 season after Crawley won the title and so promotion to League Two. His first season at the club saw him score 40 goals in 48 appearances.
During his second season with the club in League Two, Tubbs' goalscoring exploits for Crawley led to clubs becoming interest in signing him, and he became the top scorer at League Two until his move.
Bournemouth.
On 30 January 2012, Tubbs signed for League One club Bournemouth for a fee believed to be in the region of £800,000 on a three-and-a-half year contract and will wear the number 25 shirt. He then scored on his debut for his new club against Exeter City in a 2–0 win and set-up Scott Malone for a second goal in the match. After scoring his first goal on his debut, Tubbs expressed his relief and delight on scoring on his debut and told BBC Radio Solent "On your debut you want to try and get your first goal as quickly as you can and I was lucky enough to get mine tonight (Tuesday),It was great to be back. This is my home-town club and the one I supported as a kid. The standing ovation at the end was nice." His move to Bournemouth from Crawley left manager Steve Evans "shedding a tear" when he tried right up until the final minutes to try and persuade Tubbs to stay. Tubbs even admitted it was a tough decision to leave Crawley. Since then, Tubbs struggled for form at Bouremouth during his first half season before undergoing a groin operation in April 2012 which led to him missing the rest of the season.
Rotherham United.
On 27 July 2013, Rotherham United signed Tubbs on loan from Bournemouth until the end of January. On the opening game of the season, Tubbs made his debut in a 3–3 draw against Crewe, coming on as a substitute. Tubbs scored his first goal, in a 2–2 draw against Colchester United on 2 November 2013. However, Tubbs was unable to produced his goalscoring form, just only scored once. On 6 January 2014, Rotherham United announced that Tubbs has returned to his Parent club following his loan spell came to an end.
Return to Crawley Town.
On 6 January 2014, Matt Tubbs made a one-month loan return to Crawley Town. On 16 January 2014, Crawley Town announced that Matt will extend his loan deal until the end of the 2013–14 season. On 25th January he scored in a 2-2 draw against his former loan-club Rotherham United and then netted in the next three fixtures, as the club extended their unbeaten run to six matches.
International career.
Tubbs has earned two caps for England C in which he scored one goal in each game.

Miguelito Valdés

Miguelito Valdés, (born Miguel Ángel Eugenio Lázaro Zacarias Izquierdo Valdés Hernández or Eugenio Lazaro Miguel Izquierdo Valdes y Hernandez; September 6, 1912 – 9 November 9, 1978), also called "Mr. Babalú", was a Cuban popular singer of high quality. His performances were characterized by a strong voice and a particular sense of "cubanismo".
Life.
In origin, he was a mestizo of a Spanish father and a Mexican Yucatec mother. He was born in the largely black barrio of "Belén" in La Habana Vieja, and moved to another barrio, "Cayo Hueso" (in Centro Habana), when his father died. In his youth he worked as an auto mechanic and was a good amateur boxer. In 1934 he won the Amateur Championship of Cuba at his weight. One of his closest friends from his days in the barrio was Chano Pozo, and in his singing style he has been called "as black a white guy as you would meet in Havana".
Career.
He got his start in the night clubs of Havana, and first attracted renown as vocalist at the "Havana-Riverside Casino".
Miguelito began his musical career in the "Sexteto Habanero Infantil", where he played, variously, the guitar, tres, double bass, timbal and sometimes sang. Soon, his capability as a singer was realized, and from that moment he was constantly in demand. After a brief spell with María Teresa Vera's "Sexteto Occidente", he was one of the founding members of the "Septeto Jóvenes del Cayo" in 1929. In 1933 he moved to the charanga of "Ismael Díaz", and then to the "Charanga Gris", directed by the pianist and composer "Armando Valdés Torres", and to the "Orquesta Habana", directed by "Estanislao Serviá".
In 1934, he made his first journey abroad, to Panama, and on his return joined the "Orquesta Hermanos Castro", which was a leading band of the day. He was their lead singer until 1936. In 1937, he joined a group of top musicians who formed the Orquesta Casino de la Playa. He was now perhaps the top singer in Cuba, on the verge of international fame. In 1939, La Playa toured South America and Central America, and started a series of recordings for RCA-Victor which would make them famous throughout the world.
In 1940, Valdés briefly joined the Orquesta Riverside (another of the big Cuban bands) before emigrating to New York City, which became his home base for the rest of his career. In New York he worked for "Orquesta Siboney" de "Alberto Iznaga", Xavier Cugat, Noro Morales, Tito Rodríguez and Machito. He directed his own orchestra for a few years, and made some successful recordings with it in 1949/50. He appeared with Brazilian singer "Delora Bueno" (1925-1912) in her DuMont Television Network program "Flight to Rhythm" (March to September 1949).
He appeared in a number of films, and was known as "Mr. Babalú" after his performance of "Margarita Lecuona"'s "Babalú". Miguelito recorded this number with three top orchestras: Casino de la Playa in Havana, and Xavier Cugat and Machito in New York. He recorded with the renowned band Conjunto Sonora Matancera in 1951 and 1977. Miguelito was regarded as one of the greatest soneros and guaracheros in Cuban music. Although non-African, his interpretation of Afro-Cuban lyrics was remarkable. He died from a heart attack during a performance in Bogotá, Colombia. 
In 1960, he organized a revue "Mr. Babalu", which performed in Reno, Nevada and Lake Tahoe, California. Billed were singers "Loraine Barry", "Marguerita Monteil" and "Josie Powell". (Please see "Tito Puente: When the Drums are Dreaming".) By Josephine Powell, Author House, 2007
Numbers he composed include "Mondongo", "Rumba rumbero", "Loco de amor", "Los tambores", "Oh, mi tambó", "Bongó", "Dolor cobarde". Films he appeared in include "Mi reino por un torero"; "Suspense", "Panamericana", "Imprudencia", "Acapulqueña" (with María Antonieta Pons), "Copacabana", "Mientras el cuerpo aguante", "Canción para recordar" and "Nacido para amarte". Also listed is "Bailando nace el amor" (with Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth) in 1942, which may be the Spanish-language version of "You Were Never Lovelier".

<doc id="20839230" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20839230" title="The Galactus Trilogy">
The Galactus Trilogy

"The Galactus Trilogy" is a 1966 three-issue comic book story arc that appeared in "Fantastic Four" #48-#50. It was written by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Jack Kirby, and illustrated by Kirby. It was published by Marvel Comics, and is notable for being the story that introduced the characters Galactus and the Silver Surfer.
Publication history.
In 1966, nearly five years after having launched Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title, "Fantastic Four", creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of supervillains of the time, and be instead a being of god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993, 
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee dubbed the Silver Surfer:
Kirby further explained, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way." 
Writer Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation, stating, "In five short years from the launch of the "Fantastic Four", the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."
All this led to the introduction of Galactus in "Fantastic Four" #48-50 (March-May 1966), which fans began calling "The Galactus Trilogy". It culminated in "Fantastic Four" #50 (May 1966), which featured the Silver Surfer interceding on behalf of humankind against Galactus.
Plot summary.
"The Coming of Galactus!".
After wrapping up the Inhumans story of the previous issue, the story moves to the Silver Surfer as he soars through the Andromeda Galaxy, earning the attention of the Skrulls. They know that wherever the Silver Surfer appears, his master, Galactus, cannot be far behind. Terrified, the Skrulls do everything they can to conceal their world from the Surfer's perceptions.
Back on Earth, the Fantastic Four witness the entire skyline appearing be engulfed in flame. At the Baxter Building, Reed sequesters himself inside his laboratory to analyze the situation. The flames in the sky dissipate, giving way to an unending field of space debris.
The powerful being known as the Watcher appears inside Reed's laboratory. He explains that he is responsible for the atmospheric disturbances, for he has been attempting to conceal Earth's existence from the attention of the Silver Surfer. He further explains that the Surfer is the advance scout of Galactus, a powerful cosmic being that consumes the elemental energies of entire worlds, leaving them as little more than dried, lifeless husks.
The Surfer investigates the Watcher's debris field and finds Earth hidden beneath it. He flies to the roof of the Baxter Building and sends out a cosmic signal for Galactus. The Fantastic Four race to the top of the building, and the Thing rams into the Surfer knocking him off the building. In the sky above, Galactus' planet devouring world ship emerges over Manhattan. The giant Galactus exits the ship and declares his intention to consume the entire world.
"If This Be Doomsday!".
The Watcher tries to appeal to Galactus to leave Earth alone. When diplomacy proves not to work, the Human Torch and the Thing try to attack Galactus to no effect. The Watcher tells them to return to their base and he will contact them shortly.
Galactus continues to assemble his planet devouring device and the Watcher explains that there is a device upon Galactus' home planet that could stop him. The Watcher sends the Human Torch to get it. Meanwhile, the unconscious Silver Surfer wakes up in the apartment of Alicia Masters. She learns of the Surfer's mission and appeals to him to turn against his master and help save the Earth.
When the Fantastic Four begin attacking Galactus' almost completed device, the planet-eater sends his cyborg Punisher to keep them out of his way while he repairs it. Making use of this distraction and delay, the Watcher boosts Johnny's powers so that he may travel to Galactus' planet and retrieve the weapon they need to defeat the world-devourer. Alicia convinces the Surfer to help save the Earth.
"The Startling Saga of the Silver Surfer!".
The Silver Surfer arrives to attack his former master, giving Johnny the time he needs to return from Galactus' planet with the Ultimate Nullifier. When Reed threatens to use it against Galactus, the planet-eater agrees to spare the Earth and leave if Reed gives him back the weapon. True to his word, Galactus leaves but not before making it so the Surfer can never leave the Earth, by removing his "space-time powers". After the battle, Alicia thanks the Silver Surfer for his help, causing the jealous Thing to think that she's choosing the Surfer over him. He quietly walks away feeling nothing but rejection.

Music video.
The music video starts off with scenes of the promotional cover for the song. Then it shows a split screen of Shiloh in the left and a girl in the right wearing a yellow dress with a dog in her handbag, talking on her cell phone. They're both walking down a street, Shiloh has two other dancers behind her. The other girl has many unfortunate things happen to her—her cell phone's stolen; she spills her drink all over herself; her dog escapes from her handbag; she gets her sunglasses caught in her hair; and she gets dirty water thrown on her. The split screens switch simultaneously throughout the video; sometimes Shiloh will be on the right and the other girl is on the left. In the final minute of the video Shiloh has more people walking down the street behind her, dancing along to the music. It ends with Shiloh showing her knuckles to the camera with letters spelling "Operator" written on them.

Ray Deakin

Raymond John "Ray" Deakin (19 June 1959 – 24 December 2008) was an English footballer, whose playing position was left-back. He had a 14-year career in the Football League with Everton, Port Vale, Bolton Wanderers, and Burnley. He captained Burnley at Wembley in the 1988 Football League Trophy Final.
Playing career.
Born in Liverpool, Deakin began his career at Everton, where he signed his first professional contract under Gordon Lee in 1977. However, he never made any appearances for the "Toffees" first team, and was released from Goodison Park in 1981. He then joined John McGrath's Port Vale, where he spent one season. He was initially a regular in the "Valiants" team, but lost his place in October 1981 and struggled to break back into first-team contention thereafter. He claimed seven goals (including five penalties) in 27 Fourth Division and FA Cup appearances, having scored his first goal in the Football League on 5 September 1981, in a 1–1 draw with Darlington at Feethams.
Deakin left Vale Park and joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer in May 1982. John McGovern's "Trotters" were relegated out of the Second Division in last place in 1982–83, though only three more points would have seen Bolton escape the drop at the expense of Grimsby Town. Wanderers finished tenth in the Third Division in 1983–84, before dropping to 17th place in 1984–85. He scored two goals in 105 league games during his three season stay at Burnden Park.
Deakin signed for Martin Buchan's Burnley in 1985. He scored three goals in 52 games in 1985–86 and again played all 52 games in the 1986–87 campaign, as he remained in the starting eleven as the "Clarets" switched manager from Buchan to Tommy Cavanagh and then to Brian Miller. An ever-present during his first two seasons at the club, he was eventually given the captain's armband. In May 1987, he captained Burnley at the lowest point of their history, when the club almost dropped out of the Football League, and only survived on the last day of the season with a 2–1 victory over Orient at Turf Moor. He played 48 games in the 1987–88 season, and captained the club at Wembley in the 2–0 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final of the Football League Trophy. However he featured just 16 times in the 1988–89 season, as he began to become afflicted by injury; during his downtime he began training to be a coach driver. He forced his way back into new manager Frank Casper's first team with 35 appearances in the 1989–90 campaign. He played 50 games as Burnley reached the play-offs in the 1990–91 season, where they were beaten by Torquay United at the semi-final stage. He then announced his retirement from professional football.
Death.
In 2008, Deakin was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and died on Christmas Eve that year, at the age of 49.

Hendrik Wagenvoort

Hendrik Wagenvoort (August 23, 1886 – January 15, 1976) was a Dutch classical scholar. He was professor of Latin at the University of Groningen and Utrecht University and published extensively on subjects relating to the Latin language and Roman religion.
Biography.
Wagenvoort was born in Minnertsga on August 23, 1886. He began studying classics at Utrecht University in 1904 and took his doctoral degree in 1911. His dissertation was called "De Horatii quae dicuntur Odis Romanis" and dealt with Horace's so called Roman Odes. After a year of further studies in Göttingen and Rome he began teaching Latin at gymnasiums, from 1912 to 1919 in Arnhem and from 1919 to 1924 in The Hague. In 1924 he became professor of Latin language and literature at the University of Groningen and during the following years he directed his efforts at examining Religion in the late Roman Republic and the early Imperial Rome. He moved to Utrecht in 1930 to succeed Pieter Helbert Damsté (who directed Wagenvoort's doctoral dissertation) as professor of Latin. His inaugural lecture was called "Pax Augusta", in line with his earlier research, but gradually his interest shifted to the religion of the earliest Rome and "primitive survivals" in later Roman religious life. In 1956, at age 70, Wagenvoort officially retired but he continued to work at the University and in other contexts.
Wagenvoort was a deacon in the Reformed Church and a member of the Commission of the Unemployed during the economic crisis of the 1930s. He also served as the president of a number of institutions including the Provincial Society of Utrecht (Provinciaal Utrechts Genootschap) and the Extra-mural University of Utrecht (Utrechtse Volksuniversiteit). Additionally, he served as judge of Hoeufftianum, an annual competition in Latin poetry.
Works and influence.
Wagenvoort was influential both as a writer and as a teacher. He published a great number of articles but also directed 38 doctoral dissertations (2 in Groningen and 36 in Utrecht), an unusually high amount in the field of classical studies.

White Coomb

White Coomb is a hill in the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Its summit is the highest point of a network of ridges that lie north-east of the town of Moffat in the Moffat Hills. The ridges are broad, but are defended by steep valleys. The summit marks the highest point in the registration county of Dumfries.
White Coomb is most easily climbed from the National Trust for Scotland car park underneath the Grey Mare's Tail waterfall, on the A708 from Moffat to Selkirk, at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry (546 m). From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.
An alternative ascent, described by the "Daily Telegraph" as one of "Britain's finest half-day and day walks", follows the Tail Burn to the outlet of Loch Skeen before ascending the ridge to Mid Craig, and passing Donald's Cleuch Head to reach the summit. The descent suggested is via Rough Craig and south to join the road and walk back to the start point. 
Subsidiary summits.
The Database of British and Irish hills lists 18 subsidiary summits of White Coomb.

Haas is a family of rocket space launchers developed by ARCA for the Google Lunar X Prize competition and for their national manned space program. It consists of Haas balloon-launched orbital rocket, Haas 2 airplane-launched orbital rocket, Haas 2b ground-launched suborbital rocket and Super Haas ground-launched orbital rocket.
It was named after Conrad Haas, a medieval rocket pioneer who lived and worked in what is now Romania, and was the first person to describe a multistage rocket in writing.
Haas.
Haas was a Romanian carrier rocket, which was developed by ARCA as part of the ELE programme. It was designed to be air-launched from a high-altitude balloon, similar to the American Rockoon experiments of the 1950s. Prior to the development of Haas, ARCA had already launched two Stabilo rockets from balloons. It is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and bitumen.
The Haas rocket is a three-stage rocket capable of placing 400 kilograms of payload into low Earth orbit. Its maiden flight will carry the European Lunar Explorer spacecraft, ARCA's entry into the Google Lunar X-Prize, following a series of engine tests which began in 2009.
It was abandoned when ARCA decided to stop using solar and helium balloons for their space program.
Haas 2.
Haas 2 is an orbital two-stage launcher intended to be carried under the fuselage of the IAR 111 supersonic plane. It is powered by the new Executor liquid-fueled rocket engine under development at ARCA. Its intended launch altitude is approximately 17,000 m. It is able to place a 400 kg payload into low Earth orbit.
Haas 2c.
Haas 2c is a flight testing platform for the Executor engine. Is an intented single stage to orbit vehicle due to is lightweight fuel tanks and, , had been planned for an early 2013 launch. ARCA announced that after the successful flight test of Executor engine, that they would construct a multi-stage rocket based on Haas 2c in order to win the Google Lunar X Prize competition. Engine tests are scheduled to begin in June 2012

Council area

A council area is one of the areas defined in Schedule 1 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and is under the control of one of the local authorities in Scotland created by that Act.
Legislation.
Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.
In Scotland, local government counties were created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The 1889 legislation created county councils, turned each civil county (with one exception) into a contiguous area (without separate fragments) and adjusted boundaries where civil parishes straddled county boundaries, or had fragments in more than one county. The counties of Ross and Cromarty were merged to form Ross and Cromarty. 
Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, local government counties, cities and their subordinate councils (including burghs and parishes) were abolished and replaced by an upper tier of "regions" each of which contained a number of "districts" except for the Western Isles, Shetland Islands and Orkney Islands where each had a single-tier authority created which exercised all the powers elsewhere split across two levels of local government. Two of the three islands authorities - Orkney and Shetland - changed their legal nature but continued with boundaries identical to the earlier counties; the Western Isles area was previously split between Invernessshire and Ross and Cromarty.
Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994.
The regions and districts were themselves abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, in favour of a single tier of "councils". Although Scottish Councils are now unitary in nature none is officially termed a "unitary authority", as in the United Kingdom that phrase is specific to English local government legislation.
One region and various of the districts created in 1975 had areas similar to those of earlier counties. Various council areas created in 1996 continued to do so with some new areas also resembling pre-1975 areas or simple divisions of them (e.g. South Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire). Apart from their legal nature, the three islands authorities continued with their previous boundaries and most of their powers unaltered.
Similar areas.
Other areas which often (but not always) resemble council areas also exist for purposes of national government functions:-

An unusual design without a conventional landing gear, it used a wheeled trolley for take-off and three retractable skids to land. The Baroudeur did not enter production.
Design and development.
The Baroudeur was a lightweight fighter, designed to operate from grass airfields. It used a wheeled trolley that could be used for take off from grass, and three retractable skids, the third at the tail for landing and for take off from snow or ice-covered surfaces. The three-wheeled trolley had provision to use rockets (two or four according to terrain plus two back-up) if needed to assist. Apart from the landing gear the aircraft was a conventional shoulder-wing monoplane with a 38 degree swept wing and tail surfaces and powered by a SNECMA Atar 101C turbojet with wing-root intakes. The first of two prototypes flew on the 1 August 1953. Three pre-production aircraft designated the S.E.5003 were also built with Atar 101D turbojet engines but the type was not ordered into production.

<doc id="20839515" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20839515" title="Kholm, Afghanistan">
Kholm, Afghanistan

Kholm or Khulm is a town, until recently, in Samangan province, and now in Balkh province of northern Afghanistan 60 km east of Mazar-i-Sharif one-third of the way to Konduz. Kholm is an ancient town located on the fertile, inland delta fan of the Khulm River (Darya-i Khulm). As such, it is an agriculturally rich locale and densely populated. It is famous for its covered market, and is a centre for trading in sheep and wool.
The town is slightly to the south of the ruins of the ancient town of Aornos, destroyed in the mid-16th century.
Ethnography.
The town and district boast a Dari Persian speaking Tajik majority.Pashtuns, Uzbeks and Arabs form the smaller minorities in the town and district. Many identify themselves as ethnic Arabs although no one actually speaks Arabic. There are other such Persian-speaking "Arabs" to the west, between Mazar-i Sharif and Sheberghan.
Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity and may in fact point to the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales of many Arab tribes from Arabia in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.
The Pashtuns form a minority and live in approximately seven villages. Most Pashtuns living in Kholm, were brought in as settlers by the ultra-nationalist Minister of the Interior Mohammad Gul Khan or (Mahmud Golkhan), during the strong Pashtunization policies of the Zahir Shah government in the 1950s and 60s.
History and Background.
For many centuries Afghanistan was located on the old serais (along the Silk Road) between Europe and China and India. Many important cultural centres developed along the way.During and after the 15th Century Europe developed new sea routes to the east. The trade over land decreased and the cultural centres along the Silk Road became more isolated.
Tashqurghan was founded early in the 19th century and grew to become the most important town in northern Afghanistan. A large variety of industrial products and commodities were transported by camel caravans: weapons, knives, metal thread, needles, glass, mirrors, porcelain, paper, tea, cotton and silk cloth. Most of these products were produced in the European part of Russia, some originated from Russian Turkestan. From India all kinds of locally manufactured and British industrial products went the other way: binoculars, razorblades, indigo, spices, ivory, coconuts and brocades. Afghanistan contributed to this trade with wool, raw silk, fruits, vegetable dyes and horses.
In the 2nd quarter of the 19th century it first belonged to the rather large independent Kunduz state. Then in 1841 the capital of the Kunduz state shifted to Tashqurghan. However, in 1845 most of the state seceded under the leadeship of Kunduz. So, Tashqurghan remained the capital of a small independent state.
During the first decades of the twentieth century Tashqurghan gradually lost its position as the emporium of northern Afghanistan. Mazar-e Sharif and Kunduz, better positioned for crossing the Amu Darya river, took over and the caravan traffic stopped. Although Tashqurghan had lost its importance as a centre for international trade, local craftsmen and refugees from Soviet Central Asia, (most of them being craftsmen as well) reinforced the position of Tashqurghan as a centre for the production of all kinds of objects for daily use throughout the country. In the 1960s the asphalted road between Kabul and Mazar-e Sharif was completed. The 350 kilometres between the two cities could now be covered in 8–9 hours (instead of the previous two weeks travel). The number of foreign and domestic tourists visiting Tashqurghan increased considerably. Apart from larger numbers of individual visitors, organized tours started arriving. A large number of antiques shops were opened for the visitors.
During the 1970s Tashqurghan was declared a 'town of art-historical significance' by UNESCO, while the Tim, the centre of the ancient bazaar, was declared a national monument by the Afghan government. After the Soviet invasion the bazaar has been attacked on several occasions but in 1986 it was completely destroyed in reprisal attacks by the Soviet Army. 
Bagh-e-Jahan nama palace.
Located on the southern outskirts of Kholm close to the highway connecting Kabul with Mazar-e-Sharif., it was originally built in the 1890–1892 by Amir Abdur Rahman, the Bagh-e-Jahan nama (BJN) Palace has been restored and renovated in 1974–1976 by president Daoud Khan. The plan was to turn the palace into a museum. An earthquake in 1976, resulting in serious damages, prevented this idea from being implemented. In the following periods of conflict and civil war, a lot of damage and neglect was done to both the palace and the palace garden. In 2007 the original plans for a museum could be picked up and the Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace community heritage programme started. Heritage activities a Culture and Development Policy Programme of the Netherlands choose to renovate and restore the place complex. The project provides direct economical input for local craftsman. All the material needed for the construction work comes from the region surrounding Kholm, the communities are involved in every step of the development of the palace.
Garden.
The garden needs to be cleaned from old war elements, on several spots in the garden Russian concrete had to be removed. The Russians used the concrete to place their tanks so they would have a stable underground for the recoil when they fired.Together with the local community, AFIR Architects has made a landscape design for the palace garden of BJN. Some elderly of the community could remember how the garden looked like in the days before the wars broke out (before 1979). This is very useful for a historical reference for the reconstruction of the garden. The garden is divided in eight terraces and the total difference in height is nine meters. The main theme of the garden will be 'bio-diversity-jungle': a rich mixture of all kind of trees, climbers, shrubs, plants and flowers, which each will contribute to an improved eco-system. Together with the Ministry of Information and Culture plans are made to let the fruits, nuts and vegetables flourish in the it was done by the great sumit kumar das
garden. There is also an idea to start a project with honeybees, because the diversity in flowers in the garden can be a good environment for honeybees and BJN will then be capable of making their own honey and candles. For many people passing, a stop at the Bagh-e Jahan Nama Palace complex would be attractive. Moreover, rearranging the palace garden would turn the park into an economic asset (fruit trees) as well as a highly attractive picnic ground for the local population and travellers.
Future tourist attraction.
With the potential to become a tourist attraction, the option of revitalizing the plan for establishing a museum in the Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace was reconsidered. The government of Afghanistan had already established plans to create regional museums and the previous aim to make a museum at the palace fitted into this regional approach. One of the main factors in favour of a future use of the building as a regional museum for the Afghans is that the location is close to where the highway from Kabul to Mazar-e Sharif enters the northern plains; a location that cannot be overlooked by anybody travelling in either direction. For many people passing, a stop at the impressive Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace complex will be attractive. Following the new facilities, training programmes by museum experts on collection management addressing the issues of conservation, registration and documentation, museum education, presentation and administration will be organised. ethnographic museum.
The Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace is turning once again into a beautiful palace and this time a palace that can function as a museum to show all the visitors the ethnographic heritage of the region. The local ownership and commitment that is purchased in this programme is the firm basis for a sustainable future of this first ethnographic museum in Afghanistan.

A&amp;P Futurestore

Futurestore was an American supermarket chain owned and operated by A&P. Futurestore was one of two concepts A&P launched during the 1980s (the other being Sav-A-Center; also defunct). Futurestore's first supermarket was in the New Orleans area in 1984, where A&P converted two Kroger stores it had acquired. The first conversion of an A&P to the Futurestore format was in New Jersey in 1985. 
The Futurestore concept spread to A&Ps in the southeastern US, plus its traditional Mid-Atlantic region (operating in the Philadelphia area under the Super Fresh name), but, in the late 1980s, all Futurestores had been re-branded, or closed.
Distinguishing characteristics.
Like its sibling supermarket, Sav-A-Center, A&P Futurestore was identified by its features and color scheme. The Futurestore interior was black and white, compared to the green and white of Sav-A-Center stores. Most Futurestores also had a glass atrium storefront. In addition, Futurestore signage featured pictograms, similar to those of European supermarkets.
Futurestores typically offered the latest in gourmet departments and electronic services in exclusive neighborhoods. Futurestore's amenities were more gourmet- and specialty-oriented than found at a traditional A&P or Sav-A-Center supermarket. Futurestores also had more modern fixtures and machinery than A&Ps had at the time.
Since the concept was a failure, A&P phased out the Futurestore nameplate, closing some stores and converting others to A&P or Sav-A-Center. Many customers felt Futurestore did not have the same panache of other upscale food retailers, which not only offered more gourmet products, but also cooked and delivered it. A&P, however, did not immediately change the interior of the Futurestores, unlike its Sav-A-Centers, after A&P began to rebrand them as A&P Food Markets in the 1990s. For example, the first New Jersey Futurestore left its atrium and interior unchanged after its conversion to an A&P Fresh Market, but discarded the remaining Futurestore attributes, including the glass atrium front.

Timeline of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season

The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was the most active season since the 1994 season, producing 24 tropical depressions, 19 of which became tropical storms or hurricanes. The season officially started on May 15, 1997 in the Eastern Pacific—designated as the area east of 140°W—and on June 1, 1997 in the Central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W. The season officially ended in both basins on November 30, 1997. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included.
The first storm formed on June 1 and the final storm crossed into the western Pacific on December 6, thus ending the season. There were 24 cyclones in both the eastern and central Pacific, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific; 8 peaked at tropical storm intensity, while 10 reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the Western Pacific.
Activity in the Central Pacific was above average; two tropical storms formed in addition to several tropical depressions. Some of the storms entered the region from the east. The 1997 season was the fourth-most active in the Central Pacific since satellite observations began. Nine tropical cyclones entered or formed in the region during that period.

Century leap year

In the Gregorian calendar, an end-of-century leap year (often referred to as a century leap year) is a year that is exactly divisible by 400 and, as with every other leap year, qualifies for the intercalation of February 29. End-of-century years that are exactly divisible by 4 but not by 400 are common years. The years 1600, 2000 and 2400, for example, are end-of-century leap years. The end-of-century years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are non-leap years. End-of-century leap years always start on a Saturday, and thus the resulting upcoming February 29 is always on a Tuesday.
The end-of-century year "divisible by 400" rule of the Gregorian calendar was considered an improvement over the previously utilized Julian calendar which had provided for a leap year at four year intervals. Over time, the Julian practice resulted in too many leap days being added to the calendar, thus causing it to gradually drift with respect to the astronomical seasons of the years (and natural events, such as the spring equinox, to occur earlier and earlier in the calendar).

Dethick Manor

Dethick Manor is a 16th-century manor house, situated at Dethick, Amber Valley, Derbyshire, much altered in the 18th century and converted to use as a farmhouse. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The manor of Dethick was anciently owned by the eponymous family. On the death in 1403 of Robert Dethick, the heir to the family's property at Dethick (though not the last Dethick male - the family owned land in Breadsall and Newhall in Derbyshire), the property passed to Thomas Babington who had married Isabel, the elder of Robert's two daughters. Babington was the son of Sir John Babington and nephew of Sir William Babington, Chief Justice in 1423.
The son of Isabel and Thomas, Sir John Babington of Dethick (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1479) died in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. His son Thomas and his grandson Anthony both served as High Sheriff.
The manor house, dating from the 15th century, was rebuilt by the Babingtons in the 16th century. Sir Anthony Babington, born at the manor house in 1561, was attained and executed for High Treason for his part in the Babington Plot. As a result of his earlier transfer of ownership to his younger brother the sequestration of the estate was avoided.
In the 17th century the Babingtons sold the property. Later owners included Blackwell and Hallowes. The house was eventually used as a farmhouse and was substantially altered and extended for that purpose in the 18th century. Substantial elements of the 15th-century manor house remain incorporated into the present structure.
The manor farm was supplemented by the adjoining church farm, which an 1891 source describes as follows: "The church of St. John the Baptist is a small edifice of stone, dating from 1220, and consists of chancel, nave and a lofty western tower, dated 1535, containing one small bell: there are three memorial windows, and 60 sittings. ... The soil is sandy; subsoil, gritstone. The chief crops are wheat, barley, oats and about one-half the land is in pasture. The acreage is 1,826; rateable value, £4,748; the population in 1881 was 1,036." In 1530-32, Anthony Babington raised the original 13th-century roof by means of clerestory windows and added the unusual tower, distinctive of Dethick.
In 2008, the present day, Dethick Manor Farm is owned by the television presenter Simon Groom. He and his wife run the farm.

Brutha

Brutha is a former R&B quintet composed of brothers Grady Harrell III, Anthony Harrell, Jared Overton, Cheyenne Harrell and Jacob Harrell. The group was formed in 2002 and Brian Mcknight first introduced them on the 2003 "Soul Train" Holiday Special. The brothers were subsequently signed to Def Jam Records, and their self-titled debut album "Brutha" was released in December 2008. Their reality show, "Brothers to Brutha", documented their rise to fame. In 2011, the three eldest brothers, Grady Harrell III, Anthony Harrell and Jared Overton left the group to pursue solo careers, leaving the remaining brothers Jacob Harrell and Cheyenne Harrell to form the group Jake & Papa.
Early life.
The five brothers in the band are (eldest to youngest) Grady Harrell III, Anthony "Ant" Harrell, Jared "J.R." Overton, Cheyenne "Papa" Harrell and Jacob "Jake" Harrell. Four of the brothers' father is Grady Harrell Jr., a singer from Los Angeles who made his mark in music and encouraged his sons to follow in his footsteps, while Jared "J.R." Overton has a different father but the same mother as 2 of his brothers making him unrelated to Cheyenne Harrell and Jacob Harrell. Their father was a disciplinarian. He taught them how to sing, while the boys' uncle Donny (Drano) Harrell furthered their music careers. The boys, however, had different mothers. Papa and Jacob's mother is named Kierra. The mother of Jared, Anthony, and Grady Jr. is Nancy Lynn. Papa and Jacob were not raised by their father, as he had been convicted of fraud and was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison. The boys were raised on the music of their inspirations, which ranged from Sam Cooke to Stevie Wonder. Before hitting the "Big Time" they played graduation parties and bar mitzvahs.
Early career.
The Harrell brothers came to the entertainment world at a young age out of a four-generations musical family. At 5 and 6 years old, Anthony Harrell and Grady Harrell III hooked up with their first cousin Canela Cox and formed the group Papa’s Results, being trained and taught by Grady Harrell II, who was then signed to MCA Records prior to a prison term. The children appeared in his R&B hit single “Sticks and Stone” and Anthony provided the singing voice of "Young Michael Jackson" played by Alex Burell in the 1992 TV mini series, '. Papa's results lasted until Canela moved to Holland to follow her mother's musical career. The brothers filled her spot with family friend Jeff Lee and changed their name to Serenade. The trio quickly gained notice. They appeared on episodes of ' in 1997, where Anthony played the regular role of Eric Little. As a duet comprising the two Harrell brothers Grady and Anthony, they recorded two independent albums, in 1999 and 2001. 
Brutha.
In 2002, Grady and Anthony were joined by their brothers JR, Jake, and Papa and formed Brutha. The group was discovered by Brian Mcknight, who introduced them on the 2003 Soul Train Holiday Special. In 2008, their uncle Donny "Drano" Harrell, CEO of Goodfellas Entertainment, and the late Shakir Stewart, senior vice president of A&R at Island Def Jam, invited the group to Atlanta to do a filmed audition in front of Jermaine Dupri and a range of producers. The audition resulted in a one-hour special entitled "Jermaine Dupri presents: Brutha", broadcast on March 24, 2008, on Peachtree TV. Dupri was impressed and signed the brothers to the Island Def Jam Music Group. In 2007, Brutha made a special guest appearance on the Discovery Kids TV show "Hip Hop Harry."

Mario Benjamín Menéndez

Mario Benjamin Menéndez (born April 3, 1930) was the Argentine governor of the Falklands during the 1982 Argentine occupation of the islands. He also served in the Argentine Army. Menéndez surrendered Argentine forces to Britain during the Falklands War. 
(Not to be confused with his cousin Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, another Argentine general of the Dirty war. Both are nephews of :es:Benjamín Andrés Menéndez, an Argentine general who led a (frustrated) putsch against Peron in 1951).
Biography.
Pre-Falklands War.
Menéndez progressed from a cadet at the national military college to the top ranks of the Argentine military. As a full colonel serving in the 5th Infantry Brigade, he participated between July 1975 and January 1976in Operativo Independencia, a counter-insurgency campaign against trotskyist ERP guerrilla operating in Tucuman province. He later commanded the 6th Mountain Brigade in Neuquén province. In March 1982, Menéndez (according to historian Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins) was a general in the Argentine Army, and the commander of the Buenos Aires first corps.
According to his memoirs, Menéndez was in fact a member of the Military Committee in Buenos Aires that addressed the Argentine president on a weekly basis on a range of issues, including foreign diplomacy, military training and the military budget.
Falklands War.
On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands, which is British territory, and gained control that day. On 3 April, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that British forces had been dispatched to recapture the islands. Menéndez arrived in Stanley (the capital of the Falkland Islands) on 7 April, with the purpose of taking over the governorship of the Falklands. One book described him as a "competent soldier". Menéndez competed with the senior representatives of the Argentine navy and air force for dominance; a competition which was formally concluded on 26 April when Menéndez appointed himself head of the Malvinas Joint Command, an action which was approved by the Argentine government. Two Argentine brigadier generals commanded forces in the Falklands. They were both senior to Menéndez, and treated his orders as suggestions. Menéndez opted for a strategy of attritional warfare, fighting tactically from fixed positions against any British Armed Forces that made a landing upon the Falklands, rather than a more technically complex war of manoeuvre. The plan was later criticized, but historian Duncan Anderson contended after the war that the plan "suited admirably the capabilities of the soldiers he had at his disposal".
British troops landed onto the islands in May, and inflicted a number of defeats upon the Argentine defenders during the course of the month. When British forces won at the Battle of Goose Green on May 29, "the gloom and despondency that gripped Menéndez and his headquarters soon infected many Argentine officers". However, in a bold move, Menéndez in late May assembled all his army, national gendarmerie and airforce special forces with a "plan to plant a north-south screen to strike at the British logistics line of communication and capture British soldiers." They were ambushed by the Special Air Service and Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre patrolling Mounts Kent and Simon and had a Puma helicopter shot down. Ten Argentine commandos were killed and 23 were injured or taken prisoner in the heli-borne offensive. Brigadier Julian Thompson commented: ""It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by Northwood that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before deplaning and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters."" In the first week of June, as British forces prepared to assault a number of hills near Stanley, Menéndez was pressured to try to attack the Falklands settlement of Fitzroy, which had recently come under British control, but he decided to stay on the defensive. In the documentary Falklands: "How Close to Defeat?", Brigadier Julian Thompson, the commander of 3 Commando Brigade in the Falklands acknowledged that an Argentine counterattack at this point would have ""slowed the British advance, caused heavy casualties and I think in my opinion might well forced the international opinion to lean on the British government to say you got to come to some sort of agreement"." The 5th Marine Battalion commander, Carlos Hugo Robacio says in the documentary, ""I wanted to counterattack, we had a plan and the troops were ready to go. We were planning to do it at night, but the authorization never came. The general told me in all honesty, 'I cannot support this with the logistics that we have.' I think I should've disobeyed orders and counterattacked. We were only one step away from winning the war if we had at least tried. We should've taken that last step."" After the hills were captured by the British, Menéndez considered withdrawing his forces from Stanley, and holding the main airfield located in a peninsula east of the town.
A Buenos Aires based diplomat said after the British landings: "[Menéndez] will never surrender in the Falklands unless he's satisfied that Argentina's honor will be respected. If it's at risk, he'll fight on, maybe even after his own people tell him it's time to stop." In the final days of the fighting, Menendez visited the local hospital and in an interview aired on Argentinian television station C5N said that the sight of the wounded and the military surgeons busy at work on them, left an indelible mark on him.
On 14 June, Menéndez spoke with Lieutenant-General Leopoldo Galtieri-the President of Argentina-by radio regarding the situation. Galtieri said that Menéndez should counter-attack against the British forces with all of his soldiers, and told him that the Argentine military code stipulated that a commander should fight until he has lost 50% of his men and used 75% of his ammunition. He also added "the responsibility today is with you", which Duncan Anderson argues was the point at which Menéndez's morale finally broke. Menéndez replied, "I cannot ask more of my troops, after what they have been through...We have not been able to hold on to the heights...We have no room, we have no means, we have no support...". Anderson said that Menéndez was then psychologically isolated, and believed he had been deserted by his government, and started communicating almost gratefully with a Spanish-speaking British officer who had got in touch with him by radio. Menéndez agreed to meet with representatives of the commander of British land forces on the islands that afternoon, and Menéndez surrendered his forces in the evening. Private Milton Rhys, an Argentinian conscript of British descent who was present in the radio room, reported that soon after the conversation a mortar round landed in the back patio, knocking General Menendez into a door and spraying the room with shrapnel.
Fear of massacre of civilians prompted surrender.
According to more recent work by historian Hugh Bicheno, the end of the protracted fighting in the Tumbledown sector came about over real fear of Falklands civilians being massacred by angry Argentine troops as they hastily prepared for house-to-house combat. The Argentine ground forces commander, Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre is quoted in "Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War" as saying that as street fighting became inevitable, his Brigade Operations Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Eugenio Dalton warned him: ""Many soldiers are in a strange state and the kelpers are bound to get hurt. One 3rd Regiment Platoon has been told to go into the houses by a fanatical lieutenant, who has ordered the men to kill the kelpers. Something awful is happening"." General Jofre is quoted as saying: ""I'll never forget that moment. It was like a lightning bolt had hit me. I was no longer in control. We've had it. The lives of the kelpers are being risked. I told General Menendez and he realised that there was no question of fighting any further. Menendez told me he wanted to talk to Galtieri to arrange a ceasefire. I agreed. It was all over"."
Private Milton Rhys, who worked as a radio operator in Government House, reported: "“He was a wise man. When the British arrived, he said: 'This cannot be, it will be a civilian as well as a military massacre.’ I was there when Galtieri telephoned and said: 'You are all cowards! Jump out of your foxholes and fight!’ Menéndez said: 'My general, you do not know what we are fighting here.’ ”"
Post-Falklands War.
Within a month after the surrender, Menéndez had been removed from his positions of power. According to Menéndez's mother, Hilda Villarino de Menéndez, her son was arrested in October 1983 by the Argentine Army, and sent to a base for 60 days of disciplinary detention. She said that the arrest had "apparently something to do" with a book her son had published, which covered his experiences during the war. In 2009, Menéndez claimed that oft-quoted figure of 30,000 disappeared people during the 1976-1983 Argentine military dictatorship was "invented number" and lambasted former Army Chief, Lieutenant-General Martín Antonio Balza for supporting the 30,000 figure. Menendez also criticized Balza for not owning up to his role in the Dirty war and for portraying Argentine officers in his book "Malvinas: Gesta e Incompetencia" (Editorial Atlántida, 2003) as "idiots or pusillanimous." On 18 October 2012 he was again arrested, along with another 16 persons, indicted for his role in human rights violations during Operativo Independencia in 1975.Menendez served as second-in-command of the 5th Infantry Brigade, first under Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas and latter under Brigadier-General Antonio Domingo Bussi, who commanded the various units sent to fight the ERP guerrillas in Tucumán province with orders to also to detain their active collaborators hidden among the civilian population.
Military appraisal.
In retrospect, historians Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins criticised the fact that the Argentine Army had failed to defend key features on the Falklands, interdict the British advance, or harass or counter-attack against positions that had been captured by the Royal Marines or British paratroopers, and contended that Menéndez may have lacked confidence in the ability of Argentine conscript soldiers to do these things, as well as suggesting that Menéndez was shocked by the fact that the British were determined to recapture the islands and he never recovered from this. They do argue that Menéndez's general deployment of his forces was sound, however.
Other historians, notably Mark Adkin, Nick van der Bijl, David Aldea, Roberto Boila, Alejandro Corbacho and Hugh Bicheno have in more recent works reappraised the performance of the Argentine ground forces and claim their officers and NCOs generally fought well at Goose Green and that the Argentines in the form of their army and national gendarmerie special forces counterattacked the SAS on Mount Kent and harassed the British patrolling carried out in the period 1–10 June. The books "9 Battles to Stanley", "5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands", "Razor's Edge" and the British war veteran's website britains-smallwars.com (see "Up close & personal: The Argentine War") describe in great details the Argentine counterattacks carried out at company and platoon level on the heights surrounding the Falklands capital that at times threatened to derail the British advance.
General Galtieri considered him "the best general of the Argentine army".
Allegations of maltreatment of Argentine conscripts.
Argentine army officers and NCOs were later charged with abusing and killing their own troops at Goose Green. "Our own officers were our greatest enemies", says Ernesto Alonso, the president of CECIM, a veterans group founded by Rodolfo Carrizo and other conscripts of the 7th Regiment. "They supplied themselves with whiskey from the pubs, but they weren't prepared for war. "They disappeared when things got serious." There are others who maintain that the conscripts were helped to make themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and that their officers and NCOs fought well and tried hard to bolster morale. Under Brigadier-General Mario Menéndez's express orders, the army engineers (under Colonel Manuel Dorrego) in Port Stanley constructed field showers for the troops that allowed the frontline units before the British landings to send companies into town on a rotating basis to get a hot shower and mend their clothes. Menéndez in his memoirs says that when the troops started to go hungry through lack of bread he commandeered the local bakery that largely offset the lack of bread and that there was initially an abundance of water biscuits to supplement the diet of the troops. In an interview aired on 8 June 1992 in the "Graciela y Andrés" television talk show, Menendez explained to hosts Graciela Alfano and Andrés Percivale and former Falklands War conscripts Jorge Altieri and Edgardo Esteban, that when a red cross delegation arrived in early June 1982 to find out about the well-being of the Falkland Islanders, he took advantage of their decision to stay overnight in one of the hotels, and under the cover of darkness, emptied the hospital ship of its tinned provisions and says this was the food the conscripts found in abundance in the various shipping containers in Port Stanley after the Argentinian surrender. His colleague, Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre, after visiting the 3rd Artillery Group battery under the command of First Lieutenant Héctor Domingo Tessey in the Moody Brook area on 9 June, gave out orders that chocolate bars be handed to the troops serving in this unit. Jofre also maintains that the conscripts in the 4th Regiment survived on a daily basis on tinned meals after receiving orders to abandon the Mount Kent area in late May and defend Mount Harriet and Two Sisters Mountain instead. He also asserts that R&R areas had been made available in the Falklands capital so that the frontline troops, regardless of rank could get a chance to get some sleep, watch television and get proper meals. Private Jorge Andreeta of the 7th Regiment, in an interview with the Argentinian Clarín newspaper in April 2012, reported that rough punishment was meted out in his unit to those caught stealing provisions, but admitted that he got a chance to shower in Port Stanley and also watch a movie in the local hospital. According to a platoon commander in the final battles, Brigadier Jofre visited under heavy shellfire the 6th Regiment's 'B' Company awaiting the British advance on Tumbledown Mountain and gave his gloves to a conscript and fulfilled his promise of delivering much need ammunition to this unit.
In 2009, Argentine authorities in Comodoro Rivadavia ratified a decision made by authorities in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego (which, according to Argentina, have authority over the islands) charging 70 officers and NCOs with inhumane treatment of conscript soldiers during the war. "We have testimony from 23 people about a soldier who was shot to death by a corporal, four other former combatants who starved to death, and at least 15 cases of conscripts who were staked out on the ground", Pablo Vassel, under-secretary of human rights in the province of Corrientes, told Inter Press Service News Agency.
On 19 May a 12th Regiment conscript, Secundino Riquelme, reportedly died of starvation. The commanding officer of the 12th Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Italo Angel Piaggi however, maintains in his memoirs that private Riquelme died of a weak heart. There are claims, that false testimonies were used as evidence in accusing the Argentine officers and NCOs of abandonment of conscripts and Vassel had to step down from his post as under-secretary of human rights of Corrientes in 2010. Other veterans are sceptical about the veracity of the accusations with Colonel José Martiniano Duarte, a first lieutenant of 601 Commando Company in the Falklands War saying that it has become "fashionable" for ex-conscripts to now accuse their superiors of abandonment. Former conscript Fernando Cangiano has also dismissed the claims about the "supposed widespread sadism present among the Argentine officers and NCOs" and the claim that the conscripts had not handled themselves well in the fighting. Former conscript César Trejo also accused the current Argentine Ministry of Defense, Nilda Garré of promoting a "state of confused politics" in favour of the CECIM.
Sub-Lieutenant Gustavo Malacalza of the 12th Regiment is accused of having staked three conscripts at Goose Green, for having abandoned their positions to go looking for food and revealing their positions with gunfire. "We said it was going to be us next", said Private Mario Oscar Nuñez recalling the death of conscript Riquelme. Soon after the British landings, he and two other conscripts took the decision to kill a sheep. The three men were skinning the sheep when they were discovered by Sub-Lieutenant Malacalza, who was accompanied by fellow conscripts of A Company, 12th Regiment and given a beating. "They started kicking and stamping on us. Finally came the staking." Not all the conscripts of the Goose Green garrison experienced field punishments and some even came forward to say that Sub-Lieutenant Ernesto Orlando Peluffo of the 12th Regiment, would break and share his bread. Peluffo is reported to have taken his men out of line prior to the British landings in order to allow them to have a hot shower and a good night's sleep. Second Lieutenant Juan Domingo Baldini of the 7th Regiment has also been accused of handing out field punishment to three conscripts in his platoon for abandoning their posts to go looking for food. When preparing the interviews for his book, Vincent Bramley, a machine-gunner with 3 Para in the Falklands, reached the conclusion that the Argentine officers on Mount Longdon showed little or no concern for their men. Private Alberto Carbone said: “Lieutenant Baldini never said anything to us − we just followed him up the hills. It was like living in hell on that hill. Corporal Rios was the worst. Like most of the other corporals, he was a lazy bastard. None of our superiors showed the slightest concern for us." However, Private Fabian Pássaro has defended the platoon commander's actions saying: "But the officer that was with us, second lieutenant Baldini, he worried a lot about it. One day he said the way things were going it was impossible, that this could not be, and he sent for provisions from down below. And what is more, he allowed us to supplement the little we got with sheep. Baldini did what he could, but he could not do everything, poor guy. Baldini is reported to have served a cup of hot chocolate milk to each conscript in his platoon in late May 1982 an act of kindness that Private Carbone remembers but does not go into specifics.
Although the threat of field punishment kept the majority of the soldiers in line, in the predawn darkness of 9 June 1982, four conscripts of the 7th Regiment's 'A' Company on Wireless Ridge, Privates Carlos Alberto Hornos, Pedro Vojkovic, Alejandro Vargas y Manuel Zelarrayán abandoned their posts under the cover of darkness, and using a rubber boat they planned to confiscate the goods reported to be inside a Shepperd's house near Murrell River. Unfortunately for the four involved, their boat hit an anti-tank mine when returning from their foray killing them on the shoreline.
During a 2012 interview, Menéndez dismissed all claims of torture as "an exaggeration", claiming that the reported field punishment cases were not an illegal practice and that these abided with the Argentine military code in 1982.
In 2007, Nilda Garré had herself gone on record saying the field punishments were acceptable in the case there were no military lock ups and concluded: "It is a cruelty and it comes from inexplicable sadism, but it's true that it was within the rules".

Axon terminal

Axon terminals are distal terminations of the branches of an axon. An axon nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses (called "action potentials") away from the neuron's cell body, or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons.
Neurons are interconnected in complex arrangements, and use electrochemical signals and neurotransmitter chemicals to transmit impulses from one neuron to the next; axon terminals are separated from neighboring neurons by a small gap called a synapse, across which impulses are sent. The axon terminal, and the neuron to which it is attached, is sometimes referred to as the "presynaptic" neuron.
Nerve impulse release.
Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell. The terminals release transmitter substances into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. The information is received by the dendrite receptors of the postsynaptic cell that are connected to it. Neurons don't touch each other, but communicate across the synapse.
The neurotransmitter molecule packages (vesicles) are created within the neuron, then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit "docked". Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 µs of calcium entry. Triggered by the binding of the calcium ions, the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart, resulting in the creation of a fusion pore. The presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis, which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. These membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca2+ triggered and serves interneuronal signalling.
Mapping activity.
Dr. Wade Regehr, professor of Neurobiology developed a method to physiologically see the synaptic activity that occurs in the brain. A dye alters the fluorenscence properties when attached to calcium. Using fluorescence-microscopy techniques calcium levels are detected, and therefore the influx of calcium in the presynaptic neuron. Regehr's laboratory specializes in pre-synaptic calcium dynamics which occurs at the axon terminals. Regehr studies the implication of calcium Ca2+ as it affects synaptic strength. By studying the physiological process and mechanisms, a further understanding is made of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, as well as memory and learning.

Rebecca Bross

Rebecca Bross (born July 11, 1993 in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is an American artistic gymnast. She is a six-time world medalist.
Personal life.
Bross is the daughter of Terry Bross and Donna Bross (née Brugge). She has one older brother named Benjamin. Her parents put her in a gymnastics class at the age of five. She has since become one of America's top elite gymnasts. Bross returned to competition—after her knee surgery in late 2008—to compete at the 2009 US Classic in Des Moines, Iowa. She is coached by Valeri Liukin at WOGA Gymnastics.
Routines.
As of 2011, Bross performs the following skills on these apparatus:
Floor music.
2011: "Beethoven Virus"
2010: "Dark Eyes" 
2005-2009: "National Treasure Suite" from the National Treasure Soundtrack
Jh
Competitive history.
Rebecca Bross first qualified to Junior International Elite in 2005, where she also qualified to her first US Nationals; she placed 16th all-around and earned a spot on the national team. Rebecca then competed in a few international assignments over the next year. At the 2006 US Nationals Rebecca placed 4th all-around, which also qualified her to the Junior Pan Ams Team. In 2007 Rebecca was then selected for the Pan American Games Team. She then finished 2nd all-around behind teammate Shawn Johnson. During the 2007 US Championships, Rebecca won her first US National Championships despite a fall. She later won the Junior Japan Invitational.
Rebecca was able to compete in some Classic's and Invitationals in early 2008. She then competed at the Pacific Rim Championships with WOGA teammate Nastia Liukin, where she then won gold medals on the all-around, beam, bars and floor. She then had to sit out the rest of the year due to a broken foot.
On July 25, 2009, at the Covergirl Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, Bross competed on the Uneven Bars, scoring a 13.150 (.050 better than her teammate, Ivana Hong), but was unable to compete on floor, beam, or vault due to an ankle injury suffered during practice a few days earlier. (It should be noted that she competed her bar routine without a dismount, thus lowering her overall score.)
In August 2009, Bross finished third all-around behind Bridget Sloan (first) and Ivana Hong (second) at the U.S. National Championships. Bross also placed third on balance beam and second on floor to end a successful first senior Nationals.
The following October, at the World Championships in London, England, Bross qualified in first place into the all around final. She also qualified second on uneven bars and eighth on floor exercise. She fell on her beam dismount in preliminaries, which prevented her from qualifying on that event. In the all-around final, Bross led the competition going into the final rotation. Needing only a 12.925 to clinch the gold, she fell on her final tumbling pass on floor to just miss the score she needed (the judges awarded her a 12.875). Her American teammate Bridget Sloan claimed the gold, while Bross took the silver. Bross went on to tie Romania's Ana Porgras for the bronze medal in the uneven bars event final.
In March 2010, she won the all-around at the American Cup. Bross won every event with the exception of the vault, which was won by her teammate Aly Raisman. In April, she won the senior all-around title at the Pacific Rim Championships in Melbourne, Australia. At the 2010 VISA Championships, Bross finished day 1 with a 2-point lead. On Day 2 she finished with a 3-point lead, clinching the event to become the 2010 National Champion. She was selected for the women's team for the 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Rotterdam, Netherlands. There, she helped the USA win a silver medal behind the newly dominant Russian team. In the all-around, after a fall on beam, she bounced back on floor to get the bronze medal, scoring a 15.233 - the highest score given on floor out of any women at the entire meet. Russia's Aliya Mustafina was the winner and China's Jiang Yuyuan was the silver medalist. In event finals, Bross clinched the bronze on the uneven bars and tied with China's Deng Linlin for the silver on the balance beam behind Romania's Ana Porgras.
During night 2 of competition at the 2011 Visa Championships, Bross dislocated her right kneecap during a third rotation vault. Due to the injury, Bross sat out of competition for the remainder of the 2011 season. Despite this, she still earned a second-place finish on floor exercise, with a two-night total of 29.50. She also placed eighth on beam (27.6).
2012 Olympic Trials.
In the summer of 2012, Bross competed in the Olympic Trials in hopes of making the women's gymnastics Olympic team for London. She competed on the beam and uneven bars, where she finished in last place on both. Bross fell three times off the bars on Night 2, and was instructed by her coach to stop mid-routine. As a result of her low scores, particularly on the uneven bars—an area in which National Team Coordinator Márta Károlyi stated the USA women's team would need strong competitors —Bross did not make the main Olympic team, nor was she named as an alternate. Sports commentators have speculated that Bross' defeat at the Trials would likely be a career-ending one due to her previous injuries and age.

<doc id="20839745" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20839745" title="Climate of the Tampa Bay area">
Climate of the Tampa Bay area

The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen "Cfa"), with warm and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and drier winters with freezing temperatures occurring every 2–3 years. The area experiences a significant summer wet season, as nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September. The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as being in hardiness zone 10, which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown. Highs usually range between 65 and 95 °F (18 and 35 °C) year round. Though known for hot summers, Tampa's official high has never reached 100 °F (38 °C) – the city's all-time record temperature is 99 °F (37 °C). St. Petersburg's all-time record high is exactly 100 °F (38 °C).
Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.
Seasonal weather.
Spring.
Spring in the Tampa area is usually mild and dry, with highs in the 70s (around 25 C) and lows in the 50s (around 13 C). However, the calm is occasionally disturbed by the arrival of late-season cold fronts. The collision of a cold air mass with warm and humid local air can create a squall line which brings brief heavy rain, strong winds, and sometimes small tornadoes to the area. A dramatic example of this was the Storm of the Century in March 1993, but other smaller-scale events (such as the brief but intense squall which caused a freighter to strike and partially collapse the original Sunshine Skyway bridge in May 1980) occur almost every year.
Summer.
Temperatures are hot from around mid-May through mid-October, which coincides approximately with the rainy season. Summertime weather is very consistent, with highs in the low 90s °F (around 32 °C), lows in the mid-70s °F (around 24 °C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of afternoon thundershowers.
The typical summer weather pattern is for heat-produced thermals, powered by either the Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and occasionally both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over the interior of the Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front. 
The afternoon storms typically bring brief periods of heavy rain with frequent cloud-to-ground lightning, and are usually followed by a pleasantly clear and cooler evening. At times, they can grow severe, bringing gusty winds, small hail, and torrential rain, and an occasional tornado. While Florida does rank #1 in the USA in terms of tornadoes per square mile, the majority of the twisters are small, weak, and short-lived. Waterspouts are relatively common in Tampa Bay and off the gulf coast during strong summer thunderstorms, occasionally moving onshore as a short-lived tornado.
Though the Tampa Bay area is sometimes referred to as the "Lightning Capital of the World", it is more accurately called the “Lightning Capital of North America” if measured by average number of days with thunderstorm activity per year. During the summer, west-central Florida receives as much lightning as the world’s true lightning leaders such as the Lake Victoria region of Africa and the central Amazon River Basin. However, there are few thunderstorms in the Tampa Bay area from approximately October to May, decreasing the yearly average.
Every year, Florida averages 10 deaths and 30 injuries from lightning strikes, with several of these usually occurring in or around Tampa. University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within a half-mile of 10 to 15 lightning strikes every year. TECO Energy, the local electric utility, spends over USD $1,000,000 annually to repair transformers and other equipment damaged by lightning strikes.
Autumn.
Both the temperature and the average rainfall decline as September turns to October. Highs moderate into the 80s, and the lessening heat leads to lower evaporation-generated humidity and fewer convection-generated thundershowers, which are unusual after around mid-October. While everyday rain is less frequent, the hurricane season extends until the end of November, and the area is sometimes affected by a drenching hurricane or tropical storm during the fall.
Winter.
Winters in the Tampa Bay Area are generally dry and mild; highs during the season average near with mostly sunny skies. The occasional passage of a cold front will bring rain followed by a few days of cooler temperatures. Lows rarely drop below freezing , an occurrence which happens, on average, once every other year. While deep freezes are very infrequent, serious cold snaps are a significant concern due to the diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture industries in the area.
Frozen precipitation is very rare in the area. In the Great Blizzard of 1899, Tampa suffered its one and only known blizzard, with "bay effect" snow coming off Tampa Bay.
The last officially measurable snow in Tampa fell on January 19, 1977. While the accumulation amounted to less than , the area is quite unaccustomed to and unprepared for frozen precipitation, so various schools, businesses, and roads closed, at least until the snow melted away that afternoon. Many residents of southern Pinellas County reported a light snowfall on December 23, 1989. However, no snow fell at official weather stations, and the weather record indicates that light sleet fell on St. Petersburg that day.
The winter of 2009-2010 was one of the coldest in local history. Both Tampa and St. Petersburg set records for consecutive days in which the high temperature did not reach degrees, and Tampa experienced ten consecutive days with a low temperature below freezing. Much of the area received a "wintry mix" of rain, sleet, and possibly a few snowflakes on January 9–10.
Tampa's all-time record low temperature is and St. Petersburg's is , both occurring during the same cold snap on December 13, 1962.
Precipitation and sunshine trends.
Due to the frequent summer thunderstorms, Tampa has a pronounced wet season, receiving an average total of of rain from June and September but only about during the remaining eight months of the year combined. The historical averages during the late summer, especially September, are augmented by tropical cyclones, which can easily deposit many inches of rain in one day. Outside of the summer rainy season, most of the area's precipitation is delivered by the occasional passage of a weather front.
Tampa's precipitation data falls near the median for the area. Nearby communities to the interior tend to receive a bit more rain every year; those closer to the coast a bit less.
The area receives plentiful sunshine throughout the year, averaging a total of 2920 hours, or 66.7% of the possible total. The daily sunshine amount is highest in May, when the sun's angle of incidence has increased the hours of daylight and the rainy season has not yet begun.
Tropical systems.
June through November is hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin and Caribbean Sea, with the most tropical activity occurring between mid-August to mid-October. Rain dropped by tropical systems is an important component of the area's annual precipitation and is vital for replenishing the water supply of communities around Tampa Bay.
The area feels some effect from passing tropical systems almost every year, but direct hits are uncommon. Estimates of the probability of a hurricane making landfall in the Tampa Bay area during any given year range from 1 in 25 to 1 in 50. While the historical record has shown that the area is vulnerable to a large storm (such as the Great Gale of 1848, which destroyed most of the village of Tampa), Tampa Bay has not seen the landfall of any hurricane since 1946, and has not taken a hit from a major hurricane since 1921.
The 2004 Tropical Season.
The 2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season was historically busy for the Tampa Bay area. The region was affected by a record four hurricanes that year; Frances, Jeanne, Charley, and to a lesser extent, Ivan. Jeanne and Frances passed over Tampa as tropical storms after making their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south-southwest, which would have been the worst-case scenario for local storm surge flooding. But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to the region, devastating the Ft. Myers/Port Charlotte area instead. Ivan also threatened the area as it moved north up the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It remained far to the west of central Florida, however, and brought only a bit of rain and wind to Tampa Bay before eventually slamming into coastal Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.

Queen's Crescent Market

Queen's Crescent Market is one of London's oldest street markets, and is still held every Thursday and Saturday on Queen's Crescent in Kentish Town, Camden. The market sells food, discounted clothing and a wide variety of household products. It has capacity for more than 90 stalls.
Many traders run stalls that have been passed from generation to generation. This is in contrast to the nearby and considerably more famous Camden markets, which primarily attract tourists and those from other parts of London (Inverness Street Market was a traditional produce market in Camden Town for a century, but in 2013 the last produce stall closed, leaving only tourist stalls like the other Camden markets). Aesthetically Queen's Crescent market is a mixture, with pretty plain white houses sitting side by side with large council estates, some of which sit in beautifully landscaped grounds.

Operation Drop Kick

Between April and November of 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted Operation Drop Kick to test the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry a biological warfare agent in different ways. The Corps released uninfected female mosquitoes into a cooperative residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then estimated how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people. Within a day the mosquitoes had bitten many people. In 1958, the Corps released 600,000 mosquitoes in Avon Park, Florida.
These tests showed that mosquitoes could be spread by means of various devices.
The 1964 movie "Dr. Strangelove" also refers to an Operation Drop Kick.

James Cadenhead

James Cadenhead, RSA (12 January 1858 – 22 January 1927) was a Scottish landscape and portrait painter.
Life and work.
Cadenhead was born in Aberdeen, the only son of the procurator-fiscal, and received his early training in art in that city, showing an aptitude for black and white drawing, etching and portraiture. He was encouraged in his art endeavours by Dr. John Forbes White (art collector and photographer, and brother-in-law of surgeon and photographer, Thomas Keith) who aroused his interest in the old masters, and artists of the French Barbizon and modern Dutch schools. He went on to the Royal Scottish Academy schools in Edinburgh, then, in 1882, to Paris to study at the atelier of Carolus-Duran. There he was also strongly influenced by the work of Jean Charles Cazin (1840-1901).
Cadenhead returned to Aberdeen in 1884, moving to Edinburgh in 1891. In 1893, he was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, and in 1902 was made an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy. He became Chairman of the Society of Scottish Artists, and was one of the original committee of the Scottish Modern Arts Association. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Scottish Academy and Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, and was elected a Scottish Royal Academician in 1921.
Amongst his portraits is one of his mother entitled ""Lady with Japanese Screen and Goldfish"" (1886, City Art Gallery, Edinburgh).
Cadenhead died in Edinburgh in 1927.

Manly Fleischmann

Manly Fleischmann (1908-1987) was an attorney whose record of public service included positions in the Harry S. Truman Administration and in the administration of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. He served as President Truman's Defense Production Administrator for the Korean War. At the request of Gov. Rockefeller, he chaired the New York State Commission on the Quality, Cost and Financing of Elementary and Secondary Education (known as The Fleischmann Commission).
Early life.
Manly Fleischmann was born July 15, 1908 in Hamburg, New York (a suburb of Buffalo) to a Buffalo trial lawyer, Simon Fleischmann. The family had ties to both Judaism and Quakerism. The Fleischmann boys remembered of their childhood that a Quaker idiom was the household vernacular when they were growing up (that is, use of 'thee' and 'thou'). Manly Fleischmann never practiced Judaism, however. Instead, he and his future wife, Lois, worshiped and raised their family in the Episcopal Church.
Fleischmann received his undergraduate training at Harvard College in 1929 and his law degree from the University of Buffalo in 1933.
War and public service.
Buffalo native John Lord O'Brian, a friend of Simon Fleischmann, was General Counsel to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's War Production Board during World War II. He named Manly Fleischmann his Assistant General Counsel. Fleischmann remained in this post until 1943, when he joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor of the present Central Intelligence Agency), serving as a united States Navy officer detached to a British Army unit involved in espionage in Japanese-occupied Burma. For his service, he was later decorated by both the U.S. and Thai governments.
At the War's end, Fleischmann returned to Buffalo and founded a private law practice, Fleischmann Brothers, with his brother, Adelbert (1912-2008). However, with the advent of the Korean War, in 1950, he returned to Washington as General Counsel to the War Production Board.
In 1951, President Truman appointed him Defense Production Administrator and National Production Administrator, where Fleischmann balanced war production with maintaining a domestic economy. He also served as U.S. Chairman of the International Materials Conference.
As Korean War Production Administrator, Fleischmann was described as "...the man who exercises the greatest control over the economy in peacetime history." The author, Robert J. Donovan, said Fleischmann "...is representative of the rare type of government executive whose judgment is unfettered by political loyalties and whose decisions are unhampered by past ties with business, labor, or other big interests." The magazine concluded that, "[at the age of forty-three Fleischmann is looked upon as one of the ablest administrators in Washington, at a time when Washington sorely needs competent administrators."
President Truman later sent Fleischmann to Europe as one of his representatives in discussions that would lead to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
After the war, in 1952, Fleischmann, who had turned down President Truman's offer to appoint him Ambassador to Indonesia, returned to private law practice. He was a founding partner of two major firms: Webster, Sheffield, Fleischmann, Hitchcock, & Chrystie in New York City, and Jaeckle, Fleischmann, Kelly, Swart, & Augspurger in Buffalo.
The Fleischmann Commission.
In 1969, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller appointed Fleischmann to head a state commission to study the quality, cost and financing of public education.
In 1972, Fleischmann issued his report (Viking Press 1972). It stunned the educational establishment by: proposing busing to end racial segregation; opposing most state aid to non-public schools; and proposing a state takeover of all public elementary and secondary school costs to be financed by a state tax on real property.
Fleischmann suffered a stroke that debilitated him during the final decade of his life. He died March 25, 1987, at Buffalo after a fall at his home.

Raphaël Bretton

Raphaël Bretton (7 February 1920 – 20 February 2011) was a French set decorator. He won an Academy Award and was nominated for three more in the category Best Art Direction.
Biography.
He was born Raphaël Gaston Beugnon in Paris, France. During World War II he fled to England, and in 1943 was recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE). His evaluations during training where not promising. His instructors considered him "soft", "petulant" and "prone to bouts of childish temper". He was eventually transferred to the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and commissioned into the United States Naval Reserve with the rank of lieutenant. In April 1944, Beugnon and two other agents were parachuted into northern France. Their mission, codenamed "Beggar", recruited more than 90 agents to operate in the Oise department, north-west of Paris. Prior to the D-Day landings they carried out sabotage attacks on German railway traffic and communications lines. Later, as Allied troops approached Paris, they discovered a large force of German tanks hidden in woodlands and called in air strikes to destroy them. Beugnon was subsequently awarded the French "Croix de Guerre" and the American Distinguished Service Cross. His citation read in part:
Post-war he was sent to Hollywood to act as a technical advisor to the makers of the film "O.S.S.", starring Alan Ladd. He decided to stay in the United States, adopted the name Raphael Bretton, and worked as a set designer in films and television.
Bretton died in Green Valley, Arizona, on 20 February 2011.

This is a list of starting quarterbacks in the National Football League updated through week seventeen of the 2013 NFL season. The position of starting quarterback is regarded as the most visible and important role on the team. The position is the most influential due to the quarterback touching the ball on nearly every offensive play and the responsibility of both calling plays and making decisions during the play.
Brett Favre holds the record for most wins by a starting NFL quarterback with 186 wins total over his nineteen-year career. Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning has the most wins amongst active NFL quarterbacks with 155 wins. Favre also holds the record for most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback. From September 27, 1992, to December 5, 2010, Favre started a total of 297 regular season games and twenty-four playoff games, totaling 321 consecutive games. The longest active streak of consecutive starts is held by New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning at 136 starts, with his first start coming on November 21, 2004.

Lady Bullseye

Lady Bullseye is a fictional character, a supervillain in the . A female counterpart of Bullseye, she was created by Ed Brubaker, Marko Djurdjevic, and Clay Mann, first appearing in "Daredevil" #111.
Publication history.
Lady Bullseye was inspired by Lady Snowblood, a Japanese femme fatale.
Fictional character biography.
Born in Japan, the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name, or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the Yakuza, who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery. However, Bullseye, on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters. The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.
Years later, now in the employ of the Hand, the famous ninja order, she arrives in New York, to take the lead in Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi's plan. However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for the Hand's ritual, interrupting some in order to catch her enemies, who are used to those traditions, off-guard. She kills and resurrects both White Tiger and Black Tarantula to assist her.
At the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targeting Daredevil by assisting the parents of Murdock's mentally-ill wife Milla Donovan in gaining custody of her. When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to Spain, preparing to initiate "Plan B". There, she finds The Kingpin, trying to live a normal civilian life, and killing his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.
It turns out that Matsumoto's real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil's ally Master Izo, who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.
Subsequently, she is shown to now be allied with the Kingpin against Daredevil, instigating a conflict between Daredevil and Norman Osborn, which ultimately leads to Daredevil declaring Hell's Kitchen the territory of the Hand.
She was hired by an as yet unknown party to temporarily injure Pepper Potts with a compressed air rifle.
Powers and abilities.
Lady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts, and has been shown proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and using both a katana and shuriken. It has been noted that she is faster than both Bullseye and the Kingpin. However she is also less powerful. Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing yoga. She is also skilled in legal matters, being a lawyer in her civilian guise.
Other versions.
Daredevil Noir.
Lady Bullseye appears as a caucasian woman called Eliza. She is an operative of the Kingpin, and a lover of a rival crime lord called O'Halloran.
Marvel Zombies.
A zombiefied version of Lady Bullseye is part of an invasion team that heads into the 'Marvel Ape' universe, desperate for fresh meat. The simian Torch slays Bullseye with a blast of heat.

Frederick Kohner

Frederick Kohner (September 25, 1905, Teplitz-Schönau, Austria-Hungary (present day Czech Republic) - July 7, 1986), born Friedrich Kohner, was an Austrian-born novelist and screen writer, both in Germany and the US.
He is best known for having created the "Gidget" novels, which inspired a series of movies, two television series, three telemovies and a feature length animated film. He based the title character on his own daughter, Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman. 
Frederick Kohner died on July 7, 1986 in Los Angeles, California, aged 80.
Life.
Having studied in Vienna and Paris, Kohner wrote his thesis titled "Film ist Dichtung", meaning "Film is Poetry". Subsequently, he worked as a journalist in Prague and Berlin. For a short while in 1929/1930 he was employed as a movie correspondent for German newspapers in Hollywood. He used his stint there for a minute role in Lewis Milestones legendary anti-war movie All Quiet on the Western Front.
Back in Berlin in 1930, Kohner began to work for the German film industry for real, starting with the comedy "Seitensprünge" - a production a young Billy Wilder also happened to be working on as a screenwrite - where he himself was assistant producer to István Székély. In 1932/33 Kohner supplied a full three movies of his brother's, Universal producer Paul Kohner, with screenplays, often in cooperation with other authors. Having been Jewish, he was pushed into isolation due to the ongoing worsening of the political climate. In 1934, Robert Siodmak, the executive producer of his last German film "Brennendes Geheimnis" who had fled to Paris in the meantime, made it possible for him to contribute to the screenplay for the French piece "La crise est finie". During the time of the National Socialism Friedrich Kohner only contributed (uncredited) to the screenplay "Viktoria", an adaption of a novel by Knut Hamsun. In July 1936, together with his wife Fritzi and their four year-old daughter Ruth, Friedrich Kohner finally managed to emigrate to the US. 
From the time he established himself in Hollywood (mostly uncredited work for developing screenplays and treatments), he went by the Americanized name of Frederick Kohner. For his contribution to the story for the 1938 Deanna Durbin comedy "Mad About Music", Kohner received an Oscar nomination the following year. Subsequently, from 1939 onward, he sporadically was given the odd offer to create ragular screen plays for movies again, among them being "The Men in Her Life" with Loretta Young and Conrad Veidt. The bulk of his work in the US however continued to be concentrated on developing stories for films.

Allen McLane

Allan McLane (August 8, 1746 – May 22, 1829) was an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. He was the appointed as first United States Marshal of Delaware on September 26, 1789. He was appointed as Collector of the Port of Wilmington in 1797 and remained in that office until his death on May 22, 1829, at the age of 83. At 21, he moved to central Delaware. His father became a merchant in Philadelphia.
American Revolution.
He served in General George Washington's army during the American Revolution, as an adjutant of the Delaware militia with Caesar Rodney. His used most of his fortune he inherited after his father died to fund his own company as far as payment and equipment for the troops. It was very successful in the Valley Forge campaign. They earned the nickname "Market Stoppers". Mclane warned General Washington of his suspicion of Benedict Arnold's loyalty prematurely. McLane had trouble working with Henry Lee III so Washington sent him down to Charleston, South Carolina.
Allan McLane lead foraging parties for the Continental army while they were encamped at Valley Forge. He and his men cut off British expeditions and took their cattle. "He was Captain of an independent corps, now a small group of horsemen, now a hundred men, mounted and on foot, including sometimes a contingent of Oneida Indians, he was at once forager, scout, and raider everywhere about Philadelphia and even, at times, in that city in disguise." p. 547, The War of the Revolution, Volume II, Christopher Ward, published 1952, MacMillan Co, NY, NY.
Home of Allan McLane.
taken from Delaware Archives Historical Marker Program
HOME OF ALLAN McLANE
For many years this home was the property of Colonel Allan McLane, statesman and hero of the American Revolution.
Born in Philadelphia August 8, 1746, McLane had moved to Delaware by 1769. His military career began when he was commissioned as an officer in the state militia in 1775. After the outbreak of the Revolution, McLane volunteered to raise a company of troops, investing much of his inheritance in accompanying expenses. During the course of the war he was an active participant in many major engagements including Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, and the siege of Yorktown. His bravery and enterprise were rewarded in 1777 when he received his captain’s commission from General Washington. He was one of the first to suspect the loyalty of Benedict Arnold, and is said to have played a significant role in convincing the French to blockade the Chesapeake in 1781. He was a member of the Order of Cincinnati. For many years he was active in the affairs of church and state, serving as Speaker of the state Housing of Representatives, member of the Privy Council, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and U.S. Marshall for Delaware. He was delegate at Delaware’s historic Constitution Ratification Convention in 1787, and a long-time advocate of the Methodist Church.
Following his return from the war it is believed that the McLane family rented a home at the southwest corner of Mt. Vernon and Market Streets. On December 23, 1785, Allan McLane “Merchant” received a deed from Thomas Wilds for a parcel of land including the lot where his house stands. Among the members of the family moving to the home was McLane’s infant son Louis, later a distinguished member of Congress, Minister to England, and United States Secretary of State. McLane maintained homes here on his farm until he moved to Wilmington following his appointment as Port Collector in 1797. He retained ownership of this property until selling it in 1828, one year prior to his death.

Stephen B. Grimes

Stephen B. Grimes (18 April 1927 – 12 September 1988) was an English production designer and art director. He won an Academy Award and was nominated for two more in the category Best Art Direction.
Overview.
Stephen B. Grimes started working in the British film industry after the war as a sketch-artist. From the mid 50s to the late 60s, Grimes worked almost exclusively with John Huston. Their longer term collaboration resulted in 14 films in over 30 years.
Grimes also had a fruitful long-term working relationship with Sydney Pollack, making 7 films with him.
Grimes also worked with directors David Lean, Peter Yates, Mark Rydell and Ulu Grosbard.
One of his great strengths as a Production Designer was his skill as an artist: in researching and preparing a film he would produce many beautiful, dramatic and atmospheric sketches. These would help the Director and Director of Photography (and other key personnel) to create the visual style and look of a film. Grimes understood the importance of light, space and texture – he put more into his sketches than most art directors – and tended to make sketches as much as or more than take photographs. He was not lavish, he liked the challenge of getting a good visual look with essentials – combining observation and imagination. Grimes was conscientious with high standards and poured himself into his work.
Biography.
Stephen B. Grimes was the second of seven children of Leslie and Nancy Grimes. Leslie was an artist and cartoonist. Three of his brothers, Michael Grimes, Bruce Grimes and Colin Grimes also worked in the British film and TV industry as Art Directors or Assistant Art Directors. Colin Grimes (living) sometimes assisted Stephen.
Grimes grew up in Haslemere, Surrey; Peldon in Essex; and Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill Gate, London.
He went to St Martins School of Art, where he met and then married Kathleen Grimes (née Sanders). They had five children. Grimes was in the Army at the tail-end of the war.
Work as sketch artist or draughtsman.
After leaving art school Grimes was told that they were employing sketch-artists at Denham Studios. He went along with a portfolio of work and was taken on. Carmen Dillon took him ‘under her wing’ and he also worked alongside Oliver Messel, Vertchinsky, Paul Sheriff, Hein Heckroth, Ivor Beddoes, John Box and Ralph Brinton. From mid 40s to mid 50s Grimes worked as a sketch artist or draughtsman on a variety of films made at Denham and Pinewood Studios including:

Sakio Bika vs. Jaidon Codrington

Sakio Bika versus Jaidon Codrington was a super middleweight boxing contest that was notable for being the final of the 3rd season of the boxing reality show 'The Contender' broadcast on ESPN. The fight took place in Boston's TD Banknorth Garden on November 6, 2007 in front of 6,000 people and offered a prize fund for the winner of $750,000.
Build-up.
Jaidon Codrington, a 23-year-old from Queens in New York, entered the tournament with a record of 16 wins with 13 of those wins coming by way of knockout. His only defeat against Allan Green was, however, a brutal one and saw him devastatingly knocked out within the first 18 seconds of the first round. Codrington had also once held the New York State Super Middleweight title.
Sakio Bika was the more experienced of the two, 5 years older and originally from Cameroon, Bika had represented his country at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and now based himself in Australia. Bika became Australian super middleweight champion and eventually fought for the WBO, IBF and WBC versions of the World super middleweight title against the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Lucien Bute and Marcus Beyer. In October 2002 he challenged Sam Soliman for the IBF Pan Pacific title and lost a mixed decision over 10 rounds. Soliman (also an Australian) would later also become a contestant on season 3 of the Contender.
Both boxers had fought twice previously in the tournament with Codrington scoring two knockouts on his way to the final stopping Brian Vera in the 2nd round and Wayne Johnson in the 1st. Bika went the distance with both his opponents beating Donny McCrary over 5 rounds and then beating his former victor Sam Soliman over 8. The tournament represented a chance for both athletes to gain recognition in the sport and to follow in the footsteps of previous Contender winners Sergio Mora and Grady Brewer.
The fight.
The fight started in exciting fashion with both boxers going down in the first. Bika was the first to score the knockdown after assaulting Codrington with a 'big hitting early charge'. Jaidon managed to recover and later in the round scored a left hook which dropped the African to his knees and left him looking very unsteady for the rest of the round. Both boxers continued to take big shots throughout the fight with Bika in particular throwing huge hooks in wide sweeping arcs eventually wearing down the less experienced man by taking him into the trenches. ESPN's Joe Tessitore commentating on the fight called the action ""truly great"" and noted at the end of the 5th round ""If you don't like this, you don't have a pulse"".
The fight, originally scheduled for 10 rounds, was stopped in 2 minutes and 18 seconds of round 8 with Codrington spent and Bika's experience and stamina being the deciding factors. Sugar Ray Leonard sitting at ringside praised the attitude and heart of both fighters saying ""So much heart, so much determination, so much resiliency...Real fighters, real warriors, real contenders"". Promoter Lou Dibella said the action was like "something out of a Rocky movie".
Aftermath.
Following the contest Codrington took a year out of the ring only returning in November 2008 to defeat journeyman William Gill over 8 rounds. Bika returned to Australia to pick up the vacant IBF super middleweight version of the Pan Pacific title, the title he had failed to win against Soliman in 2002. In November 2008 on the same day Codrington made his comeback, Sakio defeated the runner up from season one of the contender, Peter Manfredo, stopping him in the 3rd round to pick up the IBO super middleweight title.

Elveden

Elveden is a village and civil parish in the Forest Heath district of Suffolk in eastern England. In 2005 it had a population of 270.
The village is located on the A11 between Cambridge and Norwich and experiences a high volume of traffic. Since at least the 1980s, speculative plans for a bypass have been drawn up and repeatedly shelved. However, a bypass has finally been approved and construction began in early 2013 as part of the Barton Mills to Thetford improvement works. The bypass is currently due to be opened in winter 2014.
Elveden Hall is the centrepiece of the Elveden Estate, a vast country estate that is now the family seat of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family, Earls of Iveagh. Formerly, it was the family home of Maharaja Duleep Singh, who is buried in the churchyard of St Andrew and St Patrick Church; his grave is visited by the Sikh community who pay homage to the last ruler of the Sikh Empire. A Center Parcs holiday complex is located to the North of the village in nearby Elveden Forest.
The name "Elveden" seems to come from Old English *"ælfa-dene" 'elves' valley': the name appears, translated into Latin, as "vallis nympharum" 'valley of nymphs' in the mid-twelfth-century "Miracula sancte Wihtburge". During the 17th and 18th Centuries, the village was often referred to as "Elden" and the village name is often incorrectly spelt today as 'Elvedon'.
Elveden and the nearby village of Weeting were used as the code-names for investigations into the "News of the World" phone hacking allegations during July 2011. Operation Elveden is the name of the investigation into allegations of inappropriate payments having been made to the police in exchange for information.

António Raposo Tavares

António Raposo Tavares "o Velho" (Portuguese: "the old one") (1598–1658) was a Portuguese colonial bandeirante who explored mainland eastern South America and claimed it for Portugal, extending the territory of the colony beyond the limits imposed by the treaty of Tordesillas. Raposo Tavares was partly of Jewish origin according to the Jewish historian Anita Novinsky.
Biography.
Tavares was born in São Miguel do Pinheiro, Alentejo, Portugal in 1598. He sailed for South America in 1618 with his father Fernão Vieira Tavares.
In 1622, after his father died, he settled around São Paulo; six years later, in 1628, he left the village with the first "bandeira" composed of 900 settlers and 2000 Tupi warriors.
This voyage was started to hunt the heretics down and to capture more indigenous slaves (mostly Tupi, Tememinos and Carijós). The bandeirantes first attacked some Guarani villages in the upper Parana valley, which were protected by the Spanish Jesuits and brutally killed many people, capturing 2500 Indians. This journey allowed the annexation of a portion of the land east of the Uruguay River (current states of Paraná and Santa Catarina) to the Portuguese colony.
Tavares went back to São Paulo in 1633 and he became a judge. Three years later he left again for a new journey, this time to destroy the Spanish Jesuit settlements established southeast of the Uruguay River (current Rio Grande do Sul).
From 1639 to 1642, Tavares fought along with the military which was engaged in war against the Dutch, who had conquered the settlements in the north-eastern coast (Bahia and Pernambuco).
He embarked on his last journey with a bandeira in 1648, searching for gold, precious minerals and slaves in the unexplored mainland. He was joined by 200 white mercenaries from São Paulo and over a thousand Indians. The bandeirantes travelled for over following the courses of the rivers, most notably the Paraguay River, the Grande River, the Mamoré River, the Madeira River and the Amazon River. Only Tavares, 59 whites and some Indians reached Belém at the mouth of the Amazon River. After that, the survivors returned to São Paulo, where Raposo Tavares died in 1658.

When asked about the approach Sakanaction took to this album, vocalist Ichirō Yamaguchi stated:
Yamaguchi wanted to take a more adventurous approach to this album in comparison to their debut album, Go to the Future. The fashion in which the lyrics were created more in the style of a haiku, giving it a different feel from that of Go to the Future.

Frank Reys

Frank Reys (c.1931–1984) was the first, and to date, only Australian Aboriginal jockey to win the prestigious Melbourne Cup when, in 1973, he rode to victory on Gala Supreme.
Reys' career began in Northern Queensland. He raced in North Queensland, Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne and Victoria and won his first ride in 1948 as a 16 year old. In his career as a jockey he had 1,330 winning rides, made more impressive by the fact that there was only one metropolitan and one regional race meeting per week compared to today where one can race day, every day. His 1973 Melbourne Cup win was his last. In winning his last race at 45 years of age in 1976, he bookended his career with winners.
Heritage.
Frank Reys' father was Filipino and his mother Aboriginal, a descendent of the Djiribul people of Northern Queensland. Yet, he was widely reported as Filipino only throughout his career. Many believed that it would have hindered his prospects had he discussed his Aboriginal heritage openly in a time of racial discrimination and legislative limitations. Frank's daughter Shelley Reys once said: "...My father was one of the fourteen children. It was a different time in those days, a time where Indigenous heritage was not valued as it is today. The reconciliation movement was yet to be realised and people were marginalised simply on the basis of race and colour. Many years on, we are a different nation where fellow Australians not only acknowledge Indigenous people and culture, but appreciate that it is an intrinsic part of being Australian and in doing so, celebrate it". And later, "Dad was proud of their Aboriginal and Filipino heritage. Both parents made their mark in shaping who he was, as too his many brothers and sisters". 
Frank Rey's place in history, as the first Aboriginal jockey to win the Melbourne Cup, has been contested by some on the basis that he was preceded by John Cutts on Archer in the first Melbourne Cup in 1861, and by Peter St. Albans on Briseis in the Melbourne Cup of 1876. Neither of these jockeys, however, was Aboriginal, despite the legends that have risen up around them.
Early years.
Frank Reys was born in about 1931, one of 14 children, 8 boys and 6 girls. His father, who had immigrated to North Queensland before Frank was born, was a Filipino labourer and cook who worked on farms in North Queensland – inland from Cairns. He was born of his father's second relationship, and Frank was the first child of 9 to his Aboriginal mother. Frank and his brothers would round up brumbies (wild horses), and break them in, then race in contests between themselves. Frank was the standout and won most of the races, although one of his brothers did ride with success in amateur events. Frank loved to ride, and progressed to riding at Cairns in gymkhanas and pony races before becoming a jockey.
Teenage Frank was first indentured as an apprentice jockey in June 1949, to trainer Alfred Baker at Cairns. Later his apprenticeship was transferred to trainer Gordon Shelley.
During his apprenticeship Reys rode about 45 winners. He began at Cannon Park Racecourse at Cairns, and at other district meetings. At a meeting at Gordonvale Reys won his first race riding a horse named Cruedon. In the autumn of 1950, Baysure gave him his first win in Brisbane. At the end of his apprenticeship he travelled widely and became on of a few who have ridden over 1000 winners. One notable performance was in Queensland when he rode four winners in one afternoon at Cunnamulla. He won the Cunnamulla Cup on three occasions.
In his early riding years Reys worked hard to establish himself as a fully fledged jockey without the assistance of anyone but his "boss", Mr. Shelley.
Career.
In 1955 Reys moved to Sydney. He won the Warwick Farm Autumn Handicap on Beaupa and rode three winners in an afternoon at the provincial racecourse Kembla Grange, Wollongong. Around 1961 Reys moved from Sydney to Melbourne and had considerable success in both the metropolitan area and at Victorian provincial meetings. 
Among the highlights of his time in Victoria were:
Injuries.
In January 1969, Reys was badly injured a few days after the William Reid Stakes. A four horse fall at Geelong resulted in a smashed pelvis and he was hospitalised for three months. After his return to riding,"Turf Monthly" magazine noted in July 1969 that he rode "with considerable success at the Victorian mid-week provincial meetings". 
His family struggled financially due to all the racing he had missed due to injuries. Dual Choice, the "flying" filly – and later mare – won a great many races in the years 1970 to 1972. Although Reys did not ride her in all her victories, the two nevertheless developed a great affinity. In August 1973, attempting to have his first ride back in the saddle following time off from injury, Reys was involved in a car accident on the way to the course but climbed out of the wrecked car and rode Tauto to victory at Moonee Valley later that afternoon.
Trainer.
Trainer Ray Hutchins stood by Frank Reys. Ray Hutchins stood by Frank Reys after a horrible two years in which he had suffered a broken shoulder, two pelvis fractures, a broken cheek bone and an ankle, and earned himself the nickname "Autumn Leaves". Despite these injuries Hutchins entrusted Reys with the ride on the four-year-old gelding Gala Supreme in the 1973 Caulfield Cup, in which Gala Supreme ran second. Hutchins had long before mapped out the Melbourne Cup as his mission, and after the Caulfield Cup second fielded Gala Supreme for the Cup.
1973 Melbourne Cup.
On Tuesday 6 November 1973 Reys became the first Aboriginal jockey to ride a winner in the Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme carrying and Frank Reys won the Melbourne Cup at 9-1 in a time of 3.19.15. Reys and Gala Supreme then cemented their Melbourne Cup victory by winning the Herbert Power Handicap. At 41 years of age, Frank Reys was the oldest jockey with a ride in the 1973 Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme had drawn the extreme outside barrier 24 and that clearly was the only stumbling block in Rey’s mind. Trainer Hutchins would later tell how he and Reys had numerous phone conversations after the barrier draw and discussed various riding tactics. Hutchins recalled he eventually left it up to Reys to ride the horse as he saw fit and Reys told him he’d “have Gala Supreme one off the fence in 5th or 6th position going out of the straight”. Coming from the outside barrier Reys rode just as he had planned. He had Gala Supreme one off the fence, not far behind the leaders, before passing the winning post on the first lap. As the horses turned for home, Reys became buried in the pack, just behind the leaders. Two hundred metres from the winning post Reys squeezed Gala Supreme through a gap, left by the favourite, who had drifted off a straight course. It was only a narrow win, but Gala Supreme had surged home to victory. In his recollections Hutchins continued “and he went and did it – it was the perfect ride – he rode the race of his life for me.”
His victory speech said, in part, “I thank my God, my prayers and my family for their encouragement. This is such a wonderful day. I kept picking myself off the ground and hoping I would win a Melbourne Cup. It’s something every Australian jockey dreams about. I still can’t believe it.” Reys had three of his brothers in the crowd – Fred, Tony and Eric – to witness what was later called “one of the most stunning comebacks from adversity in Australian sporting history.” In 1976, three years after his career highlight aboard Gala Supreme, and after winning a Flemington race for his Melbourne Cup trainer Ray Hutchins, Reys announced his immediate retirement from the saddle.
Death.
Frank Reys died from cancer in 1984 – aged 53.
Shelley Reys.
Frank Reys is the father of Shelley Reys, who became a director of Reconciliation Australia, a forceful advocate for Aboriginal rights, and a prominent voice on Aboriginal affairs. In 2004 Shelley was invited to address the board of the National Australia Day Council to propose an Indigenous-inclusive way of marking the anniversary of the First Fleet's arrival. As a result of her recommendations, Australia Day 2005 was officially launched during a sunrise ceremony at Uluru. On 11 June 2012, Shelley Reys was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for "distinguished service to the Indigenous community, to reconciliation and social inclusion, and as an advocate for improved educational, health and employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people."
In October 2013, Shelley Reys was named by The Australian Financial Review as "100 Women of Influence".

Club history.
Stillorgan Rugby Club (formerly known as Salesians RFC) was founded and first registered with the Leinster Branch of rugby in 1973, when a group of former pupils from schools run by the Salesian fathers themselves playing together in Dublin. Most were a long way from home and had attended school in the Salesian colleges Pallaskenry, Limerick, Warranstown in Meath and Ballinakill in County Laois.
The application was made to the Leinster Branch, who had to be satisfied that the club had a home pitch, complete with dressing rooms and showers. After a bit of searching a pitch of sorts was found in Maynooth and the application was approved Salesians played their first season at J3 level in the '73 to '74 season with moderate success and were soon fielding two teams. The first team colours were red jerseys with black collars and cuffs and black shorts. The club strip was changed in 1978 to reflect the school colours of the new salesian college recently opened in Celbridge. Despite being over 35 years old, Stillorgan is still one of the youngest clubs in Dublin. Stillorgan suffered in the early eighties when many of its founding members retired and the club was forced to move its homeground to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. In the 86/87 season the club moved to CUS Sports Grounds Bird Avenue and this has ensured the clubs growth and existence and today it comfortably fields 3 teams in the various leagues and cups. The Stillorgan rugby club has a long a proud tradition of playing rugby and enjoying themselves. If they were as good at the former as they are at the latter they would have been All Ireland champions several times over. However in recent years the Stillorgan firsts have won cups, pennants and league sections. In recent times the firsts have won the Leinster J3 Section B Pennant and Leinster J3 League Title.[http://www.irishrugby.ie/23_16843.php]
Playing on the CUS pitches on Bird Avenue for time immemorial, this truly historic playing ground has given many memorable moments to the many crowds that congregate every weekend to view the champagne rugby that Stillorgan have perfected.
2009/10 J2s.
J2B League Promotion and Cup.
After a very promising start in their J2 career Stillorgan managed to clinch promotion to the J2A league in the first year at J2B standard. A feat that was well justified by some great wins home and away. The team character that is were very disappointed not to go that step further and win the league outright but two poor performances in the year made this fairy tale a step too far. A very strong league run ensured 2nd place and promotion but due to a restructuring of the league SRFC will again play in Section B for 2010/2011.
J2 Albert O'Connell Cup 2010.
With a bye in the first round, Stillorgan's cup campaign got off to comprehensive win over De La Salle Palmerston. Having already accounted for the South County Dublin team twice in the league it was a hat trick of victories as Stillorgan ran out easy winners and if they didn't take the foot off the pedal probably could have won by more.
The Quarter Final meeting with Bective Rangers made a 1st versus 2nd of the J2B League a match to look forward to and it lived up to expectation. With a victory each in the league neither team would underestimate the opposition and a tight game in Donnybrook was always going to be the outcome. After conceding an easy early penalty Stillorgan got their act together and through brilliant forward play from set pieces manages to push a hole through the Bective defence twice for Full-Back Mark Harnett and Second Row Daniel Shanahan to touch down and leave the half time score 15-3 to the visitors.
After 20 minutes of tough slogging where both teams had scoring chances narrowly averted Bectives pressure finally told with ten minutes to go converting a try leaving a nervous final ten minutes for Stillorgan to hang on. Hang on they did and a semi final place was assured by some stout defending and cool heads at the break down.
The reward of this great victory is a home semi-final against J2A side Blackrock College who defeated J"A league Winners Clontaf to get to this stage of the competition. This was unfortunately was the second cup semi final defeat in as many years but having gone up a division and competing against teams in a division above them this was no mean feat.
2008/09 J3s.
J3 League Winners 2008/09 and Promotion.
In Donnybrook in front of a crowd of 12,568 Stillorgan captured their first J3 league title in the clubs history. An 18 - 6 win against DLSP.
Stillorgan RFC went unbeaten through the whole regulation season, winning 12 games out of 12 before the play-offs. They are the only team in Leinster to achieve that feat.
The final was a close affair with Stillorgan's two tries ultimately being the difference between the teams. The first try was scored early on after a scrambled intercept inside their own half.
Great teamwork and support was shown then with six players touching the ball before Finian Finn scored to the right of the posts. The conversion was added by Tim Twomey.
In the second half, a fantastic break through the centre by Peter Hynes cut right through the DLSP defence.
He offloaded to Twomey on the wing to score in the corner. DLSP came close to scoring on a number of occasions but just could not get over the try-line.
J3 Moran Cup 2009.
After an agonisingly close encounter in Bird Avenue and numerous chances to clinch the win Stillorgans dream of the double were dashed and season ended with a 3 point defeat to eventual cup winners Lansdowne in a very hard fought battle after extra time.

Heal the World Foundation

The original Heal the World Foundation was a charitable organization founded by entertainer Michael Jackson in 1992. The foundation's creation was inspired by his charitable single of the same name. Through his foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo, instituted drug and alcohol abuse education and donated millions of dollars to disadvantaged children, including the full payment of a Hungarian child's liver transplant. Failure to file yearly accounting statements saw the charity lose its tax exempt status in 2002. A different organization, with no relationship to Michael Jackson's foundation, incorporated in the state of California under the same name and applied for new tax exempt status in 2008. The Jackson Estate is currently taking legal action against this organisation for unfair competition and trademark infringement.
Background.
Prior to the creation of the Heal the World Foundation, Jackson had expressed great interest in humanitarianism, equality and world peace. Songs such as "Can You Feel It", "We Are the World" and "Man in the Mirror" convey this. Jackson also donated millions of dollars to charity, including his $5 million share from the Victory Tour.
In 1984, while filming a Pepsi Cola commercial, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the "Michael Jackson Burn Center" which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns. 
Shortly afterward, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award presented by American President Ronald Reagan. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.
In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity single "We Are the World" with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. He was one of 39 music celebrities who performed on the record. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was recognized for his humanitarian efforts.
Mission.
Jackson founded the charity in 1992, naming it after his hit song, "Heal the World". The purpose of the charity was to provide medicine to children and fight world hunger, homelessness, child exploitation and abuse. Jackson stated that he wanted "to improve the conditions for children throughout the world".
The foundation also brought underprivileged children to Jackson's Neverland Ranch, located outside Santa Ynez, California, to go on theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property after he purchased it in 1988.
Fundraising.
The Dangerous World Tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5 million people in 70 concerts. All profits from the concerts went to the "Heal the World Foundation", raising millions of dollars in relief. Through the foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo and paid for a Hungarian child's liver transplant.
One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at the National Football League's Super Bowl XXVII. At the show, Jackson performed his anthem "Heal the World", to help promote the organization with the assistance of a choir of 750 people and a flash card display involving 98,000 volunteers. Jackson donated his entire fees to the foundation, with the NFL also donating $100,000 and a 30-second TV spot to push for contributions.
Following the Super Bowl, Jackson ran a full-page advertisement in the newspaper USA Today, providing a toll-free number. A coupon was provided that could be clipped and mailed in along with a contribution. Those donating $35 or more were given a "Heal the World" T-shirt.
The environmental themed music video for "Earth Song" closed with a request for donations to Jackson's foundation. 
In 1997, Jackson earned money from photographs of his son, Prince Michael. The photographs were sold to "OK!" magazine and the National Enquirer, raising $3 million for the foundation.
Heal the Kids.
In February 2001, Jackson launched Heal the Kids, an initiative of HTWF and part of the foundation's attempt to boost children's welfare. Jackson launched the charity initiative, stating, "Heal the Kids will help adults and parents realize it's in our power to change the world our children live in".
Jackson gave a speech at Oxford University about raising children, as part of the launch of his "Heal the Kids" initiative. In the speech, Jackson spoke rhetorically of his children, "What if they grow older and resent me, and how my choices impacted their youth?...Why weren't we given a normal childhood like all the other children? And at that moment I pray that my children will give me the benefit of the doubt. That they will say to themselves: Our daddy did the best he could, given the unique circumstances he faced. I hope that they will focus on the positives things, on the sacrifices I willingly made for them...". Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli concluded that Jackson's performance during the speech was "absorbing" and well received.
Disbandment.
In 2002, the Heal the World Foundation was suspended, after failing to file yearly accounting statements, required for tax-exempt organizations. Records showed that the foundation had net assets of $3,542 and reported $2,585 in expenses. The foundation did not have a director, president or other top manager besides Jackson, who was listed as chairman.
Name confusion.
A separate charity named 'Heal the World Foundation was set up in 2008. On August 11, 2009, CBS News reported that: "... representatives of the Jackson estate say the foundation is not linked, "The Michael Jackson estate has no connection whatsoever to the "Heal the World Foundation” run by Melissa Johnson," said Terry Fahn, a spokesperson for John Branca, the special administrator of the Jackson estate." On September 30, the Jackson Foundation started law action against the charity claiming that the "Defendants' acts of infringement and unfair competition have been committed with the intent to cause confusion, mistake and to deceive".

<doc id="20840308" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20840308" title="Mythicomyces">
Mythicomyces

Mythicomyces is a fungal genus in the family Psathyrellaceae. A monotypic genus, it contains the single species Mythicomyces corneipes, first described by Elias Fries in 1861. The fungus produces fruit bodies with shiny yellowish-orange to tawny caps that are in diameter. These are supported by stems measuring long and 1–2 mm thick. A rare to uncommon species, it is found in northern temperate regions of North America and Europe, where it typically fruits in groups, in wet areas of coniferous forests. There are several species with which "M. corneipes" might be confused due to a comparable appearance or similar range and habitat, but microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish between them.
Taxonomy.
The genus "Mythicomyces" was circumscribed in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and Alexander H. Smith to contain the species originally named "Agaricus corneipes" by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near Alsike, Sweden; it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907, and several times by Smith. When listing the synonyms of the species, Redhead and Smith cited the publication year of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their new combination invalid according to the rules of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, although the generic name was valid. The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011.
In its taxonomic history, the species has also been placed in "Geophila" by Lucien Quélet in 1886, and "Psilocybe" by Petter Karsten in 1879. "Psilocybe" specialist Gastón Guzmán excluded the taxon from the latter genus in his 1983 monograph, based on its roughened spores that lacked a germ pore, pale spore print, stem texture, and the tawny basal mycelium. Guzmán, who examined Smith's US collections, suggested that the material might be more appropriately considered a "Galerina", but Redhead and Smith noted that several features of "Mythicomyces corneipes" are inconsistent with placement in "Galerina", including spore print color, presence of metuloids, stem texture, and tawny basal mycelium.
Redhead and Smith placed the genus in the Strophariaceae, as the biology of the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more restricted concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. "Mythicomyces" and "Stagnicola" form a clade that is sister to the rest of the family.
Description.
The cap is initially somewhat conical with margins rolled inward, and expands to become bell-shaped or broadly convex in maturity, reaching a diameter of . The cap sometimes has an umbo, which is rounded to conical. The color of the cap ranges from dull to bright orange when young, to yellowish-brown (tawny) in maturity. It is hygrophanous, and the color fades to yellowish-buff. The cap surface is smooth and polished, and somewhat translucent, such that the radial gill lines can be seen on the margin. The gills are closely spaced, and have two tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills). Gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stem, although the gills tend to secede (separate from the stem) in maturity. They are initially pallid to whitish in color before turning brownish when the spores mature. The smooth stem measures long by 1–2 mm thick. Yellowish to pale orange near the top and dark reddish brown below, it has tawny mycelium at the base. In maturity the stem turns black from the base upward. In 1907, Morgan noted the stipe to be remarkably similar to that of "Marasmius cohaerens". The mushroom flesh has an odor that ranges from indistinct to somewhat of geraniums, while its taste is indistinct to faintly bitter. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown.
The spore print is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to somewhat ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5 µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, and have a small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5 µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24 µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3 µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4 µm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.
Similar species.
"Stagnicola perplexa" is similar in appearance and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to "Mythicomyces corneipes". "S. perplexa" generally has a more faded coloration, and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones. The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics, as "Stagnicola" has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls. Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses, "Phaeocollybia attenuata" might be confused with "M. corneipes". "Phaeocollybia attenuata" can readily be differentiated in the field by the long wirelike pseudorhiza extending below the substrate, and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented limoniform-globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia. Other morphologically similar species include "Hypholoma udum" and "H. elongatum", but unlike "M. corneipes", both of these agarics have smooth spores, yellow chrysocystidia, and lack metuloids. The lookalike "Galerina sideroides" is found in Washington, Michigan, and Sweden, where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs. It has distinct microscopic characteristics, such as a wider range of basidial widths (20–40 µm), and a lack of pleurocystidia.
Habitat and distribution.
"Mythicomyces corneipes" is a saprobic fungus, and uses plant debris—usually bits of wood—as a substrate. Fruit bodies appear in autumn, and grow in groups among mosses in moist habitats, such as near the edges of bogs, or under conifers or birch in soil wet from spring flooding. It has been recorded from North America, where it is most common in the Pacific Northwest region, and Europe, where it is rare, but widespread across the northern part of the continent. In 1938, Smith called the species "extremely rare".

Winthrop Sargent (politician)

Daiyuzenji

Daiyuzenji is a Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple located on the north side of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.
Daiyuzenji began in 1982 as the Illinois "betsuin" (branch temple) of Daihonzan Chozen-ji, a Rinzai headquarter temple founded in 1979 in Honolulu, Hawaii by Omori Sogen Roshi (1904-1994), a successor in the Tenryu-ji line of Rinzai Zen. Fumio Toyoda, a lay Zen master and martial art teacher who had emigrated to Chicago from Japan in 1974, was the driving force behind the founding and administration of the betsuin. Tenshin Tanouye Roshi and Dogen Hosokawa Roshi, two of Omori Roshi's successors who taught at Chozen-ji, traveled to Chicago beginning in the early 1980s to lead sesshin there. 
Eventually the Chicago betsuin developed a cadre of senior students, including several ordained priests. In 2005 it was designated a fully independent temple by Hosokawa Roshi, named "Sokeizan Daiyuzenji" (曹渓山大雄禅寺). So'zan Miller Roshi, one of Hosokawa Roshi's dharma heirs, was appointed the first Daiyuzenji "shike" (abbot).
Daiyuzenji teachers are also involved with the establishment of Korinji, a new Rinzai Zen Buddhist "sodo" (monastery) in the Madison, Wisconsin area. Groundbreaking for this occurred in June, 2009. Daiyuzenji and Korinji together anchor a network of associated Zen practice groups called the Rinzai Zen Community (RZC).

Operation Big Itch

Operation Big Itch was a U.S. entomological warfare field test using uninfected fleas to determine their coverage and survivability as a vector for biological agents. The tests were conducted at Dugway Proving Ground in 1954.
Operation.
Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 series of tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The tests were designed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of the tropical rat flea ("Xenopsylla cheopis") for use in biological warfare as disease vector. The fleas used in these trials were not infected by any biological agent. The fleas were loaded into two types of munitions and dropped from the air. The E14 bomb and E23 bomb, which could be clustered into the E86 cluster bomb and E77 bomb, respectively. When the cluster bombs reached 2,000 or 1,000 feet (600 or 300 m) the bomblets would drop via parachute, disseminating their vector.
The E14 was designed to hold 100,000 fleas and the E23 was designed to hold 200,000 fleas but the E23 failed in over half of the preliminary Big Itch tests. E23s malfunctioned during testing and the fleas were released into the aircraft where they bit the pilot, bombardier and an observer. As a result, the remaining Big Itch tests were conducted using only the smaller capacity E14. Guinea pigs were used as test subjects and placed around a circular grid.
Results.
Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts. The weapon proved able to cover a battalion-sized target area and disrupt operations for up to one day. The one-day limit was due to the activity of the fleas; the air dropped fleas were only active for about 24 hours.

The UC Davis Aggies football team represents the University of California, Davis in NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) intercollegiate competition. The UC Davis football program began competing in 1915, and has fielded a team each year since with the exception of 1918 during World War I and from 1943 to 1945 during World War II, when the campus, then known as the University Farm, was shut down. UC Davis competed as a member of the NCAA College Division through 1972. From 1973 to 2006, the Aggies competed within the NCAA Division II. In 2007, UC Davis promoted its football program to the Division I FCS level, and joined the Great West Conference. UC Davis has secured a total of 30 conference championships. Between 1929 and 1992, the Aggies captured 27 outright or shared Northern California Athletic Conference championships, including 19 in a row from 1971 to 1990. In 1993, UC Davis shared the American West Conference title, and in 2005 and 2009, the Aggies have won the Great West Conference.
History.
Rivalries.
The Sacramento State Hornets are the natural cross-town rival who battles UC Davis annually for the Causeway Carriage. This rivalry is known as the Causeway Classic. UC Davis leads the all time series 40 to 18 with no ties. Cal Poly Mustangs are another rival of the Aggies. UC Davis and Cal Poly play yearly in the Battle for the Golden Horseshoe, where the winner receives a trophy of a large golden horseshoe. Both Sacramento State and Cal Poly are also the Aggies' designated rivals for Big Sky Conference scheduling purposes, which means UC Davis plays both teams every year as part of its conference schedule.

UC Davis Aggies

The UC Davis Aggies (or Ags) compete in NCAA Division I sports in the Big West Conference. For football, the Aggies compete in Division I FCS (formerly known as Division I-AA), and are members of the Big Sky Conference, granting UC Davis the distinction of being one of only three UC campuses to field a football team (Cal and UCLA being the other two). The Aggies are also members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in Women's gymnastics and Women's lacrosse, and the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association in rowing.
The Aggies achievements in Division 2 motivated a decision (following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and the local community) in 2003 for the athletics program to re-classify to Division I.
Aggie Stadium is the home of the UC Davis football and lacrosse teams.
The UC Davis Women's rugby was ranked 4th in the nation in 2007.
On April 20, 2010, the school announced that effective July 1, four sports will be eliminated due to the national economic downturn.
The sports are: Women’s rowing, wrestling, men’s swimming and diving, and men’s indoor track and field.
Varsity sports.
UC Davis discontinued four varsity sports in 2010 due to a financial crisis and cuts in state funding: women's rowing, men's swimming & diving, men's indoor track, and wrestling. Prior to 2010, the last time UC Davis had discontinued a sport was men's gymnastics in 1987.
Colors, Mascot, Spirit.
The official school colors are blue and gold. The blue is due to the UC's early connection to Yale and as a result is often referred to as "Yale Blue" (e.g., see and [http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/teams/page/CALDAV?&_1:col_1=1), although UCD's official blue, usually called "Aggie Blue", Pantone 295 differs from Yale Blue (approximately Pantone 289).
The official school mascot is the mustang. Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school's agricultural heritage. Unlike most colleges, there is a distinction between the name for students and the mascot. There was a movement to change the school's mascot from the mustang to the cow, but despite student support this was turned down after opposition from alumni. Many people will call the mustang mascot of UC Davis an Aggie, but this is not its proper name; the mustang mascot is named Gunrock. The name dates to 1921 when the US Army brought a horse named Gun Rock to UC Davis to supply high-quality stock for cavalry horses. The mustang mascot was selected to honor that cavalry horse.
UC Davis students gather at sporting events to rally as the Aggie Pack, the largest student-run school spirit organization in the United States. The Aggie Pack cheers on the sports team to the music of the Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! and its alumni band.
Rivalries.
The highlight of the recent 4-year transition to Division I occurred on September 17, 2005, when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium by a score of 20–17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game. The Aggies also pulled off an upset against Stanford in basketball just months later, beating the Cardinal 64–58 with a late rally at home on December 4, 2005. The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies' win loss record with Stanford to 5–1 for men's sports the 05-06 year.
The Aggie football team plays Sacramento State in the annual Causeway Classic for the Causeway Carriage. The team also plays Cal Poly in the annual Battle for the Golden Horseshoe. 
Division II success: 1990-2003.
The Aggies finished first in NCAA Division II six times in 2003 and won the NACDA Director's Cup 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003. In 1998, the UC Davis men's basketball team won the NCAA Division II national championship despite being one of the few non-scholarship institutions in Division II at that time. They have also won NCAA Division II championships in Softball (2003), Men's Tennis (1992), and Women's Tennis (1990, 1993).
Wrestling.
UC Davis also had a note-worthy wrestling program, which competed in the Pac-10 at the Division I level. In 2007, UC Davis wrestler Derek Moore gained All-American status, and won the NCAA Division I Championship for his weight class. In addition, he received the "Most Outstanding Wrestler" award of the NCAA tournament. In so doing, Derek Moore became the first UC Davis student-athlete to become a NCAA champion at the Division I level. That same year, UC Davis finished within the top 25 among Division I collegiate wrestling programs in the country.

The football team shares an intense rivalry with Western Washington University (who will also be joining the NCC in 2006). Recently, the team has been competing in a game called the Battle in Seattle taking place at Seattle's CenturyLink Field before the even more traditional Cascade Cup game, although because of conference scheduling the two games were combined starting 2006. In 2008, The Great Northwest Athletic Conference reinstated football, and Central Washington along with Western Washington rejoined the conference, so the previous format of the Battle in Seattle being played at CenturyLink Field and the Cascade Cup was contested in Ellensburg. In 2009, Western Washington University disbanded its football team. In 2009, Central Washington University posted a perfect 11-0 record, the only Division II team to post a clean slate in 2009 regular season. Central Washington then lost to the Bearcats of Northwest Missouri State, who were the eventual NCAA Division II champions.
The Wildcats won the Division 2 NAIA Football National Championship in 1995.
Softball.
In 2008, Wildcat softball players Mallory Holtman and Liz Wallace helped carry injured opponent Sara Tucholsky of Western Oregon University around the bases after she hit her first-ever career home run and injured herself running around the bases. CWU lost the game, ending the Wildcats' season. The story received national attention and the trio appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, CBS, CNN, and ESPN. They also won an ESPY award for Best Moment in Sports in 2008, were featured in Sports Illustrated, and are part of a national billboard campaign promoting sportsmanship by the Foundation for A Better Life.
Rugby.
CWU Rugby operated as a university club sport from 1972 until 2013; the university announced in early 2014 that CWU Rugby would now be a varsity sport within the CWU Department of Athletics. Of the variety of sports offered by Central, the men's rugby team has been particularly successful. CWU established the men's rugby team in 1972. The rugby team plays and regularly defeats larger Division I universities, such as the University of Washington, Washington State University, University of Oregon, and Oregon State University. Rugby at Central has been quite successful against these and other larger schools. The Wildcats played in the College Premier Division until 2013, but in 2013 moved to the Varsity Cup competition, and finished the season ranked sixth in the country.
Rugby has gained the Wildcats national recognition due to its high level of success in the national playoffs. Their most impressive accomplishments include making the Sweet 16 in 1998 and 2001. In 2001, Central defeated North Carolina 52-17 in their Sweet 16 match, before losing to Penn State 14-12 in the Elite 8. In 2007, the men's rugby team was ranked as high as 10th in the nation. Central finished the 2010-11 season ranked 7th in the nation, and finished the 2012-13 season ranked 6th.
The Wildcats have also been successful in rugby sevens. The Wildcats won the 2011 Las Vegas Invitational to qualify for the 2011 Collegiate Rugby Championship. The Wildcats gained national attention for their rugby program when, led by Tim Stanfill, they finished fourth at the 2011 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament broadcast live on NBC. That same year CWU Rugby finished 2nd (losing in overtime) at the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. Tim Stanfill was voted MVP of the 2012 Tournament and a member of the All-Tournament Team along with Forward Patrick Blair. Central Washington won the 2012 Northwest 7s tournament to qualify for the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. The Wildcats also played in the 2013 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, reaching the semifinals.
In 2012 CWU Rugby's Head 7's Coach and 15's Head Attack Coach Tony Pacheco was named as the Head Coach for the Collegiate All-Americans 7's program. Pacheco, a product of CWU Rugby (Class of '03), selected two CWU Rugby players, Tim Stanfill and Patrick Blair, as Collegiate All-Americans, joining Scott Anderson (Class of '99) in obtaining All American status as members of CWU Rugby.
Club Sports.
Pertaining to club sports on campus, not regulated by the NCAA or NAIA, the Western Oregon Men's Lacrosse Club has won the Division II PNCLL championship trophy in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Western Oregon Men's Rugby Club won the Division II Pacific Northwest Rugby Football Union (PNRFU) championship in 2005, 2009, and 2010.

Neumarkt-Sankt Veit – Landshut railway

The Neumarkt-Sankt Veit–Landshut railway is a single-tracked, unelectrified main line in Bavaria, southern Germany. It is operated by SüdostBayernBahn (a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn).
History.
Construction of the line from Landshut to Neumarkt a. Rott (now Neumarkt St. Veit) was authorised on 1 February 1880 and the 38.88 km long route was opened on 4 October 1883. 
Initially the permitted speed on the route was just 30 km/h. On 1 June 1889 the railway was designated as a main line and its top speed raised to 50 km/h.
Operation.
In the 2009 timetable 37 passenger trains and 8 goods trains will work the line daily.
Regionalbahn trains run generally every hour between Salzburg (every 2 hours), Rosenheim and Landshut. Occasionally trains from Landshut also travel over the Mühldorf–Burghausen railway to Burghausen. Passenger services are provided by Class 628 multiples. Since 10 June 2007 school specials have been introduced to and from Landshut with a DB Class 218 diesel locomotive hauling four double-decker coaches.
Upgrade.
On 22 June 2007 the upgrade of the route to handle a top speed of 120 km/h was begun. That will enable, initially from December 2008, almost hourly services from Mühldorf to Landshut. In addition, the platforms at Vilsbiburg, Geisenhausen and Neumarkt-St. Veit will be raised to 55 cm.
In 2009 the platform of the halt at Landshut-Süd will be also raised to 55 cm. Additional measures to speed traffic up will mean that in December 2009 there will also be hourly services at the stops en route.

Luuk de Jong

Luuk de Jong (, born 27 August 1991) is a Dutch footballer, who currently plays for Newcastle United on loan from Borussia Mönchengladbach and the Netherlands football team.
Early life.
De Jong was born in Aigle, Switzerland, as a son of two Dutch volleyball players who played professionally in that country. The family moved to the Netherlands when de Jong was four years old, and his brother Siem six.
He started his football career in Doetichem at the amateur club DZC '68, together with his brother. They were both then recruited by the local professional club De Graafschap. Luuk de Jong stayed with the club, but Siem was scouted and signed by Ajax.
Club career.
De Graafschap.
He made his Eredivisie debut in a match versus NAC Breda coming on as a substitute. After another match coming of the bench against SC Heerenveen de Jong became a starter joining newly acquired Ben Sahar. In their first match together against Willem II de Jong gave an assist to Ben Sahar giving De Graafschap a 1–0 win. He made his first Eredivisie goal in a home match against FC Twente he scored the 2–1. Moments later de Jong made a handball giving FC Twente a penalty which Blaise N'Kufo scored, the match ended in 2–2. His second goal came in a home match versus Heracles Almelo. Resit Schuurman took a free kick and Rogier Meijer headed it on. De Jong who was standing with his back to the goal then scored with a beautiful overhead kick which gave De Graafschap the 1–0 victory. In the home game versus NEC Nijmegen he injured his ankle and he was substituted in the first half. De Jong came back from injury in the play-offs for promotion/relegation. He scored the winner in the home game versus RKC Waalwijk but it wasn't enough to keep De Graafschap in the Eredivisie.
Twente.
On 6 April 2009, it was confirmed that de Jong signed a contract for three years with an option for another year with FC Twente. His contract would start on 1 July 2009. He played his first minutes for FC Twente in the cup match against SC Joure where he came on as a second half substitute replacing Dario Vujičević. He provided two assists in the 8–0 victory over SC Joure. He scored his first two goals for FC Twente in the cup match against Capelle.
De Jong made his Europa League debut against FC Sheriff Tiraspol replacing Miroslav Stoch. He also played against Fenerbahçe S.K. when he came on as a substitute. He scored two goals in the cup match against Helmond Sport, Twente would go on and win the match 3–0. In the away game against FC Utrecht de Jong made his debut in the Eredivisie when he replaced Kenneth Perez in the 90th minute.
Because Blaise N'Kufo was injured, de Jong deserved a starting spot against Werder Bremen in the knockout stage (32 teams) of the Europa League. He scored his first goal in the Europa League for FC Twente in the away game against Werder Bremen. FC Twente were already 3–0 behind when de Jong headed the 3–1 past goalkeeper Christian Vander.
De Jong scored his first Eredivisie goal for FC Twente in the home game against NEC at 28 February 2010. FC Twente won this game with 2–1. He scored his second Eredivisie goal in the home game against SC Heerenveen at 10 April 2010 in injury time, the matched finished 2–0.
He was very important in the Johan Cruyff Schaal scoring the winning goal against Ajax in the eighth minute. He started the match because Marc Janko was injured. De Jong intercepted a pass from Maarten Stekelenburg to Gregory van der Wiel and then stayed calm and scored the winner in the match which ended 1–0.
2011–12.
De Jong played in the Champions League play-off game against Benfica, a 2–2 home draw on 16 August. Four days later he scored his first Eredivisie goal of the campaign in a 5–1 demolition of SC Heerenveen. The following week, on de Jong's 21st birthday, he found the back of the net two more times as Twente smashed VVV Venlo 4–1.
De Jong scored two goals against RKC Waalwijk on 21 January 2012, one was a tap in to an open goal and the other a penalty, as Twente ran out 5–0 winners. In Twente's following fixture against FC Groningen on 29 January, de Jong netted a hat-trick, each goal coming off an assist from Ola John, and provided an assist for Leroy Fer as his side won 4–1 and climbed to second in the Eredivisie table. On 10 February, de Jong found the back of the net two more times but Twente missed the chance to go top of the league table, as they lost 3–2 to SC Heracles. De Jong's two goals meant he had scored seven times in the past three Eredivisie fixtures.
On 4 March, de Jong scored a goal in Twente's 6–2 thrashing of fellow title contenders PSV Eindhoven at the Philips Stadion. Four days later in a Europa League match against Schalke 04, de Jong was the protagonist of a controversial penalty simulation that resulted in a red card for Schalke defender Joël Matip, and a penalty kick which he himself successfully converted, to ensure the win for his side by 1–0. However Twente ended up falling out of the competition, losing 4–1 in the second leg in Germany, as de Jong's fellow Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar netted a hat-trick.
De Jong scored twice in two minutes on 14 April to put his side 2–1 up away to NAC Breda, but an injury-time strike from Nourdin Boukhari denied Twente the chance to close the gap on title-rivals Ajax. He finished the season with 25 goals on a joint-second place, seven behind top-scorer Bas Dost. At the end of the 2011-12 season, De Jong announced he wanted to leave the club. Having attracted the interest of several clubs around Europe, including Premier League side Newcastle United, de Jong accused the club's chairman Munsterman of increasing the bid for him. In response, the club's chairman and Steve McClaren expressed dismay over de Jong's comments.
Borussia Mönchengladbach.
On 18 July 2012, de Jong signed for Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach on a five-year deal, with a fee of €15 million (£12.6m), having revealed it was his dream to join. Eight months later after the move, de Jong stated the Bundesliga was "a great place to develop as a player".
He made his debut with Mönchengladbach in a match against Munich 1860, His team ended up winning 4–2, however, de Jong was quite anonymous during his first match, failing to score or assist any goals. On 21 August, he started his first European game for Borussia Mönchengladbach and in the process scored an own goal from a free kick in a 3–1 defeat at the hands of Dynamo Kyiv during the UEFA Champions League Qualifiers. His first goal for the club came in a 3–2 defeat to 1. FC Nuremberg on 15 September, converting a tap in after a cross from Patrick Herrmann. However, later in the season, De Jong's first team opportunities soon faded after falling out with manager Lucien Favre and only made twenty-three appearances; scoring six times. Towards the end of the season, De Jong reiterated he was confident he could prove himself as the best striker.
Newcastle United (loan).
On 29 January 2014 de Jong completed a loan signing with Premier League side Newcastle United until the end of the 2013-14 season. He made his debut on 1 February in the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland.
International career.
De Jong received his first call-up for the Netherlands senior team for the friendly against Austria on 9 February 2011 and made his debut in the same match, replacing Dirk Kuyt. He scored his first goal with the national squad on 6 September 2011 in the 2–0 win during the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying game against Finland that secured Dutch qualification to the Euro 2012. On 7 May 2012, he was named in the provisional list of 36 players for the Euro 2012 tournament by Netherlands manager Bert van Marwijk. He was one of the 23 players chosen to represent the Netherlands on Euro 2012, but he did not make any appearance.

Tomas Platero IV

Tomás Braulio Platero IV (1857 - 1925) was one of the founders of the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), Argentina's oldest existing political party, and among the most prominent Afro Argentine public figures of his time. 
Platero was born in Buenos Aires in 1857 and, though slavery had been abolished in Argentina in 1812, Platero suffered from prevailing local discrimination against people of color. He joined the original Civic Union in 1890, and became a loyal supporter of the party's first leader, Leandro Alem, becoming a prominent member of the Committee of La Plata after an 1891 split in the Civic Union led to the establishment of the UCR (which advocated greater activism towards the goal of universal male suffrage).
He was also the founder of the Professional Association of the Province of Buenos Aires, and President of the Electric Cooperative Society. Appointed Chief Civil Registry Director for the 3rd and 5th districts in Buenos Aires, he inherited a bookkeeping system whereby black births, marriages and deaths were recorded on separate ledgers, and eventually helped end the practice. He was later the founder and President of The Protector National Mutual Association. He was also a person of strong religious convictions, and a brother of the Franciscan Order. 
Following Alem's 1896 suicide, Platero became a supporter of Dr. Hipólito Yrigoyen, whose activism led to the passage of the Sáenz Peña Law in 1912, and to Argentina's first democratic presidential elections, in 1916. A steadfast supporter of President Yrigoyen's, Platero was a vocal opponent of the "Antipersonalistas" (a more conservative wing of the UCR). 
Platero died in La Plata on February 17, 1925, and his funeral was attended by the highest authorities of the UCR, including the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, José Luis Cantilo, Federico Zelarrayán (carrying condolences from Yrigoyen), and numeorus other UCR figures.

The United States House of Representatives voted on January 27, 2014 to pass the bill To provide for the conveyance of a small parcel of National Forest System land in Los Padres National Forest in California (H.R. 3008; 113th Congress). If the bill became law, it would authorize the exchange of 5 acres of land in the Los Padres National Forest for unspecified lands owned by the White Lotus Foundation. If the land exchange does not occur within two years, the Forest Service would offer to sell the land to the foundation, and the proceeds would be deposited in the Treasury. The House Natural Resources Committee report on the bill indicated that the White Lotus Foundation would have to close without the land due to a lack of accessibility.

SüdostBayernBahn

SüdostBayernBahn (Southeast Bavaria Railway) is one of several regional railway networks in Germany owned by Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG). Since 2001 the network has included the railway hub of Mühldorf which connects 7 major railway lines from Munich, Rosenheim, Freilassing, Burghausen, Simbach am Inn, Passau and Landshut, forming a star-shaped network of lines called "Linienstern Mühldorf" ("Mühldorf route star network"). "SüdostBayernBahn" is subordinated to "DB RegioNetz Verkehr" and "DB RegioNetz Infrastruktur".
Railway network.
In order to be able to operate railway networks more efficiently on a geographical basis, the Deutsche Bahn introduced the concept of regional networks or Regio-Netze. One of the five national "Regio-Netze" is called the "SüdostBayernBahn" (SOB) and is responsible for the infrastructure, and/or passenger services, on the following routes:
Operations.
"SüdostBayernBahn" has rented the lines for an extended period of time and is therefore classed as the railway infrastructure company for its network. The renting of the routes from "DB Netz" is done through "DB RegioNetz Infrastruktur".
As a railway infrastructure company, "SüdostBayernBahn" now only operates trains which provide passenger services (the freight services to Frontenhausen-Marklkofen having been taken over by Railion). These passenger services are provided using Class 218 locomotives and Class 628 diesel multiple units. Amongst the coaches used are modernized Silberling carriages and double-decker coaches. The double-deckers include three air-conditioned double-decker driving cars. The delivery of the latest class of air-conditioned, double-decker coaches began in March 2007. On those routes for which "SüdostBayernBahn" is only responsible for infrastructure, "RegionalBahn" trains are operated by "DB Regio Bayern" using Class 628 diesel multiple units and Class 426 electric multiple units. In addition "RegionalBahn" trains are also run by "SüdostBayernBahn" themselves on the following lines:
In total the network has 435 km of line and 88 stations, which are worked daily by 260 trains. Around 9.5 million passengers use "SüdostBayernBahn" trains annually.

It can result from inadequate nutritional intake of vitamin D coupled with inadequate sunlight exposure (in particular sunlight with adequate ultraviolet B rays), disorders that limit vitamin D absorption, and conditions that impair the conversion of vitamin D into active metabolites including certain liver, kidney, and hereditary disorders. Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and leads to bone softening diseases including rickets in children and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults.
Classifications.
Hypovitaminosis D is typically diagnosed by measuring the concentration in blood of the compound 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), which is a precursor to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). One 2008 review has proposed the following four categories for hypovitaminosis D:
Note that 1.0 nmol/L = 0.4 ng/mL for this compound. Other authors have suggested that a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 75–80 nmol/L (30–32 ng/mL) may be sufficient although a majority of healthy young people with comparatively extreme sun exposure did not reach this level in a study done in Hawaii.
Signs and symptoms.
Vitamin D deficiency is known to cause several bone diseases including:
The role of diet in the development of rickets was determined by Edward Mellanby between 1918–1920. In 1921 Elmer McCollum identified an anti-rachitic substance found in certain fats that could prevent rickets. Because the newly discovered substance was the fourth vitamin identified, it was called vitamin D. The 1928 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Adolf Windaus, who discovered the steroid 7-dehydrocholesterol, the precursor of vitamin D.
Prior to the fortification of milk products with vitamin D, rickets was a major public health problem. In the United States, milk has been fortified with 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D per quart since the 1930s, leading to a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.
Hypovitaminosis D is also considered a risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms in older persons. One study found low serum vitamin D concentrations in patients with schizophrenia, it is worth noting that the active metabolite of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) acts as a catalyst in glutathione production, and low glutathione levels have been implicated in several mental health disorders.
Pathophysiology.
Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, which results in decreased levels of serum total and ionized calcium levels. This hypocalcemia gives rise to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a homeostatic response aimed at maintaining, initially, serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Following this PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. PTH not only increases bone resorption, but it also leads to decreased urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton.
Risk factors.
Age.
The amount of vitamin D recommended for all infants, children, and adolescents has recently increased – from 400 to 600 IU per day. The Institute of Medicine released the Consensus Report on Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D on November 30, 2010. IOM recommends 600 IU of vitamin D a day for those 1-70 and 800 IU for those over 70 years of age. As of October 2008, the American Pediatric Association advises vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day (10 μg/d) from birth onwards. (1 IU Vitamin D is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol.) The daily dose of 400 IU is required to prevent rickets and possibly also a wide range of chronic nonskeletal diseases. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that pregnant or breastfeeding women consider taking 2000 IU/day, that all babies who are exclusively breastfed receive a supplement of 400 IU/day, and that babies living above 55 degrees latitude get 800 IU/day from October to April. Health Canada recommends 400IU/day (10 μg/d). Infant formula is generally fortified with vitamin D.
Malnutrition.
Although rickets and osteomalacia are now rare in Britain, there have been outbreaks in some immigrant communities in which osteomalacia sufferers included women with seemingly adequate daylight outdoor exposure wearing Western clothing. Having darker skin and reduced exposure to sunshine did not produce rickets unless the diet deviated from a Western omnivore pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, fish and eggs, and low intakes of high-extraction cereals. The dietary risk factors for rickets include abstaining from animal foods . Vitamin D deficiency remains the main cause of rickets among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and social customs and climatic conditions can prevent adequate UVB exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh where the disease occurs among older toddlers and children it has been attributed to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited access to dairy products. Rickets was formerly a major public health problem among the US population; in Denver where ultraviolet rays are approximately 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude almost two thirds of 500 children had mild rickets in the late 1920s. An increase in the proportion of animal protein in the 20th-century American diet coupled with increased consumption of milk fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.
Obesity.
Obese individuals have lower levels of the circulating form of vitamin D, probably because of reduced bioavailability, and are at higher risk of deficiency. To maintain blood levels of calcium, therapeutic vitamin D doses are sometimes administered (up to 100,000 IU or 2.5 mg daily) to patients who have had their parathyroid glands removed (most commonly renal dialysis patients who have had tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but also to patients with primary hyperparathyroidism) or with hypoparathyroidism. Patients with chronic liver disease or intestinal malabsorption disorders may also require larger doses of vitamin D (up to 40,000 IU or 1 mg (1000 micrograms) daily).
It has been argued that there is little evidence to support the use of high dose therapy to attain thresholds for vitamin D deficiency that greatly exceed widely used definitions of vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L), and for vitamin D insufficiency (25OHD < 20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L). Studies are potentially subject to confounding by frailty as people with poorer health are likely to remain indoors, receive less sun exposure, and have low 25OHD levels compared to their healthy peers (rather than low vitamin D levels causing ill health). Those leading sedentary lives are at increased risk of obesity, and increased fat mass is inversely associated with 25OHD levels. This association may confound the reported relationships between low vitamin D status and conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and cancer that occur more commonly in obesity. Confounding by health status can be powerful, as evidenced by the disparate results of randomised controlled trials and observational studies of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. (see Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)). Obesity remains a likely confounding factor for the associations between low 25(OH)D levels and poor health. Some continue to argue the reverse – that obese and sedentary people are at high risk of many diseases specifically because they have low serum 25(OH)D levels 
Sun exposure.
The use of sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 can theoretically inhibit more than 95% of vitamin D production in the skin. In practice, however, sunscreen is applied so as to have a negligible effect on vitamin D status. The vitamin D status of those in Australia and New Zealand is unlikely to have been affected by campaigns advocating sunscreen. Instead, wearing clothing is more effective at reducing the amount of skin exposed to UVB and reducing natural vitamin D synthesis.
Another risk factor arising from lack of sun exposure is clothing which covers a large portion of the skin. This clothing when worn on a consistent and regular basis, such as the burqa, is correlated with lower vitamin D levels and an increased prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.
Darker skin color.
It has been suggested the reduced pigmentation of light-skinned individuals results in higher vitamin D levels and that, because melanin acts like a sun-block, dark-skinned individuals, in particular, may require extra vitamin D to avoid deficiency at higher latitudes. The natural selection hypothesis suggests that lighter skin color evolved to optimise vitamin D production in extreme northern and southern latitudes. 
Rickets is sometimes due to genetic disorders such as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia and associated with consanguineous marriage, and possibly founder effect. In Kashmir, India patients with pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets had grossly raised 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Skin colour has also been associated with low 25(OH)D, especially in Africans living in countries with a temperate climate. For example 25-OHD under 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/l) in 44% of asymptomatic East African children living in Melbourne However a study of healthy young Ethiopians living in Addis Ababa (10 degrees N) found average 25(OH)D levels of 23.5nmol/L. A review of vitamin D in Africa gives the median levels for equatorial countries: Kenya 65.5 nmol/L and Democratic Republic of the Congo 65nmol/L, concluding that it remains to be established if associations between vitamin D status and health outcomes identified in Western countries can be replicated in African countries.
Vitamin D levels are approximately 30% higher in northern Europe than in central and southern Europe; higher vitamin D concentrations in northern countries may have a genetic basis. In a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies on serum 25(OH)D concentrations globally the levels averaged 54 nmol/l and were higher in women than men, and higher in Caucasians than in non-Caucasians. There was no trend in serum 25(OH)D level with latitude. African Americans often have a very low circulating 25(OH)D level. However, those of African descent have higher parathyroid hormone and 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol associated with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D than other ethnic groups; moreover, they have the greatest bone density and lowest risk of fragility fractures compared to other populations. Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization, and leads to bone softening diseases
Diagnosis.
The serum concentration of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D is typically used to determine vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced in the skin as well as that acquired from the diet, and has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days. It does not, however, reveal the amount of vitamin D stored in other body tissues. The level of serum 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is not usually used to determine vitamin D status because it has a short half-life of 15 hours and is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate, such that it does not decrease significantly until vitamin D deficiency is already well advanced. **People with a granuloma disease such as sarcoidosis can have a high level of serum 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D but show a low testing level of serum concentration of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D because the granulomas, when active, produce serum 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D. The body is then protecting itself from a calcium dump ( high calcium level) by having a low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. 
One study found that vitamin D3 raised 25-hydroxy-vitamin D blood levels more than did vitamin D2, but this difference has been adequately disproved to allow reasonable assumption that D2 and D3 are equal for maintaining 25-hydroxy-vitamin D status.
There has been variability in results of laboratory analyses of the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. Falsely low or high values have been obtained depending on the particular test or laboratory used. Beginning in July 2009 a standard reference material became available which should allow laboratories to standardise their procedures.
There is some disagreement concerning the exact levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D needed for good health. A level lower than 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) is associated with the most severe deficiency diseases: rickets in infants and children, and osteomalacia in adults. A concentration above 15 ng/ml (37.5 nmol/L) is generally considered adequate for those in good health. Levels above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L) are proposed by some as desirable for achieving optimum health, but there is not yet enough evidence to support this.
Levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D that are consistently above 200 ng/mL (500 nmol/L) are thought to be potentially toxic, although data from humans are sparse. In animal studies levels up to 400 ng/mL (1,000 nmol/L) were not associated with toxicity. Vitamin D toxicity usually results from taking supplements in excess. Hypercalcemia is typically the cause of symptoms, and levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D above 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) are usually found, although in some cases 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels may appear to be normal. It is recommended to periodically measure serum calcium in individuals receiving large doses of vitamin D.
In overweight persons increased fat mass is inversely associated with 25(OH)D levels. This association may confound the reported relationships between low vitamin D status and conditions which occur more commonly in obesity as the circulating 25(OH)D underestimates their total body stores. However, as vitamin D is fat-soluble, excess amounts can be stored in fat tissue and used during winter months, when sun exposure is limited. 
A study of highly sun-exposed (tanned) healthy young skateboarders and surfers in Hawaii found levels below the proposed higher minimum of 30 ng/ml in 51% of the subjects. The highest 25(OH)D concentration was around 60 ng/ml (150nmol/L). A similar <using the same data>study in Hawaii found a range of (11–71 ng/mL) in a population with prolonged extensive skin exposure while as part of the same study Wisconsin breastfeeding mothers were given supplements. The range of circulating 25(OH)D levels in women in the supplementated group was from 12–77 ng/mL. It is noteworthy that the levels in the supplemented population in Wisconsin were higher than the sun exposed group in Hawaii (which again included surfers because it was the same data set).
Another study of African Americans found that blood levels of 25(OH)D decreased linearly with increasing African ancestry, the decrease being 2.5-2.75 nmol/L per 10% increase in African ancestry. Sunlight and diet were 46% less effective in raising these levels among subjects with high African ancestry than among those with low/medium African ancestry. It could be possible that vitamin-D metabolism differs by ethnicity.
Nutritional factors.
Cancer.
A US National Cancer Institute study analyzed data from the third national Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the relationship between levels of circulating vitamin D in the blood and cancer mortality in a group of 16,818 participants aged 17 and older. It found no support for an association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality. Unlike other studies, this one was carried out prospectively meaning that participants were followed looking forward and the researchers used actual blood tests to measure the amount of vitamin D in blood, rather than trying to infer vitamin D levels from potentially inaccurate predictive models.
The molecular basis for thinking that vitamin D has the potential to prevent cancer lies in its role as a nuclear transcription factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and a wide range of cellular mechanisms central to the development of cancer. These effects may be mediated through vitamin D receptors expressed in cancer cells. Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, although a study of 78 Turkish breast cancer patients showed that the prevalence of the VDR Taq I and Bsm I alleles and the genotype frequencies in patients with breast cancer was similar to that in the normal population. Impairment of the VDR-mediated gene expression is thought to alter mammary gland development or function and may predispose cells to malignant transformation. Women with homozygous FOK1 mutations in the VDR gene had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with the women who did not. FOK1 mutation has also been associated with decreasing bone mineral density which in turn may be associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer. Research is also being done on the use of calcitriol in the medical treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Correlation of the vitamin D levels of a population with the solar irradiance to which they are exposed can be confounded by other factors such as age, gender, skin pigmentation, latitude, sunscreen use, and clothing. Moreover, there are genetic factors involved with cancer incidence and mortality which are more common in northern latitudes. 
A 2005 metastudy found correlations between serum levels of vitamin D and cancer, drawing from a meta-analysis of 63 observational studies of vitamin D status. The authors suggested that intake of an additional 1,000 international units (IU) (or 25 micrograms) of vitamin D daily reduced an individual's colon cancer risk by 50%, and breast and ovarian cancer risks by 30%. Low levels of vitamin D in serum have been correlated with breast cancer disease progression and bone metastases. 
Another 2006 study found that taking the U.S. RDA of vitamin D (400 IU per day) cut the risk of pancreatic cancer by 43% in a sample of more than 120,000 people from two long-term health surveys. However, in male smokers, a 3-fold increased risk for pancreatic cancer in the highest compared to lowest quintile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration has been found.
A randomized intervention study involving 1,200 women, published in June 2007, reports that vitamin D supplementation (1,100 international units (IU)/day) resulted in a 60% reduction in cancer incidence, during a four-year clinical trial, rising to a 77% reduction for cancers diagnosed "after" the first year (and therefore excluding those cancers more likely to have originated prior to the vitamin D intervention). The study was criticized on several grounds including lack of data, use of statistical techniques and comparison with a self-selected (i.e. non-randomized) observational study that found long term convergence of breast cancer incidence The author's response provided the required data, explained their statistical usage and commented that even if the vitamin D merely delayed the appearance of cancer (which they did not believe, based on other studies), that that was still a considerable benefit.
A study by Cedric F. Garland and Frank C. Garland of the University of California, San Diego analyzed the blood from 25,000 volunteers from Washington County, Maryland, finding that those with the highest levels of Calcifediol had one-fifth the risk of colon cancer compared to typical rates.
