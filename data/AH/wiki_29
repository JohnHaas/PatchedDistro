History.
Kattanam was merged with Mankavu (Kavu with mango trees) and there was only a very few Hindu families were living in this place including Mankavil Gurunathanmaar those who were conducting mantravadham (Black Magic) and believed to had supernatural powers. The story of Kattanam is related to a Yakshi (Brahma Rakshas) lived in Mankavu was a folkloric vampire . She was a Brahmin lady who was living in the same place centuries before the mankavu was formed. She had found murdered in her tharavattu kulam (family Pond) together with her unborn child. And it is also believed that the entire Brahmin family who were living there destroyed and centuries after Mankavu formed in the same place. The Brahmin lady was reborn into a Yakshi, waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood. It is also believed that after stopping the yakshi of Panayannarkavu, kadamattathu Kathanar (a priest with supernatural power) has visited Kattanam to stop the yakshi but he couldn’t succeed and returned back. Even the karmas (actions) of Mankavil Gurunadhanmar’s were turned against them, their powers couldn’t withstand against yakshi and the unnatural death of their family members increased day by day. It has been found in devaprashnam (ascertaining the lord's will) that the land has to be sold (for prize) to someone to get rid of the yakshi as well as the curse on them. Kattanam was very fertile land but were not in use due to the fear of the yakshi in Mankavu. Finally a priest from Kannankara family (Fr.Geevarghese also known as Velangattachan) has come forward and purchased the entire Mankavu for one Rasi. He arrested the yakshi with his Divine power and the yakshi requested him to install her to a paala tree (Alstonia Scholaris) which the priest refused and her soul sent permanently to rest in peace. From then the Velangattachan known famous as Mankavilachan, he destroyed the entire Mankavu and removed the fear from the public, made the place suitable for Katta (paddy with grains) production by Anam (blessing) from God. 
Later many of the Christian families migrated to Kattanam and together with the existing and migrated Hindu families they started cultivation in Kattanam and became best farmers.
Because of the good fertility of the paddy land, the production of katta’s (paddy with grains) has increased, accumulated and traded from here, “Katta-Anam” means “paddy with grains - Blessed” and since this place is known and called as Kattanam.

1974 smallpox epidemic in India

The 1974 smallpox epidemic of India was one of the worst smallpox epidemics of 20th century.
At least 15,000 people died of smallpox between January to May 1974, mainly in the Indian states of Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. There were thousands who survived but were disfigured or blinded. India reported 61,482 cases of smallpox to WHO in these five months. India had over 86% of the world's smallpox cases in 1974, primarily due to this epidemic. By 1980, smallpox was certified as being eradicated from the world.
It occurred during the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication program, and was important to the project because Indians considered smallpox to be a routine fact of life. Donald Henderson, who was a U.S. Public Health Services Officer stationed in New Delhi, said that "If this interest and concern about ending smallpox can be maintained for the next few months, it's all over. We don't think we're overconfident, but everything looks good. By June of 1975, we hope we'll be finished with smallpox in Asia."

An Agenda for Peace

An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, more commonly known simply as An Agenda for Peace, is a report written for the United Nations by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992. In it, Boutros-Ghali responds to a request by the UN Security Council for an "analysis and recommendations" to strengthen peacemaking and peace-keeping. The document outlines the way Boutros-Ghali felt the UN should respond to conflict in the post-Cold War world.
Recognizing the limitations of peacekeeping, especially as such efforts were becoming prevalent in the early 1990s, the UN Security Council convened in 1992 in a first-time meeting of heads of state. The 15 members finished the conference by issuing a statement calling on then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to write a report recommending future reforms. In their statement, the heads-of-state recognized that, “The absence of war and military conflicts amongst States does not in itself ensure international peace and security. The non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields have become threats to peace and security. The United Nations membership as a whole, working through the appropriate bodies, needs to give the highest priority to the solution of these matters.”
The Security Council saw what many critics of peacekeeping have suggested, and some recent failures had made obvious: peacekeeping alone, as then practiced, was not enough to ensure lasting peace.
Boutros-Ghali submitted his response some months later, in the form of "An Agenda for Peace". In it, he outlined a number of additional processes of preventative diplomacy the international community could use before peacekeeping, or simultaneously. He also suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced Chapter VII of the UN Charter to justify military involvement without the consent of both parties. Previously, these concepts had not been formally addressed by the UN's leadership. However, "An Agenda for Peace"’s most significant contribution to the modern understanding of peace is its introduction of the concept of “post-conflict peacebuilding.” Boutros-Ghali defines “post-conflict peace-building” as “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.” 
The concept of post-conflict peacebuilding has been especially important in the academic discipline of peace and conflict studies. It has been adopted by a number of scholars to suggest a framework for peace that addresses not only the latent forms of physical violence, but also aspects of a society that are structurally violent, and could lead to a re-emergence of fighting (see the discussion of positive peace in the article on peace and conflict studies).

Leibniz Institute of European History

Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) in Mainz, Germany is an independent research institute that carries out and promotes historical research on the foundations of Europe in Early Modern and Modern times.
History of the Institute.
The Institute was founded in 1950 by initiative of the French military government in Germany, so as to overcome historically grown prejudices and obstacles to a peaceful coexistence of European ethnic and religious communities by a more accurate knowledge of such historical developments. Therefore, the IEG consists of a section on the history of occidental religion ("Abteilung fuer Abendlaendische Religionsgeschichte") and a section on political and social history ("Abteilung fuer Universalgeschichte").
Current Research Programme.
The IEG's research on the historical foundations of Europe considers both integrating and antagonistic movements and forces shaping the geographic continent as well as the cultural context of Europe over centuries and setting up its distinct characteristics in contrast to the other continents. Research at the IEG thus targets pan-European and partly European communicative connections originating in bilateral and multilateral transfer processes. Their protagonists did not necessarily have to be aware of their taking part in "Europe-wide" interrelations. The religious and confessional developments of these transfer processes are one important focus of research at the IEG.
Also, research on the foundations of Europe maps the history of conscious reflections on Europe and Europeans, and analyses attempts at political unification, existing political plans for Europe, ideal conceptions and utopian visions of Europe – always including anti-European ideas in the picture. An integral element of this approach is the history of historiography on Europe.
This conceptual formulation includes a reflexion of theory and methods of historical research on Europe. The Leibniz Institute of European History questions the focus of interest of 'European' approaches and reflects the underlying ideological propositions in historical research on the history of Europe.
Research Areas.
For the years of 2007 to 2011, four areas of programme-bound research have been established that work inter-departmentally and include fellows into their programme. They are connected by an area of cross-departmental research European History Online / EGO and complemented by an area of non-programme-bound research ( graphic presentation). The four programme-bound research areas are set up for five years. They publish their research results in the publication series of the IEG and in other media, win the support of third-party funds, and analyse basic research results, also contributing to basic research with new data and source material:
Europa als Herausforderung für Politik, Gesellschaft und Kirche
Kommunikation und Transformation in Religion und Gesellschaft
Raumbezogene Forschungen zur Geschichte Europas seit 1500
Wertewandel und Geschichtsbewusstsein
Research Fellowships.
Since 1950, the IEG has awarded doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships for research stays in Mainz. It also welcomes international researchers as fellows in residence with external funding. The IEG states that its research fellowship programme combines research, training and international networking. Fellows can pursue their individual research projects. They discuss problems and methods of European historical research in an interdisciplinary and international surrounding. According to their special fields and interests, they are invited to participate in the academic activities of the Institute. In cooperation with its international partners, the Institute supports the exchange of fellows to embed them in a network of European historical research.
Publications
The IEG edits a monograph serial and a serial for conference reports, the latter being published online or in print. It runs a server for historical digital maps (IEG-MAPS) and publishes European peace treaties of the early modern period.

Adolf Riedl

Adolf Riedl (February 2, 1921-September 6, 2003) was a German businessman.
After the Second World War, having been driven from Sudetenland and enduring Russian captivity, Riedl, together with his sister, Marianne Sommerer, founded a company to produce knitwear in Untersteinach. The company was called the Riedl-Gruppe, and it focussed on sports textiles. On 31 August 1947, he founded Adolf Riedl GmbH & Co. KG and Aritex GmbH in 1975, to market sports and leisure fashions. In 1980 he launched the Sunflair brand and, in 1983, he acquired the “Olympia” brand, registered for the past 75 years.
Riedl promoted several sports and clubs, especially in Bayreuth, for which he was awarded the Silver Medal of the town of Bayreuth in 1981. In 1996 he was awarded the Cross of Merit with Ribbon by the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Following a stroke in January 1989, Adolf Riedl withdrew from the company and mostly from public life.
On 1 August 2004, the Riedl-Gruppe was renamed. The earlier Sunflair, Opera (swimwear), Olympia (sports articles) and Sunmarin companies are now brands of Adolf Riedl GmbH & Co. KG.

JWH-250

JWH-250 or (1-pentyl-3-(2-methoxyphenylacetyl)indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of 11nM at CB1 and 33nM at CB2. Unlike many of the older JWH series compounds, this compound does not have a naphthalene ring, instead occupying this position with a 2'-methoxy-phenylacetyl group, making JWH-250 a representative member of a new class of cannabinoid ligands. Other 2'-substituted analogues such as the methyl, chloro and bromo compounds are also active and somewhat more potent.
History.
JWH-250 was discovered by, and named after the researcher Dr. John W. Huffman. He created JWH-250 and a number of other compounds to research the structure and function of the endocannabinoid system of mammals. 
Samples of JWH-250 were first identified in May 2009 by the German Federal Criminal Police, as an ingredient in new generation "herbal smoking blends" that had been released since the banning of the original ingredients (C8)-CP 47,497 and JWH-018. An ELISA immunoassay technique for detecting JWH-250 in urine has been reported.

Indian and jackrabbits

Indian and jackrabbits is a two-player abstract strategy board game from the Tiwa tribe of Taos, New Mexico. A similar game with a slightly different board is also played by the Tohono O'odham tribe of Arizona. From the outset, these games look like hunt games similar to Catch the Hare, the Fox games of Europe, and the tiger and leopard games of Asia, because they use very similar boards, and the game mechanics (movement abilities and capturing rules) are the same, and the number of pieces each player controls is different. However, they are not the same games, because the goals are completely different. The goal of the one Indian is to capture just one of the twelve jackrabbits. The goal of the jackrabbits is to move themselves safely onto the other side of the board mirroring their initial positions. 
The game is unrelated to any other despite similarities in board design and mechanics. Indian and jackrabbits may actually be a game isolate.
The game was described by Stewart Culin in his book "Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill" (1898) on page 798.
Goal.
The Indian wins if it captures one jackrabbit. The Jackrabbits win if all of them move to the other side of the board mirroring their initial positions.
Equipment.
A 5 x 5 square grid is used for the Tigua version. An Alquerque board is used for the Tohono O'odham version, which also consist of a 5 x 5 square grid but with additional diagonal lines. There is one Indian piece that is black, and twelve jackrabbit pieces that are white.

Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center

Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center is the solar parabolic-trough component of an integrated solar combined cycle, or ISCC 1150 MW plant, in western Martin County, Florida, just north of Indiantown, built by Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). The ISCC plant is part of Martin Plant site which consists of 5 units. Unit 1 & Unit 2 are 800 MW steam electric generating units that use natural gas and low-sulfur residual oil. Unit 3 & Unit 4 are 500 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle units. Unit 8 is a natural gas fired 4-on-1 combined cycle unit with a nominal capacity of 1150 MW. Light oil is used as backup. Unit 8, placed into commercial operation in 2005, is integrated with the solar plant. Unit 8 features four 170 MW gas turbines, one 470 MW steam turbine, and a single condenser and cooling tower
The single solar field circuit heats 4 steam generators, after each gas turbine. The Martin solar thermal facility is designed to provide steam for FPL's existing Martin Unit 8 combined cycle unit, thus reducing FPL's use of natural gas. No additional capacity (MW) will result from the operation of the solar thermal facility.
The Solar Energy Center has an array of approximately 190,000-mirror parabolic troughs on about of the Martin County plant.
The solar collectors feed heat to the existing steam plant, generating electricity at a rate of 155,000 MW·h per year. The 2012 solar derived production was about 89,000 MW·h of power, according to records filed with the state’s Public Service Commission. That’s 42% less than what was projected when the plant got approval.
Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project. 
Construction began in 2008 and was completed by the end of 2010. 
FPL expects the $476 million 
solar plant to reduce the combined-cycle power plant's natural gas consumption by 1.3 billion cubic feet (37 billion m³) per year. 
Over the 30-year life of the project, this is expected to save $178 million in fuel cost and reduce carbon emissions by 2.75 million tons.
Excess pressure and a release of operating fluid led to the plant being shut down for four months in 2011 for cleanup and testing.
As of , no additional concentrated solar plants are planned for Florida, although in 2007 FPL had planned on building a 300 MW fresnel solar thermal plant.

Mellrichstadt station

Mellrichstadt station is a railway station operated by the Deutsche Bahn in the Lower Franconian town of Mellrichstadt in Germany.
General.
The station is located on the Erfurt–Schweinfurt railway in southern Germany and, since the closure of Mühlfeld station, is the last stop on the Bavarian side of the border with Thuringia. From 1898, the station was the departure point for the Mellrichstadt–Fladungen railway which ran scheduled services until 1987. Since then the line has become a museum railway worked by the ‘’Rhön-Zügle’’ (“Little Rhön Train”).
History.
Rail services began on the Meiningen–Schweinfurt route in 1874 and on the branch line to Fladungen in 1898. As a consequence of the division of Germany the Erfurt to Schweinfurt line was cut in 1945. From then on Mellrichstadt became the terminus for trains from Würzburg and Schweinfurt. Until the 1980s there were direct connexions from Munich Hauptbahnhof to Mellrichstadt; since then however the station has only been served by direct trains from Würzburg and Schweinfurt. Railway operations ceased on the Mellrichstadt–Fladungen branch in 1987. After the reunification of Germany the gap between Bavaria and Thuringia was closed and, after 46 years, Mellrichstadt is once again a through station. Since 1996 the Fladungen branch has been reactivated as a museum railway, services to all the way through to Mellrichstadt beginning again in 2000.
Services.
In 2007 Mellrichstadt station was served every two hours by the Mainfranken-Thüringen Express from Würzburg to Erfurt and by the Unterfranken Shuttle from Schweinfurt to Meiningen on the Werra Railway. That results in what is virtually an hourly service between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m. Mellrichstadt station is also the departure point for numerous bus lines belonging to "Omnibusverkehr Franken" (OVF) which link up a large part of the Bavarian Rhön - a region of low mountains which extends across the border into Hesse and Thuringia.

Log pod Mangartom

Log pod Mangartom (; sometimes "Log pod Mangrtom", ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Bovec in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It comprises Gornji Log and Spodnji Log, lies within Triglav National Park, and is surrounded by 15 peaks with an elevation of over 2000 m, giving it a unique atmosphere and making it an attractive starting point for hikers.
The road from Bovec to Tarvisio over the Predil Pass and the Predel Viaduct (the viaduct has the longest arch (85 m) in the Alps) runs through the settlement. Between Gornji Log and Spodnji Log is the entrance to the 4.5 km (2.8 mi.) Štoln drainage tunnel leading through "Ovčja gora" of the Kolovrat Range to the former lead mine in Cave del Predil, Italy. The tunnel was opened in 1903 and was used for a railway during World War I and later for transport of miners and political refugees escaping from the Communist Yugoslavia.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Stephen. It was built at the end of the 18th century and later rebuilt.

Daniel O'Rourke (politician)

Daniel "Dan" O'Rourke (died 4 August 1968) was an Irish politician and teacher, based in Castlerea, County Roscommon. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) to the 2nd Dáil at the 1921 elections for the Mayo South–Roscommon South constituency. He said later that his election came as a surprise to him, as he did not know he had been nominated and did not want to be. Although he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he voted in favour of it, as he believed the alternative of further war was worse. He was re-elected unopposed as a pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TD at the 1922 general election. He resigned his seat on 29 November 1922. He stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the September 1927 general election but was not elected. 
He was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD at the 1932 general election for the Roscommon constituency but lost his seat at the 1933 general election. He was re-elected at the 1937 and 1938 general elections but again lost his seat at the 1943 general election. He was re-elected at the 1944 and 1948 general elections but once again lost his seat at the 1951 general election. At the 1951 Seanad election, he was elected on the Labour Panel. He stood unsuccessfully at the 1954 and 1957 general elections.
He was President of the Gaelic Athletic Association from 1946 to 1949.

Cock-a-Doodle Dandy

Cock-a-Doodle Dandy is a 1949 play by Irish dramatist Seán O'Casey.
Regarded by O'Casey as his best play, this is a darkly comic fantasy in which a magic cockerel appears in the parish of Nyadnanave and forces the characters to make choices about the way they live their lives. It is a parable of mid-century Irish rural life, symbolising the struggle between repression and liberty. Initially it was regarded as anti-Catholic and was banned from professional public performance in the UK by the Lord Chamberlain. It was also suppressed in Ireland and the USA. 
In performance.
The World premiere of the play took place at the People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1949. This performance was reviewed in the Irish Times newspaper on 14 December 1949. Under the headline "A Play to Arouse both Anger and Pity", it was described as "a performance of infinitely better quality than I had expected to lie in the capacity of mere Anglo-Saxons, unlearned in the tricky inflexions of O'Casey's Nyadnanave."

The Brazil Open or Aberto do Brasil is an annual golf tournament held in Brazil. It was founded in 1945, and was an event on the Tour de las Américas on several occasions, most recently in 2005. It is now an event on the PGA Tour Latinoamérica.

<doc id="20624689" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20624689" title="Sri Chirakkakavu Bhagavthi Temple">
Sri Chirakkakavu Bhagavthi Temple

Sree Chirakkakavu Bhavathi Temple is one of the oldest Devi Temples in North Kerala. 
The presiding deity of this temple is the goddess Kaali, who is worshipped in three forms, or Thrigunaathmika. The temple was built by the king of Kolathiri- Chirakkkal Raja after the swayambhoo of the goddess in Koduvally River, and so became renowned as Sree Chirakkakavu. 
According to established belief, the goddess Kaali appeared in the azhimugham of Vamal with her parivaras(retinue), in the palace where the river meets the sea. She assumed the form of a divine fish. The place is now known as Vamal, the Sree Moolasthana of Sree Chirakkakavu Bhagavathi. 
Chiirakkal Raja visited the palace and bowed to the goddess. The king then built the temple on top of Illikkunnu, believed to be the thapovan of an earlier era. The temple is surrounded by kavu or groves of trees.
Other deities (Upadevathas).
Guntur Kotta vaanavar, Ilankarumakan and Poothadi are in a single shrine near the temple.
Outside the Nalambalamt there is a Sarppakkavu (Snake Shrine) in the north-west corner of the temple which contains Nagaraja, Nagakanyaka and Chithrkoodam. 
Festival.
The temple festival is celebrated every year on days 9-12 of the month of medaom which usually falls on April 22 to 25th. 
On Medom 9th the thantrik poojas and Uthsavabali is observed. In the evening the Uthsalva kolam (Thidambu) is taken out of the temple as Ezhunnallathu by the temple priest. This occasion is the only time where the goddess comes out of the temple in full alankaras in Ulthasava Thidambu.
Theyyam.
This is the next three-day festival. The four manifestations of the goddess, Chorakalathil Bhagavathi, Puthiya Bhagavathi and Cheriya Thampuratty, are the daughters of the mother goddess and Valiya Thampuratty. Guntoor Kotta vanavan, Ilankarumakan, Poothadi are the other male Theyyams here. On Medom 10th the Nattathira is celebrated here. On 11 th Medom Ariyalavu is observed. This is a practice of giving rice, pulses and coconut oils to the all concerned communities to the kavu. This custom recalls the riches of bygone times. 
In the olden days, the Temple owned land from Vamla To Kali. In the morning of 11th medom Valaiya Thampuratty visits all devotees in the village (hosuses comes under Anchukandy Parambu) and blesses the devotees. 
Kalasams come from various parts of the villages to make offerings to the devi. Motha Kalasam and Vaikalasam have the right to enter to the temple first. By the early hours of 12th Medom the Theyyams start to come to the Thirumuttam in this order: Guntoor Kotta Vanavar, Chorakalathil Bhagavathi and Puthiya bhgagavathi. It is considered a blessing when a few drops of rain sweep through as Chaorakalthil bhagavthi theyyam appears on the courtyard of the temple. A Mulla Mala (Jasmine garland) is the traditional offering to Chorakkalathil Bhagavathi.
Thirdly comes the Theyaam of Puthiya Bhagavathi (Theethira), The theyaam comes with the fire as ornaments and blesses the devotees. 
By the morning of 12th Medom the theyyam of Ilankarumankan and Poothadi appears on the courtyard of the temple. The theyyam is of divine war between the two. This theyyam makes us recollect the thought of Bali–Sugreeva war.
Then Thampuratty comes out into the courtyard. The Aattam of Thampuratty with her divine sword is a very rare sight which gives her devotees a life’s blessings. Then the Cheriya Thampuratty appears on the courtyard of the temple with beautiful white hair and other decorations. Then the Thampuratty with Thirumudy and her daughter, Cheriaya Champuratty travel around the temple, followed by the kalasalams and devotees in procession.

The Growise Champion Novice Chase is a Grade 1 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Punchestown over a distance of about 3 miles and 1 furlong (5,029 metres), and during its running there are seventeen fences to be jumped. The race is for novice chasers, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Punchestown Festival in late April or early May.
The present version of the race was introduced in 2007, when it was sponsored by Ellier Developments. There had been two similar events in the preceding years – a Grade 2 race over a shorter distance (also sponsored by Ellier), and a handicap race over the same length. The new version was backed by Boylesports in 2009, and by Growise in 2010.
The Growise Champion Novice Chase is Ireland's equivalent of the RSA Chase at Cheltenham, but no horse has won both races since 2007.

Galiot Mandat de Grancey

Antoine Jean Galiot Mandat (7 May 1731, in the outskirts of Paris – 10 August 1792, on the steps of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris), known as the Marquis de Mandat, was a much-admired French nobleman, general and politician. A knight and lord of Berny-en-Santerre and Les Pins in the Vendômois, he became a colonel in the Gardes-Françaises, then succeeded La Fayette as commander of the National Guard in 1792. He was assassinated by insurgents (possibly Jean Antoine Rossignol) in the events of the 10 August during the French Revolution.
Family.
Heraldic arms.
"Azure, with a lion or; au chef d'argent, chargé d'une hure de sanglier de sable, défendue d'argent, accostée de deux roses de gueules".
History.
The family had formerly been a noble family in the Limousin, attested since 1339. Galiot Mandat, lord of Aigrefoin, was received as king's secretary for provisions on 31 October 1572 on the resignation of Louis Guybert and his father. Its descendents were in two branches, of which the elder died out when Antoine-Galiot Mandat, conseiller to the parlement de Metz by letters dated May 1640, received as conseiller to the parlement de Paris on 14 July 1649, died unmarried and without issue. The other branch, known as the barons of Nully (in Champagne), "has continued until our days and distinguish itself for many generations by its devotion to the monarchy".
Antoine Galiot Mandat was the son of Galiot V Mandat (1683–1755), Maître des Requêtes ordinaire de l'Hôtel du Roi, received to the Grand Conseil on 6 March 1720. His mother, Marie Anne Cherouvrier des Grassières, was sister-in-law to marquis Louis-Urbain-Aubert de Tourny, Intendant of the Généralité de Limoges. The king confirmed his father in the land and seigneurie of Les Pins, in the north east of Touraine on 13 June 1727.
Life.
Before 1789.
He was baptised at Église Saint-Sulpice. He served in the First Company of Musketeers of the Garde ordinaire du Roi from 26 November 1753 to 2 March 1755, as enseigne à drapeau to the regiment of the Gardes-Françaises (1755–57), then as Enseigne à Pique (from 5 June 1757) and sous-lieutenant (23 December 1759) in the same regiment.
Antoine Galiot Mandat married Angélique Simone Boucher, daughter of a conseiller to the Parlement de Paris on 21 January 1758. They had two children – Alexandre, ensign to the regiment of the Gardes-Françaises, and a daughter married to a conseiller to the Parlement de Paris. Antoine's father split his fortune between his children on his death in 6 April 1762.
In 1789, he left the Gardes-Françaises, at the rank of captain or "colonel retiré du service", according to La Chenaye-Desbois. He was also a knight of the ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis. He tried in vain to become a gentleman of the court, but had to renounce his place despite his annual rent of 180,000 francs.
In the pre-revolutionary period Marquis Antoine-Jean-Galiot de Mandat was loved by everyone in Les Pins, in the north east of Touraine, even by those who would soon lead Revolutionary efforts in the area. He is known in history as "a noble who embraced the revolutionary party" and thus his behaviour corresponded to that of his neighbours and peasants.
After 1789.
In 1789 Antoine Galliot Mandat was aged 58. He was head of the 4th Legion of the National Guard. He lived at rue Chapon, n° 3. Brave and loyal to his oath to defend the inviolability of the head of state and the head of state's house, he supported the new ideas but remained highly devoted to Louis XVI. He inspired great confidence in the royal court (in the words of Adolphe Thiers "to the cause by his energy and his lights". His remarks leave no doubt as to his fidelity to the king:
His ideas favouring a constitutional monarchy arose from those close to the king. Madame Campan, whose father was a friend of Mandat, answered Louis XVI's question "Who is this Mandat who at this moment commands the National Guard?" by saying "Sire, he is the most faithful of your subjects, but with much loyalty and very little intelligence. He is in the interests of the Constitution.". The National Guard's attitude in 1792 was less loyal than Mandat's, though it varied from battalion to battalion:
Guy de Rambaud also wrote that "the bataillon des Filles-Saint-Thomas, bataillon des Petits-Pères, bataillon de Henri IV and bataillon des Grands Augustins, protected us from brigands and rebels".
Antoine Galiot Mandat "always offered his head as a guarantee of the king's good intentions", but after the flight to Varennes and due to revolutionary propaganda he could no longer succeed in convincing all the national guards. The battalions of the Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau faubourgs were openly hostile to him from 1789 onwards and in the other battalions the poorest guards were favourable to Jacobin ideas.
Mandat replaces La Fayette.
He replaced La Fayette shortly before 10 August 1792 as commander in chief of the National Guard. La Fayette had been impeached as a victim of false rumours as to his conduct and impeached. This proposition, backed by Brissot and heatedly fought by Vincent-Marie Viénot de Vaublanc and Quatremère de Quincy, was repulsed by a majority of 406 votes against 224.
Because of the vote, the deputies who had provoked him were assaulted, beaten and threatened with death after the session had ended, until the National Guard came to their rescue. According to Hippolyte Taine: As to de Vaublanc, the main defender of La Fayette, he was attacked three times, had taken the precaution not to go home but angry mobs showed up at his house, shouting that "four eighty people will perish at their hands, and he would be first." Twelve men who had climbed to into his apartment and rummaged around also ransacked nearby houses, and, unable to catch himself, looked for his family; they warned that if he returned to his home, he would be killed. La Fayette tendered his resignation. 
The assault on the Tuileries was set for August 10. The people of Marseille were given gunpowder and bullets by the municipality – a fact known to the court.
Mandat, whose side was outnumbered, intended to defend the courts by posting some Swiss and grenadiers. He even amassed the National Guard in the garden and placed cannons on Pont Neuf and St. John's Arcade, behind the Hôtel de Ville, to stop the rioters' descent from the suburbs.
After his death.
The sumptuous hôtel du Président Duret, 67 rue de Lille, belonged to him in 1792 and remained in his son's ownership until 1797 despite Galiot Mandat's assassination.

Margaret Barker

Margaret Barker (born 1944), a Methodist preacher, studied theology at the University of Cambridge, after which she has devoted her life to research in ancient Christianity. 
She has developed an approach to biblical studies known as "Temple Theology".
She was president of the "Society for Old Testament Study" in 1998, and in July 2008 she was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Temple Theology.
"Temple Theology" is an approach to biblical studies developed by Margaret Barker in her books starting from "The Great High Priest" (2003) and "Temple Theology" (2004). This approach identifies some elements of the theology and worship of the Jewish First Temple that endured beyond Josiah's reform and survived in both early Christian theology and liturgy and in gnosticism. 
According to this view "Temple Theology" has been influential in molding the roots of Christianity as well as, or even more than, Hellenistic or synagogue culture. 
According to Barker, the main ideas of "Temple Theology" are the following:
Margaret Barker works from all the available sources (the Hebrew Bible, the LXX, the Dead Sea scrolls, the New Testament, the Jewish and Christian Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Gnostic texts, and other early writings and artwork). According to her, "Sola Scriptura" has hindered rather than helped the understanding of Christianity.

The Thai have defeated the Khmer empire in the mid-18th century and taken the lovely Princess Tarawatee prisoner. Seeing her beauty, the Thai ruler weds her, but then later sees her in the arms of another man. He sentences them both to death – one through beheading and the other to be burnt to death. While waiting for her execution, the Princess hears from a fellow inmate that in a small village not too far away lives a young woman called Daow who is her exact physical double. As flames start to burn around her, the Princess sends her spirit to inhabit the body of Daow, but just as her spirit zips off to find her double, Daow is killed by a magical spell. In this manner the spirit ends up inhabiting a deceased body that soon springs to life to everyone's amazement. The body is now partly Daow's but also partly a vengeful ghost. Daow leads a normal life during the day, but at night a voracious greed overcomes her and she desperately needs to feed on blood and entrails. Thus her head slips away from the body to satisfy her insatiable hunger. This soon causes consternation among the villagers.

Maison militaire du roi de France

The maison militaire du roi de France ("military household of the king of France") was the military part of the royal household or Maison du Roi in France under the Ancien Régime. The term only appeared in 1671, though such a gathering of units pre-dates this. Like the rest of the royal household, the military household was under the authority of the secretary of state for the Maison du Roi, but it depended on the ordinaire des guerres (controlled by the Secretary of State for War) for its budget. Under Louis XIV, these two officers of state were given joint command of the military household.
Composition.
The household was akin to the Household Division of the British Army in that it comprised a number of both cavalry and infantry units, serving as the sovereign's personal guard as well as elite troops during war. Some of its units were limited to gentlemen, like the gardes du corps and musketeers, and units drawn from the elite of the army, made up of commoners. However, it was impossible for commoners to rise to officer rank in units of the military household. On the field of battle, the "Maison du Roi" fought around the king and the "porte-cornette blanche" (the king's white standard), although the corps also fought in the absence of the king. The "Maison du Roi" made up — along with the "Cavalerie d'ordonnance", the six "Vieux" and the six "Petits-Vieux" — the only permanent army of the kingdom.
Corps.
Over the years, the "Maison du Roi" has included the following corps:
History.
Far from being simply a ceremonial corps, the "Maison du Roi" participated in all the military campaigns of the 16th and 17th centuries. 
Under Francis I.
The oldest of the regiments of the Maison du Roi was the Garde Écossaise, formed in 1440, and traced its ultimate origins to the Scots forces brought to France in 1419 by John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, to fight against the English in the Hundred Years' War. 
Buchan's original company was divided in two, one part becoming the 1st (or Scottish) Company of the Life Guards ("Gardes du Corps"), the other becoming the senior company of Gendarmes. A second, French, company of Life Guards was formed by Louis XI in 1474 and the third by Louis in 1479. The fourth company, again French, was raised by Francis I in 1516. These companies existed until the French Revolution when they were disbanded. 
In 1567, during the "surprise of Meaux", the royal family escaped capture by Protestant troops of the prince de Condé by the intervention of the Cent-Suisses. 
Francis I-Louis XIII.
During the final period of the French Wars of Religion, Henry IV wished to provide guards for christening of the Dauphin (later Louis XIII). He created a new company of 200 men-at-arms which formed half of the Dauphin's guards. In 1611, this company became the "Gendarmes de la Garde". This company was paired with another company of heavy cavalry. These "chevau-légers" (light cavalry) wore armour and were only light when compared to the Gendarmes, who wore more armour. This company dated to 1570, and became part of the Dauphin's guard and then of the Maison du Roi.
The next companies of the Maison du Roi, and by far the most famous, were the Musketeers, the guardsmen who appear in Dumas senior's "The Three Musketeers". The first company, which was formed in 1622, represents the Musketeers in which D'Artagnan and his friends served. The second company, not taken into the Maison du Roi until 1663, has previously been the Cardinal Mazarin's guards. Perhaps, by this route, some of Cardinal Richelieu's guards eventually became King's Musketeers.
Louis XIV - apogee.
Unlike the previous companies, officered by powerful nobles, and with many nobles in their ranks, the final company of the Maison du Roi was created as an elite force, formed by taking one grenadier from each infantry regiment and making him a mounted grenadier. The resulting picked men who would become the "Grenadiers à cheval" were interviewed by Louis XIV. Those colonels who, in the Sun King's opinion had not sent the best of their men, were reprimanded and ordered to send a suitable replacement. The company was completed in 1676. The military household played a vital role in the Battle of Oudenarde of 1708, when it saved the French army from probable destruction. 
18th century - decline.
Regiments of the Maison du Roi did not see significant active service after the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763. For reasons of economy, at a time of financial crisis, several of these expensive units were disbanded in 1787. These included the "gardes de la prevote", the "gardes de la porte", the "gendarmes de la Garde", and the "chevau-legers de la Garde". The "mousquetaires de la Garde" had already been dissolved on 1 January 1776. The "Garde du Corps" (Body Guard), the "Gardes françaises" (French Guards) and the "Gardes suisses" (Swiss Guards) were however retained in service, the first named because of its close ties to the Royal Court, the second two because they comprised the largest, and historically most effective, infantry components of the Maison du Roi.
At the outbreak of the French Revolution in July 1789, the French Guards defected from the Monarchy and joined in the attack on the Bastille. The Body Guard was formally disbanded in 1791, although this aristocratic body had dispersed when the Royal Family had been forced to leave Versailles in October 1789. This left the Swiss Guard as the last remaining unit of the old Maison du Roi, although a short-lived "Garde Constitutionelle du Roi" was raised on 16 March 1792. 
On 10 August 1792, most of the 900 Swiss Guards defending the Tuileries were massacred when the palace was stormed by revolutionary forces. With the overthrow of the Monarchy the Maison militaire du Roi ceased to exist.
Restoration.
Following the First Restoration of 1814 the Bourbon Monarchy attempted to recreate the Maison militaire du Roi, even re-establishing the mostly-ceremonial units that had been disbanded by Louis XVI in 1787. In part this was to provide military roles for emigre royalist officers who had returned to France, or their sons. There was not however sufficient time to raise a new Swiss Guard before Napoleon's return from Elba in March 1815, although the future Charles X acknowledged that the regiment's past services warranted this being done. The Maison militaire disintegrated during the flight of Louis XVIII to Belgium and only 450 men remained with him to cross the frontier. After the Second Restoration, no serious attempt was made to again restore the Maison militaire du Roi and it was (with the exception of a re-organised Body Guard) replaced with an entirely new Royal Guard.

The Adventures of Sir Prancelot

The Adventures of Sir Prancelot was a children's animated TV Series written and produced by John Ryan for the John Ryan Studios company. It followed the adventures of Sir Prancelot, an eccentric inventor-knight who heads for the Crusades in the Holy Land. 
Plot.
To escape both his bank manager and his overbearing wife Lady Histeria, Prancelot decides to join the crusades. He is dismayed when he learns that Histeria intends to accompany him and eventually the entire household - including the children Sim and Sue, the miserly majordomo Girth, a cockney minstrel (who is also the show's narrator) and several serfs - set sail for adventure. They repeatedly fall foul of the dastardly Count Otto "The Blot" but always escape by some contrivance of Sir Prancelot himself. After many unlikely adventures they arrive in the Holy Land to discover they are 50 years too late. After a final showdown with Count Otto they return to England in a rocket ship also invented by Sir Prancelot.
Background.
The "Sir Prancelot" animation came from the same stable as "Captain Pugwash" and was in a similar style.
Narration.
All voices were performed by Peter Hawkins. The story featured the narration of The Minstrel character, whose Cockney accent was rather reminiscent of Michael Caine. 
The music was composed by Alan Parker.

Louisa Martindale

Dr. Louisa Martindale, CBE, MB/BS (Lond.), FRCOG, JP (30 October 1872 – 5 February 1966) was an English physician, surgeon, and writer. She also served as magistrate on the Brighton bench, was a prison commissioner and a member of the National Council of Women. She served with the Scottish Women's Hospitals at Royaumont Abbey in France in World War I, and as a surgeon in London in World War II. Through her writings she promoted medicine as a career for women.
Early life.
Louisa Martindale was born in Leytonstone, Essex, the first child of William Martindale (c. 1832–1874) and his second wife Louisa, née Spicer (1839–1914). The family had a Congregational Church background. Her mother, "a champion of a larger life for women", was an active suffragist and a member of the Women's Liberal Federation, and of the executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In the 1880s, Mrs. Martindale held open house for Brighton shop girls on a regular basis, and thus young Louisa would have grown up in an environment supportive of her future career.
After the death of William Martindale the family moved to Cornwall, and thence to Germany and Switzerland, finally returning to England to live in Lewes, East Sussex. In 1885 the family moved again, this time to Brighton so that Louisa and her sister Hilda could attend Brighton High School for Girls. From an early age it had been decided that Louisa should become a doctor, and at 17 she was sent to Royal Holloway, University of London in Egham and obtained her London Matriculation in 1892. She then entered the London School of Medicine for Women in 1893, gaining her MB in 1899, and her BS. In 1901 she went north to Hull as an assistant to Dr. Mary Murdoch (1864–1916), the beginning of her professional life. 
Professional life.
After five years in Hull, in 1906 Martindale gained her Doctor of Medicine and returned to Brighton. She started her own general practice and very soon was asked to join the Lewes Road Dispensary for Women and Children (which in 1911 became the Lady Chichester Hospital, Brighton Branch) as a visiting medical officer. In 1920 she was instrumental in the setting up of the New Sussex Hospital for Women in Windlesham Road, Brighton, and held the post of senior Surgeon and Physician there until 1937. She left Brighton and Hove in 1922, moving to London to start a Surgical Consultant Practice but continued to operate part-time at the New Sussex Hospital. 
Martindale's medical interests were sometimes controversial, especially her studies of venereal disease and prostitution; her book "Under the Surface" (1909), in which she spoke quite openly about these very topics, apparently caused a stir in the House of Commons. Nonetheless she was awarded with the CBE in 1931.
She secured a long and distinguished life and career in medicine, carrying out over 7000 operations. Her work brought her respect and acknowledgment from both her colleagues and her patients: she was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians in 1933, and was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine. Eventually she became a specialist in the early treatment of cervical cancer by X-ray and she later lectured extensively throughout the UK, the United States, and Germany. 
Personal life.
An active member of the Brighton Women's Franchise Society, she also served as Magistrate for many years on the Brighton bench, became President of the Medical Women’s Federation in 1931, was a Prison Commissioner and a member of the National Council of Women. She served with the Scottish Women’s Hospitals at Royaumont Abbey in France in World War I, and as a surgeon in London in World War II. Martindale never married and lived for more than three decades with another woman, Ismay FitzGerald (c. 1875-1946), daughter of Baron FitzGerald of Kilmarnock. Some scholars are wary of identifying Martindale as a lesbian; Geoffrey Walford, for instance, does not state whether Martindale's "woman-centred lifestyle" specifically entailed a lesbian relationship. Others are more explicit and unhesitatingly propose Martindale's lesbianism, referring for instance to her 1951 autobiography "A Woman Surgeon", in which she writes quite openly and tenderly (though without giving explicit detail) about her love for FitzGerald.
Death.
Martindale retired from practice in 1947 and died on 5 February 1966, aged 93.

Srpenica

Srpenica (; ) is a village on the right bank of the Soča River in the Municipality of Bovec in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlet of Brezovo, which was abandoned after the Second World War.
Name.
Srpenica was attested in written records in 1496 as "Sterpeniza". The name is probably derived from a Romance reflex of the Latin word "stirps" 'tree, bush, root', which is preserved in Italian "sterpo" 'bushes, roots that have died off' and in Ladin "šterp" 'brambles, brush litter'. A less likely theory derives the name from the Ladin common noun "stirpe" 'sterile cow'.
History.
From the mid-18th century onward, many residents of the village made a living by peddling. Others traditionally worked outside the village as seasonal labor. Nearly the entire village was destroyed by a fire in 1905, after which 10 houses were not rebuilt. Before the First World War, there were nine inns in the village. The village was not destroyed like others in the area during the First World War, although houses in poor condition were razed by the military and the narrowest streets were widened. During the war, the entire population was evacuated to Piedmont, from which they returned in 1919. After the Second World War, many of the residents emigrated, resulting in several abandoned and decaying houses in the village.

Edmond de Mandat-Grancey

Baron Edmond de Mandat-Grancey (the good) (1842–1911), was a French journalist, writer and naval officer.
Life.
After serving in the army, baron de Mandat-Grancey went on long travels. Starting in the 1880s he wrote a series of articles for the "Correspondant" on his trip into west Canada. He also published many works on his trip to Chicago, New York and Dakota in the United States of America, in which he put the French public on guard against what he saw as American "imperialism".
Mandat-Grancey also visited Madagascar, the French Congo and the Congo Free State (owned by king Leopold II of Belgium) as well as Greece and Ireland, writing memoirs of his trips there. At the turn of the century, the name of Mandat-Grancey would be associated with the royalism of Charles Maurras and the Action Française. He was one of the first contributors to the "Revue d'Action française" (founded by Henri Vaugeois and Maurice Pujo in 1899).

RadSec

RadSec is a protocol for transporting RADIUS datagrams over TCP and TLS. 
The RADIUS protocol is a widely deployed authentication and authorization protocol. The supplementary RADIUS Accounting specification also provides accounting mechanisms, thus delivering a full AAA protocol solution. However, RADIUS is experiencing two major shortcomings as time passes since its initial design: its dependency on the unreliable transport protocol UDP and the lack of security for large parts of its packet payload. Specifically, for the latter, RADIUS security is based on the MD5 algorithm, which has been proven to be insecure.
The main focus of RadSec is to provide a means to secure the communication between RADIUS/TCP peers on the transport layer. The most important use of RadSec lies in roaming environments where RADIUS packets need to be transferred through different administrative domains and untrusted, potentially hostile networks. An example for a world-wide roaming environment that uses RadSec to secure communication is eduroam.
RadSec is currently being standardized in the "RADIUS Extensions" working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The term "Soft IP" was first used at the European Patent Forum in Munich in April 2007. At this conference, the European Patent Office published a report about their work on four scenarios which are considered to describe the most likely developments in the area of intellectual property. One of these scenarios (called Blue Skies) shows a novel idea called “Soft IP”, a new form of IP.
In the field of patents there is effectively a Soft IP system in UK and Germany where patents may be endorsed "Licenses of Right" (LOR).
A Licence of Right is not a compulsory license to use the patented invention. A patent may, at the request of the patent owner, be endorsed LOR in the UK and/or Germany. The request is made by the patent owner to the German Patent Office or UK Intellectual Property Office. As a "reward" for doing so, the annual renewal fees for the patent are reduced by 50%. Any person wishing to obtain a license may approach the patent owner and agree terms for the license, and only if unable to agree is it necessary to apply to the appropriate national patent office or court to have the terms settled. The terms of the license, in particular the royalties to be paid for using the invention, are normally on the basis of willing licensee/willing licensor informed by actual licensing practice and where they exist, licenses entered into voluntarily by the patentee.
Provisions for LOR have been included in the proposals for the European Community Patent.

Christus (Mendelssohn)

Christus is the title given by the composer's brother Paul to fragments of an unfinished oratorio by Felix Mendelssohn, published posthumously as Op. 97. The work was suggested by Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen, who compiled the German libretto from biblical sources. Composition began in 1846 and continued through Mendelssohn's last year. The completed portions include a tenor recitative relating Christ's birth, a TBB chorus "Where is the newborn", the well known SATB chorus "There Shall a Star from Jacob Shine Forth" using Philipp Nicolai's chorale "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern", and a passion section ending with another chorale, "O Welt, sieh' hier dein Leben." The first performance took place in 1852.
Jeffrey S. Sposato's 2006 "The Price of Assimilation: Felix Mendelssohn and the Nineteenth-Century Anti-Semitic Tradition" discusses both "Christus" and Mendelssohn's cuts in the "Matthäuspassion" and discerns an agenda to promote "the Lutheran concept of universal guilt for Christ's death" over the prevailing antisemitism of the time.

The Mt. Carmel Monastery is a historic monastery located at Port Tobacco, Charles County, Maryland, United States. It is a two-part frame house, the main block of which was built about 1790 and restored in 1936-37, and consists of a two-story structure with a moderately pitched gable roof. The entire house, devoid of any extraneous ornamentation, reflects the austerity of the life of the Carmelite nuns who are believed to have used this house as their residence. The monastery was founded on October 15, 1790, by four Belgian Carmelite nuns, three of them former natives of Charles County. In 1831 the nuns then in residence were ordered to transfer the convent to Baltimore, Maryland, and this property was abandoned. In 1933 an organization called the Restorers of Mt. Carmel in Maryland, formed to aid in the restoration of the site.

Mykonos windmills

The Mykonos windmills are iconic feature of the Greek island of the Mykonos. The island is one of the Cyclades islands, which neighbour Delos in the Aegean Sea. The windmills can be seen from every point of the village of Mykonos, the island's principal village, which is frequently called the Chora (which translates to "Country" in Greek, but refers to an island's "Town") on Greek islands. The windmills are the first thing seen when coming into the harbour of Alefkandra, as they stand on a hill overlooking the area. Most windmills face towards the North where the island's climate sources its strongest winds over the largest part of the year. There are currently 16 windmills on Mykonos of which seven are positioned on the famous landmark hill in Chora. Most of them were built by the Venetians in the 16th century, but construction continued into the early 20th century. They were primarily used to mill wheat. They were an important source of income for the inhabitants. Their use gradually declined until they ceased production in the middle of the 20th century. Their architecture is similar. They all have a round shape, white colour and a pointed roof and very small windows. Such windmills are found in almost all Cyclades islands. One of these windmills has been transformed into a museum. The whole village of Chora and part of the harbour are visible from this point.

It consists of 19 contributing buildings, structures, and sites and five non-contributing buildings and structures. The nucleus of the district is a group of four 19th century buildings flanking Old Route 5 west of the former crossroads. Included among these are two c. 1820 structures of major interest, the Bryantown Tavern and Brick House Lot. The latter is notable for its formal Federal design.
The two most physically prominent structures in Bryantown are Evergreen and the Smith House; both built near the turn of the 20th century. Evergreen is the finest example of Victorian Carpenter Gothic architecture in Charles County. Also built early in the 20th century are the John T. Mudd House and the Carrico House, both of which are two-story, three-bay dwellings architecturally typical of a rural community in this region. There are also two, two-story, gambrel-roofed tobacco barns located near the northwest corner of the village that preserve the community's ties to the agricultural region it once served and the mid-19th century storehouses of "Boarman and Mudd" and "William N. Bean & Co."
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Kachama-Ganjule language

Kachama-Ganjule is an Afroasiatic language spoken in Ethiopia on islands in Lake Chamo and Lake Abaya. Kachama is spoken on Gidicho island in Lake Abaya, whereas Ganjule was originally spoken on a small island in Lake Chamo. Now the Ganjule speakers have relocated to the west shore of the Lake. There still are about 1000 monolinguals in this language.
Blench (2006) lists Gidicho, Kachama, and Ganjule as separate languages. "Ethnologue" gives Gatame/Get'eme/Gats'ame as a synonym; however, Blench treats that as a separate languages as well, a synonym with Haruro/Harro. While he moves the others to the northern branch of he Ometo languages, he keeps Gatame in the eastern branch.

Glenn &amp; Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center

The Glenn & Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center is a multi-use arts and performance venue in downtown Hillsboro, Oregon, United States. Opened in 2004, it is housed in a red-colored stone building completed in 1949 as a Lutheran church. Hillsboro, a city on the west side of Portland, owns the three-level facility and operates it through their Parks and Recreation Department.
Walters Cultural Arts Center includes gallery space, classroom space, and a 200 seat performance hall. With two above ground floors and one below ground level, the center has a total of of space. Located on East Main Street, the Washington County Courthouse and the Hillsboro Civic Center are just to the west and the Edward Schulmerich House one block to the east on Main. The center is named in honor of a local couple who donated $1 million towards the project which included purchasing the property and US$2.4 million worth of renovations.
History.
The Trinity Lutheran Church congregation was founded in 1917 and acquired their first church in 1923. By the 1940s the congregation needed a larger place to worship and bought a lot on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East Main Street in downtown Hillsboro in 1941.
The church did not want to sell its former home to just anyone, or for it to be torn down. At this time the city was looking for a space to use as an arts center. Plans for an arts and culture center in Hillsboro were made in the city’s Hillsboro 2020 Vision. This community plan was finalized in 2000 and designed to improve the livability of the city located in the Portland metropolitan area. Hillsboro purchased the property from the church for $1.325 million in November 2000. 
Most of the purchase price came from a $1 million donation by Glenn and Viola Walters to the city to help pay for an arts center in 1999. The Walters had earned their money from operating a nursery in the surrounding community. The city had hoped to open a remodeled arts center during the winter of 2001, but this was delayed with later estimates having the center opening in late 2002. In December 2002, construction began on the work to transform the church into a culture and arts center. WaterLeaf Architecture & Interiors designed the changes to the building that sits on a lot.
Renovations included adding a new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone from the walls to enlarge a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.
On March 16, 2004, the Glen & Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center opened. Total cost for the project including buying the property was around $3.5 million. The center’s operating budget comes from city funds and user generated fees. A new classical music concert series was started at the center in 2009, as was a book club focusing on arts and culture titles. In April 2010, the Oregon Mandolin Orchestra held their first ever concert at the center.
Building.
Located on Main Street at Fifth Avenue in downtown Hillsboro, the center is two blocks from the Hillsboro Central/3rd Avenue Transit Center MAX light rail station. The building covers of space and contains five classrooms, a lobby, meeting rooms, a box office, exhibition gallery, and an auditorium. The main part of the building has rock walls, and the auditorium contains high, arched ceilings and stained-glass windows. Once featuring a stone chimney, contractors removed the chimney during conversion to the center and inserted an elevator to comply with ADA requirements.
The T-shaped center has three levels, which includes a basement that houses classrooms used for art instruction. Instruction includes courses on creating pottery, sculptures, and ceramics. The second story contains exhibition gallery space and multipurpose rooms, with the focus on visual arts. On the main level is the auditorium where the church’s sanctuary was located. The auditorium seats up to 200 people and is used for concerts, lectures, plays, and other events.
On the outside is a garden, and a lawn area to the east with a small stage that is used for fair weather events such as summer concerts. Also outside the building is a new wheelchair ramp that was added to the east side where a new entrance was added. There are two terraces on the exterior of the building and the inside also has a kitchen area.
Operations.
Walters Cultural Arts Center was designed to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city’s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00 p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.
Performances at the Walters Cultural Arts Center include opera, folk music, country music, and spoken word acts. These include poetry readings and lectures. Art exhibits have included "Organic," "Questioning Functionality," and "Questioning Functionality 2 (QF2)" among others. These shows have included art forms such as interior design, crafts, sculpture, and fine art.

Intermediation

Intermediation involves the "matching" of lenders with savings to borrowers who need money by an agent or third party, such as a bank. 
If this matching is successful, the lender obtains a positive rate of return, the borrower receives a return for risk taking and entrepreneurship and the banker receives a return for making the successful match. If the borrower's speculative play with the depositor's funds does not pay off, the depositor can lose the savings borrowed by the borrower and the bank can face significant losses on its loan portfolio. 
The skill of identifying potential successful new entrepreneurs who can take market share off competitors or develop whole new markets is one of the most vital (and intangible) skills any banking system can possess.

Junkyard Choir

Junkyard Choir were a London-based alternative rock band formed in 2005, whose original lineup had previously played together under the name "Dirt". The final line-up composed of guitarist and lead singer Mark Woods, bassist Del Williamson and drummer Tom Herbert, the band were known for their unique blend of rock, blues, punk and waltz, having been described as "swampy rock'n'roll", "gypsy punk" and "mariachi-esque polka-rock". Frontman Mark Woods was, for three years (2003–2006), one of the main vocalists in Do Me Bad Things.
History.
Mark Woods and Kevin Hiscox had been playing together since the turn of the century as Dirt, with founding drummer Paul Connor, and gaining local notoriety in south London for their simple and catchy songs, characterised by monkey imagery and beatnik themes, sung (or howled) with Woods' distinctly lupine growl and interspersed with Connor's elastically-syncopated drumfills. Dirt self-released a number of EPs during this time.
In 2003, following a Dirt show, Woods was approached by members of Croydon soul-metallers Do Me Bad Things and asked to join their number as a vocalist. First signed to Must Destroy, then to Atlantic, Do Me Bad Things' rise to fame put a halt to Dirt's progress due to Woods' unavailability whilst away on tour. In September 2005, however, just prior to the breakup of Do Me Bad Things, Connor and Woods reformed for an acoustic gig at the Spitz, London.. Then with Hiscox they changed their name to Junkyard Choir.
The band then recorded the EP "Trying to save the world" with Pete Lyons in November 2006. Drummer Paul Connor left amicably at the start of 2007 shortly after its release. The band quickly drafted in Tom Herbert from "Captains of the citadel" to stand in. During the course of the next year Herbert eventually became a permanent member of the band.
The band released their second EP "Delope" in the summer of 2008. Bass player Kevin Hiscox went missing in Spain for the first 6 months of 2009, only to then find his way home in time to play the bands support show at The Borderline, London with the alt-country band "Clem snide" in May 2009. Mark Woods also self-released his first solo Ep "Under the big smoke" in the same month. The band then finished work on and released "When the ship goes down" in September 2009.
Junkyard Choir went on to record with Pete Lyons at Zed-One studios in Camden the following year, the tracks from which would later form their fourth self-released EP: "Dead Anchor Blues" (Sept 2010). The band gigged extensively in London and South East England until December 2011, when long-term bassist and founding member, Kevin Hiscox, left the band. Hiscox was replaced on bass by Derek "Del Boy" Williamson - best friend of Herbert's and fellow member of Captains of the Citadel.
In 2012 they once again entered the studio - entirely recording, producing and releasing their fifth EP "Vita Nova" themselves.
Derek "Del Boy" Williamson left the band in July 2013 prior to the band recording a 6th EP, this has been put on hold. Mark Woods released his first solo album "Sea I Told You" in October 2013 and promoted on a Uk tour with Eef Barzelay (Clem Snide).
Mark and Tom went on to form the blues/rock duo "Dos Hermanos Locos" who released their first EP "Kingdom of dirt" in August 2013 and then the follow up"Hold fast" in November 2013.

Eastern Visayas State University

The Eastern Visayas State University is a public university in the Philippines and the oldest higher education institution in Eastern Visayas. It is mandated to provide advanced education, higher technological, professional instruction and training in trade, fishery, agriculture, forestry, science, education, commerce, architecture, engineering, and related courses. It is also mandated to undertake research and extension services, and provide progressive leadership in its area of specialization. Its main campus is in Tacloban.
History.
The Eastern Visayas State University had its humble beginnings in 1907, as part of the provincial school. It became a separate entity in 1915, was renamed the Leyte Trade School, and was funded by the provincial government. In 1953, after 38 years, it was renamed the National Provincial Trade School by virtue of R.A. 406 and funded jointly by the National and Provincial Government to cover a wider curriculum. In 1961, the Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act No. 1561, converting the school into the Leyte Regional School of Arts and Trades, authorizing it to become a training institution for vocational and industrial education in Eastern Visayas. 
On June 19, 1965, Republic Act 4572 was enacted by Congress of the Philippines which converted the school further into a chartered college, renaming it the Leyte Institute of Technology. It took effect beginning in the school year 1965.
Starting in 1999, the institute has grown to establish a satellite campus in Ormoc City. Pursuant to Board Resolutions No. 59, series of 1999, two CHED supervised institutions (CSIs) in Leyte, namely the Leyte College of Arts and Trades and the Burauen Polytechnic College were integrated to the Leyte Institute of Technology. The LIT Dulag Campus started in SY 2000-2001. The Carigara School of Fisheries was added, the second phase of CSIs institution to SUCs.
On August 7, 2004, Republic Act No. 9311 was passed converting the Leyte Institute of Technology, into Eastern Visayas State University.

Von Neumann stability analysis

In numerical analysis, von Neumann stability analysis (also known as Fourier stability analysis) is a procedure used to check the stability of finite difference schemes as applied to linear partial differential equations. The analysis is based on the Fourier decomposition of numerical error and was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory after having been briefly described in a 1947 article by British researchers Crank and Nicolson.
This method is an example of explicit time integration where the function that defines governing equation is evaluated at the current time.
Later, the method was given a more rigorous treatment in an article co-authored by John von Neumann.
Numerical stability.
The stability of numerical schemes is closely associated with numerical error. A finite difference scheme is stable if the errors made at one time step of the calculation do not cause the errors to increase as the computations are continued. A "neutrally stable scheme" is one in which errors remain constant as the computations are carried forward. If the errors decay and eventually damp out, the numerical scheme is said to be stable. If, on the contrary, the errors grow with time the numerical scheme is said to be unstable. The stability of numerical schemes can be investigated by performing von Neumann stability analysis. For time-dependent problems, stability guarantees that the numerical method produces a bounded solution whenever the solution of the exact differential equation is bounded. Stability, in general, can be difficult to investigate, especially when the equation under consideration is nonlinear.
In certain cases, von Neumann stability is necessary and sufficient for stability in the sense of Lax–Richtmyer (as used in the Lax equivalence theorem): The PDE and the finite difference scheme models are linear; the PDE is constant-coefficient with periodic boundary conditions and have only two independent variables; and the scheme uses no more than two time levels. Von Neumann stability is necessary in a much wider variety of cases. It is often used in place of a more detailed stability analysis to provide a good guess at the restrictions (if any) on the step sizes used in the scheme because of its relative simplicity.
Illustration of the method.
The von Neumann method is based on the decomposition of the errors into Fourier series. To illustrate the procedure, consider the one-dimensional heat equation 
defined on the spatial interval formula_2, which can be discretized as
where
and the solution formula_5 of the discrete equation approximates the analytical solution formula_6 of the PDE on the grid.
Define the round-off error formula_7 as
where formula_9 is the solution of the discretized equation (1) that would be computed in the absence of round-off error, and formula_10 is the numerical solution obtained in finite precision arithmetic. Since the exact solution formula_9 must satisfy the discretized equation exactly, the error formula_7 must also satisfy the discretized equation.
Thus
is a recurrence relation for the error. Equations (1) and (2) show that both the error and the numerical solution have the same growth or decay behavior with respect to time. For linear differential equations with periodic boundary condition, the spatial variation of error may be expanded in a finite Fourier series, in the interval formula_2, as
where the wavenumber formula_16 with formula_17 and formula_18. The time dependence of the error is included by assuming that the amplitude of error formula_19 is a function of time. Since the error tends to grow or decay exponentially with time, it is reasonable to assume that the amplitude varies exponentially with time; hence
where formula_21 is a constant.
Since the difference equation for error is linear (the behavior of each term of the series is the same as series itself), it is enough to consider the growth of error of a typical term:
The stability characteristics can be studied using just this form for the error with no loss in generality. To find out how error varies in steps of time, substitute equation (5) into equation (2), after noting that
to yield (after simplification)
Using the identities
equation (6) may be written as
Define the amplification factor
The necessary and sufficient condition for the error to remain bounded is that formula_28 
However,
Thus, from equations (7) and (8), the condition for stability is given by
For the above condition to hold at all formula_31, we have
Equation (10) gives the stability requirement for the FTCS scheme as applied to one-dimensional heat equation. It says that for a given formula_33, the allowed value of formula_34 must be small enough to satisfy equation (10).

Roland U-110

The Roland U-110 is a synth module (sample playback or "Rompler" type) produced by Roland Corporation in 1988.
General information.
Roland's answer to the E-mu Proteus, the predecessor of the more successful U-220 module and U-20 keyboard and the ancestor of the prototype T-110, the U-110 was Roland's first dedicated sample playback synth. It used ROM to store sounds rather than loading them from disks into RAM, hence it was not a true sampler as it could not sample sounds.
The U-110 contained a base 2MB of sounds stored in ROM. It could be expanded with up to 4 Roland SN-U110 sound library cards, unlike the more popular Roland U-220 that could only accommodate two. It had six individual outputs.
Test mode.
Tests carried out; 1. S-RAM Check, 2. LCD Check (display switches on all pixels), 3. KEY/LED Check (pressing down a key will blank out that keys name on the display and if there is an LED in the key that will light up as well if working), 4. Battery check, 5. MIDI Check (using a midi cable connect midi in to midi out on back of unit. Midi message light will flash and a graphical representation of data flow will appear on the display), 6. Wave ROM check, 7.ROM card check, 8. DAC Offset Adjust, 9. DAC MSB CHECK, 10. Sound Check (By pressing <- and -> you can cycle though the modules voices. if working a tone should be heard from headphones or other connected output device (mix output) also pressing or [inc/enter checks the effects), 11. Output check (this checks the individual voice outputs use <- or -> to change the currently selected output and check to see if a test tone is emitted from that output).

Germany national football B team

Germany B (or Germany A2) is a secondary team for the national football team of Germany, used to try out and develop players for potential inclusion in the first team. The team - which has not been active since 2006 - can play against other nations' B-teams, or against full national teams, but its matches are not considered full internationals. In its last incarnation the team was named Team 2006, as a development team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was to be hosted in Germany.
Team 2006.
In 2000, when Germany was selected to host the World Cup, the national team was in decline - the squad was ageing, with little in the way of emerging talent. After the team was knocked out in the first round of Euro 2000, the German Football Association decided to form 'Team 2006' - a development team for young players, with the hope of producing a squad that could perform at the 2006 World Cup. The team played ten fixtures between 2002 and 2005, with four wins, four draws and two defeats.
Ultimately, only four players from Team 2006 were part of the World Cup squad - Tim Borowski, Arne Friedrich, Mike Hanke and Timo Hildebrand. However, Manuel Friedrich, Alexander Madlung, Clemens Fritz, Stefan Kießling, Simon Rolfes, Robert Enke, Patrick Helmes, Mario Gómez and Roman Weidenfeller went on to play full internationals, as did Daniel Bierofka, Marco Engelhardt, Fabian Ernst, Frank Fahrenhorst, Ingo Hertzsch, Tobias Rau, Andreas Hinkel and Kevin Kurányi, who had already been capped before their Team 2006 debuts.
The team was coached by Uli Stielike (2001-2003) and later Erich Rutemöller (2003-2005).

Augustin-Joseph de Mailly

Augustin-Joseph de Mailly (5 April 1708, Villaines-sous-Lucé – 25 March 1794, Arras) was a French general, governor and nobleman.
Augustin-Joseph de Mailly was marquis d'Haucourt and baron of Saint-Amand. In January 1744 he inherited the title of count of Mailly following the death of his cousin Louis de Mailly (1723–1743). At first a musketeer (1726), he served in the gendarmerie (1733–1764) before rising rapidly through the ranks – brigadier on 20 February 1743, maréchal de camp on 1 May 1745, lieutenant-général on 10 May 1748, inspector general of cavalry and dragoons on 21 May 1749, and finally director-general of camps and armies. In disgrace, he was distanced from the court and therefore remained a lieutenant-Général for a very long time, before becoming commander in chief in Roussillon, where he was the originator of great building works and the renewal of the university and played a large rôle in Catalan Freemasonry. Made a chevalier du Saint-Esprit on 26 May 1776, he was made marshal of France on 13 June 1783 and due to his age was able to be governor of Abbeville, sénéchal and Grand bailli of Ponthieu not far from his lands and château. However, this Mailly, who fought in many battles of the wars of Louis XV, received from Louis XVI, in 1790, command of one of the four armies decreed by the National Assembly (14th and 15th military divisions). This was a difficult task and he resigned on 22 June, when he learned of the king's flight to Varennes. On 10 August 1792, despite his old age, he fought on the side of the threatened French monarchy. Escaping the carnage that followed the capture of the palais des Tuileries and the September massacres, he was arrested in his château, then guillotined in 1794 at Arras, aged 87 – on the scaffold he cried "I remain faithful to my king, as my ancestors have always been".
Life.
Arrest and execution.
On the 25th of March 1794, Joseph de Mailly was executed by guillotine, at the time of his execution he was the oldest person to be executed.

Ellen Marx

Ellen Marx (born February 22, 1939) is a French-German visual artist and author of reference books about color.
Life.
She was born in Saarbrücken, Germany, where she studied fundamental visual-research and graphic design from 1957 to 1962 at the "Staatliche Werkkunstschule", Saarbrücken notably with the professor Oskar Holweck, an artist belonging at this time to the ZERO group in Germany (Günther Uecker, Otto Piene, Heinz Mack). His work and his teaching should have a profound influence on the evolution of her own work.
In 1962 Ellen Marx went to Paris and created two years later her atelier 40 km from Paris where she is still living and working today.
After the research-works of E.Chevreul, Johannes Itten and Josef Albers, Ellen Marx has quantified objectively for the first time the color-relativity in her second book "Optical Color and Simultaneity". In parallel to the publication of this book in 1983, a solo-exhibition took place at the Center Georges Pompidou (National Center of Art and Culture)in Paris, France. The color-reliefs in this exhibition were interactive and changing constantly with the view-point of the spectator. Numerous other group- and solo-exhibitions were held in Europe,especially "Relief Concrete in Germany today" with the German artists of Concrete Art which was showed 1981 in the Modern Gallery of the Museum of the Saar, Germany. In 1989 her fFrench editor Pierre Zech published in the collection "Le Temps Apprivoisé" the book "Méditer la couleur" which examines in great detail the phenomenon of successive contrast.
Marx was invited to be the Keynote-Address-Speaker of the International Conference on Color Education which was organized by the University of Art and Design in Helsinki and which showed in parallel her work in an exhibition beside paintings of Josef Albers.
Since 2000 she has been conceiving her paintings with the computer.

Gerard Caris

Gerard Caris (born 20 March 1925) is a Dutch sculptor and artist who has pursued a single motif throughout the course of his artistic career, the pentagon.
Early life and education.
He was born in Maastricht, Holland. After attending the technical school in Maastricht he joined the marines as war volunteer trained in Camp Lejeune, N.C., United States, to end the occupation by Japan in World War II. During his training the war was ended by the atom bomb and he was sent to the late colony of the Netherlands Indonesia. In 1947 he came back to the Netherlands, only to leave soon afterwards to the far East in an attempt to escape the poverty of his native surroundings. Ten years later he decided to emigrate to the U.S. Here he studied art and philosophy at the New York University. Combining his art classes with earning a living and visiting all art happenings, museums and galleries, for example the Tinguely happening at the MOMA in NY in 1960 he was overwhelmed by Abstract expressionism and left for the Arabian desert in Dhofar, a sultanate of Muscat and Oman where he worked in his former trade as a petroleum engineer. He did one more important job project, the erection of the Telstar Horn Antenna at the Andover earth station in Maine, then he traveled to California, inspired by the movie he watched while working in the Arabian desert "Strangers When We Meet". He studied at the Monterey Peninsula College, California, the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies and San José College (arts and humanities) subsequently at the University of California, Berkeley, a.o. with David Hockney, R.B. Kitaj, Elmer Bischoff and Richard Diebenkorn In 1967 B. A. in Philosophy, in 1969 M.A. in arts .
He returned for a “short visit” to Holland where he continued his art practice without realizing there is no intellectual resonance where he works but he is so possessed with his newly discovered Pentagonism that he does not realize he has landed on the moon. 
To this day he works continually, evolving new ideas, executes them, and making them public through exhibitions and publications, remaining optimistic, believing that ha has added a new chapter to the history of art self coined as Pentagonism.

Austria Netto Katalog

The Austria Netto Kataloge are Austria's most popular collectors' catalogs. They have been regularly issued since the mid-20th century. Among philatelists, numismatists, and phone card collectors they are considered the authoritative reference catalogs.
The most famous of these catalogs are those issued in the field of philately. These are limited to the Austrian collecting field, and are issued annually. The oldest of these, the "Österreich Spezial Katalog" (Austria Special Catalog), as of 2007, is in its 63rd edition. Also issued annually are the "Österreich Standardkatalog" (Austria Standard Catalog) and the "Vierländerkatalog" (Four Countries Catalog), the latter of which lists all stamps issued in each of the four German-speaking countries: Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland.
In addition to its stamp catalogs, the "Austria Netto Kataloge" line also includes annually-issued Austrian coin catalogs and Austrian phone card catalogs. The catalogs' publisher also issues catalogs for special cancellations.
The editor-in-chief of the Austria Netto Kataloge, as of 2008, is Christine Steyrer.
Due to the length of the name "Austria Netto Kataloge", collectors often use the abbreviation "ANK". Therefore, while also commonly used, the expression "ANK catalog" is technically redundant.

External floating roof tank

An external floating roof tank is a storage tank commonly used to store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats on the surface of the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor space (ullage) in the floating roof tank (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid There is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation.
The roof has support legs hanging down into the liquid. At low liquid levels the roof eventually lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof, similar to a fixed roof tank. The support legs are usually retractable to increase the working volume of the tank.
Advantages.
External roof tanks are usually installed for environmental or economical reasons to limit product loss and reduce the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC), an air pollutant.
Normally (roof not landed), there is little vapor space, and consequently a much smaller risk of internal tank explosion.
Disadvantages.
Rain water and snow can accumulate on the roof, eventually the roof may sink.
Water on the roof is usually drained from a flexible hose that runs from a drain-sump on the roof, through the stored liquid to a drain valve on the shell at the base of the tank. The hose often develops leaks and drains both water and product.

Career.
Jackson was born in Papakura, New Zealand. His first Olympic participation came in 1988 in Seoul. Here, he competed in the men's doubles event, but as the team only won one match and lost six in the preliminary round, they were eliminated from the competition on an early stage. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Jackson competed in both the men's doubles and singles events. In the doubles event, the team placed fourth in the group stage after losing all matches, and in the singles event, he placed third in his group after winning one match and losing two. Neither placement was good enough to advance. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia Jackson participated as an official.
His last Olympic participation came at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Here he only competed in the singles event, but failed to advance after losing two matches. Then, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games he won a bronze medal in the mixed doubles event partnering Chunli Li. He also competed in the men's doubles and singles events without the same success, reaching the round of 32 in the singles and the quarterfinal in the doubles. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games he competed in both singles, doubles, mixed doubles and the team event.

Indoor Obstacle Course Test

The Indoor Obstacle Course Test (IOCT) is a test of full-body functional physical fitness administered by the Department of Physical Education (DPE) at the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. DPE considers the IOCT to be one of the best evaluations of total body fitness given in the Army. Cadets who earn an A- (2:38 or less for males and 3:35 or less for females) are authorized to wear the IOCT Badge on their athletic shorts.
Description.
DPE administers the test in historic Hayes Gymnasium, built in 1910. The IOCT is similar in concept to the obstacle course seen on the TV show American Gladiators, with the addition of a quarter mile sprint at the conclusion of the course. DPE administers the IOCT in the winter months, usually in early February. Large crowds of cadets, officers, and other onlookers gather to watch. Due to the extreme intensity of the event, cadets sometimes become nauseous and vomit shortly after completion, while many cadets take hours to fully recover from coughing and wheezing afterward. This wheezing is said to be the "Arvin Black Lung" or "Hayes Lung".
Relevance.
Army Regulation 350-1, Army Training and Leader Development, [http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r350_1.pdf] specifically supports functional fitness and the IOCT by specifically naming numerous skill related components of fitness, like balance, agility, and coordination by stating ""Preparation for the APFT is of secondary importance. Maintenance of the military skills listed
below will also be emphasized.""
The IOCT is often cited or studied in articles concerning high intensity human performance and obstacle courses. This is due to the large amount of available data due to the lengthy history of the course. It has been administered with few changes since 1944.
History.
DPE began administering the IOCT in 1944 during the Second World War. After lessons learned from WWII, the IOCT was changed to obstacles that are similar to what we see today. The test has changed little since 1948.
Gender Difference.
The difference in completion time grade scales between male and female cadets is not taken into account during the order of merit listing that the United States Military Academy uses for branch and post selections for cadets.

Second Battle of Wissembourg (1793)

The Second Battle of Wissembourg from 26 December 1793 to 29 December 1793 saw an army of the First French Republic under General Lazare Hoche fight a series of clashes against an army of Austrians, Prussians, Bavarians, and Hessians led by General Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. There were significant actions at Wœrth on 22 December and Geisberg on 26 and 27 December. In the end, the French forced their opponents to withdraw to the east bank of the Rhine River. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition phase of the French Revolutionary Wars.
Background.
During the First Battle of Wissembourg on 13 October 1793, the Lines of Weissenburg, defended by the French Army of the Rhine, were stormed by an Austrian-Allied army under Wurmser. A month later, Austrian engineer Franz von Lauer compelled Fort-Louis on the Rhine to surrender to the Allies. The French government responded to the crisis by sending reinforcements from the Army of the Moselle. 
On 17 November, the 739-man French garrison of Bitche repelled a Prussian assault on the citadel. A French traitor led the picked force of 1,200 into the outer fortifications. The alert defenders spotted Oberst (Colonel) von Wartensleben's attackers and drove them out of the fort with the loss of 120 killed and 251 captured. The French lost a handful of men killed and wounded and 63 captured. The traitor was captured and shot. That same day, Prussian General Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth with 13,000 troops defeated Hoche's 20,000 men at Biesingen. The French lost 760 killed and wounded, plus 42 captured. Prussian losses were only 16 killed and 92 wounded. 
The Battle of Kaiserslautern followed on 28 to 30 November 1793 when Hoche with 29,115 infantry, 5,046 cavalry, and 52 guns engaged Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel with 26,000 Prussians and Saxons. The Allies defeated the French with a loss of 2,400 killed and wounded, plus 700 men and two guns captured. Prussian casualties numbered 616 while the Saxons lost 190 men. Following the policy of King Frederick William II, Brunswick failed to follow up his victory with a vigorous pursuit. 
Battle.
The allies were in their turn dispossessed by Hoche on 26 December and forced to retreat behind the Rhine.
It was a French victory and enabled French forces to take over the whole of Alsace. It also led to a definitive break between the Austrians and the Prussians, who both blamed each other for the defeat. The battle's name is engraved on the north pillar of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Permanganometry

Permanganometry is one of the techniques used in quantitative analysis in Chemistry. It is a redox titration and involves the use of permanganates and is used to measure the amount of analyte present in unknown chemical samples.
It involves two steps, namely the titration of the analyte with potassium permanganate solution and then the standardization of potassium permanganate solution with standard sodium oxalate solution. The titration involves volumetric manipulations to prepare the analyte solutions.
Depending on how the titration is performed, the permanganate ion can be reduced to Mnx, where x is +2, +3, +4 and +6. Using permanganometry we can estimate the quantitative presence of Fe+2, Mn+2, Fe+2 and Mn+2 when they are both present in a mixture, C2O42-, NO2-, H2O2 etc.
In the most cases permanganometry is performed in a very acidic solution in which the following reaction occurs:
MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- = Mn+2 + 4H2O
The standard potential of this electrochemical reaction is:
Eo=+1.52 V
which shows that KMnO4 (in an acidic medium) is a very strong oxidizing agent. With this method we can 
oxidize:
and even
In weak acidic medium MnO4- can not accept 5 electrons to form Mn+2, this time it accepts only 3 electrons and forms MnO2(s) by the following electrochemical reaction:
MnO4- + 4H+ + 3e- = MnO2 + 2H2O
The standard potential is Eo=+1.69 V.
For the reaction: MnO4- + 8 H+ + 5 e- = Mn2+ + 4 H2O
the standard reduction potential is Eo=+1.51 V.
And if the solution has a concentration c(NaOH)>1 mol dm−3 the following reaction occurs:
MnO4- + e- = MnO42- Eo=+0.56 V.

Hurlbut Memorial Gate

Hurlbut Memorial Gate is a monumental structure, long, high, and in depth, at the entry way to Water Works Park located at East Jefferson Avenue and Cadillac Boulevard in a historic area of Detroit, Michigan. It is named after Chauncey (sometimes "Chauncy") Hurlbut, a 19th-century Detroit grocer, president of the Board of Water Commissioners, and philanthropist. The gate was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The monument was built in 1894 and fully restored in 2007.
History.
The city of Detroit began building its water system as early as 1836, with the construction of a waterworks at the foot of Orleans. The prosperity of the city in the time after the Civil War allowed Detroit to develop a municipal water system, using water from the Detroit River. In 1868, the city began developing Waterworks Park, on Jefferson Avenue near at the foot of Cadillac Boulevard. The main function of the site was to provide water to the municipal system, but it was also intended to use the grounds to be used as a public park. By 1879, the pumping station was completed, and by 1900, the park had become the second most-used park in the city. Early French settlers planted twelve missionary pear trees "named for the twelve Apostles" on the grounds of what is now Waterworks Park. Waterworks Park was named Gladwin Park in 1910 in honor of Major Henry Gladwin during Siege of Fort Detroit from Pontiac's Rebellion; however, the park is still more widely known as Waterworks Park.
Chauncey Hurlbut.
Chauncey Hurlbut (1803–1885) was born in Oneida, New York, and moved to Detroit in 1825. He worked as a saddler and harnessmaker for a few years, then went into the grocery business with his brother-in-law. In 1837, Hurlbut bought out the grocery store, and continued in the trade until his death. Hurlbut was also heavily involved in public service, serving on the board of the fire department, as a city alderman, as a directior of the Detroit Board of Trade, and as a sewer commissioner. Hurlbut also served on the Detroit Board of Water Commissioners from 1861-1863, and again from 1868 to 1885. He was president of the commission from 1871 onward, when he presided over the original acquisition of property for and planning of Waterworks Park.
When Chauncey Hurlbut died in 1885, he willed the bulk of his fortune, some $250,000, to beautify Waterworks Park. The architectural philosophies of the era called for construction of monumental gates at the entrances to public places, to symbolically separate the park from the hustle and filth of the city. Part of Hurlbut's fortune was used to construct just such a gate.
Description.
Herman A. Brede and Gustave Mueller were chosen to design this gate at a cost of $30,000. The structure is a three tiered triumphal arch, in length, in depth, and over high, built from limestone. It is decorated with carved garlands, water fonts and roundels, and an American eagle with outstretched wings tops the entire structure. Two stairways lead to a terrace twelve feet above the ground.
The gate originally featured a statue of Chauncey Hurlbut inside the center dome, and an ornamental iron gate for vehicle entry, but both are now gone. The gate was substantially restored in 2007, with damaged limestone repaired or replaced, a stairway reconfiguration, repair of the eagle sculpture, and repair and replacement of light fixtures.

Carlo Munier

Carlo Munier (July 15, 1859 – February 10, 1911) was an Italian mandolinist who advocated for the mandolin's acknowledgement among as an instrument of classical music. Maestro Silvio Ranieri in 1925 described Munier as one of the principal pioneers in the revival of the mandolin repertoire - a repertoire that with Munier began to move away from the limitations of the popular style (waltzes, serenades and fashionable marches) in order to approach the "art music" forms.
Biography.
Carlo Gennaro Pasquale Munier was born in Naples on July 15, 1859, son of Vincenzo Munier, a printer, and Rosa Vinaccia. Orphaned at a very young age, he was adopted by the relatives of his maternal grandfather, the noted luthier Pasquale Vinaccia. The Vinaccia family of Naples had been active as instrument makers since the first half of 18th century, and Pasquale is considered today one of the fathers of the modern mandolin for his technical innovations for the instrument. Munier acknowledged the closeness of his relationship with the Vinaccia family in his several references to Pasquale Vinaccia in his "Method for mandolin", and in his dedication of the "Three Mazurkas Op. 116-118 for mandolin and guitar" to his uncle Gennaro, son of Pasquale.
Growing up in the Vinaccia atelier, where he learned his first musical rudiments, Munier began to study the mandolin and the guitar with Carmine de Laurentis, Neapolitan maestro of both instruments and author of the 1869 "Metodo per mandolino" published by Ricordi editions. Munier then enrolled in the S. Pietro Maiella Conservatory when he was 15, studying piano with the maestros Galiero and Cesi and harmony and composition with maestro Nicola D'Arienzo. He completed his studies at 19, winning awards in composition and harmony. In this period he performed at several concerts in Naples and published his first compositions, arrangements of "La Traviata" and "I Puritani" for two mandolins, mandola and piano, dedicating the last one to the Queen of Italy.
When he was 22 Munier moved to Florence, where he spent the rest of his life. He quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso, becoming a guiding figure of the Florentine mandolin and guitar school, which also included such illustrious students as Queen Margherita. In 1890 he organized and conducted the first plucked string quartet, with Luigi Bianchi on first mandolin, Guido Vizzarri on second mandolin, Riccardo Matini on mandola and himself on liuto moderno. With this quartet he performed several concerts across Italy, popularizing this kind of ensemble. In 1892 the quartet won first prize in the National Competition of Genoa, over which the famous violinist Camillo Sivori presided. In the same competition Munier won the gold medal as mandolin player and composer performing his "Concerto in Sol maggiore". In October 1909 he performed for King Vittorio Emanuele III, in the historical castle of Sommariva-Perno in Cuneo province, playing the "Prelude in Re maggiore" and the Mazurka-Concert "A Lei!". The king complimented Munier on the execution of the pieces and the extraordinary effects he obtained with the mandolin.
In autumn 1910, Munier left for a European tour that made stops in Marseilles and Antwerp. In Marseilles, he met his mandolinist friend Laurent Fantauzzi to whom he told of his plan to organize an impressive concert in Florence. Unfortunately, he never realized the event; on his return to Florence Munier contracted an unexpected illness and died on the 10th of February 1911, after an unexpected illness.
Munier first married Luisa De Fonseca, who died young and to whom he dedicated "Elegia" op 148. He then married Armida Bastianini with whom he had two daughters, Luisa and Elena.
Compositions.
Munier was a prolific composer. His catalogue includes more than 350 published works. With the exception of a few works, including the "Trio for mandolin, violoncello and piano" and the "Three quartets for 2 mandolins, mandola and lute", Munier wrote primarily for mandolin and guitar. His production of methods was also remarkable: the "Metodo completo" for mandolin in two volumes; "Lo Scioglidita" in four volumes and the "Venti Studi". His ouvre also included didactic works like the "Lezioni in Forma di Duetto" Op. 115 and the "Opere per Due Mandolini" (Op. 220, 228 and 230).

The Room (novel)

The Room is the second novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., first published in 1971.
Plot.
The novel centers on a nameless petty criminal locked in a remand cell, and explores his feelings of impotence, hatred and rage, and fantasies of revenge.
Reception.
Selby described the critical reception of the book as "the greatest reviews I've ever read in my life", although in reality it was not well received. The novel was regarded by Selby as the most disturbing book ever written, and Selby stated that he himself was unable to read it again for 20 years. At least one reviewer has expressed similar feelings, with claims that reading the novel made them physically sick. It has been described as "a terrifying journey into the darkest corners of the psyche."
In popular culture.
A section of "The Room" is used in Richard Linklater's "Waking Life", where a red-faced man in a jail cell describes in vivid detail the abuse he intends to inflict once he is released.

This species is almost identical to "R. hasseltii", except for the number of warts on the perigone lobes of the two species. Another distinctive feature of "R. cantleyi" is its ability to form flowers on the aerial portions of its host "Tetrastigma".
"R. cantleyi" was named after Nathaniel Cantley, curator of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Commission des Sciences et des Arts

The Commission des Sciences et des Arts or "Commission of the Sciences and Arts" was a French learned body set up on 16 March 1798. It was made up of 167 members, of which all but 16 joined Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt and produced the Description de l'Égypte. More than half were engineers and technicians, including 21 mathematicians, 3 astronomers, 17 civil engineers, 13 naturalists and mining engineers, geographers, 3 gunpowder engineers, 4 architects, 8 artists, 10 mechanical artists, 1 sculptor, 15 interpreters, 10 men of letters, 22 printers in Latin, Greek and Arabic characters. Bonaparte organised his scientific 'corps' like an army, dividing its members into 5 categories and assigning to each member a military rank and a defined military role (supply, billeting) beyond his scientific function.
Members.
Some members - like Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Monge, or Vivant Denon - are universally remembered but most have been all but forgotten. Some became members of the Institut d'Egypte.

Paluvettaraiyar

They were petty chiefs who were ruling present Kila-Paluvur and Mela-Paluvur, in the Udaiyarpalayam taluk of the Tiruchirapalli district, during Chola kingdom with the title Paluvettaraiyar. They were responsible for a number of benefactions to the temples at this place and to have been related to the Chola by marriage. About a dozen records pertaining to this dynasty.
Reference in south Indian inscriptions.
Paluvettaraiyar, a Chera Mutharayar figures largely in the inscriptions copied at Kila-Paaluvur and Mela-Paluvur in the Tiruchchirappalli District. A.R. No. 231 of 1926 dated in the 12th year of Parantaka, that Paluvettaraiyar Kandan Amudanar fought, on behalf of his Chola overlord, a victorious battle at Vellur against the forces of the Pandya king and his Ceylonese ally, in which the Pandya lost his life. To commemorate this success the Commander Nakkan Sattan of Paradur made a gift of a perpetual lamp to the temple of Tiruvalandurai-Mahadeva at Siru-Paluvur.
It is perhaps this Amudanar who is referred to in the Anbil Plates of Sundara Chola as a Kerala prince whose daughter was married to Parantaka I and bore him prince Arinjaya By ‘Kerala prince’ should be meant a relation of the Chera king.
Periya pazhuvettaraiyar based on udaiyargudi inscriptions: we need to refer "Pazhuvoor Pudhaiyalgal" by Dr.R.Kalaikkovan before speculating further. The last few pages of the book give a detailed chronology along with years. In the book, there are names like Kumaran Maravan, Maravan Kandan etc. - all taken from names mentioned in epigraphs found at Avani gandarpa easwaram temple at pazhuvoors. The person we are talking about was a mutharaiyar chief as evident from title "sozha ( Chola) mutharaiyan". Pazhuvetaraiyars bore the title "Pazhuvetaraiyan kandan maravan" etc.
Three other members of the family mentioned.
Kandan Maravan figures in two inscriptions, dated in the 4th and 7th years of Rajakesarivarmna identified with Rajaraja I, and is also mentioned in two epigraphs of the 15th and 16th year os Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola, similarly records are found of Maravan kandan covering about the same period in the 10th and 12th years of Rajakesarivarmn Sundara-chola. and between the 9th and 15th years of Parakesari Uttama-Chola. It appears as though these two chiefs were brothers who are stated in a record of the 12th year of Parakesari (Uttma-chola) from Udaiyargudi to have made a gift of land to the temple on behalf of his own younger brother Kandan Satrubhayankaran. It is also likely that he was known by the name Vikramaditya, whose wife Raman Koviyar is recorded to have made a gift of sheep for a lamp to the temple at Kila-Paluvur in the 8th year Uttama-Chola Parakesari.

Old Georgian language

Old Georgian () was the literary language of Christian Georgia beginning in the 4th century. The language remains as the only liturgical language of the Georgian Orthodox Church.
Spoken Old Georgian gave way to what is classified as Middle Georgian in the 11th century, which in turn developed into the modern Georgian language in the 17th century.
Fähnrich (1994) distinguishes three stages of Old Georgian: "Chanmeti" (4th to 7th centuries), "Haemeti" (7th and 8th centuries) and "Sani" (9th to 11th centuries), noting grammatical difference between the extant texts of these stages.
The texts of the "Chanmeti" and "Haemeti" stages (also known as "Early Old Georgian") are almost exclusively religious in nature, but from the 9th century ("Sani", also known as "Classical Old Georgian"), there was a literary tradition with a wider scope, including philosophilcal and historiographical documents.

Peter Harboe Castberg (2 October 1844 – 18 November 1926) was a Norwegian banker.
Personal life.
He was born in Larvik, Norway. His father, physician Tycho Fredrik Edvard Castberg, was the oldest living son of Peter Hersleb Harboe Castberg. As such Peter Harboe Castberg was the nephew of Johan Christian Tandberg Castberg and first cousin of Johan and Torgrim Castberg. In addition, Peter Harboe Castberg had one younger brother, the sculptor Oscar Ambrosius Castberg.
Peter Harboe Castberg married the English citizen Nina Benham in 1886. They had two sons, of whom one died young and one died in World War I, and one daughter.
Career.
Peter Harboe Castberg enrolled as a law student in 1862, but as he was later hired as a stenographer in the Norwegian Parliament, he quit the studies.

In 1902 he published "Ældre og nyere Udtalelser vedrørende Sveriges faste Forsvar". Both works pertained to the possible military tensions between Sweden and Norway, who were in a personal union at the time, the first work causing a greater interest in the northern part of the border. The question on the presence fortresses on the Norwegian-Swedish border would become a hot topic at the dissolution of the union in 1905, specifically in the Convention of Karlstad. In 1906 Castberg published "Production: en Studie", a monography in economy. Already the next year it was published in English.
Peter Harboe Castberg died in 1926 in London.

Right to Die?

Right to Die? is a documentary aired on Sky Real Lives in December 2008 (rebroadcast on PBS on 2 March 2010 as "The Suicide Tourist") about the assisted suicide of Craig Colby Ewert (1947–2006), a 59-year-old retired university professor who suffered from Lou Gehrig’s disease. Oscar-winning Canadian John Zaritsky directed and produced the film. "Right to Die?" had been previously shown on Canadian and Swiss television and at film festivals without controversy.
Ewert, who lived in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England where assisted suicide is punishable by 14 years in jail, travelled to Switzerland where he was assisted by the Dignitas NGO at a rented Zurich apartment. The documentary, which covers the last four days of life, shows him dying on 26 September 2006 with Mary, his wife of 37 years, at his side. An employee of the Swiss clinic, Dignitas, can be seen preparing a lethal dose of barbiturates on camera, following which Ewert drinks it and dies. He died listening to Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. Ewert's children, Ivan and Katrina, who live in the US, decided not to attend their father's death after he expressed concerns that they would become upset.
Reception.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown, questioned in the House of Commons, hours before the documentary was screened, told MPs that he "thinks it is very important that these issues are dealt with sensitively and without sensationalism and I hope broadcasters remember that they have a wider responsibility to the general public." He further explained his position: “I believe that it’s necessary to ensure that there is a never a case in the country where a sick or elderly person feels under pressure to agree to an assisted death or somehow feels it’s the expected thing to do. That’s why I’ve always opposed legislation for assisted deaths.” A spokesman for Dignity in Dying criticized Brown's statement: “Gordon Brown’s comments underline why there needs to be a full debate in Parliament on this issue.” Lord Warner, a former Health Minister, added: “Gordon Brown’s comments are not terribly helpful... Survey after survey has shown that 75-80 per cent of the population are in favour of assisted dying for the terminally ill when their pain has become unbearable, providing there are appropriate safeguards in place.” Privately, other politicians also criticised Gordon Brown, claiming that he had breached a convention of government neutrality by expressing a view on an issue recognised as one of conscience rather than party policy.
"The Sun" found the documentary deeply moving. Director John Zaritsky, said making a film about euthanasia without showing the moment of death would be "less than honest".
The broadcast on Sky was watched by 231,000 viewers. This was a huge boost to Sky Real Lives' ratings – the show had less than 10,000 viewers in the same time slot a week before. Mary Ewert defended the documentary against criticism that it was a "cynical attempt to boost television ratings". His son Ivan told "The Sun" from his home in Chicago, Illinois "I am very proud of what dad did".

1995 Northwestern Wildcats football team

The 1995 Northwestern Wildcats football team represented Northwestern University in the 1995 NCAA Division I-A college football season. 
Season.
Northwestern finished the season with a 10–2 record. Under head coach Gary Barnett, the trio of quarterback Steve Schnur, running back Darnell Autry, and linebacker Pat Fitzgerald lead the Wildcats to a dramatic turnaround for the program. "Expect Victory" was the motto even as Northwestern began the season as 28-point underdogs. A shocking 17–15 season-opening win over heavily favored Notre Dame, along with wins over Michigan, 19–13, and Penn State, 21–10, catapulted the team into the national spotlight and made them media darlings. Northwestern achieved a ranking of #3 in the nation and won the Big Ten Conference title. They faced off against USC in the Rose Bowl where the Wildcats' Cinderella season came to an abrupt halt with a 41–32 loss.

Cohomology with compact support

In mathematics, cohomology with compact support refers to certain cohomology theories, usually with some condition requiring that cocycles should have compact support.
de Rham cohomology with compact support for smooth manifolds.
Given a manifold "X", let formula_1 be the real vector space of "k"-forms on "X" with compact support, and "d" be the standard exterior derivative. Then the de Rham cohomology groups with compact support formula_2 are the homology of the chain complex formula_3:
"i.e.", formula_2 is the vector space of closed "q"-forms modulo that of exact "q"-forms.
Despite their definition as the homology of an ascending complex, the de Rham groups with compact support demonstrate covariant behavior; for example, given the inclusion mapping "j" for an open set "U" of "X", extension of forms on "U" to "X" (by defining them to be 0 on "X"–"U") is a map formula_6 inducing a map
They also demonstrate contravariant behavior with respect to proper maps - that is, maps such that the inverse image of every compact set is compact. Let "f": "Y" → "X" be such a map; then the pullback
induces a map
If "Z" is a submanifold of "X" and "U" = "X"–"Z" is the complementary open set, there is a long exact sequence
called the long exact sequence of cohomology with compact support. It has numerous applications, such as the Jordan curve theorem, which is obtained for "X" = R² and "Z" a simple closed curve in "X".
De Rham cohomology with compact support satisfies a covariant Mayer–Vietoris sequence: if "U" and "V" are open sets covering "X", then
where all maps are induced by extension by zero is also exact.

Olyfran

OLYFRAN, which stands for "Olympiade flamande du français" (French for "Flemish Olympiad for French") is a contest organised in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) to test students' knowledge of the French language (which is the language spoken in the southern part of Belgium, Wallonia).
History.
In 1987, Willy Clijsters, professor French as Foreign Language (FLE) at the Hasselt University and president of DiWeF, the association of Flemish teachers FLE, launched ""La Tour Eiffel - Concours de Français"."
This contest consisted of a written selection test of 100 multiple choice questions in three different categories, followed by a classification interview in front of a mixed jury of teachers and representatives of the business world. The elimination question lists are mainly centred on everyday communication and have been developed in a contrastive approach. This means that the questions are partially written in the source language, Dutch.
The initiative, which was launched in 1988 to make the teaching of French more dynamic for youngsters in the Belgian province of Limburg, welcomed about 1,200 participants from all over Flanders. Soon, all the Flemish universities (Leuven - Kortrijk - Ghent - Antwerp - Brussels) joined the organization. Growing very quickly and strongly since, LTECF has received in each of the last few years of the competitions about 5.000 candidates.
Meanwhile, the contest changed name and is now called ""the Flemish Olympiad for French”" "(Olyfran)." As part of this activity, every year 400 multiple choice question on the French language are drawn up by secondary school teachers and academics. All this material (over 5000 MCQ), provided with several parameters, is available for Francophiles and learners of French and their teachers on the Internet.

Rutland County College

Rutland County College is a post-16 (or sixth-form) college, based mainly in Oakham, Rutland, England. In September 2012 it opened on a new site in Barleythorpe on the outskirts of Oakham. 
Originally called Rutland Sixth Form College, it was built on the site of the former Rutland Girls' Grammar School. It was incorporated into Tresham College in August 2000, changing its name to Rutland College. 
In 2009 Tresham Institute announced its intention to withdraw from Oakham. Tresham sold the existing buildings and land, leaving the local community to find a new site and the capital to build a new 16-19 college. In autumn 2009 Rutland County Council announced that Casterton Business and Enterprise College (an 11-16 community college) would take responsibility, in partnership with the County Council and Tresham, for managing the college and would provide 100 sixth form places at its Great Casterton site in addition to Oakham. The second phase of the proposal included moving to a new site and in November 2010 it was announced that the College would relocate to occupy the former EEF Conference Centre in Barleythorpe in September 2012.
The College prospectus describes a new post-16 programme with a range of courses including ‘A Level’ subjects, the new 14-19 diplomas, apprenticeships, or career specific ‘vocational’ training.
The College was judged Outstanding by Ofsted in November 2010.
Former and participating students formed the 'Hand-stitched Theatre Company' who were rated four stars at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Bob Sijthoff

Henri Gregory (Bob) Sijthoff is a Dutch businessman.
Family.
Sijthoff is a descendant of the famous Dutch Sijthoff family. The family is known through their connections to the Luitingh-Sijthoff publishing company and to several regional newspapers like the now defunct "Haagsche Courant". The publishing company and the "Haagsche Courant" were the property of Sijthoff's grandfather Henri, but have since passed into the hands of other Sijthoff family members.
"Het Financieele Dagblad".
Sijthoff's father, Henk Sijthoff (1915–2000), was the founder of the Dutch business newspaper "Het Financieele Dagblad" (The Financial Daily). After a lengthy negotiation, this newspaper was ultimately sold in 1997 for a converted sum of €38 million. Bob Sijthoff had become a Commissioner of the paper well before this sale. Founder Henk Sijthoff died three years later and Bob Sijthoff inherited a part of his wealth. Sijthoff has since resigned as Commissioner of "Het Financieele Dagblad" and sold his company interests. Willem Sijthoff, a grandnephew of Bob, together with a company known as HAL Investments, became the new owners of "Het Financieele Dagblad".
Controversies.
Prison time for extortion.
Sijthoff has been involved in several controversies in his time. On 15 April 2008 it became known that Sijthoff had invited Swiss banker Hurlimann to his office in 2004 to put pressure on him to make a statement in favor of Sijthoff. In April 2008, Sijthoff had to account for his actions before the court in The Hague. In juli 2004 Sijthoff had already been held by the Swiss Justice and arrested and detained for two weeks On March 11, 2009, the The Hague court convicted Sijthoff to 18 months in prison for extortion.
Housing deal.
In an article in "Quote" in July 2006, Jort Kelder states that a confidant of Willem Endstra told him that Sijthoff bought two pit houses in Amsterdam from Endstra in March 2001 through the mediation of Willem Holleeder. Kelder claims that cadastre data showed that the apartments were sold well below market value: the apartments were sold for €374,369 each to Sijthoff.
Wikipedia.
In November 2008 Sijthoff made the news because he did not want an article about him published on the Dutch Wikipedia. According to him the article contained "false and abusive" texts. He sued "the Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland" and "the Stichting Wikimedia Nederland" and demanded the publication of the particulars of the author of the article and that the article would be removed from the Dutch Wikipedia. He is the first Dutchman demanding through the court that his Wikipedia article be removed. Ruling on this case took place on December 10, 2008. The court rejected his request. The judge stated that he has sued the wrong entity. The legal responsibility for the content of the articles would not lie in the Netherlands, but with the American Wikimedia Foundation. According to the court, Sijthoffs lawyer did not make it sufficiently plausible that the Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland and the Stichting Wikimedia Nederland have control over the provision and content of the Dutch version of Wikipedia.
Autosport.
As a sportsman, Sijthoff races together with his son Diederik Sijthoff in the team of ACS Racing in the Dutch Supercar Challenge. The team drives a Marcos Mantis with starting number 241. In 2000 Sijthoff took part of the Dutch Toerwagen-kampioenschap in a Honda Integra on the Circuit Park Zandvoort together with his team mate Bert Ploeg with the team name BPR Honda.

Design work was carried out by the National Park Service Landscape Division.
The lookout was the first in Yosemite, and was still in use in the 1980s. It was designed in the National Park Service Rustic style, and is one of only four similar structures in California, with the Henness Ridge Fire Lookout being the only other in Yosemite. These lookouts were specifically designed to blend with their surroundings, in contrast to the metal towers used by the U.S. Forest Service. The Crane Flat lookout was included in an influential portfolio of park structures assembled by Thomas Chalmers Vint, chief landscape architect of the National Park Service to be used as prototypes for general use.

Rodrigo Prats

Rodrigo Prats (Rodrigo Ricardo Prats Llorens, Sagua La Grande, 7 February 1909 – Havana, 15 September 1980) was a Cuban composer, arranger, violinist, pianist and orchestral director.
Biography.
The son of a musician, Jaime Prats, Rodrigo began to study music at the age of nine. He studied at first under his father, then under Emilio Reynosa, and finished later at the Conservatorio Orbón.
When only thirteen he played violin in the Cuban Jazz Band, the first band of its type in Cuba, which was directed by his father. At around the same time he joined the "Orquesta Sinfónica de la Habana", founded by Gonzalo Roig. Prats' first work as a director of an orchestra was for the theatrical company of Arquímedes Pous; later he fronted many other groups. He was the founder of the radio band "Orquesta Sinfónica del Aire", the "Orquesta de Cámara del Círculo de Bellas Artes". He was deputy director of the "Orquesta Filharmónica de la Habana", musical director of "RHC-Cadena Azul", and of "Canal 4 de TV". Prats was the founder and director at the "Teatro Jorge Anckermann", and the musical director of the "Teatro Lírico de La Habana". He joined the faculty of Havana's Studio Sylvia M. Goudie in 1956 after his stint at the Iranzo Conservatory.
His body of work includes popular music, sainetes (short comedies), and zarzuelas. Prats composed "Una rosa de Francia", a famous criolla-bolero, at 15, and many other pieces, including "Aquella noche", "Espero de ti", "Creo que te quiero" and "El tamalero". He wrote the music for sainetes such as "El bravo" and "Soledad", and zarzuelas such as "Amalia Batista", "El pirata", "Guamá", "La perla del Caribe" and "María Belén Chacón". It is probably this work for the Cuban musical theatre for which he is best remembered.

<doc id="20627012" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20627012" title="Retail concentration">
Retail concentration

Retail concentration refers to the market-share generally belonging to the top 4 or 5 mass distribution firms present in a regional market, as a percentage of the total.
Retail concentration is not simply a concentration ratio as is emerging in the food sector. This is due to two factors: the particular relevance retail is gaining on a global scale, and the particular shape of the food supply chain.
In recent years, Retail Concentration moved ahead with fusions and acquisitions along the entire food supply chain. We can assume with Grievink (2003) that in a few years there will be only 5 dominant actors in the globalised food chain.
The same researcher states that in the 90's the top-5 food manufacturers could count on twice the cash flow of the top-5 retailers. Nowadays the relation is inverted: the top 5 retailers can count on twice that of the top-5 manufacturers.
Thus, the food chain has become increasingly vertically integrated, with global corporations able to coordinate inputs from the seed to the field, from the stable to the table. Retail concentration by one hand is the answer that retail is giving to compete with the giants of agrofood industry. By the other hand, is the agrofood industry in itself searching to arrive directly to the consumers, through a refined relations system. In this process, private labels are increasingly attracting consumers, and are expected to grow more and more on their fidelisation strategy, beating on quality, safety and also ethical values.
Recently the European Commission proposed solutions to face with overall price increase about foodstuff. Among the measures proposed, several relate to the retail power recently acquired.
In particular, the payments delay to the producers; the additional fees asked to the producers to place on the shelves branded products; price transparency; better regulation on promotional activities and openings/closing time are all issues on the agenda.
For supporters, retail concentration means more chances for consumers, lower prices, better quality. For opponents, by the contrary, the disappearing of traditional shops, of food culture, of neighborhood life in general. Furthermore, too much concentration means squeezing the price of industry and of agriculture, which can lead to outsourcing food from anywhere it can cost less, without a truly long term impact assessment.
Tim Lang (Food Wars, Earthscan London 2004) described the retail concentration phenomenon such as a "food war", in which winners and losers take place. Tim Lang talks about "food clusters" ([p. 84]) to better handle the idea of concentration along the entire food chain.
There are a lot of legal instruments which allow to get more and more concentrated.
Acquisition being the first one, follow mergers, joint ventures, partnerships and more not formalised contracts/ agreements.
Note that the "hypermarketization" is not limited to the Western World, but supermarkets rise fast also in the less developed countries and in the East and in the South of the World.
Regarding that, there are a lot of concerns, pretending that the overwhelming power of retailing is making poorer and poorer farmers, in particular in the LDC (Less Developed Countries). The "crowding out" effect on local agricultures it is basically due to the global sourcing of the produces, wherever they cost less and offer more. To say it with the words of the Italian food-thinker Corrado Finardi to fairly function, the agricultural system has a different, slower timeline than the market (in agriculture counts the long term investment, while on the global market it is more important the precise moment in which supply and demand match).
Market concentration (considering the upper and lower tails)
A more refined form, which calculates the percentage of last 4/ competitors on the first 4/5. 
Eve in its static version, it measures the level of competition in the sector. 
A diachronic comparison allows for even more insights.
Herfindahl Hirschman Index
This index is used in Europe and in the USA for antitrust regulatory purposes, in order to assess the feasibility of mergers and acquisitions.
The HHI is calculated as the relative frequencies squared and summed, comprehensive of all actors in the playfield. So far, it gives more importance to biggest player in proportion. 
Even if interesting, a HHI, often wrongly assess the real behaviours on the field.
Consider, for the comparison sake, the retail concentration in Europe. Top 5 retail distributors account for the 70% of the market share. Even if apparently it gives the idea of a highly concentrated market, the HHI does not allow for that conclusion in most of the cases. 
Following 3 different scenarios, we explored the relative market shares of the single actors.
1 scenario: 1= 19%, 2=15%, 3=14%, 4= 12%, 5=10% (total=70% for the top 5), remaining= 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 9%.
In this first case, where there is a linear distribution of market share among players, the HHI scores at 0,121 (considered a moderate concentration indicator)
2 scenario: 14% *5 (top 5 players =70%, having equal market share), the remaining, each equalling 3% (3%*10). In this second case, the HHI scores an 0,098, which stands for an unconcentrated market at all. We can deliberately make some reflections on that, since the HHI seems not taking into account opportunistic behaviours in the direction of oligopoly. It is assumed that, because of the equal market power of the top 5 actors, they are going to compete (even if history shows that more probably they find some form of implicit agreement…). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,033571429 (very low…).
3 scenario. First player= 20%, followers 12%, then 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 4% and the last 10 each 3%.
In this case the HHI is 0,0944 (not concentrated market, even if not highly competitive environment). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,0378 (very low…).
Even in a case where there is one leading competitor which “makes the market” as in the 3rd scenario, the HHI stays relatively low.

Morton Lochs

Morton Lochs is part of Tentsmuir National Nature Reserve (NNR) located near Tayport, in the north east of Fife, Scotland. It consists of three small lochs important for a variety of waterfowl species. Access to the nature reserve can be gained from the public footpath through Scotscraig golf course in Tayport, from the many footpaths in Tentsmuir Forest, or by road by turning off towards Morton on the B945 between Tayport and Leuchars. There is a small car park beside the reserve which is close to the two main footpaths. Surrounding the lochs are three bird hides that are accessible for public use, and another hide that requires a key available from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Three of the hides sit on the largest of the three lochs with the other being on the South Loch.
History.
Morton Lochs is not a naturally occurring wetland system; it was made by local land owners, the Christie family, in 1906. They initially flooded this area of dune heath for fishing, but it quickly became an important centre for wintering wildfowl. Perhaps the most notable visitor is the teal, which comes in its hundreds at times according to entries made in the record book in the hide. The teal is also the emblem for the NNR, and appears on signs at the entrance to the reserve. Morton Lochs was defined as an NNR in 1952, at the time being the second NNR in the UK.
Biodiversity.
The surrounding woodland of Morton Lochs and Tentsmuir are an important habitat for the red squirrel, which can often be seen right outside the John Berry hide. Bird feeders are placed around the woodland and outside the John Berry hide and attract a range of tits, finches and Great Spotted Woodpecker.
Wildfowl visitors to the loch include Water Rail, Goldeneye, Little Grebe, Teal, Mallard, Moorhen, Greylag Goose, Mute Swan and many more. Other sightings have included Kingfisher, Marsh Harrier, Osprey and Otters.

Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi

Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (PSUAD) or Université Paris-Sorbonne Abou Dhabi (UPSAD) is a French and English speaking university in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates.
An international agreement between the French University Paris-Sorbonne or Paris IV, and the government of Abu Dhabi was signed on 19 February 2006 with the aim of bringing to Abu Dhabi the best international standards in higher education. PSUAD was established on 30, May 2006 by decree of the ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates). The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education as the establishment of the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in 2007 shows as well.
The University opened its doors on 7 October 2006 in a temporary building. On 6 December 2009, PSUAD moved into its permanent campus on Al Reem Island. PSUAD campus features approximately 93,000m2 of newly built, teaching and recreational facilities, including accommodation for students, a library that accommodates 200,000 books, a 700-seated guest- auditorium, a sports centre and a spacious cafeteria. It is worth mentioning that the DH 1.6bn campus comes to translate the shared vision of the government of Abu Dhabi and the government of France. 
PSUAD remains true to the same teaching structure implemented in Paris. The campus of Abu Dhabi offers a whole array of subjects as in Sorbonne-Paris and Paris-Descartes. Its teachings are exclusively delivered by lecturers from the Paris following the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). PSUAD is a full part of the European higher education area (or Bologna process), the European unified system of higher education. The teaching language is French. Paris Descartes University or Paris V is a partner for the Economics and Law programmes.Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University or Paris VI will deliver a diploma in physics in English, beginning in September 2013. The degrees are French degrees.
(European Licence = 3-year undergraduate programmes) 
Master Programmes
PSUAD is a common place to meet a student who had no prior mastery of French language ultimately speaking French fluently and self-assuredly in a year’s time. The Intensive French Course prepares students’ integration into the Licence Programmes. 
PSUAD is ruled by Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC). PSUAD is managed by a board of six members, three of whom are appointed by Paris-Sorbonne University, the other three are appointed by Abu Dhabi Executive Council. PSUAD President is Paris-Sorbonne President and chairman of the board according to the agreement.
The research programmes at PSUAD benefit from the world class research work carried out in the field of humanities and social sciences at Université Paris-Sorbonne and Paris-Descartes. Upon completion of their undergraduate studies in Abu Dhabi, students will be able to choose whether to carry on with one of the Master programmes in Abu Dhabi or to join one of the departments in Paris where some of the world’s most renowned professors will guide them through their research, covering fields as varied as medieval Islam, intercultural processes, travel literature, national and international geopolitics and will allow each student to find support wherever their field of interest is. 
Highlighting the importance of dialogue between cultures, and the exchange of knowledge, PSUAD organises all year round lectures, round table discussions and colloquia hosting renowned experts from the region and beyond to shed the light on key aspects and phenomena in a wide range of fields. Most of these functions are open to public and provide simultaneous translation into Arabic and English. 
The university residence offers one type of rooms; that is the single accommodation. Two residence blocks are available; one for male students and another for female students. The university residence is adjacent to the main campus to facilitate students’ daily commute. PSUAD campus is located near the center of Abu Dhabi city which makes it close to main landmarks and attractions.
Sorbonne-Abu Dhabi lecturer Nasser Ben Ghaith was arrested for making pro-democracy remarks in April 2011, alongside two other pro-democracy campaigners including blogger Ahmed Mansoor.

Community Hospice of Northeast Florida

Community Hospice of Northeast Florida, also known simply as Community Hospice, is a not-for-profit hospice, which has served the Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan Area since its inception in 1979. The organization was the first hospice program in Northeast Florida and one of a few operating programs in the state when Florida began granting hospice licenses in 1981; Community Hospice received their license in 1983 and in 2008, assisted nearly 1,000 patients daily and more than 6,000 patients a year 
History.
Community Hospice was founded by two nurses, one minister and a small group of volunteers who worked out of an office at Methodist Hospital. The program was certified by Medicare in 1983, and like all Hospice organizations in the United States, relies on Medicare for 80-85% of their revenue. Unlike most other hospices, Community Hospice receives no money from the local United Way; instead relying on the "Community Hospice Foundation" as a reliable source of funding. The remainder of their operating income comes from contributions from clients, fund raising initiatives throughout the year and private insurance payments.
Children.
The needs of children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions are very different from those of adults. Community PedsCare, is the pediatric palliative and hospice program developed by Community Hospice in collaboration with Wolfson Children's Hospital, "Nemours Children's Clinic" and University of Florida. The program, begun in 2000, offers individualized support, comfort and care to these children and their families.
In October, 2008, PedsCare was a recipient of the 2008 "Quality in Palliative Care Leadership Award", which is "presented annually to recognize organizations which have enhanced their palliative care services by implementing the palliative care principles supported by the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care and the National Quality Forum".
Locations.
Community Hospice provides services to 90% of the Greater Jacksonville market area. The organization has several outreach centers and four "Centers for Caring" for patients who require treatment for symptoms that cannot be managed in another setting. A facility in St. Johns County, Florida is the newest inpatient location. 
Other community outreach offices are located at Gateway Office and Yulee/Nassau County Office.
Education.
The "Charles M. Neviaser Educational Institute" at Community Hospice provides clinical education to area medical professionals on subjects related to hospice and palliative care, including pain management, the dying process, grief and loss, advance directives and ethics in end-of-life care. There are no other independent, nonprofit hospices in Florida that provide this information.
In September, 2004, the Neviaser Educational Institute, together with Mayo Clinic Jacksonville established a 12-month physician fellowship in palliative medicine to train physicians in end-of-life or chronic, non-curable disease care. 
The Institute also served the Northeast Florida community with educational outreach programs to consumers.
Foundation.
The Community Hospice Foundation, established in 2000, provides funding to support end-of-life care and education. Funding is made possible through individual and corporate donations, planned gifts from will and estates, and special fundraising events.
Fund Raisers.
Community Hospice holds several fund raisers each year with proceeds benefiting patients who are unable to pay for their care. Among them:
In addition, it maintains the Community Hospice Thrift Shop to help raise funds. 
Other groups and organizations have also assisted in fundraising for Community Hospice of Northeast Florida. The Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance has primarily donated its annual proceeds to Community Hospice of Northeast Florida, totalling over $1.5 million since 1998. The Esprit de Corps, a group of young professionals founded in 1986, provides volunteers to assist in Community Hospice events.
Homicide Survivors.
Community Hospice was awarded a $70,000 grant to support the "Homicide Survivor's Program", a pilot project at the Duval County Medical Examiner's Office. Counselors provided grief and loss services to family members of homicide victims. In 2005, there were 125 homicides in the 4th Judicial Circuit.
Five Wishes.
Aging with Dignity named Community Hospice of Northeast Florida as the 2006 "National Innovator" for being the single largest distributor in the United States of the "Five Wishes" living will. Community Hospice distributed 358,000 copies of the living will to residents of Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns counties. The document was created by Aging with Dignity.
Georgia.
Community Hospice merged with Hospice of Southeast Georgia in 1994, creating Community Hospice of Southeast Georgia (CHSG). The organization assisted 100-125 patients yearly in Glynn, McIntosh, Ware, Camden, Brantley and Charlton counties in Georgia. As "Hospice of the Golden Isles" in Brunswick, Georgia grew, they expanded their service area, which overlapped that of CHSG. There were barely enough patients for one agency, and CHSG lost $200,000 in FY 2000, so to avoid competing, CHSG stopped accepting patients in late 2001.

Ombudsman for Local Governments in Kerala

Ombudsman for Local Governments in the Indian state of Kerala is an independent quasi judicial authority which investigates the complaints against local governments in Kerala or the functionaries working under them. The Ombudsman is functioning at the State level with its Head Quarters in the State Capital. Possibly no other State in India has such an institution to oversee the functioning of Local Self Government Institutions. A former judge of a High Court can be appointed as Ombudsman.Local Government Ombudsman in Kerala has been modelled in the pattern of Local Government Ombudsman, United Kingdom.But it has been endowed with the powers of punishment.
Ombudsman is a Swedish word, which means "citizen's defender" It is essentially a Scandinavian institution through which administrative actions are overseen by an independent authority to contain abuse of discretion, mal-administration etc. 
The Objectives.
The objectives of Ombudsman for Local Governments are to deal with corruption and mal-administration in local governments in Kerala. Ombudsman can conduct investigation and or enquiry in respect of any action involving corruption or maladministration or irregularities in the discharge of administrative functions by Local Self Government Institutions or by an employee or an officer working under the Local Self Government Institution or by an employee or an officer working in any office or institutions transferred to such Local Self Govt. Institution or by any elected Member of the Local Self Govt. Institutions including its President or Chairperson and for the disposal of any complaint relating to such action in accordance with the provisions of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. The Ombudsman can look into instances of favouritism, nepotism, lack of integrity, excessive action, inaction, abuse of position, etc. on the part of officials and elected representatives of all local governments (Corporations, Municipalities, and Panchayaths of all three levels)in Kerala.
Ombudsman can even register cases suo moto if instances of the above kind come to his notice. His sittings can be anywhere in the State and at his discretion. He is not fully bound by the rigid provisions of the Indian Evidence Act and the Procedure Codes. Advocates can appear in the cases before the Ombudsman only if specifically permitted to do so for stated reasons. These provisions make the functioning of the Institution very flexible and enables conduct of cases fast and inexpensive. At present sittings of Ombudsman are held at Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, and Kozhikode. Occasionally sittings are also held at other places like Kannoor, Palakkad, etc. also.
A Brief History.
The Institution started functioning in the year 2000 as a 7 member body with a Retd. Judge of the High Court as its Chairman. The successor government changed the constitution and made it a single member body through an amendment of the Panchayath Raj Act in the year 2001. During the preceding 3 years the office was held by Mr. Justice T.K. Chandrasekhar Das and before that by Mr. Justice K.P. Radhakrishna Menon. The Chairman of the 7 member body which was functional in the year 2000 was Mr. Justice P.A. Mohamed. All of them have rendered exemplary service to the institution. With effect from 17-3-2008 the office of Ombudsman is held by Mr. Justice M.R. Hariharan Nair, a former Judge of the High Court of Kerala and his vibrancy is evident from the newspaper reports on his actions (See the inks below). His appointment was for a term of 3 years which ended on 16-3-2011.
Justice M N Krishnan, who served as the High Court Judge from 28 October 2004 to 10 February 2011, is expected to join the position of Ombudsman for Local Governments in Kerala by 20 April 2011.
Mode of Submitting Complaints.

Second ARC hails Ombudsman system.
On institutionalizing the Ombudsman system in other state, the Second Administrative Commission Report Vol 6 (page 99) on Local Governance says as follows :-
"... there is need for institutionalising a grievance redressal mechanism which would address complaints regarding elected functionaries and officials of the local bodies. This would provide a platform to the citizens for voicing their complaints and also bring out the deficiencies in the system for suitable remedial action. With increased devolution to the local government institutions, a plethora of developmental schemes will be implemented at the grass roots level. On an average, a Panchayat could be handling a crore worth of programmes every year. Such a large size of public funds increases public expectations. It also gives rise to concerns that decentralisation without proper safeguards may increase corruption, particularly if the process is not simultaneously accompanied by the creation of suitable accountability mechanisms similar to those available at the Union and State Government levels. The Commission in its Fourth Report on "Ethics in Governance" considered this issue. It was of the view that a local body Ombudsman should be constituted for a group of districts to look into complaints of corruption and maladministration against functionaries of local bodies, both elected members and officials. For this, the term ‘Public Servant’ should be defined appropriately in the respective State legislations. The Ombudsman should have the authority to investigate cases and submit report to competent authorities for taking action. Such competent authorities should normally take action as recommended. In case of disagreement, reasons must be recorded in writing and be placed in the public domain. These would require amendments in the respective State Panchayat Acts and the Urban Local Bodies Acts to include provisions pertaining to the local body Ombudsman".

U.S. Route 212 in Minnesota

Within the U.S. state of Minnesota, U.S. Highway 212 travels from the South Dakota state line in the west, crossing the southwestern part of the state, to the Minneapolis – Saint Paul metropolitan area in the east, ending at its interchange with U.S. 169 and State Highway 62 in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina. U.S. 212 in Minnesota has an official length of . It is an urban freeway within the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area, and is mostly a two-lane rural road elsewhere in the state.
Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Highway system, most of the U.S. 212 corridor in Minnesota was part the transcontinental auto trail known as the Yellowstone Trail, which was established in 1917. U.S. 212 was established in 1926 but originally terminated at U.S. Highway 12 in the city of Willmar from 1926 to 1934. U.S. 212 was shifted to its current alignment around 1934, continuing slightly east of its current terminus to end at then U.S. 12 in Saint Paul until 1982, when U.S. 212 was truncated to Edina. In 2008, the Twin Cities portion of U.S. 212 was relocated to a new freeway (formerly designated as State Highway 312 from 2003 to 2008).
Route description.
U.S. Highway 212 in Minnesota passes through seven counties in the southern part of the state, from the South Dakota state line to the Twin Cities area. It runs in straight east–west course from the South Dakota line across prairie land to the city of Montevideo. From there the route follows the valley of the Minnesota River to Granite Falls. It then leaves the Minnesota River valley to pass through farming areas until Glencoe, where the terrain gradually becomes more hilly as the road continues east. As the route approaches the Twin Cities, the road becomes a freeway running parallel to, but not within, the Minnesota River valley. U.S. 212 ends at the junction of U.S. 169 and State Highway 62 in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina.
The entire length of U.S. Highway 212 in Minnesota is officially designated the "Minnesota Veterans Memorial Highway".
Legally, the Minnesota section of U.S. 212 is defined as Legislative Routes 155, 12, 187, and 260 in the Minnesota Statutes. The route is not marked with those numbers.
South Dakota to Granite Falls.
U.S. 212 crosses into Minnesota from South Dakota, traveling through flat, open terrain. About from the state line, it intersects with U.S. Highway 75, then enters the small city of Dawson several miles later. U.S. 212 continues past Dawson through more fertile prairie land, eventually being joined by U.S. Highway 59. The overlapped routes pass by the entrance to "Camp Release State Park", a park where the former Sioux village of Chief Red Iron was located, and which also contains a granite monument commemorating the release of 269 prisoners from Sioux captivity. U.S. 212 and 59 split in the western edge of the city of Montevideo in the valley of the Minnesota River, with U.S. 59 heading northwest and U.S. 212 heading southeast. U.S. 212 follows the Minnesota valley for about thirteen miles (19 km) to the city of Granite Falls. In the center of the city, State Highway 23 joins U.S. 212 briefly as they cross the Minnesota River, with the two routes splitting soon after leaving the eastern city limits. The city of Granite Falls is known as being the hometown of Andrew Volstead, who authored the National Prohibition Act.
Granite Falls to Glencoe.
East of Granite Falls, U.S. 212 leaves the Minnesota River valley, heading due east across a variety of farming areas in the south central portion of the state. For the next , U.S. 212 passes through a series of small cities in this area: Sacred Heart, Renville, Danube, and Olivia. In Olivia, the county seat of Renville County, U.S. 212 meets with U.S. Highway 71. U.S. 212 continues due east through more farmland, again passing through a series of small cities that developed along the route. Through the next of the road, U.S. 212 goes through Bird Island, Hector (intersecting with State Highway 4), Buffalo Lake, Stewart and Brownton (intersecting with State Highway 15). Brownton, which is located on Buffalo Creek, is the site of the Sioux Uprising, one of the earliest massacres of white settlers in the region. Several miles later, U.S. 212 is joined by State Highway 22, U.S. 212 becomes a four-lane divided highway heading east into the city of Glencoe closely following Buffalo Creek. Highway 22 splits off to the north in downtown Glencoe, while U.S. 212 heads east out of the city.
Glencoe to the Twin Cities area.
East of Glencoe, the terrain becomes progressively more hilly as U.S. 212 continues eastward. U.S. 212 is joined by State Highway 5 and State Highway 25 about eight miles (13 km) after leaving Glencoe. The three overlapped routes continue east into the city of Norwood Young America for about two miles (3 km), after which Highways 5 and 25 split off to the north in the center of the city. After leaving Norwood Young America, U.S. 212 becomes a two-lane road, passing by several lakes, then continues east for several miles to the city of Cologne, then into the community of Dahlgren. East of Dahlgren, U.S. 212 becomes a freeway as it heads into the Twin Cities area. The freeway runs along the northwest upland of the Minnesota River valley.
After the first interchange on the freeway with "Jonathan Carver Parkway", U.S. 212 enters the city limits of Chaska. The road then curves to the north, crossing over Chaska Creek and interchanging with "Engler Boulevard", before turning northeastward. The freeway meets with State Highway 41. Less than two miles (3 km) later, the freeway enters the city of Chanhassen, where it has two interchanges and passes by several lakes. U.S. 212 then crosses into Hennepin County and into the city of Eden Prairie. U.S. 212 is joined by State Highway 5 in Eden Prairie for about as they travel eastward. The overlap with Highway 5 ends at the cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 494. At the boundary between Eden Prairie and Edina, U.S. 212 is paralleled by State Highway 62 and the two routes have a junction with U.S. Highway 169. U.S. Highway 212 officially ends at the eastern limit of this interchange in Edina, where eastbound U.S. 212 merges into eastbound Highway 62. Highway 62 continues the roadway into the city of Minneapolis.
History.
Auto trails.
Most of the route of present day U.S. Highway 212 between Montevideo and Norwood Young America was originally designated as part of the transcontinental auto trail known as the Yellowstone Trail, which was conceived in 1912. The "Yellowstone Trail" stretched from Seattle, Washington, via Yellowstone National Park, to Plymouth, Massachusetts. The auto trail route in Minnesota was officially recognized by the Minnesota Highway Department in 1917. East of Norwood Young America, the "Yellowstone Trail" utilized State Highway 5, shifting to "Excelsior Boulevard" via the "Minnewashta Parkway" to reach Minneapolis. West of Montevideo, the "Yellowstone Trail" used present day State Highway 7 to U.S. Highway 12.
The westernmost section of present day U.S. 212, from the South Dakota line to Montevideo, was also part of another auto trail known as the "Short Cut West Highway". This auto trail went on a direct route between Minneapolis and Yellowstone National Park. The "Yellowstone Trail" also connects Minneapolis with Yellowstone National Park but travels a longer, more circuitous route through many populated centers. Between Montevideo and the Twin Cities area, the "Short Cut West Highway" ran along State Highway 7 until Lake Minnewashta, where it ended at the "Yellowstone Trail".
Designation as a U.S. Highway.
In 1926, the U.S. Highway system was implemented in the country. U.S. 212 was originally designated as a route that connected U.S. 85 in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, with U.S. 12 in Willmar, Minnesota. In 1934, U.S. 212 was extended east to Saint Paul along mostly its modern alignment. In the Twin Cities area, U.S. 212 utilized "Flying Cloud Drive" and "Vernon Avenue" to reach "Excelsior Boulevard". It then followed "Lake Street" through Minneapolis, crossing the Mississippi River into Saint Paul and becoming "Marshall Avenue", finally ending at then U.S. 12 in downtown Saint Paul. In 1983, U.S. 212 was truncated to end at U.S. Highway 169 in Edina, resulting in U.S. 212 no longer connecting to U.S. 12, its parent route.
Construction.
The paving of U.S. 212 in Minnesota began in 1928 and the route was completely paved by 1940. The earliest sections to be paved were the roads east of State Highway 15, which was paved by 1929. The portion of the route in Renville County was paved by 1931, while the portion between U.S. Highway 75 and Granite Falls was paved between 1932 and 1934. The portion west of U.S. Highway 75 had originally been a county road and was only added to the state highway system in 1934. Paving of this section was finished in 1938. The portion that overlapped with State Highway 5 was paved by 1940.
Over the next few decades, several sections of the road were reconstructed as four-lanes divided highways. The four-lane road between Glencoe and Norwood Young America was completed in 1959. The expressway approach in the vicinity of I-494 was completed by 1971. Several other segments were reconstructed in 1990, namely the old "Flying Cloud Drive" alignment, which became a four-lane divided surface arterial, and the State Highway 5 overlap, which became an expressway.
The section of the route between Glencoe and Chaska currently alternates between a 65 mph four-lane expressway and a 55 mph two-lane roadway. A four-way stop sign in Glencoe is located within the 65 mph expressway segment of the route. Counties and cities along Highway 212 are lobbying to extend the four-lane divided highway west of Glencoe. Mn/DOT is considering the proposal.
From Hector to State Highway 22 near Glencoe, the route is planned to be reconstructed with passing lanes beginning in 2009.
Highway 312.
Between Eden Prairie and Chaska, U.S. Highway 212 was relocated in July 2008 to a new, more northerly, freeway alignment. During planning and construction, the new freeway was given the temporary designation of Highway 312.
On April 29, 2002, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta was in the Twin Cities for an announcement regarding transportation in Minnesota. Mineta presented a $2.9 million check (Federal Highway Administration grant) to state transportation officials. The $2.9 million is part of the $238 million funding for the new freeway alignment of U.S. Highway 212 in Eden Prairie, Chanhassen, and Chaska. The groundbreaking celebration on August 20, 2005, was held in Chaska. Elected officials at the ceremony included former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman, former U.S. Rep. Mark Kennedy, U.S. Rep. John Kline, former U.S. Rep. Jim Ramstad and Lieutenant Governor Carol Molnau. Lieutenant Governor and Transportation Commissioner Molnau said that "When the Legislature approved the $900 million Transportation Finance Bill secured by the Pawlenty Administration during 2003, we were able to advance Highway 212 as a 'design-build' project by eight years from its originally scheduled start between 2010 and 2015."
On December 7, 2007, a six-mile (10 km) portion of the project from "Dell Road" in Eden Prairie to State Highway 41 in Chaska opened to traffic, giving drivers use of about half of the new freeway alignment. It was signed using its temporary designation of State Highway 312. On July 14, 2008, the remaining portion of the project from Highway 41 to just west of Carver opened to traffic. The new freeway has a designated shoulder on both sides for a planned Bus Rapid Transit route extending from Carver, MN to points eastward along the freeway.
Soon after the completion of Highway 312, the "312" route number was retired and Highway 212 was relocated onto the new freeway. The former surface alignment of Highway 212 along "Flying Cloud Drive" was turned back to the maintenance of Carver and Hennepin counties as County Road 61.

Bellamira (play)

Bellamira: or, The Mistress is a comedy by Sir Charles Sedley, published in 1687, partly modelled on Terence's "Eunuchus"
Stage History and reception.
Ascertaining the exact number of performances of "Bellamira" presents some problems. It is a fact that "Bellamira" was performed by the United Company in the Drury Lane Theatre on 12 May 1687. "Bellamira" may also have been performed in the Dorset Garden Theatre. However, as it was a standard play, without fancy scenery or machinery, the Drury Lane Theatre is the most likely place of performance. According to "The London Stage", 12 May, however, may not be regarded as the première. It is uncertain how many performances followed in the season of 1687/88, and there may have been a revival of the play in the season of 1690/91.
At least two sources testify that "Bellamira" was not a failure in spite of obvious criticism from parts of the audience. The first testimony is that of Thomas Shadwell, who, in his "Tenth Satyr of Juvenal" (1687), which is dedicated to Sedley, thanks Sir Charles for his patronage, adding: "Your late great obligation in giving me the advantage of your Comedy, call’d "Bellamira", or the "Mistress", has given me a fresh subject for my Thanks ... I am heartily glad that your Comedy (as I never doubted) found such success, that I never met with any Man of Sence but applauded it" ("The Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell", ed. Montague Summers, Vol. V, p. 291). The phrase "advantage" here presumably means that Sedley offered Shadwell, a Whig out of favour and debarred from the theatre in the mid-1680s, the third night's income to support him. If this is correct, "Bellamira" was performed more often than two times.
The second source of the play's success is that it went into print within six weeks after the première. However, instant publication does not necessarily speak in favour of a play's success, since even prompt copies of unsuccessful plays were sent to the printer.
Evidence about the success of "Bellamira" is not consistent, however. In his Preface to "Bellamira", Sedley himself refers to a rather cool reception of his comedy. He seems to have attributed this to a latent element of obscenity. In Sedley's view, female spectators with their increasing demand for morals and manners on the stage, showed a particular dislike of this kind of lasciviousness in comedy.
Contemporary authors who spoke in favour of "Bellamira" again include Shadwell and George Etherege. Shadwell defended Bellamira from the charge of obscenity. Etherege, who served as diplomat at the Imperial Court in Ratisbon between 1685 and 1689 and was bored there, apparently found reading "Bellamira" a welcome change.
"Bellamira" saw no further editions after 1687. This means that it cannot have been a smash hit. Nor does it occur in the list of the most successful plays between 1660 and 1747 which were still performed after 1900. And yet, "Bellamira" was adapted by Robin Chapman and broadcast on 18 March 1975 by Thames Television under the title "Way of the World: Bellamira".
Inversion of traditional hierarchies in the plot.
"Bellamira" is full of relationships and affairs, and only one couple is married on stage while more marriages are only planned for the future. However, all the marriages are doubtful as to how close they function as satiric norm(s). Traditional hierarchies and ties of interdependence are inverted. Previously unprivileged members of society dominate the plot. The ones formerly in power either have to pay for their "status quo" or have to submit to survive: 
Criticism of competitive society.
The criticism of contemporary society in "Bellamira" is achieved by satire and parody. The play presents the picture of a competitive society which is largely characterised by materialistic and cynical as well as libertinistic, if not nihilistic, tendencies. The society of "Bellamira" is morally corrupt and profit-seeking, degenerate, cunning and violent. Established standards of conduct, codes of honour and polite conversation all serve to cover up the prevalent hypocrisy.
The motif of sterility and disease in the play.
In "Bellamira", a profit-seeking attitude has infected every aspect of life and ruined each relationship. Materialistic motives lead to arranged marriages devoid of feelings and love. The society delineated here is an ageing society not only morally deficient but also literally diseased: Bellamira is a veteran courtesan; Merryman an elderly drunkard; Cunningham a crumbling syphilitic wretch; Dangerfield an old-fashioned, impotent soldier in retirement. In addition to this picture of ageing and disease, the imagery of sterility receives special emphasis in the play: the device of the eunuch becomes the very symbol of the play, and thus, characteristics such as incompleteness and lack of fulfilment dominate the play. While characters like Dangerfield and Merryman suffer from physical impotence, others like Lionel are emotionally sterile. In his raving, Lionel commits a crime by raping the girl he professes to love. Keepwell, too, who is ruled by a courtesan, seems less than a man. The pervasive animal imagery underlines this impression: Pisquil, the real eunuch, is called "Humane Gelding," Dangerfield "gelt" by Bellamira, and Merryman refers to him as "Gib’d Cat," that is, gelded cat. In a final piece of irony, the lean Cunningham refers to himself as a "Capon," that is, gelded cock.

1940s, 1950s.
The "South Yorkshireman" was started by British Railways in May 1948. It left daily at 10:00, returning from London at 16:50, and calling at Huddersfield, Sheffield, and Leicester; in some years at least, also at Halifax, Brighouse, Penistone, Nottingham, Rugby and Aylesbury. It was not a particularly fast service even by the standards of that era, the down train taking 5 hours 30 minutes to get from London to Bradford. It usually had nine coaches including a restaurant car, and was often hauled by a Gresley A3 Pacific. The train continued running until 1960, when all long-distance expresses on the former Great Central route were withdrawn.
Present day.
The "South Yorkshireman" in its current form started on 15 December 2008. The service was named as part of an East Midlands Trains competition to name two new crack express trains.

<doc id="20627460" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20627460" title="Kind (type theory)">
Kind (type theory)

In the area of mathematical logic and computer science known as type theory, a kind is the type of a type constructor or, less commonly, the type of a higher-order type operator. A kind system is essentially a simply typed lambda calculus "one level up", endowed with a primitive type, denoted formula_1 and called "type", which is the kind of any (monomorphic) data type.
A kind is sometimes confusingly described as the "type of a (data) type", but this is a triviality, unless one considers polymorphic types to be data types. Syntactically, it is natural to consider polymorphic types to be type constructors, thus monomorphic types to be nullary type constructors. But all nullary constructors, thus all monomorphic types, have the same, simplest kind; namely formula_1.
Since higher-order type operators are uncommon in programming languages, in most programming practice, kinds are used to distinguish between data types and the types of constructors which are used to implement parametric polymorphism. Kinds appear, either explicitly or implicitly, in languages with complex type systems, such as Haskell and Scala.
Kinds in Haskell.
("Note": Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds.) 
Haskell's kind system has just two rules:
An inhabited type (as proper types are called in Haskell) is a type which has values. For instance, ignoring type classes which complicate the picture, codice_1 is a value of type codice_2, while codice_3 is a value of type <code>(list of Ints). Therefore, codice_2 and codice_5 have kind formula_1, but so does any function type, for instance codice_6 or even codice_7.
A type constructor takes one or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports partial application thanks to currying. This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type codice_8 (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type of the elements of the list. Hence, codice_9 (list of Floats) and even codice_10 (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the codice_8 type constructor. Therefore, codice_8 is a type of kind formula_4. Because codice_2 has kind formula_1, applying it to codice_8 results in codice_15, of kind formula_1. The 2-tuple constructor codice_16 has kind formula_5, the 3-tuple constructor codice_17 has kind formula_16 and so on.
Kind inference.
Haskell does not allow polymorphic kinds. This is in contrast to parametric polymorphism on types, which is supported in Haskell. For instance, in the following example:
the kind of codice_18 could be anything, including formula_1, but also formula_4 etc. Haskell by default will always infer kinds to be formula_1, unless the type explicitly indicates otherwise (see below). Therefore the type checker will reject the following use of codice_19:
because the kind of codice_8, formula_4 does not match the expected kind for codice_18, which is always formula_1.
Higher-order type operators are allowed however. For instance:
has kind formula_22, i.e. codice_22 is expected to be a unary data constructor, which gets applied to its argument, which must be a type, and returns another type.

Bornholm school of painters

The Bornholm school of painters started to take shape towards the beginning of the 20th century on the Danish island of Bornholm when a number of artists developed a distinctive style of classic modernism, inspired by the island's unique landscapes and light. Karl Isaksson and Edvard Weie were among the first to paint the island's constantly changing natural beauty, using pure, subdued colour to produce work in new aesthetic directions. They were soon joined by other Danish artists including Niels Lergaard, Kræsten Iversen and Oluf Høst. They lived mainly in the picturesque little ports of Gudhjem and Svaneke on the northern coast, adventuring at times over to the small island of Christiansø where they found further seclusion and inspiration.
Many of the works of the Bornholm School can be seen in the Bornholm Art Museum near Gudhjem and in the Oluf Høst Museum in Gudhjem itself.

The Bat Conservation Trust

The Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) is a British charity dedicated to the conservation of bats and their habitats in the UK. BCT was formed in 1990 and is the only national organisation solely devoted to bats. Its vision is a world where bats and people live in harmony.
BCT’s work is based on four key objectives, which are seen as critical to maintaining a sustainable, diverse bat population in the UK: 
National Bat Helpline.
BCT runs the National Bat Helpline, providing information to anyone needing advice on issues relating to bats. The helpline received almost 10,000 enquiries in 2007/08. Users can telephone the helpline directly or submit queries via a form on BCT's website.
National Bat Monitoring Programme.
BCT runs a number of national, annual surveys through a volunteer network to monitor the status of bat species across a range of habitats. These surveys form the National Bat Monitoring Programme (NBMP) through which changes in bat populations can be tracked. A key use of NBMP data is to help inform which bat species are included on the priority list in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. BCT runs NBMP surveys aimed at beginners as well as experts.
Bechstein's Bat Project.
In February 2008, BCT launched the Bechstein's Bat Project, which aims to establish the distribution of Bechstein’s bats and other woodland bat species in England and Wales. The survey protocol is based on methods devised by experts Frank Greenaway and David Hill.
Count Bat.
Supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), Natural England and the City Bridge Trust, BCT runs the England Count Bat project, which aims to involve a wider spectrum of people in bat conservation, particularly those from under-represented groups.
Magazines.
Bat News.
"Bat News" is BCT's members' magazine. It features news, research updates and in-depth features and is published three times a year.
The Young Bat Worker.
"The Young Bat Worker" is BCT's magazine for Young Batworkers' Club members of BCT. It features bat-themed activities, games, stories, competitions and curriculum guidance for teachers. It is published three times a year.
European Bat Weekend.
BCT organises European Bat Weekend, an annual celebration of bats held on the last weekend of August each year, to coincide with European Bat Night, which is organised by EUROBATS. The aim of European Bat Weekend is to encourage people to see and hear bats in their natural environment by taking part in a range of events organised by local bat groups, wildlife trusts, countryside rangers and other organisations across the country. BCT features European Bat Weekend events on an interactive map on its website.

Da (political party)

The Movement for Democracy and Aliyah (, "HaTnu'a LeDemokratia VeAliya"), commonly known as Da (; , lit. "Yes"), was a minor Israeli political party founded by immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s.
History.
The party was established in 1992 and sought to have the well-known refusenik Natan Sharansky head its list. After several changes of heart, Sharansky turned the offer down.
Led by Yuli Kosharovsky, in the elections that year the party won 11,697 votes (0.4% of the total, and around 5% of the immigrant vote), and failed to cross the electoral threshold of 1.5%. Most Russian immigrants voted for the Israeli Labor Party.
Notable members included Gennady Riger, who later served as general secretary and a MK for Yisrael BaAliyah, another immigrant party.

<doc id="20627638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20627638" title="Surgical margin">
Surgical margin

Surgical margin, also known as tumor free margin, free margin, normal skin margin, and normal tissue margin, usually refers to the visible normal tissue or skin margin that is removed with the surgical excision of a tumor, growth, or malignancy.
Definition.
Surgical margin in a surgery report defines the visible margin or free edge of "normal" tissue seen by the surgeon with the naked eye. Surgical margin as read in a pathology report defines the histological measurement of normal or unaffected tissue surrounding the visible tumor under a microscope on a glass mounted histology section. A "narrow" surgical margin implies that the tumor exists very close to the surgical margin, and a "wide" surgical margin implies the tumor exists far from the cut edge or the surgical margin. Narrow surgical margin using the bread loafing technique suggests that residual cancer might be left due to false negative error. A surgeon often will perform a second surgery if a narrow surgical margin is noted on a pathology report.
Associated errors and recurrence rate.
This determination is made with the full understanding of "false negative error" intrinsic in the bread loafing technique of histology (also known as POMA - a term used by the NCCN). The higher the false negative error is, the higher the recurrence rate of a cancer or tumor at the surgical margin. This is due to the misreading of a pathology specimen as being clear of residual tumor, when there is actually residual tumor left where the specimen was not cut and mounted on the histology slide. The "false negative error" is very low in the CCPDMA method of histology processing, and can be very high in the bread loafing (POMA) method of histology processing. In the bread loafing method of processing, one will note a high false negative error rate with narrow surgical margin; and one will note a low false negative error with a wide surgical margin Surgical margin has a much less significant effect on the false negative error rate of CCPDMA methods, allowing the surgeon to routinely use very narrow surgical margins (1 to 2 mm for non-melanoma skin cancer).

316 (Lost)

"316" is the sixth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's "Lost". The 92nd episode of the show overall, "316" aired on February 18, 2009 on ABC in the United States, and was simulcast on A in Canada. The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Stephen Williams.
In 2007, having recruited Sun-Hwa Kwon, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus find a way to return to the island. Jack makes a last-ditch effort to recruit the other "Oceanic 6" survivors.
Plot.
The episode begins with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and Hugo "Hurley" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) having returned to the island, three years since they left it in "There's No Place Like Home". The narrative then shifts to 46 hours previous where the previous episode, "This Place is Death", left off. Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) takes Jack, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) to a Dharma Initiative station underneath the church called the Lamp Post, which was used by Dharma to find the island; since the island is constantly moving, they developed a way to predict where it would be at a given time. When Eloise mentions that the group only has 36 hours to get on Ajira Airways Flight 316 a Boeing 737-300 in order to return to the island, Desmond refuses to join them and leaves. Eloise then tells Jack in private that he must bring something that belonged to his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) with him on the flight and also gives him John Locke's (Terry O'Quinn) suicide note.
The next day, Jack gets a call informing him that his grandfather Ray (Raymond J. Barry) has attempted to escape his nursing home. Jack goes to the nursing home and finds an old pair of Christian's shoes and decides to take them with him. Later, Jack returns to his apartment, where he finds Kate sleeping in his bed. He wakes her and asks where her adoptive son Aaron is, but she refuses to answer. Kate tells Jack that if he wants her to get back to the island, he must never ask her about Aaron. Then they kiss passionately and fall into bed. The next morning, Jack receives a phone call from a severely beaten Ben, who tells Jack that he must go to a butcher shop and retrieve Locke's dead body. Jack does so, putting Christian's shoes on Locke's feet in the process. He also leaves the suicide note in Locke's pocket.
At the airport, Jack, Kate, Sun, and Hurley all board Flight 316. Hurley was informed by someone other than Ben, and bought all the remaining seats on the plane, in order to spare the lives of potential passengers. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) also boards the plane, in the custody of Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is last to board the plane, which momentarily disquiets Hurley. Also on board is Caesar (Saïd Taghmaoui). Jack asks Ben as to what will happen to the other people on the plane, to which Ben replies: "Who cares?", leaving Jack speechless. During the flight, Jack realizes that Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is piloting the plane and Frank realizes that they are going back to the island. Jack, who has been given Locke's note by a flight attendant, reads the note which says, "Jack, I wish you had believed me." The 737 hits turbulence and there is a flash of white light similar to that caused by the time shifts. The first scene replays, following which, Jack, Kate and Hurley are found by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who is driving a Dharma van and wearing a Dharma jumpsuit.
Production.
This episode and "The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham" were written at the same time by executive producers Lindelof and Cuse. "The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham" was originally meant to be aired first, but the order was switched because they felt it made more sense and was "cooler" and "there is probably some good information to get in “316” before."
Reception.
13.161 million American viewers watched the episode's premiere.
IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the episode was shocking, but seemed as though it was meant to be. He opined that: "The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical and the fact that he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense." James Yates of the "Staten Island Advance" wrote that it was "great" to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.

Something Like That

"Something Like That" is the title of a song written by Rick Ferrell and Keith Follesé, and performed by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in June 1999 as the second single from McGraw's album "A Place in the Sun". The song reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. It also reached number one on the Canadian "RPM" Country Singles and peaked at #28 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, making it a minor crossover hit. According to Nielsen BDS, the song was the top-played radio single in any musical genre in the 2000s with 487,343 spins from January 1, 2000, to December 17, 2009.
Concept.
The song recounts the narrator’s youthful experience of falling in love for the very first time at age seventeen. The man sees a woman at a county fair on Labor Day weekend when he is seventeen, and then five years later, sees her on a plane, while the man is heading to Mardi Gras. The bridge talks about how a love can never go away no matter how long the two people are apart.
Critical reception.
Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying that "through its vivid, detail-laden approach, the lyric effectively hones ["sic"] in on the fact that the experience of one’s first love is, in itself, unforgettable." He goes on to say that the point of the song "is driven home by a sprightly piano hook, toe-tapping rhythm, and wildly catchy singalong-friendly chorus – a one-two punch that helps the record make an impression both as a great lyric and as a fun, catchy listen."
Music video.
This was the first video to be directed by Scott Scovill. It features McGraw during his 1999 tour. This was also McGraw's last video, until 2001's "The Cowboy In Me," which was also shot on tour.
Chart performance.
"Something Like That" re-entered the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks as an official single at number 68 for the week of July 3, 1999.

Alpha capture system

An alpha capture system is a computer system that enables investment banks and other organisations to submit "trading ideas" or "trade ideas" to clients in a written electronic format, for example TIM Group's TIM Ideas product. Financial Services Authority Markets Division: Newsletter on Market Conduct and Transaction Reporting Issues, Issue No. 17, September 2006, First used in 2001 by Marshall Wace they are an alternative to the traditional stockbrokering approach of communicating ideas and strategies to clients face-to-face or over the telephone.
The term "alpha capture" refers to the aim of such systems to help investors find alpha or market-beating returns on investments. Submitted trade ideas are accompanied by a rationale, timeframe and conviction level and enable investors to quantify and monitor the performance of different ideas.

Oluf Høst

Oluf Høst (1884–1966) was a Danish Expressionist painter, the only member of the Bornholm school who was a native Bornholmer. Although he studied in Copenhagen, he returned to the Danish island of Bornholm in 1929 where he remained with his family for the rest of his life. Bognemark, a little farmhouse near Gudhjem, was one of Høst's favourite motifs. From 1935 on, he painted the farm some 200 times under varying conditions at different times of the year, often reflecting his particular mood at the time. His home in Gudhjem, built from two fishermen's cottages with a rocky garden in the rear, is named "Norresân" after the nearby harbour, Nørresand Havn, where he painted many of his works.
Life and work.
Høst was born in Svaneke on the island of Bornholm. He attended various schools of art in Copenhagen including the Academy of Fine Arts from 1906 and 1915. During this period, he studied at Harald Giersing's school where Karl Isakson introduced him to Expressionism, especially through the work of Cézanne and Van Gogh. Inspired above all by Cézanne, Høst's work was also strongly influenced by the Nordic tradition as a result of the changing seasons and weather. This is evident in the way he depicted changes of light and mood. Høst commented:
"We have our seasons, the long light nights, the enchantment that we must struggle with, while Cézanne lived in a place where there was no weather as such, as it was always the same."
In 1913, Høst married Hedvig Wiedemann, a fellow student. They had two sons, Ole and Niels. They were sociable hosts, inviting many contemporary intellectuals to their home, including the author Otto Gelsted who was a frequent guest. In 1943, Ole, the older of his two sons who had joined the SS, died in Barwenkowo, a small town on the Eastern Front in Russia. Høst felt guilty for the rest of his life about introducing his son to his friend Fritz Waschnitius, an Austrian-born translator and writer who was a Nazi supporter. It was no doubt Waschnitius who had encouraged Ole to fight with the Germans. Over the next few years, Høst painted a series of pictures of the Bognemark farm as if it was facing towards Barwenkowo.
After Høst returned to Bornholm in 1929, he was free to paint as he wished. He concentrated on local buildings and landscapes including views of Gudhjem with its smokehouses (the little smokehouse at the Nørresand harbour was a favorite) and dramatic St. Hans midsummer bonfires. But his favorite was Bognemark, at the top of a cliff above Norresân, where he bought a farm in 1935, making it his second studio. From there, he painted many sunsets looking out across the water towards the Swedish coast. There were also picturesque views over Salene Bay where Sweden could be seen on a clear day. As the farmhouse is aligned in an east-west direction, it provided fine sunset vistas from the coach house. It was a frequent haunt for many years. He also painted details of the gables and roofs of the buildings in different shades of the light of the setting sun and in several permutations. There were scenes of the killing of pigs, the cowshed and the haystacks. He liked bright colors.
Høst is also known for his subtly expressed acerbic views in the 1,800 diaries he called "log books", written with such clarity and self-criticism. After his death, they were kept in secret by the Royal Library as Høst had specified they should not be revealed until 50 years after his death. A typical comment was: "I really have nothing to talk about with people who do not like negroes and films, and feel cement is ugly." or "I cannot do without the common people – nature's loneliness and silent friendship." Based largely on the log books, a recent biography by Jens Henrik Sandberg, director of the Oluf Høst Museum, was published in 2012 with the title "Oluf Høst: jeg blev væk i mig selv" (Oluf Høst: I was lost in my self), a title Høst had chosen for his biography if ever it should be written. His family and friends thought that the term of 50 years on the log books may have been set because they contained information about links with the Nazis but this proved not to be the case. In fact, one of Oluf Host's paintings was labeled by the Nazis as "degenerate art" and removed from an art exhibition in Berlin (along with a painting by Van Gogh). 
Oluf claimed he was apolitical. On one occasion he confided that while he had voted conservative, he was in fact more sympathetic to the communists. Sandberg, qualifying him as a Metaphysical painter, comments that his early works were reflective of his association with the so-called "dark painters" but in later life they were of a lighter and more intellectual style.
Honours.
From 1930, Høst was recognized as a Danish artist of great repute. He received a number of honours, including the Eckersberg Medal (1933), Denmark's highest award for painting, and the Thorvaldsen Medal (1943), the prestigious visual arts award. He also exhibited with success at Den Frie Udstilling (The Free Exhibition) from 1926. However, he was so attached to his paintings that he did not want to lose them and therefore did not exhibit for years on end. He was so fastidious about his paintings that even after their sale to private individuals or museums he would return with brushes and paints to touch them up, frequently reclaiming them for "completion". Many of his paintings, 50 in all, have indeed never been completed.

Action Reconciliation Service for Peace

The Action Reconciliation Service for Peace is a German peace organization founded to confront the legacy of Nazism.
The Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (German: Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienste, or ASF) was founded in 1958 by the synod of the Evangelical Church in Germany, driven by the efforts of Lothar Kreyssig. It was prompted by the acknowledgement of guilt that Germans needed to face at the end of World War II and the Nazi era.
The Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP) is known especially through its international volunteer programs and the organisation of work camps in western and eastern Europe. Every year, ARSP sends approximately 180 volunteers to countries that suffered under the German occupation during World War II: Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Belarus, and the Ukraine. They also work in Israel and the USA because many Holocaust survivors fled or immigrated to these countries.
Excerpt from the by-laws of ARSP.
§2 Purpose and operation
History of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace.
Background.
The beginnings of ARSP started with the actions of the Evangelical Church in Germany to reject Nazism and resist the Nazi regime. The founder of ARSP, Lothar Kreyssig, was one of the determined resisters within the Confessing Church. After the war, he made this refusal by the Protestant church a subject of discussion and, along with like-minded people, such as Martin Niemöller, Gustav Heinemann and later, Franz von Hammerstein, called for repentance and reversal.
Appeal for the Action for Reconciliation.
Lothar Kreyssig tried to find fellow campaigners for his reconciliation service for the first time on "Kirchentag" 1954, in Leipzig. The appeal found few ears. "That something is right and necessary, is not enough to see it materialize in time and space. The hour must be ripe," he later wrote in his unpublished autobiography. The Synod of the Evangelical Church in Germany convened from April 26–30, 1958, alternating in Spandau, in West Berlin) and Weißensee in East Berlin. At this point, the synod still involved the entire Evangelical Church in Germany, both east and west. There was a controversy that year over the west German military chaplaincy contract and possible nuclear armament by the Bundeswehr. This was the troubled atmosphere in which Praeses Kreyssig, on the last day of the Synod, read his appeal to found the Action for Reconciliation. Numerous attendees signed the appeal that evening.
The appeal not only expressed an admission of guilt, it also delineated concrete consequences. The Action for Reconciliation would not offer assistance, rather, would ask to help. This humble attitude was a rejection of any patronizing functionalization of the reconciliation thought process. The attitude was to signal the readiness to get involved — that is, to learn by doing and through dialogue — because the appeal relied on conversation, response and new action.
The Action for Reconciliation was initially founded as a Germany-wide organization, but the division of Germany made a joint effort impossible. The two German states therefore had two organizations with a common goal, albeit different emphasis in practice.
ARSP in western Germany.
The western German ARSP began its work in 1959 with construction projects in the Netherlands and Norway and later, with projects in other countries. Volunteers helped build a synagoge in Villeurbanne and the Church of Reconciliation in Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, in Burgundy, France. They helped build a kindergarten in Skopje in the former Yugoslavia, helped install a water irrigation system on Crete, and helped create an international symbol of reconciliation from the ruins of Coventry Cathedral in England. Work in Israel began in 1961, after the Adolph Eichmann trial was concluded. From the mid-1960s, the projects slowly changed. There was ever less construction work, but new projects emerged for memorials, for work with the elderly, and social work. By the 1980s, with World War II fading into the past, there were additional projects working with minority groups.
ASZ in eastern Germany.
After 1961, the Berlin Wall prevented the East German Action for Reconciliation (Aktion Sühnezeichen, or ASZ) from sending any more volunteers to the west. Because the German Democratic Republic (GDR) considered itself to be an anti-fascist state, it did not consider itself responsible for the consequences of German fascism. Therefore, the projects of the ASZ were initially limited to the GDR. In 1965 and 1966, volunteers were still able to travel with Catholic chaplains from Magdeburg to Auschwitz, Majdanek, Stutthof, Groß-Rosen and Breslau. By 1967 and 1968, further trips to memorial sites in Poland and Czechoslovakia were not permitted, despite invitations being sent to the state visa refusal. With the introduction in 1972 of visa-free travel between the GDR and Poland and Czechoslovakia, young German were able to take part in summer camps in Poland. By then, Polish and Czech young people were also embarking on missions in the GDR. From this time on, reconciliation groups were involved in the preservation and restoration of Jewish cemeteries in almost every region of the GDR. The first group to work at Buchenwald was in 1979. Starting in 1981, the number of summer camps expanded to include Sachsenhausen, Ravensbrück, and Nordhausen-Dora. From 1962 till 1992, over 12,000 volunteers took part in the summer camps from ASZ.
Reunification.
After reunification, the two eastern and western organizations merged, retaining their different forms of voluntary service, the long-term service of the ARSP and the short-term service and summer camps of the ASZ. Like the European Voluntary Service, since the late 1990s, the ARSP has increased the number of project sites to respond to changing need and new opportunities.
Current ARSP projects.
Long-term voluntary service.
At present, ARSP sends out about 180 men and women per year to work on projects, primarily in countries that suffered directly from the Nazis, but also ones that have large numbers of Holocaust survivors. Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Israel, Ukraine, America and Belarus all have ARSP voluntary projects. The volunteers are predominantly young, between the ages of 18 and 27. Conscientious objectors can fulfill their required civil service under the auspices of ARSP. Volunteers support and accompany survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants, work at memorial sites, take care of older people, those with disabilities, the disadvantaged and refugees, and get involved in neighborhood projects and anti-racism initiatives.
ARSP volunteers helped create an international center of reconciliation in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral. In Israel, volunteers have worked in historical or political education and at the national memorial site, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and in projects with Jewish and Arab citizens, working toward mutual understanding.
ARSP first sent volunteers to Norway and the Netherlands in 1959 to work on construction projects. More recently, volunteers in the Netherlands work in historical or political education, for example, at the Joods Historisch Museum or Anne Frank Foundation.
Volunteers in Poland work in societies for former concentration camp prisoners and at concentration camps sites, Auschwitz in Oświęcim, Stutthof in Gdansk and Majdanek near Lublin. For political reasons, ARSP first sent volunteers to Russia in 1990, and the Czech Republic in 1993. In Russia, they work at veterans' hospitals and the Russian human rights organization, Memorial. In the Czech Republic, they work with the Jewish community in Prague and at the memorial site Theresienstadt concentration camp. Volunteers to Ukraine work with former forced laborers.
ARSP has 24 volunteer positions in the United States. They work with Holocaust survivors or in offices at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Washington, DC and the American Jewish Committee in New York and Washington. Since 1996, about 15-20 requests per year have come from partner programs in other countries from young people seeking voluntary peace service in Germany, as well.
Short- and medium-term voluntary service.
Each year, about 300 people take part in summer camps, where they live and work together in about 25 camps in Germany and other countries. All summer camps are run by unsalaried employees, often former long-term volunteers who want to pass along their own experience. During the two- to three-week stay, volunteers learn about current and historical issues and are involved in projects, such as performing upkeep at Jewish cemeteries and memorial sites. They also work in social services and with intercultural projects.
For the past several years, there has been medium-term voluntary service available in Israel. Lasting three to six months, this service involves volunteers of all ages, including seniors. There is a three-day orientation seminar is held in the country.
Public relations and education.
Many ARSP alumni are in regional groups and maintain connections, continuing to volunteer even after their initial voluntary period ends. With the implementation of long- and short-term voluntary service, more unsalaried positions are created, filled by these alumni. Some also contribute to public relations and education efforts.
Four times a year, ARSP publishes "Zeichen" ("Signs"), a magazine (in German) that reports on the current work of volunteers and project partners. Each issue is centered around a different theme. It publishes "Predigthilfen & Materiellen für die Gemeinde" ("Sermon aids and materials for the congregation") three times a year, on the occasion of "Israel Sunday," (a memorial day in the Evangelical church); for a ten-day period in November, called the "Ökumenische Friedensdekade" ("Ecumenical Decade of Peace"); and for International Holocaust Remembrance Day. With these, ARSP wants to convey theological insights from the Jewish-Christian dialogue and the dialogue with Islam into the religious community. In addition, ARSP wants to weigh in on current political themes, thereby joining the inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue and presenting its position against anti-semitism, right-wing extremism and racism and strongly advocating for compensation to those persecuded by the Nazis; and for a just peace.
Educational work.
ARSP endeavors to stimulate societal debateon the themes of the politics of memory, national identities and inter-religious dialogue with events, workshops, seminars and congresses. ARSP contributes as founder, sponsor or cooperative partner to the following:

Ebierbing

Ebierbing (), also known as "Joe," "Eskimo Joe," "Ipirvik", "Eberbing", and "Joseph Ebierbing", c. 1837 - c. 1881, was a remarkable Inuit guide and explorer, who assisted several American Arctic explorers, among them Charles Francis Hall and Frederick Schwatka. Together with his wife Tookoolito, he was one of the best-known and most widely travelled Inuit in the 1860s and 1870s.
Life.
The nickname "Joe" was given him by the whalers of Cumberland Sound. In 1852, one of these whalers, Thomas Bowlby, Bolby, or Bowling, took Joe and his partner Tookoolito, known as "Hannah," and another young Inuk with him to the English whaling port of Hull. He exhibited them at several venues, always taking care to let the curious know that Joe and Hannah were man and wife, and had been converted to Christianity. Bowlby made arrangements for them to be received by Queen Victoria, and they apparently made a very favorable impression. Unlike many less scrupulous men, Bowlby returned all three Inuit to the Arctic safe and well.
In 1860, Ebierbing and Tookoolito met Charles Francis Hall, and worked closely with him as he sought to trace Inuit oral traditions about the 16th-century expedition of Martin Frobisher. Tookoolito worked principally as Hall's translator, while Ebierbing served as guide and hunter. Having located the original site of Frobisher's attempted settlement, Hall returned to the United States in 1862; Ebierbing, Tookoolito accompanied him, along with their infant son "Butterfly" (). Hall had the Inuit family appear with him when he gave his talk on the Frobisher relics at the American Geographical Society, and realizing the high degree of interest in them, arranged with P. T. Barnum for their exhibition at Barnum's American Museum. Hall arranged for their exhibition shortly afterwards at the Boston Aquarial Gardens, but when no payment was forthcoming for this second exhibit, swore off any more dealings with "Show Establishments." Nevertheless, Ebierbing and Tookoolito, along with little Tukerliktu, appeared with Hall during his east coast lecture tour of 1863; the strain of the tour led to health problems for both "Hannah" and her son, and a few weeks later "Butterfly" was dead.
Together with Tookoolito, he accompanied Hall on his final voyage, the Polaris expedition (1871–1873) in search of the North Pole. He was among the party left behind after Hall's death, when the ship broke loose of the ice and failed to return. During the party's six-month drift on a gradually-shrinking icefloe, Ebierbing and the Greenlandic Inuk Hans Hendrik managed to provide food for the entire party; they were eventually picked up by a sealer in April 1873. During the investigation into Hall's death, both Ebierbing and Tookoolito supported Hall's claim that he had been poisoned, but their evidence was discounted. The couple returned to Groton, Connecticut, although Ebierbing returned to the Arctic periodically to work as a guide, while Tookoolito remained behind, caring for their daughter Panik and working as a seamstress. After Panik, whose health had been poor since her experience on the icefloe, died at the age of nine, Hannah fell into declining health. Joe was with her when she died on December 31, 1876; she was buried in the Starr Burying Ground not far from the Budington family plot. 
Ebierbing died in the Arctic sometime in 1881; the details of his death are unknown.
The island Joe Island is named after Joe Ebierbing, the island is located just outside to the left of Petermann Fjord off Kap Morton in Kennedy Channel. Hannah Island, in the mouth of Bessels Fjord next fjord to the south of Petermann Fjord, is named after his wife Hannah (Tookoolito).

Leyte Progressive High School

The Leyte Progressive High School is a private and non-sectarian academic institution. It is the oldest existing Chinese school in Tacloban City. It is colloquially known as "Heng-hwa" by the local Filipino-Chinese community.
History.
In 1919, the Leyte Chinese School was established by a group of local Chinese businessmen through the Leyte Tek Club and the Tacloban Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
The Leyte Chinese School started in an old building with two rooms and with an enrollment of a few boys and girls who were mostly from the Leyte Chinese Community. The school was registered with the Department of Education in 1921. Eight years after its establishment, the first school building was erected.
Three years after, the first newly built Chinese School in Leyte was closed for a year due to financial problems.
The school's closure alarmed the Chinese community; hence, an education committee was organized with the objective of reopening the school in line with its vision that education of the Chinese children should be given concerted and preferential attention by the Chinese community.
As expected, the student population increased and the school was transferred to a building at Grand Capitan street (now Justice Romualdez Street).
The school was forced to close when war broke out in 1941 and was reopened after the liberation in October 1945.
The Chinese community immediately worked on the renovation of the school buildings and other facilities which had been destroyed by the war. A new school building was constructed at Sabang District. Thus, the first graduation ceremony for the High School department was held in the new building.
At this point, the name was changed from Leyte Chinese School to Leyte Chinese High School.
However, in 1973, a government circular required all Chinese schools to Filipinize their names so that it had to be renamed Leyte Progressive High School.
Mission statement.
LPHS is a non-profit service oriented institution, as such it is committed to the total development of its pupils and students by providing them with unique opportunities to pursue academic excellence, imbibe the Filipino and Chinese heritages and training them to become responsible and productive citizen of our country.
Goals and objectives.
LPHS aims to provide democratic instructions in the development of basic knowledge, fundamental skills, positive attitudes and values, worthwhile habits and interest relevant to productive citizenship of its pupils and students, to prepare them for active leadership roles in the future. It exists to enhance an enlightened outlook of genuine patriotism and provide of their Filipino as well as Chinese heritage.
Logo.
The outer triangle represents the basic important factors of learning: the PUPIL, the TEACHER, and the INSTRUCTION.
The LPHS acronym inside the small triangle signifies the institution as an effective channel for education.
The characteristics of this Chinese plum flower at the middle of the triangle signify perseverance, hard work and dedication towards attaining a goal. It is believed that the more difficult circumstances become, and many trials a student experiences, the better he is molded and becomes successful in life.

Guillaume Vandive

Guillaume Vandive (1680–1706), Printer and ordinary bookseller of Monseigneur the Dauphin. Guillaume Vandive, was born about 1680, was baptized in Paris Church of St. Bartholomew's under his original name Vandivout ( Van Dievoet ), and died in 1706 after eleven months of marriage. 
He was the oldest son of the famous Parisian goldsmith of origin of Brussels Philippe Van Dievoet dit Vandive (1654–1738), adviser of the king, goldsmith of the King and the Dolphin, and the nephew of the famous sculptor of Brussels Peter Van Dievoet (1661–1729).
Personal History.
Guillaume Vandive, printer and publisher of Monseigneur the Dauphin, was accepted as a Master on December 20, 1701, with does the recommendation of Monseigneur the Grand Dauphin Louis (who was called Monseigneur, as specified by Lottin), after being trained from April 1697 to April 1701 under Jean Ier Boudot (1651? -1706), ordinary printer of the King and the royal Academy of sciences and director of the Printing works of His Serene Highness the Prince de Dombes with Trévoux. He married in Paris in 1705, Eléonore the Prior. Guillaume and Eléonore had a daughter, Charlotte-Eléonore Vandive. 
Nicolas Simart succeeded him after having married his widow on June 15, 1706; he received his Mastership the following July.
Its production.
It was installed street Saint-Jacob with the sign With the Dolphin crowned, opposite the street of the Parchment factory. It published various catalogs of the books printed at his place into 1701,1704,1706. It points out that it still has other books printed in France or abroad. 
It also published a series of works in collaboration with Louis Coignard, established street Saint-Jacob with “the Gold Eagle”, born in the 1680 and deceased on September 27, 1738 with the convent of Meung-sur-Loire where it had been transferred a few months before after being embastillé on December 28, 1737 to be implied in the publication of works Jansenists. He was the brother of Elie Jean-Baptiste Coignart (1667–1735) famous to have published the first edition of the Dictionnaire of the French Academy in 1694 and the son of Jean-Baptiste Ier Coignart, printer-bookseller of the king and the French Academy, born in the 1637 and deceased on September 10, 1686. 
The catalog of the books published in collaboration with Louis Coignard was published in 1703 in the last pages of the book, Moiens to join together the protestans with the Roman Church publish by evesque Mr. Camus of Belley under the title of Avoisinement of the protestans towards the Roman Church . New corrected and increased edition remarks, to be used as supplement, by Mr. ***, Paris, 1703, at Louis Coignart with the Eagle of gold, and Guillaume Vandive, with the Crowned Dolphin, street S. Jacques, with approval & privilege of Roy (in 12°). The author of this corrected edition would be large the Richard Simon (1638–1712) itself, according to the annotation written in a writing of time on the title page of the specimen which its family preserves. It acts, like says it the first letter prefaces, of a work which addresses to the communities the new ones and new Catholics, and that nearly twenty years after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. 
It published, only or with its associate Louis Coignard, especially of the recent or new books, in French and sometimes in Latin, covering various subjects, in particular of theology of tendency Jansenist, sometimes of trade, and voyage. Its catalog contains also books intended for the “new converts”. One finds there for example Charles-Joachim Colbert, bishop of Montpellier, the “general Instructions in the form of catechism”, or, of Nicolas Feuillet, “shortened History of the Conversion of Mr Chanteau”, or of works of Henry de Barillon, of Jean-Pierre Camus, Vincent Houdry, Etienne Lochon. It also published “the Perfect one Negotiating” Jacques Savary, increased in this new edition of a “Treaty of the Bill of exchanges”.

Its typographical mark, made in homage to the Dolphin, consisted of three surmounted dolphins swimming of a fleurdelized closed crown and two horns of plenty, with the top a listel containing the currency inspired of the legend of the poet Arion: “ hoc duce tuta salus ”: with this dolphin as guide your safety is assured. 
Paul Lucas had been sent in 1699 like “antique dealer of the King” to Raising and in the East, charged with enriching by its lucky finds the cabinets with Louis XIV and its German sister-in-law the Palatine and its book appears, like says it Dirk Van der Cruysse, among the most coloured accounts of voyage most alive and era louis-quatorzienne. 
Guillaume Vandive died in full youth at the age of twenty-six years whereas it had founded a printing works and a promising publisher of a bright future.
Its successors.
Its successor Nicolas Simart who had married his widow and had become also “printer and ordinary bookseller of Monseigneur the Dolphin”, still a long time continued to print various books of his funds. Thus in 1731, always installed street Saint-Jacob with the “Crowned Dolphin”, it publishes a “new re-examined and corrected edition” of the Voyage of Sieur Paul Lucas with Raising which contrary to the promises of the title page reproduces the original one very exactly. 
In spite of the fact that it continued to draw throughout its life its subsistence from the printing works founded thanks to the investments from Guillaume Vandive, Nicolas Simart started a sordid lawsuit in 1727 to claim in Philippe Vandive and Balthazar Philippe Vandive the expenses which during twenty years the maintenance and the education of his/her daughter-in-law Charlotte Eléonore Vandive had caused him. He did not hesitate besides to give a noisy publicity to his lawsuit by publishing and spreading on the public place the aggressive indictment of the prosecutor Baron against the arguments of the Vandive family. This indictment preserved at the National library of Paris and written in a style worthy of the Litigants of Root, but in sourer, transmitted the echo of this conflict of interests to us.
No doubt, Nicolas Simart was already in bad financial position and this malicious lawsuit was not to him it great utility, because in 1748 Nicolas Simart was imprisoned for debts with the Caretaker's lodge, where he was still at the first January 1749 according to the Historique of the booksellers of the inspector of Hémery.

Pusweli Oya

Pusweli Oya is a major tributary of Kelani Ganga river in Sri Lanka. 
Starting from the hills in Puswelihena in Horana Division of Kalutara District, it flows northwards through a low lying flat land (6–10 meters above sea level) converted into rice fields, which ultimately becomes the stream's flood plain during rainy seasons. On its way, the stream is joined by the Ma Dola starting from the hills of Madoluwawa and Kurugala, the Angomuwa Oya starting from Angomuwa and Miriyagal Kanda and the Arukwathu Oya starting from Udagama Kanda (1492 feet above sea level). The stream flows for 16 km down its valley before joining the Kelani Ganga near Hanwella. The lowest part of its valley is mostly covered by a large marshland known as Barawa marshland, where there are river loops and islets on its course. The flood plain of the stream is flooded many times annually mainly during the monsoon season from May to September and the inter-monsoon season of October and November.

Middlewich railway station

Middlewich railway station served the Cheshire, England, salt-producing town of Middlewich between 1868 and 1960. It lay on a branch line from Sandbach to Northwich. The Mid Cheshire Rail Users' Association is campaigning for the reopening of the line to passenger traffic, and the construction of a new station at Middlewich.
Construction and opening.
The branch line and Middlewich station were built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) during 1867-1868. The railway line was completed in November 1867 and was initially used by goods trains. The station was completed later and was opened for passenger use on 1 July 1868. 
Passenger services.
The basic train service for passengers was from Crewe via Sandbach to Middlewich and Northwich. Some trains reversed at Northwich and then continued to Hartford and Greenbank and then along a short stretch of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) to Acton Bridge.
The July 1922 LNWR branch line service comprised nine Crewe to Northwich trains, of which five continued to Acton Bridge. There was an additional morning train from and to Crewe that reversed at Middlewich. 
In 1885, the LNWR initiated a through carriage on weekdays from Manchester Oxford Road via Northwich to Middlewich and on to London Euston. The July 1922 railway timetable shows this departing Manchester at 1030am and picking passengers up at major stations to Northwich, calling at Middlewich at 1130am. The carriage reached Crewe at 1150am, where the steam loco detached and the carriage was attached to a Liverpool to Euston express, reaching the capital at 3.10pm. The northbound service left Euston at 2.30pm, reaching Middlewich at 6.10pm. The service to Euston had ceased by World War Two. 
The branch line was operated by the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMSR) after the railway grouping of 1 January 1923. By August 1946, the local passenger service had been reduced to six trains each way between Crewe, Middlewich and Northwich, each offering only third class accommodation. The LMSR was nationalised by British Railways on 1 January 1948 and the branch was thereafter operated by the London Midland Region
Nearby railway halts.
As the branch was 9 miles (14.5 km) in length, with just one main station at Middlewich, the LNWR decided to construct two railway halts to improve facilities for passengers in the locality. Cledford Bridge Halt was located between Sandbach and Middlewich and opened in January 1911. Billinge Green Halt was located between Middlewich and Northwich and opened during 1915. Both halts were closed by the LMSR on 2 March 1942.
Freight traffic.
The branch line from Sandbach through Middlewich to Northwich was primarily built to serve the industries lying near the railway. The most important in tonnage terms were the Cheshire salt mines which provided the line with much revenue up to recent times, when the traffic switched to road haulage. The related chemical factories also raised revenue for the railway companies. Short railway sidings were laid from the branch line to serve the bigger salt and chemical establishments. A goods depot was provided at Middlewich for the receipt and despatch of freight wagons and there was a parcels office for public use. The Middlewich branch continues to be used by freight trains and for occasional train diversions.
Station closure.
Middlewich station shared in the common experience of a drastic reduction of services during the war and for years after. By January 1956, the passenger service offered just four third-class only trains each way on weekdays, and none on Sundays. Unlike many other lines services were not increased after 1956. The station became victim of the pre-Beeching British Railways closure programme, with regular passenger trains ceasing to use the branch on 4 January 1960. The station buildings were subsequently demolished. The nearest railway station is now Winsford 2.3 miles (3.7 km) away on the WCML.
Reopening.
The Mid Cheshire Rail Users' Association is presently campaigning for the reintroduction of passenger services on the Sandbach - Northwich line and the construction of a new station at Middlewich.

Frank Robison

Frank DeHass Robison (born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1852, died Bratenahl, Ohio September 25, 1908) was an American businessman, best known as a baseball executive. He was the organizer of the Cleveland Spiders franchise, and owned or part-owned the club throughout its existence, from its founding in as the Cleveland Blues until . Along with his brother, Stanley Robison, he was also co-owner of the St. Louis Perfectos/Cardinals baseball team of the National League from through .
After briefly attending Delaware University, Robison went into business with his father-in-law, Charles Hathaway, operating streetcars in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1887, he used funds from this business to start up a baseball team, the Cleveland Blues (called the "Forest Citys" in some sources). He continued to operate in both areas for the next two decades, including financing the construction of League Park in 1889, and the formation of the Cleveland City Railway Company in 1893.
In 1899, the Robison brothers were responsible for the worst Major League Baseball team in history, the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. Before the season, the Robisons purchased the bankrupt St. Louis Browns from Chris von der Ahe and renamed them the Perfectos. During the single season in which they owned both the Spiders and Perfectos, the brothers transferred the best players of both franchises to St. Louis, leaving the Spiders with a team that finished with a record of 20-134, the worst full-season record ever for a major league baseball team. Following this debacle (and a similar one involving the Baltimore Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas), the practice of allowing the same owners to run multiple teams was outlawed.
Following Robison's death in 1908, Stanley Robison became sole owner of the Cardinals until his death in 1911, when the franchise was bequeathed to Stanley's daughter (Frank's niece) Helene Hathaway Britton.

Chevrolet Lakewood

The Chevrolet Lakewood is a 4 door station wagon produced by Chevrolet in the 1961 and 1962 model years. It was the station wagon version of the Corvair and therefore the entry level station wagon series. In size, appearance, and technical respects it resembled the Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback, and power came from the Corvair's rear engine with 146 cu.in. displacement which developed 80 bhp @ 4,400 rpm. Like the Corvair it had a 108 in. wheelbase and was equipped with a 3 speed manually shifted gearbox.
In 1961 the Lakewood was available in base form as part of the "Corvair series 500" and in more luxurious form as the "Corvair Series 700". The following year the base trim level was called "Corvair Deluxe series 700" and the top-of-the line model was the "Corvair Monza series 900". The Series 900's engine developed 84 bhp and was connected to a 2 speed Powerglide automatic gearbox.
For 1963 the Corvair station wagons were no longer offered. In two years 32,120 Lakewoods were made. Only 2,362 of them (model year 1962 only) were made with a standard Powerglide automatic transmission.

La Lucerne Abbey

History.
La Lucerne Abbey ("Abbaye Sainte-Trinité de La Lucerne") is a Premonstratensian monastery situated in the forests of the Thar valley in the Manche department, near the commune of La Lucerne-d'Outremer, in France.
The abbey was founded in 1143 by Hasculf de Subligny, son of Othoerne, the tutor of William Adelin, both of whom perished in the White Ship disaster of 1120, and later had the support of the English crown. The new monastery was settled from Dommartin Abbey near Hesdin. The foundation stone of the permanent buildings was laid in 1164 by Achard of St. Victor, who was later buried here. Construction lasted from 1164 to 1178 and was in the Romanesque style, in the restrained and sober manner of Cistercian architecture, except that the complex was dominated by an Anglo-Norman Gothic tower.
La Lucerne was the mother-house of four other Premonstratensian monasteries: Ardenne Abbey, Mondaye Abbey and Belle-Étoile Abbey (at Cerisy-Belle-Étoile) in Normandy, and Beauport Abbey in Brittany.
Major structural renovations were carried out in the 15th and 17th centuries.
During the French Revolution, in 1792, the abbey was suppressed. Its buildings were at first turned into a cotton mill and then used as a source of stone.
Reconstruction.
The ruins were classed as a "monument historique" in 1928.
In 1959, under the aegis of Abbé Marcel Lelégard (1925-94), the enormous task was begun, which still continues under the "Fondation Abbaye de La Lucerne d'Outremer", of the restoration of the abbey. The first phase of the work was the reconstruction of the abbey church, particularly the ogival crossing vaults and the west front with its Romanesque portal, continuing to the refectory and cellars. 
Work has continued since then and the tithe barn, the Romanesque lavatorium (the only one in Normandy), the medieval gatehouse (with its bakery and courtrooms), the dovecote, the park, the 18th century abbot's lodgings and the ponds are all now restored . The chapel of Blessed Achard is in the process of restoration.
One of the aims of the "Fondation Abbaye de La Lucerne d'Outremer" has been to re-establish a monastic community at La Lucerne, and the abbey is still being rebuilt with that intention.

Liliesleaf Farm

Liliesleaf Farm in northern Johannesburg, South Africa, was the farm used secretly by African National Congress activists in the 1960s and was the location where many prominent African National Congress leaders were arrested, leading to the Rivonia Trial. Nowadays Liliesleaf Farm is a Museum and world famous Heritage Site, attracting many visitors annually, and rated as a top "things to do in Johannesburg" site. 
In 1961, Lilliesleaf Farm in Rivonia was purchased by Arthur Goldreich and Harold Wolpe as headquarters for the underground Communist Party and a safe house for political fugitives. The purchase was made using South African Communist Party funds. Nelson Mandela needed a safe place from which to operate, and lived there under the assumed name of David Motsamayi as a worker in blue overalls employed by the owner to look after the farm.
On 11 July 1963, security police raided the farm and captured 19 members of the underground, charging them with sabotage. They were meeting in the thatched room, and were stunned by the raid. 
George Mellis, the young son of the owner of the Rivonia Caravan Park, which lay opposite the entrance to Winston Avenue leading to the farm, saw cars coming and going and people of various races meeting and greeting each other. In those days that was sufficiently unusual for him to tell his family, and a string of reports, coincidences and rumours, and an informer in the military wing, led to the police raid.
The activists had already decided to move to another safe location, and this was to be the final meeting in the farmhouse. Nelson Mandela was already in prison, serving a sentence of several years for relatively minor offences, having been arrested the previous year. The police found documents during the raid incriminating Mandela. As a result he was charged and brought to trial with the others.
The trial, which ran from October 1963 to June 1964, culminated in the imposition of life sentences for eight of the accused.
Liliesleaf Farm today.
The farmhouse at Liliesleaf Farm has now been surrounded by the gradual spread of Johannesburg's suburbs, but the historic site has been reopened to visitors. The buildings have been restored to their earlier condition, and visual and audio-visual displays recreate the dramatic events leading up to the police raid, and the raid itself.
The farm is referred to either as "Liliesleaf" or "Lilliesleaf", with the former spelling used at the site itself.

It is mandated to provide higher professional and special instructions for special purposes and to promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in education and other related fields. Its main campus is in Tacloban City.
History.
The history of Leyte Normal University dates back to the pre-war years. It came into being in 1921 as the Provincial Normal School, a mere adjunct of the Leyte High School. It eventually outgrew its base becoming a two-year collegiate training institution in 1938. It became a degree-granting four-year college complete with a training department in 1952. It was then known as Leyte Normal School.
On June 14, 1976, it was converted into the Leyte State College by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 944, signed by then Pres. Ferdinand Marcos.
In 1993, the late Cong. Cirilo Roy Montejo filed House Bill No. 22 in the House of Representatives proposing the conversion of the college into a university. This bill was sponsored by former Sen. Letecia Ramos-Shahani in the Senate. On February 23, 1995, the college was converted into the Leyte Normal University though R.A. 7910.
Sometime in April 1996, the university was proclaimed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as the Center of Excellence for Teacher Education in Region VIII from 1996 to 2001. Then in August 2008, CHED again awarded LNU as Center of Excellence for Teacher Education from 2008 - 2011.

It opened its doors on November 17, 2006 with three major anchor stores including Walmart, Lowes and Hollywood Theatres. The fourth, Gander Mountain, opened ten months later. The shopping district is located south of Airport Road on the east side of Interstate 95, two miles (3 km) east of Jacksonville International Airport (JIA). When Phase II is fully built out, the project will have cost over $300 million to build and boast more than 100 retailers.
Original Plans.
The original plan for the $300 million, mixed use project included a shopping district, 900 residential units, 300 hotel rooms, and 133,000 ft2 of light industrial space. The retail center, developed by Ramco Gershenson, will eventually include of retail space and should attract shoppers from Nassau County and southeast Georgia.
Movies.
Hollywood Theaters built a stand-alone building at the mall's south end. All 14 screens featured stadium seating when it opened on September 21, 2006. Portland, Oregon based Hollywood Theaters planned to spend nearly $14 million on the project, which is managed by Wallace Theaters. 
Current status.
While the RCM that exists today is not exactly what the "developers originally intended", it "is still the largest shopping center to be constructed on Northside" and provides "an array of retail destinations that previously" were only available across the river or in Orange Park, a drive of approximately 20 minutes.

Bois-Seigneur-Isaac Abbey

Bois-Seigneur-Isaac Abbey, in Ophain-Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, Belgium (a village now part of the town of Braine-l'Alleud), is a former Augustinian abbey, now a Premonstratensian priory, dependent on Averbode Abbey.
History.
Origins - legend or history?
In the 11th century Lord Isaac ("Seigneur Isaac") set out on Crusade and was taken prisoner by the Saracens, but was miraculously freed following a vision of the Virgin Mary. On returning to his lands he built a wooden chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Grace and Consolation, with a statue venerated for nearly two centuries. In 1336 the neighbouring village of Ittre, suffering the Black Death, won permission from the bishop of Cambrai (whose diocese included Brabant) to carry the statue in procession through their village. It was found that the plague abated wherever the statue passed and so the villagers refused to hand back the statue which had protected them so well, finally winning the bishop's agreement to keep it and place a new statue in the chapel of Bois-Seigneur-Isaac.
Augustinian abbey.
Better documented is the eucharistic miracle which occurred here on 5 June 1405. On that day, whilst celebrating mass, the parish priest of Ittre found a fragment of the consecrated host in the corporal, which, when he took it in his hands, began to bleed. The bishop of Cambrai investigated the miracle and in 1410 declared it genuine and allowed the chapel to become a place of pilgrimage. Augustinian canons were summoned to the site in 1413 to attend to the spiritual needs of the growing number of pilgrims and the priory the canons established soon became autonomous, becoming an independent abbey in 1416 as the abbey of Bois-Seigneur-Isaac ("Abbatia Silvae Domini-Isaac"), a member of the reformist Congregation of Windesheim.
The small Gothic chapel built over the site of the miracle, which is still the priory church, is the oldest building of the complex and is surmounted by an elegant bell tower. The year 1593 on a keystone shows that it was built in phases, with nearly 200 years between the start and completion of the works. It has a 16th-century ceiling, decorated stalls, paintings of the miracle (by J. Crockaert, 1777), a double-naved sacristy, a polychrome statue of the Virgin and Child, a reliquary and a monstrance.
The French Wars of Religion saw the abbey ravaged by the troops of William the Silent in 1580 and the canons forced to flee. Once it was possible to return they did so and rebuilt the abbey, continuing to serve pilgrims until the end of the 18th century. During the French Revolution, Bois-Seigneur-Isaac and all other religious houses were suppressed by the law of 15 Fructidor (1795), and the monks expelled the following year. The local population intervened and although the cloister was demolished and part of the buildings turned into a farm, the chapel survived and was served by a chaplain throughout the 19th century.
Premonstratensian abbey.
When the Republican law of 1903 expelled all monks from France, the canons from Mondaye Abbey lived in exile at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, buying and rebuilding the abbey ruins, turning the chapel into the monastery's church, and renewing and promoting the local devotion to the Holy Blood. The abbey again became an important pilgrimage and spiritual centre. In 1921 the canons were allowed to return to Mondaye and handed over Bois-Seigneur-Isaac to their co-brothers of Averbode Abbey, who ensured the continuity of monastic life and pastoral services there.
In 1957 Bois-Seigneur-Isaac officially became a priory dependent on Averbode. The number of pilgrims has dropped dramatically, but the devotion remains active via a Fraternity of the Holy Blood set up in 1900. On major festivals, the Wednesday before Pentecost (the anniversary of the miracle), 1 July (feast of the Holy Blood) and the first Sunday after 8 September (Birth of Our Lady), major celebrations are held, with a procession of the sacrament along the village streets.

Carole Feuerman

Carole A. Feuerman (Born 1945) is an American artist and hyper-realistic sculptor. 
Life and work.
Feuerman currently lives and works in New York, New York. She is most known for her resin sculptures painted in oil, but she also utilizes other media such as bronze and stone. She developed a technique she calls “painting with fire” where she pours, splatters and splashes up to five different molten metals that are 2000 degrees in temperature.
She is represented by galleries both nationally and abroad, and has work in many public and private collections all over the world. She has enjoyed six museum retrospectives to date, and has been included in exhibitions at, among other venues, the Smithsonian Institute's National Portrait Gallery, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, the Venice Biennale, and Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, Italy.
Public Art.
In 2003, Feuerman was commissioned by artist Seward Johnson and the Sculpture Foundation to create a one of a kind painted bronze sculpture installation for the permanent collection of Grounds for Sculpture.
In 2010 she introduced photography and interactive video media as a component to her sculptural works. Most recently she has directed her focus to the realm of public art and a series of hyper-realistically painted bronze sculptures.
On May 20, 2012, Feuerman unveiled her monumental sculpture "Survival of Serena" in painted bronze with New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation. Its resin sister debuted at the Venice Biennale in 2007. The new "Survival of Serena" is the first of a series of painted bronze sculptures by the artist designed specifically for outdoor placement. The bronze sculpture was prominently installed in Petrosino Square through September before traveling to the Boca Raton Beach Resort in Florida, where it is currently on view. Additional painted bronze sculptures by Feuerman inclding "Next Summer" and "Balance" were publicly showcased by Baker Sponder Gallery at the Boca Raton Beach Club & Resort as well the Ritz Carlton Key Biscayne.
From September 19, 2012 through January 6, 2013, Feuerman's monumental work "Quan", in painted bronze and polished stainless steel, was featured at Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan as part of the group show entitled "Body Double: The Figure in Contemporary Sculpture".
A 16 foot bronze diver entitled "The Golden Mean" at Riverfront Green Park with Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, New York was unveiled on September 29, 2012, Feuerman's largest work to date. A video documentary on the two-year creation of the work plays on loop at the HVCCA gallery space and has also been posted online. In 2013, The City of Peekskill announced the acquisition of the sculpture as a permanent monument to the town. A second diver was created for her spring 2013 solo exhibition at Jim Kempner Fine Art also titled "The Golden Mean" where it is on display in the outdoor sculpture garden through the summer and then moved to an 8 piece outdoor sculpture exhibition at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City. The monumental model used to create the bronze was installed in the 2013 Venice Biennale where it is on display in Giardini at the entrance to the Biennale.
