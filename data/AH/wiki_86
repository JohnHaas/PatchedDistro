2008 Guinean coup d'état

The 2008 Guinean coup d'état was a Guinean military "coup d'état" that occurred in Guinea on 23 December 2008, shortly after the death of long-time President Lansana Conté. A junta called the National Council for Democracy and Development ("Conseil National de la Démocratie et du Development", CNDD), headed by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, seized power and announced that it planned to rule the country for two years prior to a new presidential election. Camara did indeed step down after Alpha Condé was elected in the 2010 election.
Death of Conté.
In the early hours of 23 December 2008, Aboubacar Somparé, the President of the National Assembly, announced on television that Conté had died at 6:45 pm local time the previous day "after a long illness." While Somparé did not name the particular illness, sources reported that Conté had chronic diabetes and leukemia. According to the Constitution, the President of the National Assembly is to assume the Presidency in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election is to be held within 60 days. Somparé requested that the President of the Supreme Court, Lamine Sidimé, declare a vacancy in the Presidency and apply the Constitution. Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souaré and General Diarra Camara, the head of the army, stood alongside Somparé during his announcement. Declaring 40 days of national mourning for Conté, Souaré urged "calm and restraint". He told the army to secure the borders and maintain calm within the country "in homage to the memory of the illustrious late leader".
Government officials met at the People's Palace, seat of the National Assembly, in the early hours of 23 December. Prime Minister Souaré, Somparé, the President of the Supreme Court, and military leaders were present.
Speaking to Radio France Internationale after Conté's death, opposition leader Jean-Marie Doré of the Union for the Progress of Guinea stressed that the institutions of state must "be able to work to prevent unnecessary disorder in Guinea which would add to the current difficult situation".
Announcement of coup d'état.
Six hours after Somparé announced Conté's death, a statement was read on state radio announcing a military coup d'état. This statement, read by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara on behalf of a group called the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD), said that "the government and the institutions of the Republic have been dissolved." The statement also announced the suspension of the constitution "as well as political and union activity." According to Captain Camara, the coup was necessary due to Guinea's "deep despair" amidst rampant poverty and corruption, and he said that the existing institutions were "incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country." Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as Prime Minister at the head of a new government that would be ethnically balanced. The National Council for Democracy and Development would, according to Camara, include 26 officers as well as six civilians.
Reporting from Conakry at the time of the coup announcement, Alhassan Sillah of the BBC said that the situation in the city was "unusually quiet" and that he had not seen any soldiers. Later in the day, several tanks were seen in the city.
Following Camara's announcement, Souaré said the government and state institutions were intact. According to Souaré, he did not know who was behind the coup attempt, but he said that he was "sure that they will see reason. They have not used force. There has been no threat against anybody." Somparé, meanwhile, called the coup attempt "a setback for our country" and expressed hope that it would not succeed. He argued that most soldiers were still loyal to the government.
It was reported that soldiers at the Alfa Yaya Diallo military camp had chosen a lieutenant-colonel, Sékouba Konaté, as leader of the coup attempt, although some soldiers objected because they believed a higher-ranking officer should have been chosen. The chief of the armed forces, General Diarra Camara, said that the coup plotters represented only a minority of the army. In the afternoon of 23 December, amidst confusion about who was in control of the country, Gen. Camara asked that the soldiers "at least wait until after [Conté's] funeral", while also stating that he was not trying to prevent anyone's ambitions.
On 23 December, both the office of the Prime Minister and the Little Palace, Conté's former residence, were reported to be under the control of the coup leaders. According to Somparé, the leaders of the coup held a meeting to choose an interim leader for the country late on 23 December; he said that Moussa Camara, Sékouba Konaté, and Toto Camara were considered candidates for the position. The composition of the CNDD was announced late on 23 December; it included 32 members, 26 of whom were officers and six of whom were civilians.
In an interview with Guineenews on 23 December, opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo said that he believed the constitution should be respected, while also saying that he believed a new presidential election should be held together with the already planned parliamentary election on 31 May 2009.
Consolidation of CNDD authority.
A statement was read over the radio on 24 December announcing that Captain Moussa Dadis Camara was the President of the CNDD. Later in the day, Camara and thousands of soldiers loyal to him paraded through the city, surrounded by large numbers of civilian supporters. According to Camara, he "came to see if the terrain is favorable to us", declaring that the large crowds indicated that the people were indeed supportive of the coup. Also on 24 December, Camara said in a radio broadcast that the CNDD did not want to stay in power indefinitely and that it intended to lead the country for two years, promising "credible and transparent presidential elections by the end of December 2010". This contradicted an earlier statement promising an election within the constitutionally mandated period of 60 days.
The CNDD declared an 8 pm to 6:30 am nation-wide curfew, although it said that the curfew would not be implemented until 26 December to avoid interfering with the Christian celebration of Christmas. The extent of the CNDD's control remained unclear on 24 December; although Prime Minister Souaré had gone into hiding, he insisted that the government had not been toppled. Souaré described Camara as "an unknown captain doesn't control the army" and argued again that most troops were loyal, while attributing the "disorder" to "one little group".
Shortly after the CNDD ordered all members of the government and army officers to go to the Alpha Yaya Diallo military camp within 24 hours, with the threat of "a sweep of the entire national territory" if they did not. Prime Minister Souaré went to the camp and turned himself in on 25 December, together with all the members of his government except for two ministers who were, according to Souaré, on official missions abroad. Camara met with Souaré and stressed that the CNDD was now in power, but he said that Souaré and his government could "go back to business". During the meeting, Souaré lamented the death of Conté and expressed his government's willingness to serve under the CNDD, pointing out that his government was composed of technocrats, not politicians. He also addressed Camara as "President".
Speaking on the radio on 25 December, Camara said that he did not plan to run for President at the end of the two year transitional period. He also declared that the CNDD was not susceptible to bribes. According to Camara, people had "startto show up with bags of money to try to corrupt us. They've tried to give money to our wives and cars to our children." He warned that he would "personally go after anyone who tries to corrupt us". Camara also said that Conté's funeral on 26 December (several days late) would be "grandiose", and he expressed disapproval in describing the lack of proper care for Conté's body.
Conté's funeral was held on 26 December, with over 20,000 in attendance at the national stadium in Conakry. Leaders of neighboring countries were present for the funeral, although Camara was not. General Mamadouba Toto Camara of the CNDD said at the funeral that "we pray God to give us the courage to continue work of tolerance and peace for the welfare of Guinea". He was then taken to his hometown of Moussayah for burial.
Camara held a large "informational meeting" at the Alfa Yaya Diallo military base on 27 December; about 1,000 people representing various groups were present, including Somparé, the key opposition leaders Alpha Condé and Sidya Touré, and the trade union leader Rabiatou Serah Diallo. At the meeting, Camara discussed his plans to renegotiate mining contracts and fight corruption. He said that all gold mining had already been halted for the time being. Camara also told the opposition and union leaders that they could propose a Prime Minister. Condé said on that occasion that the members of the CNDD junta were "patriots", and his party, the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG), subsequently expressed its willingness to participate in a government under the CNDD. Sidya Touré gave a positive assessment of the situation and said that "we will discuss the program and timetable for the transition and we will ensure that the military keep their promises."
Although the CNDD's curfew was enforced on 26 December, the junta decided to lift the curfew beginning on 27 December in order to encourage "a climate of peace". At around the same time, AFP reported the retirement of 22 senior military officers who had reached retirement age. The retired officers included General Diarra Camara, the army's chief of staff, who opposed the coup. Two officers were appointed to key positions on 28 December: Captain Kelety Faro as Minister Secretary-General at the Presidency and General Mamadouba Toto Camara as Minister of Security and Civil Protection. Also, Sékouba Konaté was appointed as Minister of Defense.
On 29 December, soldiers forcefully entered the compound of Mamadou Sylla—a wealthy businessman who had been an ally and close personal friend of Lansana Conté—and told Sylla to relinquish the keys to six SUV vehicles that they said were owned by the state. Sylla did so, but he complained that force was not necessary and said that the vehicles had been part of a contract between his company and the military.
The CNDD appointed Kabine Komara, a banker working in Egypt at the African Export-Import Bank, as Prime Minister on 30 December 2008. In a television speech on 1 January 2009, Camara said that the coup had prevented Guinea from "tumbling into ethnic warfare". According to Camara, Somparé was not a legitimate constitutional successor because his mandate as President of the National Assembly had legally expired, and he said that if Somparé had taken office, there would have been "incalculable consequences".
About 20 soldiers searched the home of opposition leader and former Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo on 1 January, while holding Diallo and his family at gunpoint. According to Diallo, the search was based on suspicions that Diallo had weapons and mercenaries and was planning another coup, but he said that the soldiers did not take anything from his home. A junta delegation met with Diallo on 2 January and condemned the search, saying that "uncontrollable elements out to hurt the junta" were to blame and that Camara and the CNDD had nothing to do with it.
On 5 January 2009, Camara stated that both legislative and presidential elections would be held by the end of 2009, a year earlier than originally announced.
Camara, acting on the recommendation of Prime Minister Komara, appointed a new government on 14 January 2009. The government was composed of soldiers and technocrats and did not include any political parties. The government included 27 ministers and two secretaries of state.
Colonel Aboubacar Sidiki Camara was sworn in as Permanent Secretary to the CNDD on 26 January 2009.
Contrary to the wishes of CNDD President Camara, he was unwilling to postpone his swearing in, and he also requested the release of officers who were closely associated with Conté. He was promptly arrested later on 26 January; CNDD member Biro Condé was also reportedly arrested at that time. CNDD President Camara said on 27 January that Aboubacar Sidiki Camara had been dismissed from his post as Permanent Secretary due to negligence. He was released from detention on 28 January.

Seničica

Seničica is a small village south of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. The settlement arose alongside Mavelščica Creek (previously called Seničica Creek).
Name.
Seničica is also known as "Snič(i)ca" locally. The name is derived from "*sěnьnica" 'hay shed' and is related to other Slavic toponyms such as Sjenica, Senice, and Senica.
History.
Approximately two centuries ago the French operated a mine near the village, presumably for coal. Today the excavations and tailings from the mine can still be seen in the woods on the way to Žlebe.
Cultural heritage.
There is a stone bridge across Mavelščica Creek; it is a special feature of the municipality because in the past it was part of an important north-south transit route known as the "Ljubelj Road" connecting Salzburg and Aquileia. Because of this special function the bridge was built with special care, with large stones specially fitted to one another. The year 1666 is carved on the bridge. The bridge is occasionally referred to as "Napoleon's Bridge"; although Napoleon likely crossed it, its construction had nothing to do with the movement of French troops because it predates the Napoleonic campaign by a century and a half. Circa 1970 the bridge was registered as Yugoslav cultural heritage with the highest level of protection through the efforts of Marko Mušič. The bridge was renovated in the early 1980s. Today it is part of a protected complex together with a nearby chestnut plantation.

Salotgi

Salotgi as a centre of learning in the 11th century.
According to A.S. Altekar in "Education in Ancient India":
The village of Salotgi in Bijapur District of the Bombay Presidency was a famous centre, probably of Vedic learning, in the 10th and 11th centuries C.E. The Sanskrit college that flourished at this place must have existed for a long time, for it eventually transformed the original name of the place, Pavittage, into Salotgi, which is an abbreviated and Prakristised compound of Sala and Pavittage. The college was located in a spacious hall, attached to the temple of "Tray-Purusha", which was built by Narayana, a minister of the Rashtrakuta emperor Krishna III. Owing to its far spread fame for efficiency, the college could attract students from different parts of the country. The strength of the college is not known, but it seems that 27 houses were necessary for lodging the students. An endowment of 12 Nivartanas(probably equal to 60 acres) of land was made for meeting the lighting charges of the boarding houses. The students were offered free boarding, an endowment of 500 Nivartanas having been received for that purpose. It would appear that at least 200 students were offered free boarding, lodging and education at this institution.
Transportation.
Salotgi can be reached by K.S.R.T.C buses from Indi which is 7–8 km away. the nearest railway station is Indi Road Railway which is connected to Solapur and Bijapur. Some private buses can be accessed to reach Salotgi. The nearest airport is Solapur. One can also reach Salotgi by hiring a tum tum from Indi.

It is well written, entertaining and presents a lot of original material and new ideas on war-game design." The reviewer added that, while Sabin "makes frequent references to his previous book, "Lost Battles: Reconstructing the Great Clashes of the Ancient World", which I found distracting, ... I enjoyed reading this book: it is well researched and academically sound and, for the right audience, it will be very welcome."

Smlednik () is a village on the left bank of the Sava River in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
Smlednik was attested in written sources in 1136 as "Fledinich" (and as "Vlednich" in 1214 and "Vlednic" in 1228). The origin of the name is unclear. A possible derivation is from the common noun "smled" 'hog's fennel', referring to the local vegetation. Other explanations include the obsolete Slovene common noun "smled" 'watchpost', or the root "*mlědъ" 'deciduous woods' or 'sparse woods', but neither of these is linguistically convincing. In the 19th century the German name was "Flödnig".

Centerpin fishing

Centerpin fishing, also called float fishing, is a fishing technique which uses a noodle or mooching rod, reel and Roe or fly. The method is used behind boats for steelhead fishing in salt water, and is currently popular with freshwater salmon anglers who drift floats downstream.
Directional floats can also be used. These can be planed left and right and flip direction when given a little tug by flicking the rod tip.

Oregon Ballot Measure 54 (2008)

Oregon Ballot Measure 54 (2008) or House Joint Resolution (HJR 4) is a legislatively referred constitutional amendment that removed provisions relating to qualifications of electors for school district elections. The measure is a technical fix designed to remove inoperative, provisions in the Oregon Constitution which barred those under 21 from voting in school board elections and required voters to be able to pass a literacy test to vote in school district elections. This measure appeared on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon. It was passed by voters, receiving 72.59% of the vote.<br>
History.
Background.
In 1948, voters passed a ballot measure amending the Oregon Constitution to require that in order to vote in school elections citizens must meet certain qualifications. Those qualifications were set forth in , of the Oregon Constitution, and included requirements that a citizen be at least 21 years old, have resided in the school district for at least six months before the election and have registered for the election. A citizen meeting these qualifications would also only be allowed to vote in the school election if they could also read and write English.
Later developments in voting rights laws and in court decisions have made each of those requirements unconstitutional or a violation of federal law. The 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents denial or abridgment of the voting rights of a citizen 18 years of age or older. Federal court decisions have held that residency requirements of the type which were set forth in section 6, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 generally prohibits literacy tests as a condition for eligibility to vote. Because of this, Oregon’s Attorney General in 1972, Lee Johnson, held that the requirements under section 6 were unenforceable.
Path to the ballot.
The move to put this measure before the voters began when in the spring of 2006 when the Grant High School Constitution Team in Portland were meeting to continue its preparations for the Center for Civic Education's annual "" competition, in which knowledge of the U.S. Constitution is tested in a simulated congressional hearing.
While attending the Grant Constitutional Team meeting Roy Pulvers, a Portland attorney and the father of one of the students, brought up the provisions of Article VIII, Section 6 in the Oregon Constitution to the team and its coaches. He had been preparing for an election-law conference in Washington, D.C. he was going to be attending, and was reading through relevant Oregon statutes and constitutional provisions. He stated his belief that the requirements of Section 6 were unconstitutional. The team agreed and prompted the students to take action.
At first the students considered filing a lawsuit, but dropped the idea since it was no longer being enforced. Over the course of several months the students broke into small groups and researched the issue, gathering evidence to help overturn what they believed were outdated, unfair voting restrictions still codified in Oregon's Constitution. 
Once they felt they had evidence, they drafted a letter outlining their case and sent it to Bill Bradbury who was then the Oregon Secretary of State. 
His office sent a letter to Hardy Myers, who was at that time the Oregon attorney general, to take a look at the section and give a legal opinion on the matter. The attorney general's office wrote back saying that while the section is still on the books it was inoperative. This prompted the secretary of state's office to sponsor legislation during the 2007 session of the legislature to amend the state's constitution, which became House Joint Resolution 4 (HJR 4).
On January 24, 2007, lawmakers held public hearings and invited three of the students, Hannah Fisher, Ethan Gross and Pulvers' daughter Evan, to testify in front of the House Elections Committee. The bill passed the House and Senate with Rep. Jerry Krummel (R-26) of Wilsonville being the only opposing vote. This placed HJR 4 on the 2008 general election ballot as legislatively referred constitutional amendment, becoming Measure 54.
Passage.
While there was no organized opposition to the measure, it was reported there was a theoretical problem with striking Section 6. Portland Constitutional lawyer Chuck Hinkle expressed a concern that if passed, the measure might prevent people who do not own property from voting in school district elections.
The Chair of the House Elections Committee, Representative Diane Rosenbaum, dismissed such concerns. She pointed out that is not the intention of Measure 54, and that there are no plans to restrict school bond elections to taxpayers. The measure went on to be passed by voters with an overwhelming 72.59% of the vote, the second largest margin of victory in the November 2008 general election ballot.

Meghalaya Progressive Alliance

The Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) was the ruling coalition of political parties that formed the Government in the state of Meghalaya, India from 2008 to 2009. It was led by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the United Democratic Party (UDP) who are the second and third largest parties in the 8th Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Chief Minister Dr. Donkupar Roy and the other ministers in the Government belong to the MPA.
History.
The MPA was formed soon after the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly election, 2008 when it emerged that the Indian National Congress (INC) did not have sufficient Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to form the Government. All the non-INC parties in the state decided to join hands and formed the MPA in a bid to keep the INC out of power in Meghalaya.
After the elections, the Governor S. S. Sidhu invited the INC-led Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) under the leadership of D. D. Lapang to form the Government by virtue of being the largest party in the Assembly. The MPA claimed that this move by the Governor was unconstitutional since the MUA did not have sufficient majority in the Assembly. The MUA was given 10 days to prove its majority in the Assembly. As the confidence vote approached, D. D. Lapang resigned and the MPA was given the chance to form the Government.
The MPA Government headed by Dr. Donkupar Roy was sworn in by Governor Sidhu on 19 March 2008 with the support of 31 members in the 60 member Assembly.
The MPA have pledged to provide top priority to ensuring tranparency in governance and have prepared a common minimum program that reflects promises made by each of the constituent parties in their respective poll manifestoes.
Initial Support.
At the time of formation, the MPA included the following members:
Despite being the largest party, the NCP gave up the Chief Minister post to UDP in order to achieve stability in the Government. There are also some reports of a power-sharing agreement between the UDP and NCP to share the Chief Minister position for two and a half years each.
Changes in constituents.
By June, the MPA was able to secure further support from 2 additional independent MLAs. This took the ruling party's count to 33 in the 60 member Assembly.
Collapse.
In March 2009, Meghalaya was put under President's Rule. By May 2009, the United Democratic Party and the Hill State People's Democratic Party had left the Progressive Alliance, and the United Alliance returned to power with D.D. Lapang as chief minister.

Sora, Medvode

Sora () is a village in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Farjevec (or Pri Farjevcu) and Komarnija.
Geography.
Sora is a clustered village at the foot of Hom Hill (718 m) on an alluvial fan above Ločnica Creek, where it exits a narrow valley in the hills to the southwest. The soil is loamy and fields lie below the village, extending toward the Sora River to the north. The surrounding hills are karstified and there is a large cave on Kravjek Hill.
Name.
Sora was attested in written sources in 1154 as "Zower" (and as "Ceur" in 1161 and "Zevra" in 1252). The name is derived from the Sora River and comes from the archaic Slovene common noun "" from the verb "*sъ-vьrěti" 'to pour out, boil over', referring to a flashy stream, and presumably turbulent confluences along the course of the river. In the 19th century the German name was "Zaier".
History.
The remnants of a Roman building and graves have been found between Sora and neighboring Rakovnik, attesting to early settlement in the area. A regular school was established in Sora in 1874, and the school building was remodeled in 1907. A catchment basin for water was built below the church in 1911 at the initiative of the writer Fran Saleški Finžgar. Engagements in the area during the Second World War are commemorated by a stone commemorating a fallen female Partisan along the road to Topol pri Medvodah and a monument with the names of seven fallen Partisans next to the road along Ločnica Creek. After the Second World War, the local school was named after the communist people's hero Avgust Barle. This name was removed in 1992, when the school was renamed the Sora Branch School ().
Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Stephen (). A church already stood at the location in the 13th century and its parish priest was cited in a document from 1295. The church was remodeled several times, and in 1882 a new church was built in the pseudo-Gothic style.The church contains a painting of Saint Stephen by Janez Valentin Metzinger (1699–1759).

Sherlock (TV series)

Sherlock is a British television crime drama that presents a contemporary adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. Nine episodes have been produced, the first three of which aired in 2010. Series two aired in 2012, and a third series aired in the first quarter of 2014. The third series has become the UK's most watched drama series since 2001. "Sherlock" has been sold to over 200 territories.
"Sherlock" depicts "consulting detective" Holmes, assisting the Metropolitan Police Service, primarily Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves), in solving various crimes. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate, Dr John Watson, who has returned from military service in Afghanistan. Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes' conflict with his archnemesis Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) is a recurring feature. Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), a pathologist at St. Bart's Hospital occasionally assists Holmes in his cases. Other recurring roles include Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson, Holmes and Watson's landlady; and co-creator Mark Gatiss as Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes. 
Sue Vertue and Elaine Cameron of Hartswood Films produced the series for the BBC and co-produced it with WGBH Boston for its "Masterpiece" anthology series on PBS. The series is primarily filmed in Cardiff, Wales. North Gower Street in London is used for exterior shots of Holmes and Watson's 221B Baker Street residence. In January 2014, executive producer Steven Moffat has announced that a fourth series has been commissioned, with scripts being planned.
Critical reception has been highly positive, with many reviews commenting on the quality of the writing, performances and direction. "Sherlock" has been nominated for numerous awards including: BAFTAs, Emmys and Golden Globe, and winning several awards across a variety of categories. All of the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray, alongside tie-in editions of selected original Conan Doyle stories and original soundtrack composed by David Arnold and Michael Price. In January 2014, the show launched its official mobile app called "Sherlock: The Network" which was created by The Project Factory in association with Hartswood Films.
Production.
Conception and development.
Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, both Sherlock Holmes fans with experience of adapting or using Victorian literature for television, devised the concept of the series. Moffat had previously adapted the "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" for the 2007 series "Jekyll", while Gatiss had written the Dickensian "Doctor Who" episode "The Unquiet Dead". Moffat and Gatiss, both "Doctor Who" writers, discussed plans for a Holmes adaptation during their numerous train journeys to Cardiff where "Doctor Who" production is based. While they were in Monte Carlo for an awards ceremony, producer Sue Vertue, who is married to Moffat, encouraged Moffat and Gatiss to develop the project themselves before another creative team had the same idea. Moffat and Gatiss invited Stephen Thompson to write for the series in September 2008.
Gatiss has criticised recent television adaptations of the Conan Doyle stories as "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead to be as irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone, which were mostly set in the then-modern pre-WWII and post-WWII era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet, and GPS, to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of "Sherlock", says that this is in keeping with Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that "n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments. It's just a modern-day version of it. He will use the tools that are available to him today in order to find things out."
The update maintains some traditional elements of the stories, such as the Baker Street address and Holmes's adversary Moriarty. Although the events of the books are transferred to the present day, some elements are incorporated into the story. For example, Martin Freeman's Watson has returned from military service in Afghanistan. While discussing the fact that the original Watson was invalided home after serving in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880), Gatiss realised that "t is the same war now, I thought. The same unwinnable war."
"Sherlock" was announced as a single 60-minute drama production at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August 2008, with broadcast set for mid to late 2009. The intention was to produce a series of six 60-minute episodes should the pilot prove to be successful. However, the first version of the pilot—reported by "The Guardian" to have cost £800,000—led to rumours within the BBC and wider media that "Sherlock" was a potential disaster. The BBC decided not to transmit the pilot, requesting a reshoot and a total of three 90-minute episodes. The original pilot was included on the DVD of the first series. During the audio commentary, the creative team said that the BBC were "very happy" with the pilot but asked them to change the format. The pilot, observes critic Mark Lawson when it was released on DVD, was "substantially expanded and rewritten, and completely reimagined in look, pace and sound". In July 2009, the BBC drama department announced plans for three 90-minute episodes, to be broadcast in 2010. Moffat had previously announced that if a series of "Sherlock" was commissioned, Gatiss would take over the duties of executive producer so that he could concentrate on producing "Doctor Who".
Cast and characters.
Moffat and Vertue became interested in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 drama/war film "Atonement". The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. "Cumberbatch", says "The Guardian", "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, "There's a great charge you get from playing him, because of the volume of words in your head and the speed of thought—you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is one step ahead of the audience, and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." Piers Wenger, Head of Drama at BBC Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". However, Moffat turned the character "more Victorian" in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's "beautiful voice" to make it sound like "he's giving a lecture".
In an interview with "The Observer", co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, "Benedict was the only person we actually saw for part of Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too "barmy", as the producers required someone "straighter" for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in "Doctor Who".
The writers said that Freeman's casting developed the way in which Cumberbatch played Holmes. The theme of "friendship" appealed to both Gatiss and Moffat. Gatiss asserted the importance of achieving the correct tone for the character. "Watson is not an idiot, although it's true that Conan Doyle always took the piss out of him," said Gatiss. "But only an idiot would surround himself with idiots." Moffat said that Freeman is "the sort of opposite of Benedict in everything except the amount of talent... Martin finds a sort of poetry in the ordinary man. I love the fastidious realism of everything he does." Freeman describes his character as a "moral compass" for Sherlock, who does not always consider the morality and ethics of his actions.
Rupert Graves was cast as DI Greg Lestrade. The writers referred to the character as "Inspector Lestrade" during development until Gatiss realised that in contemporary England the character would have the title "Detective Inspector". Moffat and Gatiss pointed out that Lestrade does not appear often in the stories and is quite inconsistently portrayed in them. They decided to go with the version that appeared in "The Six Napoleons": a man who is frustrated by Holmes but admires him, and whom Holmes considers as the best person at Scotland Yard. Several candidates took a comedic tack in their auditions, but the creative team preferred the gravitas that Graves brought to the role. His first name is revealed to be Greg in "The Hounds of Baskerville".
Andrew Scott made his first appearance as Jim Moriarty in "The Great Game". Moffat said, "We knew what we wanted to do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho." Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation into these three episodes between Moriarty and Sherlock but realised that they "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other."
The remainder of the regular cast includes Una Stubbs (who has known Cumberbatch since he was four years old, as she had worked with his mother Wanda Ventham) as Mrs Hudson and co-creator Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes. Vinette Robinson, Jonathan Aris and Louise Brealey play the recurring roles of Sergeant Sally Donovan, Philip Anderson and Molly Hooper, respectively.
Amanda Abbington plays Mary Morstan, Watson's girlfriend and then wife. In Series 3 Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton, Benedict Cumberbatch's real parents, are introduced as Sherlock's parents.
Guest appearances included Phil Davis as Jeff, Paul Chequer as DI Dimmock, Zoe Telford as Sarah, Gemma Chan as Soo Lin Yao, John Sessions as Kenny Prince, Haydn Gwynne as Miss Wenceslas, Deborah Moore as one of Moriarty's victims and Peter Davison as the voice-over in the planetarium. Series two's "A Scandal in Belgravia" featured Lara Pulver as Irene Adler, while "The Hounds of Baskerville" featured Russell Tovey as Henry Knight. In the final episode of series 2, the role of Max Bruhl was played by Edward Holtom, while Katherine Parkinson played journalist Kitty Riley. The first episode of series 3 featured Derren Brown.
Production design and filming.
The show was produced by Hartswood Films for BBC Wales, while BBC Worldwide also provided co-production funding. Production was also co-funded by PBS, a network of public-service broadcasters in the United States, for WGBH-TV's "Masterpiece Mystery!" strand. Filming of the pilot episode, written by Moffat and directed by Coky Giedroyc, commenced in January 2009. The following January (2010), the first set of three episodes entered production. Paul McGuigan directed the first and third episodes and Euros Lyn directed the second. The three episodes were filmed in reverse order of their broadcast.
Gatiss says that they wanted to "fetishise modern London in the way that the period versions fetishise Victorian London". Production was based at Hartswood Films' Cardiff production unit, Hartswood Films West, which was opened in late 2009 to take advantage of the BBC's planned Cardiff Bay "drama village". Production of the first two series was based at Upper Boat Studios, where "Doctor Who" had been produced. Cardiff was more economical than in London, with some good matches for parts of London. However, some architecture could not be faked, so location shooting in the English capital was necessary. The location shots for 221B Baker Street were filmed at 187 North Gower Street – Baker Street was impractical because of heavy traffic, and the number of things labelled "Sherlock Holmes", which would need to be disguised. Executive producer Beryl Vertue explains how it was important to design the entirety of Sherlock's flat as a contemporary set, yet still convey his eccentricity. He would not, she says, live somewhere "too suburban" or "too modern".
Costumes for the pilot were designed by BAFTA Cymru award-winning costume designer Ray Holman. Cumberbatch wore a £1,000 Belstaff coat in the series. Sarah Arthur, the series' costume designer, explained how she achieved the detective's look. "Holmes wouldn't have any interest in fashion so I went for classic suits with a modern twist: narrow-leg trousers and a two-button, slim-cut jacket. I also went for slim-cut shirts and a sweeping coat for all the action scenes—it looks great against the London skyline."
The writers say that they did not want to force modernity onto the story. There were some creative challenges, such as the decision to include the sign "221B" on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.
The producers found it difficult to coordinate the schedules of the principal players and Moffat and Gatiss for a second series. Cumberbatch and Freeman both worked on the 2012 film "The Hobbit", and Moffat continued as "Doctor Who"s head writer. In response to the time pressure, "The Guardian" asserted, the series "features reworkings of three of Conan Doyle's most recognised tales". Gatiss says that there had been an argument for producing these tales over three years, but Moffat explained that they rejected "deferred pleasure". The relationship between Holmes and Watson developed during the second series, with Watson being less amazed by Sherlock's deductive abilities; Watson acted as the primary detective in the second episode, "The Hounds of Baskerville". The cast and production team were more confident during the second series' production following the positive audience and critical reaction to the first series.
Music.
The theme and incidental music was composed by David Arnold and Michael Price. Arnold explains that he and Price worked with the producers to "come up with a central theme and character" for the series, then found what was "going to be the defining sound of this show". Pieces were often constructed using synthesizers, but the tracks used for the show were recorded using real musicians, Arnold says, to bring the music "to life". Similarly, Price comments that the musicians can adapt their performance of a score by responding to footage from the show.
Episodes.
Three series, each consisting of three episodes, have been produced. The first series was initially broadcast in July and August 2010 on the BBC, later premiering on co-funders Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States in October 2010. A second series of three episodes was first broadcast in the UK in January 2012, and then in the U.S. during May 2012. The third series premiered in the UK on 1 January 2014 and in the US on 19 January 2014. The series has been sold to over 200 territories.
Series 1 (2010).
The first episode, "A Study in Pink", loosely based upon the first Sherlock Holmes novel "A Study in Scarlet", was written by Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan. The story depicts the introduction of Holmes to Watson, and them entering a flatshare at Baker Street in London, and then their investigation into a series of deaths, initially believed to be suicides. The episode was first broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD on 25 July 2010.
The second episode, "The Blind Banker", was first broadcast on 1 August 2010. Written by Stephen Thompson and directed by Euros Lyn, the episode depicts Holmes being hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in the City.
The first series concluded with "The Great Game", which was first broadcast on 8 August 2010. The episode introduces the character of Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) to the series, who sets Holmes deadlines to solve a series of apparently unrelated cases. Written by Mark Gatiss and directed by McGuigan, "The Great Game" ends in a cliffhanger in which Sherlock and Moriarty reach a standoff involving a bomb removed moments earlier from Watson.
Series 2 (2012).
After the high ratings for "A Study in Pink", the BBC were reportedly eager to produce more episodes. On 10 August 2010, it was confirmed that "Sherlock" had been renewed for a second series. At the 2011 convention, Gatiss confirmed which stories would be adapted, and that the writers of the first series would each write an episode for series two. Acknowledging that "A Scandal in Bohemia", "The Hound of the Baskervilles" and "The Final Problem" are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, Gatiss explained, "We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous ." "There's the question of how to go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on. You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too." Paul McGuigan directed the first two episodes, and "Doctor Who" director Toby Haynes handled the last one. The second series of three 90-minute episodes was initially planned to air in late 2011, but was delayed until early January 2012.
"A Scandal in Belgravia", written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast on 1 January 2012. Loosely based on "A Scandal in Bohemia", the episode depicts Holmes's quest to retrieve compromising photos of a minor royal held on the camera phone of Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), a ruthless and brilliant dominatrix who also trades in classified information extracted from her rich and powerful clients.
Mark Gatiss wrote "The Hounds of Baskerville", which investigates the strange activities at a military base. Aware that "The Hound of the Baskervilles", first published in 1902, was one of the most famous of Conan Doyle's original stories, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he does when adapting the lesser-known stories. Russell Tovey appeared as Henry Knight, a man whose father was ripped apart by a gigantic hound on Dartmoor twenty years earlier. Directed by McGuigan, the episode was first broadcast on 8 January 2012.
The second series concluded with "The Reichenbach Fall". Steve Thompson wrote the episode, which was directed by Toby Haynes, who had previously directed many of Moffat's "Doctor Who" episodes. First broadcast on 15 January 2012, the episode follows Moriarty's plot to discredit and kill Sherlock Holmes, concluding with Holmes faking his suicide. It was based upon Conan Doyle's story "The Final Problem", in which Sherlock and Moriarty are presumed to have fallen to their deaths from the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. Moffat felt that he and co-creator Gatiss had outdone Conan Doyle in their version of Holmes' fall and Moffat added that, in that much-discussed sequence, there was still "a clue everybody's missed".
Christmas mini-episode (2013).
BBC One premiered a "Sherlock" mini-episode over the 2013 Christmas period entitled "Many Happy Returns". The episode is available via BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button service, and BBCs YouTube channel, and acts as a prequel to the third series.
The synopsis for the episode reads "Sherlock has been gone for two years. But someone isn't quite convinced that he's dead." The 'someone' turns out to be Anderson, the forensics technician from series 1 and 2 (who has now lost his job due to his obsessive conviction that the detective still lives). He had a long standing mistrust of Sherlock, yet is now one of the few people who believes Sherlock is alive, and throughout the episode is trying to convince Lestrade. Anderson tracks him via various mysterious events from Tibet to New Delhi to Germany in which he seems to be involved, and points out that the incidents are getting progressively closer to London.
Series 3 (2014).
After the end of the final episode of the second series, Moffat and Gatiss both announced on Twitter that a third series had been commissioned at the same time as series two, and a part of the resolution to "The Reichenbach Fall" was filmed concurrently with series two. Without revealing whether Moriarty also faked his own death at the end of series two, Moffat suggested that Moriarty will not feature heavily in future series of "Sherlock".
"The Empty Hearse", written by Mark Gatiss and directed by Jeremy Lovering, is the first episode of Season 3 and was first broadcast on 1 January 2014. Inspired by "The Adventure of the Empty House" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the episode follows Sherlock Holmes' return to London and reunion with John Watson, and their subsequent solving of an underground terrorist network.
In "The Sign of Three", written by Stephen Thompson, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, Watson and Mary Morstan get married. The episode takes place during the wedding reception and the story is told through flashbacks. The episode title is inspired by "The Sign of the Four".
The final episode "His Last Vow" was first broadcast on 12 January 2014, on BBC One, and written by Steven Moffat, directed by Nick Hurran and is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton". This case leads Sherlock into conflict with Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a "terrifying" villain who was introduced as an unnamed villain in episode one. Holmes and Watson try to get Magnussen arrested; but their attempt fails, and Holmes shoots Magnussen to stop him from blackmailing Mary Watson. Mycroft arranges that Sherlock will be exiled from the United Kingdom instead of being tried for murder. However, as Sherlock's plane takes off, every video screen in London broadcasts the image of Moriarty, and Sherlock is recalled to deal with the crisis associated with Moriarty's potential return.
The third series aired in the United States on PBS over a period of three weeks, airing late January to early February of 2014.
Series 4.
The show's executive producer, Steven Moffat, has confirmed that a fourth series has been commissioned, with scripts being planned. Previously the show's stars, Cumberbatch and Freeman, announced to the press their desire to return for a fourth series, although co-creator Steven Moffat at the time indicated that BBC executives had not formally commissioned further episodes. Moffat told "The Telegraph", "we're all keen to continue", but it is difficult to co-ordinate the lead actors' schedules. Moffat continued, "And obviously Mark and I have our other commitments too, but it's just a matter of scheduling." Moffat and Gatiss also announced that they have developed plots for a fourth and fifth series.
Reception.
Critical response.
The show met with critical acclaim, sustaining positive reviews across its three series. Series one holds a Metacritic score of 85/100, based on 17 reviews and series two scored 91/100, based on 24 reviews, while season three holds a score of 88/100, based on 22 reviews. The first two seasons hold a 100% rating at critical aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, and season three has a 97% approval rating. The first episode rated highly on the Appreciation Index. "The Observer" said the show was "a cross between "Withnail and I" and "The Bourne Ultimatum", there is also a hint of "Doctor Who" about the drama; hardly surprising, since it has been written and created by "Doctor Who" writers Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat." "The Guardian"s Dan Martin said, "It's early days, but the first of three 90-minute movies, 'A Study In Pink', is brilliantly promising. It has the finesse of "Spooks" but is indisputably Sherlock Holmes. The deduction sequences are ingenious, and the plot is classic Moffat intricacy." Tom Sutcliffe for "The Independent" wrote, ""Sherlock" is a triumph, witty and knowing, without ever undercutting the flair and dazzle of the original. It understands that Holmes isn't really about plot but about charisma ... Flagrantly unfaithful to the original in some respects, "Sherlock" is wonderfully loyal to it in every way that matters." The lead actors were commended. Critic Victoria Thorpe said, "Freeman's dependable, capable Watson unlocks this modern Holmes, a man who now describes himself as 'a high-functioning sociopath'." Following the second series' opening episode, Sarah Crompton, for "The Telegraph", asserts that "Cumberbatch is utterly credible as a man who lives entirely in his cerebellum with little regard for the world outside, mak "Sherlock" the perfect depiction of Holmes for our times".
Conan Doyle fans were generally appreciative. Gwilym Mumford, for "The Guardian", suggested that "this has to do with the fact that Moffat and Gatiss are enormously knowledgeable about Conan Doyle's work, and their reimagining incorporates big- and small-screen adaptations of Holmes as well as the original stories. As Gatiss puts it: 'Everything is canonical.' " Sarah Crompton, for "The Telegraph", identifies some of the jokes and allusions intended for fans. Commenting specifically on the second series' finale "The Reichenbach Fall", "The Guardian"s Sam Wollaston praised the show's faithfulness to Conan Doyle, but also how "it will wander, taking in mobile phone technology and computer hacking ... But it doesn't feel like cheating; more like an open relationship, agreed by both parties."
Ratings.
According to overnight data provided by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB), the highest overnight figure from the first series of "Sherlock" was 7.5 million for the opening episode, "A Study in Pink", whereas the second series averaged over 8 million viewers. The three episodes of series two were the three most watched programmes on iPlayer, the BBC's video-on-demand service, between January and April 2012. Its opening episode, "A Scandal in Belgravia", attracted controversy from the tabloid newspaper "Daily Mail", which reported that Irene Adler's nude scene early in the episode had been met with disapproval from some viewers who were concerned that it had been shown before the 9:00 pm watershed hour, before which adult-orientated content is not supposed to air. Some critics also took exception to Moffat's treatment of Irene Adler, arguing that she was sexualised, an argument rejected by others, including Moffat. The series' conclusion, "The Reichenbach Fall", in which Sherlock fakes his suicide by jumping from St Bartholomew's Hospital, led to speculation on forums, social networking sites and in newspaper articles about its resolution.
The third series has become the UK's most watched drama series since 2001.
Accolades.
The series has been awarded and nominated for numerous awards. The series won the BAFTA award for Best Drama Series, while Freeman won the award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Dr Watson alongside Andrew Scott, who portrayed the role of Jim Moriarty and was awarded the following year, and Cumberbatch was nominated for Best Actor. The show was also nominated for the YouTube Audience Award. Andrew Scott won Best Supporting Actor for his work in the second series, which was nominated in other categories. The first series also won the Arqiva award for the "best terrestrial show" at the 2011 Edinburgh International Television Festival. "A Study in Pink" and "A Scandal in Belgravia" were nominated for Emmy Awards in a variety of categories. The series won several BAFTA Cymru awards: television drama, Director: Fiction (Euros Lyn), Director of Photography: Fiction (Steve Lawes), Production Design (Arwel Wyn Jones), and Make Up & Hair (Claire Pritchard-Jones). Charlie Phillips won the 'Editing: Fiction' category at the British Academy Television Craft Awards.
The show's popularity resulted in enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. "The Independent" reported, "designer Paul Costelloe moved to meet the demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, "ou can see why men wanted to get the look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means your standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers... and decided it must have something to do with the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip. Surely not even the great detective himself could have deduced that was going to happen." Publishers and retailers reported a 180% rise in sales of Sherlock Holmes books during the first series' broadcast. Speedy's, the sandwich shop below the flat used as Holmes' residence, reported a sharp rise in new customers who recognised it from the show. BBC Online published several tie-in websites relating to the show's fictional world. These were written by Joseph Lidster, who had also contributed to the "Doctor Who" tie-in websites.
Home release and merchandise.
The first series was released on disc by 2entertain in the United Kingdom on 30 August 2010, in Australia on 4 November, and the United States on 9 November 2010. The first and second series are also available on Netflix. The release included the three episodes and several special features. "A Study in Pink" featured audio commentaries by Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss and Sue Vertue, while Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman and Mark Gatiss comment on "The Great Game". The release included the pilot episode, a 60-minute version of "A Study in Pink" directed by Coky Giedroyc. Critic Mark Lawson called the decision to include the pilot "commendable and brave". The British Board of Film Classification rated the pilot and the three episodes as a 12 certificate for video and online exhibition. The release also contained a 32-minute documentary about the production called "Unlocking Sherlock". Please note that "Unlocking Sherlock" is also the name of a different, but related, documentary (2014, 56-minute) which premiered on PBS-TV on 12 January 2014 as a prelude to the third series episodes.
The second series disc was released in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2012. The second series is also available on Netflix. The release included an audio commentary for "A Scandal in Belgravia" and "The Hounds of Baskerville" and a documentary called "Sherlock Uncovered". The soundtrack album for the first series was released by Silva Screen on 30 January 2012, and for the second series on 27 February 2012.
BBC Books published some of Conan Doyle's original collections and novels as tie-in editions, with cover art featuring Cumberbatch and Freeman. "A Study in Scarlet" and "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" were released in Autumn 2011, with introductions by Moffat and Gatiss respectively. "The Hound of the Baskervilles", "The Sign of Four" and "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes" were released in March 2012, with introductions by Cumberbatch, Freeman and Thompson respectively. Two more books, "The Return of Sherlock Holmes" and "His Last Bow", were released in December 2013, ahead of the premiere of the third series. They featured introductions by Gatiss and Moffat respectively. According to "Radio Times", the popularity of "Sherlock" has led to a resurgence in the sales of the original Conan Doyle stories.
"Sherlock: The Casebook", an official companion book to the series written by Guy Adams, was published by BBC Books in the United Kingdom in October 2012. The book was republished in the United States under the title "The Sherlock Files: The Official Companion to the Hit Television Series" in July 2013.
In Japan, a manga adaptation of the series illustrated by Jay has begun serialization in Kadokawa's "Young Ace" magazine from 4 October 2012. In October 2012, Winning Moves sold a Sherlock-themed edition of Cluedo.
In Greece, OTE TV has bought the rights of the series and it will premiere on OTE Cinema 1 on 24 June 2013.
Tie-in media.
Sherlock Holmes's homepage, "The Science of Deduction", as well as "John Watson's blog" are available online for the public as tie-in media. They feature the events from the show in the form of puzzles and case-summaries, often with comments (e.g. by John Watson's sister, "Harry"). Also, there are several blogs about 'unseen' cases that do not feature on television. Similar to the broadcast cases, these also retain familiar elements from classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories: 'The Geek Interpreter' instead of The Greek Interpreter and 'The Six Thatchers' instead of The Six Napoleons. On the websites links can be found to Molly Hooper's diary and the official website of Connie Prince.
In January 2014, the show launched its official mobile app called "Sherlock: The Network" which was created by The Project Factory in association with Hartswood Films.
Relationship to CBS's "Elementary".
"Elementary", another contemporary reworking of the Sherlock Holmes story, began screening on US network CBS just over two years after "Sherlock" premiered in the UK. In January 2012 "Sherlock" producer Sue Vertue told newspaper "The Independent" "we understand that CBS are doing their own version of an updated Sherlock Holmes. It's interesting, as they approached us a while back about remaking our show. At the time, they made great assurances about their integrity, so we have to assume that their modernised Sherlock Holmes doesn't resemble ours in any way, as that would be extremely worrying." The following month Vertue said that "We have been in touch with CBS and informed them that we will be looking at their finished pilot very closely for any infringement of our rights."
CBS made a statement on the issue: "Our project is a contemporary take on Sherlock Holmes that will be based on Holmes, Watson and other characters in the public domain, as well as original characters. We are, of course, respectful of all copyright laws and will not infringe on any stories or works that may still be protected."
Creator Robert Doherty discussed comparisons between "Sherlock" and "Elementary" that July, pointing out that a tradition of updated Holmes stories dates back to the Basil Rathbone films of the 1940s, and that he didn't think it was the case that "Elementary" took anything from "Sherlock", which he described as a "brilliant show" having watched its first series. Several months later, Lucy Liu confirmed the producers were shown the pilot, "saw how different it was from theirs," and were "okay with it now."

Katrina Mumaw

Captain Katrina Mumaw, from Lancaster, California, is a United States Air Force Academy graduate and accomplished pilot who holds several records in aviation. On July 12, 1994, at the age of eleven, Mumaw became the youngest person to pilot a Russian MIG-29 fighter jet and also the youngest to break the sound barrier. Because of this media dubbed her "the world's fastest kid" during her youth.
Early life and education.
She became interested in becoming a pilot when she met Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan at the age of three after one of their last test flights of the Rutan Voyager, the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. Her first flight as a passenger occurred when she was 5 and when she became aware of the Air Force Academy, she was determined to study there and although her admittance was delayed by a dental malocclusion she was eventually accepted. She graduated from the academy on May 31, 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in behavioral science/human factors engineering.
Career and records.
Mumaw first started piloting by competing in mock aerial combat at the age of eight and she held the record for the most victories in mock dogfights. She was also the youngest person to pilot a BD-10 (a prototype of the aircraft seen in the James Bond movie "Octopussy") in 1993.
On July 12, 1994, at the age of 11, Mumaw became the youngest person to fly a Mig-29 jet fighter and break the sound barrier with it. She first flew an Aero L-39 Albatros together with her instructor Vladimir Danilenko to prove she'd be able to handle the MIG safely. She satisfied the instructor and subsequently flew the MIG-29UB two-seat trainer to a speed of Mach 1.3 (940 mph). After that, she celebrated by performing a series of military-style maneuvers and aerobatics. However this MIG training wasn't enough to prepare her for joint specialized undergraduate pilot training with the USAF. She washed out in under 3 weeks. 
Because of her records, Mumaw has appeared in print publications and television programs including "Sports Illustrated" and "Ripley's Believe it or Not!".
She is also a co-author of a paper on human performance titled: "PC-based Desktop Display versus Immersive Head-mounted Display Flight Simulator Performance".

Spodnje Pirniče

Spodnje Pirniče is a village on the left bank of the Sava River in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
Spodnje Pirniče (literally, 'Lower Pirniče') and neighboring Zgornje Pirniče (literally, 'Upper Pirniče') were attested in written sources in 1392 as "Pernekk" (and as "Pernek" in 1394 and "utrumque Bernh" in an 18th-century copy of a document from 1118). The original form of the name may be reconstructed as the plural demonym "*Pyrьničane", ultimately derived from the common noun "*pyro" 'spelt', referring to a local cultivar and meaning 'people living where spelt is grown'. Another possibility is that the name developed from a plural demonym derived from the Old High German name "Ber(i)nhard" or the Middle High German name "Pern(a)hart".
Church.
The local church is dedicated to the Feast of the Holy Cross.

Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione

Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione (1677) or On The Improvement Of The Understanding, is a seventeenth-century unfinished work of philosophy by the 17th century philosopher Baruch Spinoza.
The "Tractatus" was first published in 1677, the year of Spinoza's death, by some of his closest friends, along with other works including the "Ethica" and the "Tractatus Politicus". The "Tractatus" is an attempt to formulate a philosophical method that would allow the mind to form the clear and distinct ideas that are necessary for its perfection. It contains, in addition, reflection upon the various kinds of knowledge, an extended treatment of definition, and a lengthy analysis of the nature and causes of doubt. The characteristic of the work is the discussion of different form of perception at Chapter IV and illustration of the best one in relation with the experience and intelligence at the next Chapter. He also addresses the issues of memory and forgetting.
Theory of knowledge.
Spinoza commenced this treatise with the intention of digging deep into the problem of Knowledge, but the work was never completed. In his other works epistemological discussions are intimately linked with the rest of his philosophy. Indeed, even in the "Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding" epistemological views are almost inseparably connected with ethical and religious ones. That is the consequence of his characteristic conception of "Knowledge". For Spinoza "Knowledge" is "life", not in the sense that contemplation is the highest life, but in the sense that knowledge is the means of holding together the threads of life in a systematic unity that can fill its proper place in the cosmic system. In this sense the effort after the highest knowledge becomes part of the cosmic activities by which cosmic unity is maintained, and so part of the very life of God.
There are two things which must be borne in mind in connection with Spinoza's conception of knowledge. The first is his insistence on the "active" character of knowledge. The ideas or concepts by means of which thought construes reality are not like "lifeless pictures on a panel"; they are activities by which reality is apprehended; they are part of reality, and reality is activity. The second point is that Spinoza does not divorce knowing from willing. Man always acts according to his lights. If a man's endeavours appear to fall short of his knowledge, that is only because his knowledge is not really what it is held to be, but is wanting in some respect. On the one hand, reason, for Spinoza, is essentially the "practical reason". On the other hand, the highest expression of willing is experienced in that striving for consistency and harmony which is so characteristic of reason. For Spinoza, then, as for Francis Bacon and all the Renaissance thinkers, "Knowledge is power", but in a much deeper sense than Bacon intended.
Opinion, reason, intuition.
Spinoza's account of knowledge is particularly interesting as a clue to the way in which he gradually built up his ontology. He distinguishes three ascending grades of knowledge, namely, opinion, reason and intuition. By "opinion" Spinoza means the lowest grade of knowledge in which one assents to what one hears, perceives or imagines. It is the pre-scientific stage of knowledge. Its main characteristic is that objects and events are apprehended as detached things, without any insight into their connection or laws. The second grade, or "reason", is that in which we have an insight into the connections of things and events, and their laws; it is the stage of scientific knowledge. This grade of knowledge is greatly superior to the first, inasmuch as a knowledge of their connections and laws makes things more intelligible. But even this stage is imperfect because rather abstract. It reveals the course of single threads in the fabric of reality, not the whole pattern; it traces "world-lines", but affords no synoptic vision of the cosmos as a whole. It is the function of the third grade of knowledge, "intuition", to complete the scheme. In intuitive knowledge the cosmic system is grasped as a whole. This highest stage is only possible for a mind that has been through the discipline of the rational stage. Unlike the mystics, Spinoza
does not regard intuitive vision as a substitute for thought and entirely different from it, but rather as its highest fruit — it is "thoughtfulness matured to inspiration". The three stages in the acquisition of the knowledge might be roughly compared with the three stages in the acquisition of the knowledge of a new language. First come the separate letters of the alphabet; then combinations of letters into words and of words into sentences, etc., in accordance with the laws of grammar; lastly comes the stage when the significance of a whole sentence or paragraph is grasped at a glance. So it is with the great book of Nature. First comes the perception of apparently isolated facts and events; next comes the understanding of their interconnections and laws; finally comes the intuition of the structure and significance of the whole — the vision which sees all things in God, and God in all things.
Interconnected reality.
Spinoza's theory of knowledge appears to make the ontological assumption that reality is an interconnected system. Spinoza himself regarded it as an ultimate intuition. And his theory of knowledge was in some ways a justification of that view. To realise this it is necessary to grasp the fundamental distinction which Spinoza draws between "opinion" and "reason", or perception and understanding. A percept or an image is, for Spinoza, something entirely different from and idea or concept. Conception or understanding is an activity which grasps interconnections, and has nothing to do with images as such. Perception and imagination, on the other hand, are concerned with images and not with connections. And the laws of these two kinds of activities are as different as are their objects. Perception, or imagination, is concerned with images and follows the laws of association; conception or understanding is concerned with connections and follows the laws of logic. Hence Spinoza's insistence that "we can not "imagine" God, but we can "conceive" Him". Hence also Spinoza's rejection of Baconian empiricism. From observations of particulars as such it would be impossible, according to Spinoza, to derive laws or necessary connections. The laws or general truths of science rest, in the last resort, not on their correspondence with objects of perception, but on their harmonious interconnection in a system of truths. Spinoza, accordingly, dispenses with an external criterion of truth. "The true," he maintains, "reveals itself and the false." The ultimate test of truth is more truth or more knowledge, or the coherence of all that is known. The false or untrue betrays itself by its incoherence with what is already known. In fact, Spinoza for the most part regards ideas or concepts from the point of view of their "adequacy" rather than their "truth", in order to avoid the suggestion of a merely external correspondence such as is usually associated with the term "truth". Concepts (or "ideas" in this sense) are acts of thought by which the laws and interconnections of things and events are apprehended. They are "adequate" in so far as they really enable us to systematise a certain range of facts. In that case they are also true, for they agree with the facts. The primacy, however, is with the "adequacy" of the concept, because until we have the adequate concept we cannot apprehend the facts in such a way that is said to be in agreement with them, or to be "true".
Coherence theory of truth.
In the history of philosophy Spinoza was the first to elaborate the coherence theory of truth. In his time mathematics was the only science that could serve as a model of such a coherent system. Hence his addiction to the method of geometry. The significance of his use of this method has been misinterpreted. His sole aim was to express his philosophy in as coherent and objective manner as possible. Two points should be noted in particular. In the first place, Spinoza did not suppose that science or philosophy can dispense with observation or experience. He fully realised the importance of experience in the very setting of the problems which science and philosophy seek to solve; and it is known from his letters that he carried out many chemical and physical experiments. All that he insisted upon was that science involves much more than mere observation, that it needs concepts not derived from experience. It was his intention to write about scientific method, and to show that Bacon's ideas about it were inadequate; but this was one of several plans which he did not live long enough to carry out. The second point is that Spinoza had no delusions about the conclusiveness of the geometrical method. He himself had expounded the philosophy of Descartes in that method, although he thoroughly disagreed with it. Above all it is important to note that, for Spinoza, the highest knowledge ("intuitive" or "clear" knowledge) is something much fuller and richer than the abstract assertions usually associated with the term knowledge. In another work he describes it as
"...feeling and enjoying the thing itself."

Soft Aid

Soft Aid was a Charity Computer Game Software edition,
released by Quicksilva in late 1985 to support the Famine Relief in Ethiopia. The software was released on tape for the ZX Spectrum computer and the Commodore 64.
On one side of the tape, as well as games, the charity single, Do They Know It's Christmas? by Band Aid was also available if the tape was played (at this point) on an audio tape recorder.
The tape was unusual in that it was released to help support a charity (possibly unique in computer gaming at the time). To help bring home this point, the cover featured an artwork by British artist David Rowe, showing a desert landscape, a bright blue sky (upon which the "Soft Aid" title was written in yellow scrawl, and a sub-title of "Feed the world" written in red), a tree (backed by distant mountains) and a person of indeterminate gender, clearly representing the starving people of Ethiopia, sitting on the desert, with their head on one hand. It also listed the games found on the tape for both games systems.
The tape sold in the United Kingdom for £4.99

Todd Carmichael

Todd Carmichael (born 1963) was the first American explorer to cross Antarctica to the South Pole alone, on foot and with no assistance. He arrived at the pole on December 21, 2008, after a total travel time of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes.
Carmichael set the record for the fastest solo journey to the South Pole, surpassing the record set by Hannah McKeand in 2006. He averaged 18 miles per day on skis (8 miles) and foot (692 miles). Born in Spokane, Washington August 30, 1963, Carmichael claims to have crossed the majority of all world's deserts in solo. Contributor to the "Huffington Post", Carmichael is a passionate crusader for social and ecological causes and has a decade-long history of undertaking self-supported treks into challenging environments. His expeditions have taken him to locations are varied as Namibia to Zambia, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In keeping with his unwavering ethic of low-carbon, self-sufficient travel, Carmichael only brings what he can carry on his back, or, in the case of Antarctica, pull behind him on a sled.
Carmichael kept a video log of his progress across Antarctica, and the footage has since been made into a documentary, "Race to the Bottom of the Earth" (2010), as seen on the National Geographic Channel.

1945 Mikawa earthquake

The was an earthquake which occurred off Aichi prefectures, Japan at 03:38 AM on January 13, 1945. As the earthquake occurred during World War II, information about the disaster was censored, and efforts at keeping the disaster secret hampered relief efforts and contributed to a high death toll.
Earthquake.
The Mikawa earthquake had its epicenter offshore in Mikawa Bay at a depth of eleven kilometers). The city of Tsu recorded a magnitude of 6 on the Richter Scale; however areas in southern Aichi prefecture were closer to the epicenter, and suffered significant damage.
The earthquake created the Fukozu Fault, named after the village lying in the middle of the fault-line, in area adjoining the west of the Tōkaidō Main Line railway between Okazaki and Gamagōri, Aichi Prefecture. The fault has a total visible distance of little more than 9km, but is of great interest to geologists as it has a right angle bend in its middle portion, rather than being straight or at a gentle curve. It is also remarkable in that ground displacement at the fault is up to one meter in places; however, the Tokaido Railway Line although located only 150 meters distant from the fault line in places, suffered no damage.
Damage.
Hardest hit were what is now Hazu District. Nishio city, Kira town, Anjō city, Hekinan city and Gamagōri city. The earthquake had a confirmed death toll of 1180, with an additional 1126 missing and 3866 injured. A total of 7221 houses were totally destroyed, and 16,555 severely damaged. However, as the earthquake occurred in the middle of the night, and also towards the end of the war when fuel supplies were very low, only two houses burned down.
Previous events.
Similar large earthquakes have occurred in the same location in 1685 and 1686, and the large 1944 Tōnankai earthquake was also in the same area.

Sir George Clark, 1st Baronet

Sir George Smith Clark, 1st Baronet DL (8 November 1861 – 23 March 1935) was a businessman and politician in Northern Ireland. George S. Clark was born in Paisley, Scotland the second son of thread manufacturer James Clark, and Jane Smith; both his parents were Scottish Presbyterians.
Early life.
Clark was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh. He was apprenticed to Harland and Wolff in Belfast and, in 1877, opened his own shipyard on the river Lagan with Frank Workman. Clark's mother's brother, George Smith, was able to provide capital for this initial venture. In 1891 the firm became Workman, Clark & Co. Ltd. Charles Allan (a cousin of Clark's and a member of the Allan Line family also joined the firm). By 1902 the shipyard was .
Workman Clark & Co: Rise and fall.
During the war the shipyard concentrated on Admiralty work and it was for this that, in 1917, Clark received the Baronetcy of Dunlambert; his firm now employed 10,000. In 1920 the firm was taken over by the Northumberland Shipping Company the company's fortunes, however, did not remain. A debenture loan for £3 million was floated, professedly to advance the enterprises of Workman Clark in Belfast. Instead the proceeds were used partly to compensate the former shareholders of Workman Clark, and partly to purchase the shares of other companies which the Northumberland Shipping Company had acquired.
By 1927 the company was all but bankrupt. As a result the directors of the company, including Sir George were sued on the grounds that their 1920 prospectus was fraudulent. At the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal the directors lost their case; the case reached the House of Lords as "Clark & Ors. v Urquhart v. Urquhart AC 28" The firm finally closed in 1935.
Personal life.
In 1881 Clark married Frances Matier, and became a director of her family's linen firm; Henry Matier & Co. The couple had two sons. In a 1907 by-election he became Member of Parliament for North Belfast, retiring in 1910 to devote more attention to his business affairs. In 1913 the Workman Clark shipyard had assisted the UVF gun running. In 1925 Clark became a Unionist Senator in the Northern Ireland parliament. He remained in this position until his death at his home, Dunlambert, Fortwilliam Park, Belfast, on 23 March 1935. He also served as a Deputy Lieutenant and director of the Bank of Ireland.
He was buried on 26 March in Belfast City Cemetery. The virtues of company law are such that despite the ruin of Workman, Clark & Co. Ltd. Sir George died a millionaire.
Upon his death his son, Sir George Clark, 2nd Baronet, succeeded to the baronetcy; he was a Cambridge-educated naval architect and soldier (d. 1950).

Mary Ann Black

Mary Ann de Mestre née Black (1801–1861) was the wife of Prosper de Mestre (1789–1844) a prominent Sydney businessman in the early 19th century; and the mother of Etienne Livingstone de Mestre (1832–1916) the trainer of the racehorse Archer who won the first and second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862, and the foremost Australian horse trainer of his era. It was on her property of "Terara" on the Shoalhaven River near Nowra on the South Coast of New South Wales that Etienne established a horse stud, stable and racecourse.
Mary Ann’s other descendants include: Sarah Melanie de Mestre (1877–1961) who distinguished herself as a nurse in France and Flanders in World War I, and whose decorations included the Royal Red Cross which was presented to her at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 3 June 1918 (the King's birthday); Roy de Maistre (1894–1968), a successful Australian artist; Guboo Ted Thomas (1909–2002) a prominent Aboriginal leader, and the last initiated tribal elder on the South Coast of New South Wales; Margaret Augusta de Mestre (1915–1942), a nurse who was killed in action on a hospital ship on 26 February 1942 in the bombing of Darwin during World War II; Neville de Mestre (c.1938- ), an eminent Australian mathematician and author, Emeritus Professor of Maths at Bond University, and who has held the titles of World Iron Man champion in the 60-64 age group, and Australian and World Masters surfing champion in the over-65 group for body surfing; and Lloyd Nolan Hornsby (1947- ), a prominent Aboriginal artist.
Background.
Mary Ann was born in Sydney on 1 October 1801. Her mother was the former convict Mary Hyde (1779–1864) who in 1855 took the Commissioners of City of Sydney to the House of Lords and won. Her father was Captain John Black (1788–1802), a ship's officer and a privateer (state-sanctioned pirate). Mary Ann was their second child, and only daughter. Her father died in 1802 when his ship the "Fly" was lost at sea with all hands. After this Mary Ann's mother moved in with (and later married) a business associate of Mary Ann's late father Simeon Lord (1771–1840) a pioneer merchant and a magistrate in Australia, who became Mary Ann's stepfather.
Mary Ann received her education in England. In 1807 six year old Mary Ann was taken to England by Simeon Lord's adopted daughter Joanna and her husband Francis Williams, to be placed into the care of her grandfather Reverend John Black. She first left on board her stepfather's ship the "Commerce" in February 1807 as a 5 year old, but the ship returned to Sydney in April 1807 after picking up shipwrecked men, and sustaining damage in a storm. In July 1807 Mary Ann was baptised at St Philip's Church in Sydney. Then in November 1807 she again began the voyage for England aboard her stepfather's ship the "Sydney Cove". She was not returned to Australia until 1814 after her grandfather's death.
Her stepfather Simeon Lord held land in trust for Mary Ann and her brother, land that backed onto the Tank Stream and had originally been leased by their late father Captain John Black, where Mary Ann and her brother had been born, and where her mother had been living prior to her relationship with Simeon Lord. On her marriage Mary Ann receiving her portion of the land in George St., Sydney as a dower.
Mary Ann married at the age of 19 on 1 March 1821 at St Philip's Church in Sydney to Prosper de Mestre who was 12 years her senior, and a business associate of her stepfather Simeon Lord. Prosper, a merchant like her stepfather, was a good catch, and the large family was well and luxuriously provided for, becoming an important part of the fabric of Sydney in the 1820s to the 1840s. Her husband eventually owned properties in Sydney, and elsewhere in New South Wales, including at Shoalhaven on the South Coast. Mary Ann was also a good catch for de Mestre, with her stepfather Simeon Lord's connections being invaluable to de Mestre's business dealings.
When her husband Prosper de Mestre became insolvent in 1844, and most of his land and property needed to be auctioned to pay his debts, Mary Ann moved to prevent the Shoalhaven properties being sold. As the George St. property had been her dower, she questioned whether it should be included in the sale. Her solution was that the more valuable George St. property could be included in the sale, if the Shoalhaven properties were not. In exchange she also asked for "the whole of the plate, horses etc., etc., on the establishment in Liverpool Street, the six cows, horse and cart at Helsarmel", and to be "permitted to occupy the thirty-two acres at Petersham until the house at Shoal Haven can be rendered fit for the residence of my family." The family house in Liverpool St, and its "elegant Household Furniture", was sold by auction on 16 May 1844, and the family was moved to briefly to Petersham and then onto Terara, which Mary Ann’s husband Prosper had initially developed as a hobby farm.
Over a period of twenty years Mary Ann gave birth to 10 children, in the day when home births were the norm. When her husband Prosper de Mestre died in 1844 she was left with a large family to raise that included adult children and teenagers, but also included young children, with four children under the age of 10, and her youngest child being was less than 3 years old.
To raise her family Mary Ann continued to work the Shoalhaven property of Terara with the aid of her three sons. Mary Ann, together with her three sons, Prosper John (1821–1863), Andre (1823–1917) and Etienne (1832–1916) de Mestre, was also instrumental in furthering the development of the village of Terara near her "Terara" property after her husband's death in 1844. They added three wharves in 1854, in 1856 a Church of England on land she donated and with capital she largely provided, and established a steam-driven flour mill in 1856. The steam flourmill was managed by the eldest son, Prosper John de Mestre who lived at Millbank. Andre and Etienne de Mestre lived at Terara House. By 1866 the village of Terara was a bigger and more important centre than Nowra. When the Shoalhaven River flooded in 1870 settlement began to shift from Terara to the Nowra site 3 km west.
Mary Ann Black was a widow for 16 years before her death on 11 July 1861. She left a will that divided her property amongst her children. Millbank was left to Prosper John de Mestre, along with the steam mill and premises which he was occupying at the time. The Terara House and property was left to Andre and Etienne de Mestre, and the 7 girls each received a portion of land. Mary Ann was buried on the Terara property next to her husband Prosper de Mestre on land that she had donated to the church. Against her stated wishes, the land has been sold by the church, and the exact location of the graves is now lost.

Frank Linke-Crawford

Oberleutnant Frank Linke-Crawford (18 August 1893 – 30 July 1918), was the fourth-ranking ace of the Austro-Hungarian empire during World War I, with 27 victories.
Early life.
Frank Linke-Crawford was born in Krakau (Cracow), in what is presently Poland. His father, Major Adalbert Linke, was a Galician soldier; his mother, Lucy Crawford, was British. Despite this mixed background, he was a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
He entered the Wiener-Neustadt military academy in 1910. Upon graduation, he was commissioned Leutnant and assigned to the 6th Dragoon Regiment. On July 28, a month after the assassination of Austria-Hungary's Archduke Franz Ferdinand, his country declared war on Serbia. This was the initial declaration of war that snowballed into World War I.
Linke-Crawford first saw battle on the Russian Front. In November, 1914, he was appointed commander of the infantry troop of the Sixth Dragoons. Between October 1914 and October 1915, he received several decorations; he also was hospitalized several times with malaria and dysentery.
In 1915, Linke-Crawford's fascination with the Luftfahrtruppen (Austro-Hungarian air service) led him to request a transfer for pilot training. His poor health is also mentioned as a reason for his transfer.
Aerial service.
Upon his completion of observer training at Wiener-Neustadt in March 1916, Linke-Crawford was posted to Fliegerkompanie 22 to fly reconnaissance and bombing missions in two seater airplanes.
In September, 1916, after six active months flying as an observer, he retrained as a pilot.
In January, 1917, he was transferred to Fliegerkompanie 12 as chief pilot, which made him second in command of the unit. His new posting was still to a unit serving on the Isonzo Front in northern Italy. While his duties remained recon and bombing, he was now operating over mountainous terrain. He also flew some attack sorties in single seat fighters. On one of these missions, on 13 April, he shot down a Nieuport that cartwheeled into a crash far behind the Italian lines. He did not bother to attempt to claim this victory, though he mentioned it in a letter home to his sister. On 25 May, his aircraft was badly shot up, taking 14 hits from a couple of Spad fighters. He then had another unconfirmed triumph on 25 June.
He gained a reputation for courage. On one of his long range reconnaissance missions, he was attacked by an Italian Spad, which riddled his Hansa-Brandenburg C.I with 68 bullet holes over a half hour period. Nevertheless, he completed his mission.
On 2 August 1917, while flying his Aviatik C.I with no rear gunner aboard to man the craft's single machine gun, he was shot down but uninjured as Pier Piccio's eighth victim.
On 4 August 1917, he was transferred to Fliegerkompanie 41, situated near Trieste. Flik 41 was Austro-Hungary's most renowned air unit; it was commanded by the empire's top ace, Godwin Brumowski. Linke-Crawford damaged his airplane upon landing at his new base, Sesana Airfield.
He began wearing a scarlet flying helmet and white trousers when he flew, leading to the nickname of "Redhead". He marked his plane with falcons painted on either side.
He scored his first confirmed aerial victory on 21 August 1917, using a Hansa-Brandenburg D.I to down a Nieuport. In the next five days, he scored three more confirmed wins using this plane, with one claim going unconfirmed.
The Hansa-Brandenburg D.I had serious liabilities as a fighter plane; it spun easily, had poor forward visibility, and its machine gun was mounted well above the pilot's head on the top wing to fire above the propeller arc. It was nicknamed "the flying coffin" and killed more pilots in flying accidents than died in combat.
Linke-Crawford's switch to flying an Albatros D.III mounted him in a fighter that not only offered him better field of vision, especially downward, but also armed him with twin Spandau machine guns in front of him that were synchronized to fire through his propeller.
Flying the Albatros D.III, he shot down a seaplane on 23 September 1917 to become an ace. Continuing to use the Albatros, he ran up a score of 13 by 13 December.
In late December, 1917, Linke-Crawford was appointed commander of Fliegerkompanie 60. This unit was stationed at Grigno in northern Italy until March, 1918. This airfield was located in a swampy mountainous basin and was prone to flooding. Flik 60j's seven pilots flew against an opposition of British, Italian, and French pilots.
Linke-Crawford's plane in Flik 60j was a Phonix D.I. He used this slow but sturdy twin-gunned fighter to run up seven triumphs in the first three months of 1918. Flik 60 transferred to Feltre, also in northern Italy. This was a better airfield than Grigno.
Linke-Crawford scored his last victory in the Phonix on 11 March. In mid-March, he grounded all the Phonix's in his unit because of their unreliability.
Beginning on 10 May, Linke-Crawford switched to an Aviatik D.I. (115.32) At least five of these seven wins were over superior aircraft, such as the Sopwith Camel and Bristol F.2 Fighters.
Death and legacy.
On July 30 1918, the day after his final victory, he was flying an early model Aviatik (Berg) D.I in a formation of four. He was shot down in flames by a pair of Italian Hanriot HD.1 fighters, with his plane disintegrating before impact.
Linke-Crawford had separated from his wingmen before engaging the Italians. His plane had spun out before engaging them; he had then recovered and been fired upon. His plane had then fallen apart in midair. Linke-Crawford was accredited as Caporale Aldo Astolfi's sole success as a fighter pilot. Given that the Aviatik was the first fighter manufactured entirely in Austria, and that it initially had a reputation for wing failures during violent aerial maneuvers, there was suspicion that Linke-Crawford had fallen afoul of a faulty airplane rather than an Italian pilot. While the original Aviatik D-I design by Julius von Berg was sound, the Series 115 aircraft license-produced by the Lohner firm at Wien-Floridsdorf were notorious for failures along the wing trailing edges in high speed maneuvers, as Lohner had deviated from Aviatik specifications by employing thinner, lighter wing ribs. At the time of his death, Linke-Crawford was flying one of these defective machines, build number 115.32.
His legacy was best described by one of his peers, Julius Arigi, who was the second ranked Austro-Hungarian ace:
"Linke was both a fine flier and a fine man. He gave his men full support and generally ignored the rules about officers and non-officers having little to do with each other. He often gave away victories to other, less experienced pilots. As you can imagine, the feelings of his men for him were quite strong."
Although Frank Linke-Crawford was originally buried at Pobrežje Cemetery in Maribor, now Slovenia, after the war, in 1919, he was reinterred in Salzburg.

He lived at Bible Hill; Archibald is believed to have given the town its name. Bible Hill continues to celebrate a festival in Archibald's honor yearly to commemorate his birthday. He is the great-great paternal grandfather of the singing sensation Adam Levine. He died in Truro.
His son Alexander Lackie Archibald also represented Truro in the assembly.

Naghnaghiya (, "Al-Naghnaghiyya") was a Palestinian Arab village, southeast of Haifa. It was depopulated before the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
Location.
The village was on the north edge of a hill at the edge of a wadi bed, overlooking the Jezreel Valley and the Nazareth hills to the north and northeast. It was the smallest of a group of three villages (known collectively as al-Ghubayyat) located together; the others were Al-Ghubayya al-Fawqa and Al-Ghubayya al-Tahta.

Topol pri Medvodah

Topol pri Medvodah is a small settlement in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It lies in the hills northwest of the Slovene capital Ljubljana and is a popular destination for short trips with locals.
Name.
The name of the settlement was changed from "(Sveta) Katarina nad Medvodami" (literally, 'Saint Catherine above Medvode') to "Topol" (literally, 'poplar') in 1955. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. However, its old name is still often used in the modified form "Katarina nad Ljubljano" (literally, '(Saint) Catherine above Ljubljana').
Church.
The local church is dedicated to Saint Catherine. It is an early Baroque church dating from the beginning of the 17th century. The chancel was painted by Ivan and Helena Vurnik in 1919 and 1920, and the main altar was created by Ivan Vurnik. The painting of Saint Catherine is by Helena Vurnik, and France Kralj created the altar cross. The church is surrounded by a cemetery that features a First World War monument and a cemetery chapel.

The is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train used for commuter services on the Keiyo Line in Japan operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Only one trainset has been built, and it differs significantly from other JR commuter EMUs in having articulated cars with shared bogies and using direct-drive motors. As of October 2012, this train is not in operation.
Formation.
The lone set, AK1, is formed as follows, with car 1 at the Tokyo end.
Interior.
Cars 2 to 13 have longitudinal seating, while the end cars 1 and 14 have transverse seating bays which can be rotated and rearranged longitudinally against the train sides to provide increased standing space during peak hours.
History.
Incorporating new technology tested on the earlier experimental E993 series "AC Train", the E331 series was delivered to JR East in March 2006. Cars 1 to 7 were built by Tokyu Car Corporation in Yokohama, and cars 8 to 14 were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe.
Following extensive test running, the set entered revenue service on the Keiyō Line between Tokyo and from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2007. It was soon removed from service on 26 March for modifications. The set was returned to service on 23 December 2008.
The set was removed from revenue service in May 2009, returning to service on 3 April 2010.
It was subsequently removed from service again, and as of October 2012, is not in use.

Nancy Morris

Nancy Morris (born 2 November 1961) is a Reform rabbi, who was appointed to Glasgow Reform Synagogue, formerly known as Glasgow New Synagogue, in October 2003, making her the first female rabbi in Scotland. She is now Rabbi of South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue in London.
Morris was born in Canada where she studied and qualified in Law before choosing to study for the rabbinate in London, qualifying in 2002.
Career.
Morris gained an MA in Jewish History from McGill University in 1989 before continuing her studies to gain an LLB, also at McGill University, before completing her articles at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto.
In 1997, she decided upon a career change and left Canada to study rabbinics at Leo Baeck College in London, graduating in 2002.
In the final year of rabbinic studies, she returned to Canada where she served as Rabbi at Har Tikvah, in Brampton, Ontario and Temple Shalom, in Kitchener, Ontario/Waterloo, Ontario from 2001 till 2003.
She became the first female Rabbi in Scotland when she was appointed to the post of Rabbi of Glasgow Reform Synagogue in October 2003. During her tenure, Rabbi Morris was also a Guest Lecturer at the University of Glasgow where she lectured on Judaism.
In January 2012, Rabbi Morris returned to her native Canada to take on a temporary post of Rabbi at Temple B'nai Tikvah in Calgary.
In June 2012, South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue (often referred to by the acronym SWESRS) in London announced that Rabbi Morris had been appointed as their new Rabbi. She began this position in September 2012.
Role within Jewish community.
Rabbi Morris strongly supports the egalitarian nature of Progressive Judaism and has spoken a number of times on issues relating to gender equality within Judaism. In particular she was strongly critical of the arrest of Anat Hoffman, head of Women Of The Wall, and publicly wrote to the Israeli Ambassador to the UK on behalf of her Synagogue community about the arrest.
Rabbi Morris also called on the incoming Chief Rabbi to demonstrate his commitment to repairing divisions between different Jewish traditions by publicly criticising the detention of Emily Wolfson for wearing a Tallit at the Kotel. Rabbi Morris conducted the Bat Mitzvah of Ms Wolfson when she was Rabbi at Glasgow Reform Synagogue and encourages girls to embrace Jewish ritual such as wearing a tallit upon their Bat Mitzvah. Consequently, Rabbi Morris felt strongly that the grounds of detention a female wearing a tallit were both unjustified and a dangerous escalation of attempts by Orthodox authorities to exclude women and Progressive Jews from one of the most sacred locations in Judaism.
Rabbi Morris helped conduct the Purim celebrations for a group of Bnei Menashe in 2010 when she was in Mumbai, India on a sabbatical.
Role within Scottish Jewish community.
Rabbi Morris was primarily based in Glasgow at Glasgow Reform Synagogue but also provided support to other Progressive synagogues in Scotland, on an "ad hoc" basis. Whilst not necessarily affiliated with the Reform Movement, these progressive synagogues operate under a liberal interpretation of Judaism whereby a female rabbi is welcomed.
Role as a community leader.
As leader of the second largest stream of Judaism in Scotland, Rabbi Morris participated in interfaith meetings as well as speaking at various events, presenting a modern, liberal, Jewish perspective on a variety of subjects.
On this basis, Rabbi Morris presented the Time For Reflection at the Scottish Parliament on 25 June 2008.
Connections With East End Of London.
Rabbi Morris' paternal grandfather grew up in London's East End in the early 1900s before emigrating to Canada. This family connection partly influenced Rabbi Morris to take up the post at SWESRS as the synagogue has a strong connection with the East End. In an amazing coincidence, when researching her family history, Rabbi Morris discovered she was also related to Second Lieutenant Harry Jassby, a World War I RAF pilot who was killed on 6 November 1918 at an airfield very close to the Oaks Lane location of SWESRS. Despite being Jewish, Second Lieutenant Jassby was buried in the Christian cemetery at St.Peters church which was the closest graveyard to the airfield where he was killed. Members of SWESRS look after the grave and Rabbi Morris conducts an annual Remembrance Service at the graveside.
Broadcasting.
Rabbi Morris was interviewed by Ian Wyatt on his BBC Essex radio programme on which she discussed her career and decision to become a Rabbi. Wyatt also explored her thoughts on the atheist arguments of Richard Dawkins concerning religion. Rabbi Morris explained she feels his arguments focus too much on disputing the literalist interpretation of scriptures as emphasized by religious fundamentalists. Fundamentalism is only espoused by very extremist groups of religious people, and the vast majority of people of faith do not necessarily take such a literalist view of Scripture. Dawkins, in her opinion, fails to address the wider social, emotional, spiritual and cultural benefits for human beings who are devoted to their religious beliefs. Rabbi Morris particularly loves the discussion and lively debate that forms such an important part of Jewish tradition and understanding of Judaism throughout its history.
Rabbi Morris appeared regularly on BBC Radio Scotland's "Thought For The Day" slot where she presented, from a Jewish perspective, brief talks designed to cause listeners to pause for reflection.
Rabbi Morris also contributed to the BBC radio programme on Matisyahu with her predecessor at Glasgow Reform Synagogue, Rabbi Pete Tobias.
Publications.
Rabbi Morris contributed to the book "God, Doubt and Dawkins", a Reform response to Richard Dawkins' book "The God Delusion".
She also publishes selected Torah commentary and articles on her own website.

Musevisa

Musevisa ("The Mouse Song") is a Norwegian Christmas song by singer-songwriter Alf Prøysen from 1946. Prøysen wrote the lyrics for the song in 1946, to a traditional tune. "Musevisa" is a secular song, where a family of anthropomorphic mice are preparing for Christmas. The mouse-mother specifically warns her children against the dangers of the mousetrap. In December 2008 the alleged rediscovery of a missing verse from the song attracted the attention of the Norwegian media. Though an alternative ending was originally written for the song, the discovery in question was eventually revealed to be a hoax.
Creation.
In the late autumn of 1946, Prøysen (1914–1970), who had just left his job as a farm hand, received a commission from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) to write a Christmas song for children. Before presenting the song to the network, he met with his friend Arnljot Høyland near the Oslo railway station Vestbanen, to get his opinion on the song he had written. Prøysen said he was worried about the happy and sympathetic tone of the song, since the subject was mice, considered a pest. For this reason he had written an alternative ending to the lyrics. Høyland told him not to worry, correctly predicting that this would not be an issue. Prøysen presented the song in its original form, it was accepted and became an instant classic. Høyland never heard the alternative ending.
Rediscovery of missing verse.
In December 2008, NRK-presenter Vidar Lønn-Arnesen claimed to have found the missing verse. In Lønn-Arnesen's version, it was children's program host "Onkel" Lauritz Johnson who had objected to the original verse, and asked Prøysen to write a new one. In the original version the mice were eaten by a cat, which Johnson found too disturbing for children's radio. The original verse had been thrown away, but a cleaning maid had picked it up. The woman had kept the piece of paper, but fifty years laternow living in Thailandshe sent it back to NRK. Then, in 2008, Lønn-Arnesen was editing a Christmas songbook, and decided to include the original verse and the story behind it.
The story attracted widespread attention in Norwegian newspapers, but not everybody was ready to accept it. Ove Røsbak, who had written a biography on Prøysen, had interviewed Høyland and others, and debunked Lønn-Arnesen's story as false. The song in its present version was in fact the original, according to Røsbak, and if another version existed this had to be a discarded early draft. Pointing out the poor literary quality as the reason why the extra verse had been abandoned, he still conceded that the verse was written by Prøysen: "There is no doubt about that, but there's a reason why it ended up in the dustbin." Røsbak also took issue with the late Johnson being presented as a prude who censored controversial content. Lønn-Arnesen stuck to his version of the events, but insisted that he had never intended any disrespect to Johnson, who had been his colleague.
Hoax revealed.
On 23 December, former NRK-photographer Ivar Kalleberg revealed that it was in fact he who had written the missing verse, as a hoax. Kalleberg had used an old yellowed piece of paper, and copied Prøysen's handwriting from a letter he had once received from him. He then asked his neighbor if she would compose a letter, posing as the fictional retired cleaning lady. Kalleberg claimed to have used the Hitler Diaries as an inspiration for the hoax. To back up his claim, Kalleberg referred to an autobiography he had written in 2003, where he had reproduced the verse from memory, almost verbatim.
Røsbak appreciated Kalleberg's hoax, though he commented that the episode did raise some issues about source criticism in the Norwegian publishing business. Lønn-Arnesen admitted that, although he didn't believe Kalleberg's story, if he had indeed been the victim of a practical joke, it was a good one. Kalleberg, meanwhile, was convinced that Prøysen would have appreciated the hoax had he been alive. The poet was once, in the 1950s, informed about an impostor who performed under his name. He reacted with a shrug and replied "Perhaps he sings better than I do."
Swedish version.
There is a Swedish version of the song - without the false verse - called "Mössens julafton" ("Christmas Eve for the Mice") written by Prøysen's long time co-operative partner, the popular Swedish composer and songwriter Ulf Peder Olrog. In Sweden, Olrog usually is known as the composer of the song's melody.

<doc id="20817354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20817354" title="Attercopus">
Attercopus

Attercopus fimbriunguis belongs to an extinct order of arachnids named Uraraneida; spider-like animals able to produce silk, but which lacked true spinnerets and retained a segmented abdomen bearing a flagellum-like tail resembling that of a whip scorpion. They are thought to be close to the origins of spiders. 
An important Early Devonian (about ) fossil example from the of Gilboa, New York, was originally described as a member of the extinct order Trigonotarbida and named "Gelasinotarbus? fimbriunguis". It was later assigned to a new genus "Attercopus" and reinterpreted as the oldest, and most primitive, example of a true spider (Araneae). This hypothesis was based on the supposed presence of unique spider features such as silk-producing spinnerets and the opening of a venom gland on the fang of the chelicera. 
Further study – based on new fossils from a comparable Devonian locality called South Mountain – and comparison with other material from the Permian of Russia indicates that "Attercopus" does not actually have spinnerets. The specimen which looked like a tubular spinneret is actually a folded sheet of cuticle. It would, however, have produced silk from a series of silk gland openings, or spigots, located across plates on the underside of the abdomen. The opening for the venom gland is also a misinterpretation. A segmented tail, or flagellum, also belonged to this animal.
It seems unlikely that "Attercopus" spun webs, but it may have used its silk to wrap eggs, lay draglines or construct burrow walls. "Attercopus fimbriunguis" is not a spider, but it is probably close to the type of animals which did give rise to modern spiders today. 
Its name is taken from the English dialect word "attercop" ("spider"), which came from Old English ' ("poison-head"), from ' ("poison"), itself drawn from the Proto-Germanic ' ("poisonous ulcer") and ' ("head").

BBC Persian Television

BBC Persian Television () is the BBC's Persian language news channel that was launched on 14 January 2009. The service can be accessed through satellite television, and is aimed at the 100 million Persian speakers in Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
History.
The annual budget of £15 million is funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but as with the BBC World Service which is also funded by the FCO, the BBC remains editorially independent, though some Iranian media have accused the British Government of using the service as a propaganda tool. The Iranian government issued a statement denouncing the new service as 'suspicious and illegal', and 'working against the interests of the Islamic Republic'.
Controversies.
In June 2009, BBC Persian's Hot Bird satellite broadcasts along with those of BBC Arabic Television, other BBC services, and those of other broadcasters were experiencing interference due to a jamming signal originating from within Iran. In response, BBC Persian started transmission on other satellites and increased their broadcast hours in order to combat the interference
The channel has been criticised by Iranian state television of encouraging "illegal" rallies and manipulating the Iranian people against the Islamic Republic, a claim which the BBC denies.
The jamming resumed on 20 December 2009 soon after BBC Persian began extended coverage of the protests resulting from the death of leading reformist cleric Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri, and on 28 December 2009, BBC Persian ceased its transmission from the Hot Bird 6 satellite., however transmissions continued from the Telstar 12, Eutelsat W2M and Atlantic Bird 4A satellites.
BBC Persian returned to a different frequency on Hot Bird 6 on 26 May 2010, after a period of test transmissions. After a new jamming in February 2011 on Hotbird, BBC Persian showed for some months only a test card along with the audio of their service. Since February 2012 BBC Persian is back on Hotbird again.
Also, due to the ban on foreign reporters in Iran, the news service currently relies on a significant amount of user-generated content, often taken with mobile phones.
Awards.
It appears that Iran's presidential elections in June 2009 and what followed greatly elevated BBC Persian TV's stature and importance. It became the channel that extensively covered the events for the Iranians inside Iran. Outside of Iran, the channel was therefore recognised accordingly.
On 4 November 2009, BBC Persian TV was honoured for the "Clearest coverage of a single news event – television" by the Association for International Broadcasting at its annual global media excellence awards at a gala event in London, England. The award was for "the elections that shook Iran". It was a half hour narration of the unrest that developed in the streets of Iran immediately after the disputed June presidential elections.
On 20 November 2009, BBC Persian TV was honoured at the 12th annual Hot Bird TV Awards in Venice, Italy. It was named best news channel for its portrayal of unbiased news in a complex and fast-moving environment.
Schedule.
The channel broadcasts from London for eight hours every day. Programmes cover a variety of subjects including current affairs, documentaries, culture, science, business and the arts.
Entertainment programmes such as "BBC Sound" and "Top Gear" are broadcast with Persian dubbing.
Presenters.
Jamaluddin Mousavi (Mosawi).
Jamaluddin (Jamal) started working for the BBC in 2001 as a journalist when he joined the BBC's Central Asia magazine in Iran and Afghanistan. Before joining the BBC, Jamal was the editor of a weekly publication for Afghan refugees living in Mashhad, the province capital of Iran's Khorasan province where he also managed a UNHCR project to train young Afghan journalists. Jamal comes from Afghanistan although he grew up and studied in Iran.

Jeremy Clarkson on Ferrari

Jeremy Clarkson on Ferrari is a non-fiction book, published in 2000, written by British journalist and television presenter Jeremy Clarkson. The book covered every model made by Ferrari up to the Ferrari 360 Modena accompanied by colour photographs.
Background.
According to an article in "The Independent", Clarkson said that in 1999, an old friend of his, Pete Butters, stopped by to re-live old times and have a drink of whisky. Butters suggested that Clarkson should write a book about Ferrari for his new publishing company, who specialise in limited edition books. Clarkson agreed to write the book.
Print editions.
1500 copies of the book were printed and each was individually numbered. 550 copies were leather-bound with an embossed silver plaque. The remainder were cloth-bound, costing £245 each.
Reception.
The book was widely criticised in the media. Clarkson branded it a "ridiculous tome".
"Thoroughbred and Classic Car" magazine criticised the book for having the tone of vanity publishing, relying too much on car show snapshots of questionable quality. The book was also criticised for placing too much emphasis on mainstream models and being to similar to other Ferrari books that cost considerably less.
Clarkson, after reading a copy himself and reading the reviews, stated that the criticisms didn't go far enough. In an issue of "Top Gear Magazine" he said it was the worst thing he had ever done. He added, excepting "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" and A. A. Gill's "Sap Rising", he "considered it to be the worst book in the world" and suggested that "anyone thinking about buying it should flush the money down the loo instead".
Clarkson received no payment for the book.
The combined high price and dubious quality of the book, resulted in slow sales compared to other high-end automotive books. As of 2009, second-hand copies command £150.

Lewis Blackmore

Lewis Gordon Blackmore (21 May 1886 – 23 July 1916) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Family and early life.
Lewis' father, Edwin Gordon Blackmore (1837–1909), an Englishman from Bath, the son of a doctor, had fought as a volunteer in the "Maori Wars" with the Taranaki Rifle Volunteer Corps from 1863 to 1864, and had moved to South Australia and had established himself in Adelaide. He was a co-founder of the Adelaide Club, the Adelaide Hunt Club, and served the Clerk of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1886 and, later, served as the Clerk of the Federal Parliaments.
Lewis' mother, Eleanora Elizabeth Farr (1847–1901), was the eldest daughter of ven. Archdeacon George Henry Farr (1819–1904), M.A., LL.D. and Julia Warren Ord.
Lewis had four older brothers, Gordon Patteson Blackmore (1872–1941), George Edward Blackmore (1874–1936), James Gairdner Blackmore (1876–?), Edwin Ord Blackmore (1879–?), two older sisters, Jane Gordon Drummond Blackmore (later, Mrs. Granville Sharp) (1881–1942), Eleanor Mary Blackmore (1884–1891), and one younger brother, John Coleridge Blackmore (1888–?). His older brother Quartermaster Sergeant George Edward Blackmore (No.85), had served in the Boer War with the Third South Australian Citizens' Bushmen Contingent.

Footballer.
Recruited from Melbourne Grammar School, when still a student there, he played on the forward line, and kicked four goals from five shots in his first senior game against St Kilda, at the Junction Oval on 2 September 1905. He played in the next two games, the last match of the season, and the first Semi-Final, both against Fitzroy. Fitzroy won both matches. Blackmore kicked one of Essendon's four goals in each of the matches.
He played in the second, third and fourth games of the 1906 season, and in the second game of the 1907 season.
Soldier.
Prior to his enlistment he was farmer and grazier, working with his brother, John Coleridge Blackmore, at Wattamondara, near Cowra, in New South Wales. He enlisted in Adelaide on 23 September 1914; seven weeks after the declaration of war.
On 21 December, having finished his basic training, he was promoted from Trooper to Lance Corporal; and, on that same day, as part of the 6th Light Horse Regiment, A Troop, A Squadron, he embarked from Sydney on board HMAT Suevic (A29).
After further training in Egypt, he was sent to Gallipoli, where he was wounded in action (on 14 July 1915); amongst other things he had a broken right arm.
He was evacuated to Malta; and whilst there, in the September, he contracted "enteric fever" (typhoid). He was immediately sent to Cardiff, Wales, in the UK to recover and, once he was well enough to do so, he returned to his unit, in Egypt, in January 1916.
Death.
Second Lieutenant Blackmore was killed by machine gun fire in France, just after midnight, whilst taking part in an attacking advance as part of the 1st Infantry Battalion during the Battle of Pozières on the morning of Sunday, 23 July 1916. He was hit in the forehead by a machine gun bullet and died instantly, at 30 years of age.
His body was never identified, and the precise location of his grave is unknown.
He is commemorated at the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial, in France.

Cryptocarya erythroxylon

Cryptocarya erythroxylon is a medium to large rainforest tree, that grows from the Barrington Tops in New South Wales to the Gladstone area in Queensland. The common name is the pigeonberry ash, rose maple, or rose walnut.
This is one of the largest laurels in Australia. Mature specimens usually reach around 35 metres tall, though there is a 57 metre tall tree at Murray Scrub near Kyogle close to the NSW–Queensland border. It grows between 500–1050 m altitude.
Trees of the genus "Cryptocarya" are mostly from the tropics or warmer temperate areas. This tree is unusual as it grows in cooler regions, subject to frost and rare snowfall. It is also an unusually tall member of the genus.
The trunk is often buttressed, and the grey or white cylindrical trunk is a conspicuous feature in the rainforest. Leaves are 6 to 13 centimetres long, white and veiny underneath. The small cream flowers form in early summer, the fruit is a black drupe maturing in the cooler months. Germination occurs easily after removal of the black aril.

Church of the Transfiguration

The Church of the Transfiguration is a Franciscan church located on Mount Tabor in Israel. It is traditionally believed to be the site where the Transfiguration of Christ took place, an event in the Gospels in which Jesus is transfigured upon an unnamed mountain and speaks with Moses and Elijah.
History.
The current church, part of a Franciscan monastery complex, was completed in 1924. The architect was Antonio Barluzzi. It was built on the ruins of an ancient (4th–6th-century) Byzantine church and a 12th-century church of the Crusader Kingdom period. There is a Greek Orthodox church located on Mount Tabor as well, dedicated to the same purpose.
Architecture.
The church contains three grottoes belonging to the Crusader church. They were described by Jonas Korte, a publisher from Eldena, as "three chapels, with a small altar. They are called tabernacles, and they are said to represent the three huts which Peter desired to build, one for his Master (Jesus) the other two for Moses and Elias (Elijah)". 
The Grotto of Christ is in the eastern part of the church. Steps lead down to a lower level containing a sanctuary roofed with a modern vault.
There is a chapel in each of the two towers at the western end of the church. The Chapel of Elijah is located in the south tower; the north tower holds the Chapel of Moses.
In the upper part of the church there is a mosaic on a gold ground representing the Transfiguration. On Aug 6th, which is the "day of the Transfiguration" in some church calendars, the sun strikes a glass plate set into the floor so that the golden mosaic is briefly illuminated.
The Transfiguraton.
The Transfiguration of Jesus is an event reported by the Synoptic Gospels in which Jesus is transfigured upon a mountain (, , ). Jesus becomes radiant, speaks with Moses and Elijah, and is called "Son" by God. The transfiguration put Jesus above Moses and Elijah, the two preeminent figures of Judaism. 
Several mountains have been identified as the site of the Transfiguration, for example the tallest mountain in Israel, Mount Hermon. Mount Tabor is closer to the center of Jesus's activities and therefore the Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem wrote in the year 348 that he preferred Mount Tabor to Mount Hermon. Thus Mount Tabor was accepted as the site of the transfiguration of Christ.

Valburga

Valburga () is a settlement on the left bank of the Sava River in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Plave and Na Mlaki.
Name.
Valburga was attested in written sources in 1324 as "Sand Walpurch" (and as "Sand Walpurgen" in 1327 and "apud Sanctam Walpurgam" in 1355). It is named after Saint Walpurga, the patron of the local church. Locally, the settlement is known as "Šentomperga". The name of the settlement was changed from "Sveta Valburga" (literally, 'Saint Walpurga') to "Valburga" (literally, 'Walpurga') in 1952. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. In the 19th century the German name was "Sankt Walburga".
Church.
The local church is dedicated to Saint Walpurga. It stands at the northern end of the village and was first mentioned in written sources in the 14th century. The current building is a Baroque structure with a main altar dating from the mid-18th century. The side altars and the pulpit are late Baroque. The paintings of the Mount of Olives and the Way of the Cross displayed inside are by Leopold Layer (1752–1828), based on models by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.
Manor.
There is a large manor in the settlement, known as Lazzarini Manor (), Smlednik Manor (), or Valburga Manor (). It was built in the 17th century. The main hall is painted with high-quality frescoes with mythological themes in the illusionist style. The painting in the chapel vault is believed to be by Anton Cebej. After the Second World War, the manor was seized by the state and nationalized; from 1946 to 1990 the building was used as a special needs school. The manor is being renovated after a fire in 2007 and is not open to the public.

Bledric ap Custennin (also known as Blederic, Bredrice, Peledric, Bletius, Bledrys, Bledrig, Bletricius or Bledericus) was a 6th and 7th century ruler of Dumnonia (now the English West Country).
Life and rule.
The actual status and reality of Bledric is difficult to ascertain as he figures in much old Welsh literature variously as "King", "Duke" or "Prince" of Devonshire and/or Cornwall. He was described as Duke of Cornwall by "c."603, and an ally of northern Welsh kings. 
The fullest account of Bledric's life comes from Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudohistorical "Historia Regum Britanniae" where he is numbered amongst the legendary Dukes of Cornwall. Here Bledric, Duke of Cornwall, was the commander of the allied British armies which included King Cadvan of North Wales (Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd) and King Margadud of South Wales (probably Maredydd ap Rhain of Dyfed) at the Battle of Bangor-is-Coed. He joined battle with the army of Æthelfrith of Northumbria who had just slain 1200 monks, and succeeded in wounding Æthelfrith and defeating the Angles but being slain himself.
Some authors have Peredur, son of Cado ap Gerren, ruling as king in the "fl." 600s, descended from a different line of Dumnonian kings from Gerren "Llyngesic". This is as given in the Dumnonian king-list derived from Jesus College, Oxford, MS 20.
Family.
Bledric was one of three sons of king Constantine (or Custennin) who died in "c."560, his brothers being Gerren rac Denau, who he may have succeeded as king, and Domuel (or Dywel). He also had a sister who married Peibio Clafrog, king of Ergyng in South Wales. Bledric may have had two sons, Clemen as given in the "Llyfr Baglan" (Book of Baglan) who is thought to have succeeded him, and Blethyn as given by Caradoc of Llancarfan.
Death.
Caradoc of Llancarfan, in his "Historie of Cambria" (History of Wales), notes that Bledric was one of the British leaders killed by King Æthelfrith of Northumbria and King Æthelberht of Kent at Bangor on the River Dee in "c."613, where he is described as the Prince of Devonshire and Cornwall. It is said that 'by the valiant forgoings of his life got his partners the victory'. His sons apparently went on to 'enjoy the government of North Wales ever since Cadfan ap Iago was chief King in Britain.' Caradoc of Llancarfan also gives Bledric's descendants elsewhere and gives Blethyn (or Bleddyn) as his son and Ednowen (or Ednowain) as his grandson.
Literature.
Bledric may also appear in one of the Welsh Triads. Triad 69, the 'Three Defilements of the Severn' give the second as 'the gift of Golydan from Einiawn son of Bedd, king of Cornwall', although given the genealogy of Caradoc of Llancarfan, this could be his supposed son Bleddyn who was recorded as father of Ednowain.
He is also given in "Llyfr Baglan" as a Duke of Cornwall, son of Constantine, High King of Britain (e.g. Custennin) and father of Clement (e.g. Clemen), Duke of Cornwall.

Vaše is a settlement on the right bank of the Sora River just before its confluence with the Sava River at Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.

Vaše was first attested in written sources in 1318 as "Weisach" (later as "Watschach" in 1353, "Waschach" in 1373, "Waczach" in 1393, "Wartschach" and "Watschach" in 1444, and "Wartschach" in 1453). These are all locative forms. The medieval transcriptions indicate that "-š-" developed from "-šč-" and that the name is therefore likely derived from the demonym "*Vaščane" (literally, 'villagers').

The son of Bertrand and Reva Gerstein, Gerstein was made a Member of the Order of Canada in recognition for being a "respected businessman and a loyal and diligent volunteer and philanthropist" in 1999. In 2002, he was awarded the Order of Ontario.
Gerstein is best known for his time as President of Peoples Jewellers. He led the Peoples takeover of Zale Corporation in 1996 and then Zale's takeover of Gordon Jewelry in 1989. By 1990, he headed the world’s largest jewelry retail empire.

He is a long-time political fundraiser for the Progressive Conservative Party and now the Conservative Party of Canada.
Gerstein received his BSc. in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
On February 23, 2011, Irving Gerstein was charged along with Senator Doug Finley for violations of the Canada Elections Act. Elections Canada alleged that Irving Gerstein was complicit in a scheme that involved filing false tax claims and exceeding federal spending limits on campaign advertisements. If found guilty, Gerstein would have faced up to a year in prison and fines exceeding $25,000; however, the charges were dropped after the Conservative party agreed to pay a $52,000 fine.
Gerstein was chair of Senate’s Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce which authored the 2013 report entitled "Follow the Money: Is Canada Making Progress in Combatting the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing? Not Really." The report cautioned that in spite of considerable resources expended, "there is a lack of clear and compelling evidence that Canada’s regime is leading to the detection and deterrence of money laundering." The Senate also expressed concern that "Given that multinational financial institutions have recently been implicated in money laundering and terrorist financing, the Committee is concerned about non-compliance with the Act by reporting entities." The annual value of money laundering in Canada in 2011 was between $5 billion and $15 billion. Globally the annual value of global money laundering is between US$800 billion and US$2 trillion.

Campaspe Plains massacre

Campaspe Plains massacre, occurred in 1839 in Central Victoria, Australia as a reprisal raid against Aboriginal resistance to the invasion and occupation of the Dja Dja Wurrung and Daung Wurrung lands. Charles Hutton took over the Campaspe run, located near the border of Dja Dja Wurrung and Daung Wurrung, in 1838 following sporadic confrontations.
Cause.
In April 1839 five Aborigines were killed by three white men. In response Hugh Bryan, a shepherd, and James Neill, a hut keeper were killed in May 1839 by Aborigines identified as Daung Wurrung, who had robbed a hut of bedding, clothes, guns and ammunition and also run a flock of 700 sheep off the property, possibly as retribution for the earlier Aboriginal deaths. The Daung Wurrung were enemies of the Dja Dja Wurrung.
The Massacre.
Hutton immediately put together an armed party of settlers who tracked and finally caught the Aborigines with a flock of sheep 30 miles away near the Campaspe Creek. An armed confrontation between the settlers and Aborigines occurred for up to half an hour. Hutton claimed privately that nearly 40 Aborigines were killed.
The following month Hutton led a party of mounted police and came upon a party of local Dja Dja Wurrung whom Hutton had previously forced off his run, even though these people had been friendly to him since his arrival. The Aboriginal camp near the Campaspe Creek was charged by Hutton and the mounted police with no warning given, with six Dja Dja Wurrung being shot in the back and killed as they tried to flee and others wounded.
Charles Parker, the Assistant Protector of Aborigines for the region, described the massacre as:
George Robinson described Charles Hutton and his attitude to "the blacks" in his journal of 24 January 1840:
No official action was taken against Hutton.

Bánhidi Gerle

__NOTOC__
The Bánhidi "Gerle" (Hungarian: "Dove") was a two-seat, single-engine sport biplane built in Hungary in the early 1930s, designed by Antal Bánhidi. It had a conventional layout, with staggered, single-bay wings of equal span braced by N-struts. The pilot and passenger sat in open cockpits in tandem, and the main units of the tailskid undercarriage were divided. The fuselage was constructed of fabric-covered steel tube, while the wings were built of plywood ribs and spruce spars and also covered in fabric. Bánhidi flew a single prototype (the Gerle 11 on 4 September 1930. This was followed by examples (designated Gerle 12 to Gerle 15) built by Műegyetemi Sportrepülő Egyesület, the sport flying club at the Budapest Technical University, and by another three machines (Gerle 16 to Gerle 18) built by WNF in Wiener Neustadt. The Gerles built by Műegyetemi Sportrepülő Egyesület are sometimes known under the name MSrE Gerle or MSE Gerle. 
Bánhidi achieved fame with the Gerle 13 when in 1933 he made a long-distance flight of 12,258 km around the Mediterranean. Between 19 February and 24 March, he and Tibor Bisits visited twenty-two cities in Italy, France, Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Turkey, and Greece, spending around 100 hours in the air. Later the same year, Bánhidi made a flight from Hungary through northern Europe to England and back to Hungary, his route taking him from Debrecen to Rapla, Helsingfors, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Croydon, and then non-stop back to Debrecen. This final leg of the flight covered 1,640 km, a considerable achievement in a light aircraft at the time.
A flying replica of the Gerle 13 was built in 1988.

Vincent Cartwright

Vincent Henry Cartwright DSO (10 September 1882 – 25 November 1965) was an English rugby union international who captained his country. He also played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire.
Personal history.
Cartwright was born in 1882 in Nottingham. He was educated Rugby before matriculating to Oxford University in 1901. After leaving university he became a solicitor in Nottingham, and later a Clerk to Nottingham City Magistrates. 
Cartwright served in the British Armed Forces during the First World War, joing the Royal Marines. He was made a Temporary Second Lieutenant in 1914, then Temporary Captain, before reaching the rank of Temporary Major in 1917. Serving on the Western Front, Cartwright was highly decorated, twice mentioned in dispatches, a DSO and Croix de guerre.
Rugby career.
Cartwright first came to note as a rugby player while at Rugby, representing the school team. On entering Oxford he was selected as a freshman to join the University rugby team. He played in four successive Varsity Matches from 1901–1904, all at forward, collecting his sporting 'Blues'. While still a university student, Cartwright was selected for the England national team during the 1903 Home Nations Championship; a miserable defeat on a boggy St. Helen's ground against Wales. Despite the loss, Cartwright was reselected for the remaining two games of the tournament; both loses. He continued his international career throughout his time at Oxford, with two caps in the 1904 Home Nations Championship and all three of the 1905 Championship. After leaving Oxford in the later half of 1905 he joined Nottingham, becoming the first player to be capped for England directly from the club. His first international cap while a Nottingham player saw him given the captaincy of the England team, in the 1905 encounter with New Zealand. 
Cartwright continued his captaincy of England through all three matches of the 1906 Championship, which included the first England encounter with France, a win for the English team which saw Cartwright score his first international points with four conversions. In 1906 Cartwright lead out the East Midlands team to face the first touring South African team; the first game of the Springbok's tour, the South African's won by a comfortable 29-0 margin. This was followed by Cartwright's last international, leading England against the same touring South Africans. The game ended in a 3-3 draw.
After retiring he became a referee and was President of the Rugby Football Union in 1928 and 1929.
Cricket career.
Cartwright played his seven first-class cricket matches with Nottinghamshire between 1901 and 1904 as a right-handed batsman but could only manage 60 runs.

The Prince of Wales International Centre for SANE Research

The Prince of Wales International Centre for SANE Research (POWIC) in Oxford houses investigations into finding the causes of and better treatment for serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and depression.
POWIC was built with donations from Nicholas and Matti Egon from the Xylas shipping family, the late King of Saudi Arabia Fahd bin Abdel Aziz Al-Said, Keeper of the Two Holy Mosques, and His Majesty the Sultan of Brunei. The building was formally opened by SANE’s Patron, HRH The Prince of Wales in February 2003, although the scientific programme had been running for the previous nine years. Support for POWIC was encouraged by SANE's founder and chief executive Marjorie Wallace (SANE) CBE. 
Prior to the formation of SANE in 1986 there was a considerable paucity of research interest in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. One of the charity’s endeavours has been to initiate and fund research into the causes and treatments of mental illness.
In order to focus research efforts, SANE established POWIC in conjunction with the research psychiatrist Professor Tim Crow.
Professor Crow was appointed the honorary scientific director of SANE based at the Department of Psychiatry at Warneford Hospital, part of Oxford University. SANE successfully raised £3.5 million to establish a new centre on the Warneford Hospital site. The specially designed and purpose built centre includes office and laboratory space, as well as conference and library facilities.
The aims
The aims of POWIC are:
The research
Professor Crow has being studying schizophrenia for over 20 years, and he and his research group have been developing and researching a specific hypothesis about the origins of psychosis - that it is associated with the unique human capacity for language.
Professor Crow arrived at this hypothesis by bringing together the fact that schizophrenia only appears to occur in humans and not in our closest relatives, chimpanzees. The same can be said of brain asymmetry (the left and right sides of the brain, which are basically the same, being different in size). Brain asymmetry has been linked to the capacity for language. 
POWIC's quest for an organic basis for mental illness is pursued using three levels of explanation:
In 2008, POWIC shared its building with the Oxford Mindfulness Centre(OMC), a new charity working within the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry which will conduct research and training in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for people with severe, recurrent depression who are at risk of suicide. 
His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who visited Oxford in 2008, gave his support to the new Centre and the scientific examination of the Mindfulness approach: "My primary concern is not to religion, but to benefit humanity. It is certainly right to use Buddhist techniques like mindfulness to alleviate suffering in this life."
Within the space occupied by the OMC, a third strand of research, with immediate impact on mental health service users and their families, will be conducted under the leadership of Professor Tom Burns CBE. His National Institute for Health Research team will be investigating the implications of the Mental Health Act 2008 and ethical issues involved in voluntary as against compulsory psychiatric treatment.

Leo Housakos

Leo Housakos (born Leonidas Housakos on January 10, 1968) is a Canadian politician of Greek descent and a Conservative member of the Canadian Senate. 
An avid student of the Canadian political system, Montreal-born Leo Housakos has been actively involved in Canada’s political and business sectors for over twenty-five years.
Mr. Housakos was appointed to the Canadian Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on December 22, 2008.
Mr. Housakos’ varied experience in the business world includes the presidency of Terrau Inc., a company specializing in composting, the presidency of Quadvision International, a company which focuses upon communications and strategic planning and the vice-presidency, Sales at Constant Laboratories, a company specializing in the development and sales of industrial chemical products. He was also a member of the North America Advisory Board for the Alexander Proudfoot Company, an organization specializing in the productivity of corporations.
Senator Housakos’ passion for public policy and service was evident very early in his life as he became involved with the youth wing of the Progressive Conservative Party at the age of sixteen.
This commitment to public policy continued to develop after he graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1992 and worked as a ministerial staffer in the Ministry of Multiculturalism with the Honorable Gerry Weiner. Soon after, he became involved with the Hellenic Congress of Quebec and served two terms as its Vice-President, National Issues between 1998 and 2000, where he continued to expand upon his already impressive record of community activism.
Feeling frustrated with the Liberals taking the cultural communities for granted, and with a burning passion to serve Canadians, Senator Housakos decided to become a candidate for the Canadian Alliance in 2000, in the riding of Laval Ouest, where he has lived for over twenty years.
He also co-founded the Hellenic Board of Trade in 1993, an organization dedicated to the development of business opportunities and networking in the Greater Montreal Area. The Hellenic Board of Trade is a member of the Board of Trade of Greater Montreal and his work with this organization allowed Mr. Housakos to focus upon municipal issues as he eventually became an advisor to the Mayor of Montreal between 2001-2002.
His political experience also includes the presidency of the fundraising commission of the Action Démocratique du Québec, demonstrating a well-balanced resume at all levels of Canadian politics. His skills in the realms of business, politics and community activism led to his appointment, in 2007, to the Board of Directors of Via Rail where he served the interests of Canadians until 2008.
Personal life.
He is married to Demi Papapanagiotou for over 19 years and is the father of two children, Peter and Tasso.
A Digital Plan for Canada.
Canada has a proud history in telecommunications with the CBC, in 1978, becoming the first broadcaster in the world to use an orbiting satellite for television service, thus linking Canada "from east to west to north”, (3) and being the first country in the world to connect all its schools to the Internet, and further leading the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries in the deployment and uptake of broadband.
With over twenty countries in the world having a comprehensive national digital strategy, and Canada having none, the Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, in June 2010, of which Senator Housakos was deputy chair, produced a ground-breaking and a far-reaching report called A Plan for Digital Canada.
Some of its objectives included access to high-speed Internet, the nation-building role of wireless, the pace of the adoption of innovations, and Canada’s development of the sector in comparison to the performance in other countries.
The committee made two fact-finding missions to Europe, where it entertained over seventy officials who shared their expertise and their view of a digital world. It also held twenty-two meetings in Ottawa, hearing from expert witnesses such as government, academic and other experts; representatives of high-tech companies; wireless service providers – national incumbents, regional providers and new entrants – consumer advocates and groups with focused concerns, such as digital literacy and privacy.
The report produced 18 recommendations, some of which called for:
o A Minister for Digital Policy, thus ensuring the implementation of the national digital strategy;
o Digital services to be brought to all citizens, thereby ensuring universal access for all citizens, by having the government using all the proceeds from spectrum auctions to provide high-speed Internet (broadband) access for both rural and remote areas;
o Cabinet meetings being paperless;
o The Minister for Digital Policy should work with his ministerial colleagues to develop a secure Internet platform that would allow citizens to review their government files over the Internet;
o Further fostering Canada’s democratic tradition by empowering Elections Canada to move expeditiously to develop major test projects involving e-Registration and e-Voting.
Commenting on the release of the report, Senator Housakos said, “We need a multi-targeted policy approach to prepare the way for a digital society. We need a principal of true universality to avoid the creation of ‘information haves’ and ‘information have-nots’.”
NDP industry critic Brian Masse welcomed the report, insisting a national digital policy was overdue for Canadians and contained many ideas his party wants to explore further.
Public Positions – Public Statements – Published Articles.
Breaking ranks with his party in September 2011, Senator Housakos was the first Conservative Party Parliamentarian to openly and publicly oppose the nomination of unilingual Michael Ferguson as Auditor General of Canada, stating, “there are certain positions in the federal government that are so symbolic to what Canada is all about and I just believe they have to be filled by people who are functionally bilingual.”
Arguing that the appointment sets a dangerous precedent that threatens bilingualism in Canada, Mr. Housakos further added, “I think that bilingualism is so fundamental to this country, not just from the point of view of national unity, but I think it’s a tool that should be used as a positive attribute, both in terms of our diplomatic strategies and our commercial strategies around the world.”
This may have led the New Democratic Party, Official Opposition in Parliament, to propose a bill where all officers of Parliament, auditor general, the chief electoral officer, the commissioner of official languages, the privacy commissioner, the information commissioner, the senate ethics officer, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, the commissioner of lobbying, the public sector integrity commissioner, and the president of the public service commission, would be required to be proficient in both official languages of Canada.
The Conservative government later endorsed the bill.
In October 2012, Senator Housakos published The Challenges of Integration and Multiculturalism, where he voices concerns regarding the difficulties recent immigrants have had in being both accepted and integrated within North American society and, more specifically, the challenges the Muslim communities have had in a post 911 reality.
In order to ensure social harmony, quick integration and acceptance within Canadian society, he argues that the Canadian government should provide prospective new immigrants a clear understanding of the norms and values of their adoptive new home, because Canada is a country based on the separation of Church and state and the equality of men and women.
Immigration authorities in embassies and consulates should prepare Muslim as well as other religious and secular applicants on the laws and norms of Canada, because religion should be something that is in the home and in the confines of the church, synagogue, mosque and temple.
In March 2013 an internal investigation was taking place in British Columbia regarding an outreach scandal targeting ethnic communities. The scandal erupted over allegations of the existence of a document, created using taxpayer resources, to attract ethnic voters to the BC Liberals in hopes of winning key ridings in the May 14, 2013 provincial election.
Outraged over the BC Liberal government scandal, Senator Housakos publishes Multiculturalism’s an Outdated Insult, in March 2013, where he argues that official Multiculturalism, a Liberal Party invention of the 1960s, essentially became a state-financed marketing program where the government uses tax dollars to buy photo ops with ethnic leaders – usually in culturally diverse cities such as Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Under the guise of official government policy, this Liberal invention, he adds, would eventually translate into broader support in general elections.
This policy of Multiculturalism, continued by successive governments, produces profiling Canadians based on race, color and religion, thus furthering the creation of hyphenated Canadians.
Being of Greek descent, he firmly believes that Multiculturalism is an outdated policy and favors replacing multiculturalism with a policy of integration, where Canadian values of equality and the rule of law are emphasized.
Most recently, Senator Housakos spoke out against the PQ government’s controversial Charter of Quebec Values, on the basis that it negates respect for individual rights.
“Other than just a political ploy on the part of the Parti Québécois to chase down nationalist votes that have maybe left to go to other more radical nationalist parties in the last couple of elections, there’s no other benefit (from introducing a new charter),” said Mr. Housakos. “So the only people that see a need for this is the Parti Québécois. And the need is for political expediency.”
Community Involvement - Passions.
During his spare time, Senator Housakos does charity work for the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA), where they help raise funds for children’s causes in the Montreal area.
Mr. Housakos was instrumental in helping to organize a charity ball for Giant Steps, an association dedicated to helping autistic children.
He has also been coaching a youth hockey team for over 10 years. In 2009, his team became the champions of the 33rd Brossard Provincial Atom hockey tournament.

Bahnbetriebswerk Passau

The Bahnbetriebswerk Passau (abbr: Bw Passau) is the locomotive shed that belongs to Passau's main station, the Hauptbahnhof.
Passau Hauptbahnhof was opened on 1 September 1861, with its first shed. It was initially a terminal station until the 1.5 km long section over the river Inn to Empress Elisabeth Railway from Wels on the Austrian side was taken into service. This now meant that railway traffic could now operate from Frankfurt am Main to Vienna via Passau. This border station was now operated by two separate railway companies and operating interest was generated by the changeover of locomotives there.
In 1865 a railway link was built by a private railway company to the river port on the Danube next to Passau town hall. This was transferred to the Royal Bavarian State Railways on 1 January 1876. After the site had been extended several times over the course of the years and several branch lines had been taken into service, the "Bahnbetriebswerk" had to move to "Haitzingerstraße" in 1906. 150,000 m² of earth was moved and a twenty-road roundhouse with an adjoining two-road workshop was erected, together with a six-road workshop and traverser, which stamped its mark on the appearance of the site for 70 years.
Because of the Obernzell to Wegscheid line, the only rack railway in the Royal Bavarian State Railways, new locomotives were constantly being tested at Bw Passau. The PtzL 3/4 (later DRG Class 97.1) was only ever stabled here; the first trials on the Uerdingen railbus, the VT 95, VT98.9 und VT97, took place here, as did testing for the road-rail vehicle and the V 100, which worked the line until the Class 213 (the variant for steep inclines, the V100.10) succeeded it. 
This depot has stabled numerous steam locomotives, but over time they were replaced by diesel or electric locos. After the closure of passenger services on several routes as well as the withdrawal of goods traffic and the dismantling of the Obernzell - Wegscheid line and the disbandment of the Regensburg railway division the depot was subordinated to the Nuremberg division. The departure of the locomotives to other depots began in the 1960s and was completed in 1978. The last modification took place in 1976 and saw the demolition of the roundhouse. In its place the present day "Orange Shed", for the maintenance of railbuses, and a workshop were erected. After the depot was closed in 2000, the property was entrusted to a local railway society, the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde (PEF), who are housed on the site.
The old Betriebswerk Passau can now only be seen as an H0 gauge model in the cellar of Passau Hauptbahnhof. The railway modelling section of the PEF had the aim of building a model with a historical background; as a result the depots of both the German and Austrian railways - the Deutsche Bundesbahn and ÖBB - are depicted as is Passau station and several neighbouring branch lines.

Dimitrios Diathessopoulos

Dimitrios Diathessopoulos is a Greek lawyer specializing in sports law, a politician and an important figure in the Greek Sports and International Swimming society. He is called the father of Greek water polo and he is the presently the longest serving president of an athletic federation in Europe.
Early life.
He was born in Piraeus in 1947 to a middle-class family. In 1965 he entered the NUOA Law School of Athens and immediately he registered in Center's Union Party Youth branch. Two years later he was elected president of the Law School Students Union, just days before the beginning of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. During the seven years of the junta he was pursued due to his anti-dictatorship actions. By 1974 he became an early member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) that some years later came to power in Greece.
First contact with sports.
From 1976 he started his career as a water polo referee. At that time water polo referees were paying their expenses out of their own pocket. From 1979 he started to work as a lawyer, while he continued his parallel career as a water polo referee, soon qualifying to work at the A1 Men's Category. He participated as a water polo referee at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He continued as an active member of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Party (PASOK).
The road to presidency.
In 1984 the PASOK government decided to introduce reforms in Greek sports organization, as part of their general program of reforms. Diathessopoulos was chosen to work with swimmers; he formed a team of competitors. Some months later he won the Hellenic Swimming Federation (KOE) elections and began serving as its President. He still holds this post today with a brief break during 1991-1994, when the New Democracy party was in power in Greece.
His work.
During Diathessopoulos' presidency, the Hellenic Swimming Federation developed rapidly and its sports (water polo, swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming) became popular among Greek youth. Successes include a silver medal that was won by women's water polo team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, which is the biggest Greek success in team sports, and a fourth place finish by the men's water polo team at the Olympics, which is the biggest success of any Greek men's sports team. In 1987 Diathessopoulos was elected General Secretary of the Greek Olympic Committee (EOE), a position that he kept for over 17 years with brief breaks. He is a member of the administrative council of FINA, the international swimming federation. After many years as a member of their bureau, in 2008 he was elected vice-president of the European Swimming Federation (LEN). He was appointed as the highest officer for the development and administration of water polo in Europe.
During his presidency of the Hellenic Swimming Federation (KOE) he worked hard to prevent attempts by the government to reduce its economic and moral support of sports, and he is considered a key player in the struggle against doping in Greece. He was involved in a dispute with the former Minister of Sports, Andreas Fouras, when Fouras attempted to pass legislation that reduced the state's financing of sports and included provisions that would allow the cancellation of any developments in Greek athletics. The affair ended with Foura's expulsion from office; Diathessopoulos was widely recognized for his efforts, which have discouraged any further attempts by the state to cut sports financing. Diathessopoulos is renowned for his actions towards the development of mass sports in Greece. With his protests, political initiatives, work on sports law, and even lawsuits against the Greek state, he has made an important contribution to the enactment of pro-sports developmental legislation. Several times he was considered as the national voice of the Greek sports community. He was a key player in Greece's failed attempt to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, and one of the architects of the successful 2004 Summer Olympics bid. He played an important role as a member of the organizing committee for the event, in cooperation with Gianna Aggelopoulou-Daskalaki. His political activism has brought him the attention of the Greek press on many occasions.
Other political work.
Diathessopoulos has kept involved in the Greek political scene. He was elected as president of the Perfectorial Councilor of Athens District from 1994 to 1998. He holds several important offices within PASOK, as a member of its National Committee and a leading member of the committee that directs the party's sports policy. In 2000 he was proposed for the office of General Secretary of Sports in Greece under the Ministry of Culture, but he rejected the offer, as he preferred to pursue a career within international swimming organizations.
Future plans.
Dimitris Diathessopoulos was reelected recently to his offices and he is not planning to leave the KOE's Presidency soon. He was elected a member of the FINA Bureau and supreme officer for water polo throughout the world.
His son Michael (Michail) Diathessopoulos, also an attorney at law and a Cambridge scholar, follows the steps of his father, with involvement in politics. He is a member of the National Committee of PASOK and is a leader in PASOK's Youth Organization. Dimitrios Diathessopoulos hopes his son will one day follow in his footsteps as president of the Hellenic Swimming Federation.

Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations

Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations have had a controversial and stormy diplomatic relationship. Zimbabwe is a former member of the Commonwealth, having withdrawn in 2003, and the issue of Zimbabwe has repeatedly taken centre stage in the Commonwealth, both since Zimbabwe's independence and as part of the British Empire.
Zimbabwe was the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, gaining responsible government in 1923. Southern Rhodesia became one of the most prosperous, and heavily settled, of the UK's African colonies, with a system of white minority rule. Southern Rhodesia was integrated into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In response to demands for greater black African power in government, the anti-federation white nationalist Rhodesian Front (RF) was elected in 1962, leading to the collapse of federation.
The RF, under the leadership of Ian Smith from 1964, rejected the principle of NIBMAR that the Commonwealth demanded, and the Southern Rhodesian government, now styling itself 'Rhodesia', issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. The United Kingdom refused to recognise this, and the Commonwealth was at the forefront of rejecting the UDI, imposing sanctions on Rhodesia, ending the break-away, and bringing about Rhodesia's final independence under black majority rule as Zimbabwe in 1980. However, differences of opinion of how to approach Rhodesia exposed structural and philosophical weaknesses that threatened to break-up the Commonwealth.
In recent years, under the presidency of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe has dominated Commonwealth affairs, creating acrimonious splits in the organisation. Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 for breaching the Harare Declaration. In 2003, when the Commonwealth refused to lift the suspension, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth. Since then, the Commonwealth has played a major part in trying to end the political impasse and return Zimbabwe to a state of normalcy.
Early history.
Towards responsible government.
Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia from 1901, having been colonised by the British South Africa Company (BSAC), headed by Cecil Rhodes. Southern Rhodesia first became a central issue in the Commonwealth in 1910, upon the creation of the Union of South Africa. The South Africa Act 1909 made provisions for the accession of both Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia) to join the union. This was one of three popular options, but actively discouraged by the BSAC, which preferred union with Northern Rhodesia. This was actively pursued by the BSAC administration, under Leander Starr Jameson and Francis Chaplin, as a means of countering an Afrikaner-dominated South Africa.
In the election of March 1914, BSAC-supported candidates (as opposed to supporters of self-government) won twelve of the thirteen elected seats in the Legislative Council. However, when the charter came up for renewal in August of the same year, it was granted only on condition that further political rights were extended: pushing the territory towards self-government. Furthermore, in 1918, the Privy Council ruled that the BSAC did not own any unalienated land. Now being unable to sell land, it decided against investing any further in the colony, but advocated incorporation into South Africa, which would be able to compensate its shareholders.
This, however, was unpopular amongst settlers, who, in the 1920 election, elected ten representatives of the Responsible Government Association. Persuaded of its popular support, Colonial Secretary Viscount Milner formed a commission to investigate, and this commission, the Buxton Commission, ruled that the two options – union with South Africa and responsible government – be put to a referendum. Union was rejected by the Southern Rhodesian people, who voted in the 1922 referendum in favour responsible government, which was granted in 1923.
A status of its own.
Southern Rhodesia had been granted a great deal of autonomy, including powers over defence and constitutional amendment, but falling short of dominionhood. However, observers would be forgiven for thinking that Rhodesia had just become the eighth dominion (as, indeed, reported "Time" magazine). Southern Rhodesian Premiers were routinely invited to Imperial Conferences of dominions' Prime Ministers from 1932 onwards; and, when the Dominions Office was created in 1925, Rhodesia was the only non-dominion to fall under its remit, in recognition of its quasi-independent status.
Indeed, the government of Southern Rhodesian itself was under the same misapprehension. Its official position, which it would hold until UDI, was that Southern Rhodesia was already a member of the Commonwealth, albeit not a dominion. When Robert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia, found in 1963 that Jack Howman thought that Southern Rhodesia 'is and always has been a member of the Commonwealth', this caused a diplomatic spat that contributed to the Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
Nonetheless, Southern Rhodesia did recognise that it had limits on its self-government. For example, foreign relations were not maintained, nor could the government change the Southern Rhodesian pound from parity against the British pound sterling. The most important derogation was on racial affairs; laws related to racial affairs were to have Royal Assent withheld. However, despite these limits, and the formal supremacy of British statutes under the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, a convention emerged that Parliament would not legislate for Southern Rhodesia, nor the Governor withhold Assent, without the Legislative Assembly's permission. The threat of intervention may have achieved some successes, such as when the Rhodesian government attempted to ban native Africans from voting outright in 1934, but these were few and far between. The result is that, even though self-government had been tailored to avoid the creation of a system that subjugated the native population, it happened anyway: directly against the "zeitgeist" of the rest of the Empire at the time.
Bledisloe Commission.
Discussions returned on the further integration of Southern Rhodesia with surrounding colonies. Plans to amalgamate with Northern Rhodesia had been rejected by the settler population in 1916 on the grounds that merger with its less developed neighbour would delay self-government. However, when the Hilton Young Commission recommended in 1929 an even wider union, encompassing both central and eastern Africa, a Rhodesian union became the lesser of two evils, and jumped upon.
In the face of this opposition to the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission, in 1935, Viscount Bledisloe (newly departed Governor-General of New Zealand) was asked to evaluate the future of cooperation and combination of the colonies of central Africa. The government required him to take into account the 'interests of the inhabitants, irrespective of race'. Taking four years to report, and acquiring the nickname 'Viscount Bloody-slow' for this, Bledisloe concluded that there was a single barrier to political integration: Southern Rhodesia's racist legislation. Under the doctrine of non-interference that had been established, this was seen as insurmountable, putting off any political integration, yet allowing for the economic integration that Bledisloe recommended as feasible.
Southern Rhodesia in the Second World War.
Southern Rhodesia attempted to show its loyalty to, and independence of, the mother country by symbolically becoming the first colony to affirm the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939 (like other colonies, as well as Australia and New Zealand, which had not ratified the Statute of Westminster, it had no power to declare war itself). It is often reported that a greater proportion of the population of Southern Rhodesia served in the war than of any other part of the Empire. Even though this has become a part of nationalist folklore, this is to include only the White population (of whom, 15% served), and not the population as a whole (of whom, 2% served). Nonetheless, there developed a nationalist perception that the UK and its empire owed the Southern Rhodesians a debt: which continued right up until the late 1970s.
During the war, Southern Rhodesia benefited from the 'lucrativeness of loyalty', by hosting several bases of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Even though there were no established training facilities before the war, shortly after outbreak, Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins offered to raise three air squadrons, initiating a dialogue that led to the United Kingdom offering a blank cheque to train as many pilots and air crew as Southern Rhodesia could manage. In total, 10,107 service personnel, including 7,730 pilots, were trained in Southern Rhodesia under the plan. The construction and operation of the bases (paid for mostly by the UK and Canada), as well as the location of thousands of service personnel in the colony, boosted the war-time economy of Southern Rhodesia dramatically. Higgins estimated that the training camps were as important to the war-time economy as the gold-mining industry.
Central African Federation.
Deliberations.
[[File:Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland map 1960.jpg|320px|thumb|The Central African Federation – incorporating Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland – was designed as a buffer state to Afrikaner-dominated South Africa.

In 1945, a Central African Council was formed as a consultative body for the three British central African territories: Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland (present-day Malawi). This was the limit of the British wish for integration: fearful for the same reasons Bledisloe had been. However, the conversion in July 1948 of the Northern Rhodesian settler leadership, under Roy Welensky, to supporting federalism (from long-held support for amalgamation) promoted London to reconsider its position.
When Welensky held talks with the Southern Rhodesia leadership at Victoria Falls, they he agreed a wide-ranging agreement that, far from loose federalism, seemed more a plot to amalgamate under white Rhodesian leadership. This would be a recurring theme, first at in April 1950, as a vicious circle of patently unacceptable Rhodesian proposals were made and flatly refused: potentially alienating the promise of resolution, hence pushing white settlers towards South Africa.
The official visit of Gordon Walker to the region in early 1951 was the turning point for the United Kingdom. Startled by the strength of pro-South African support in Salisbury, Walker's report made it clear that, spurned, Southern Rhodesia could turn to outright revolt, as 'potential American colonies - very loyal, but very determined to have their own way'. This, it was feared, would lead to a cataclysmic war between settler-dominated south and east Africa and native-dominated west Africa: ripping apart the nascent Commonwealth. Coupled with the Baxter report from a conference of officials, the report to the cabinet stated unequivocally: "is urgently desirable in the interests of the territories (including those of the African inhabitants) and of the Commonwealth."
It has been suggested that the main impetus for the British fear of South African domination of central Africa was to avoid South Africa cornering the market in various raw materials: including gold, chrome, and uranium.
Forming a federation.
The Federation would be 'the most controversial large-scale imperial exercise in constructive state-building ever untaken by the British government'.
Rhodesia after UDI.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
But for the likely hostile reaction from the rest of the Commonwealth, and hence a threat to its very existence, it is probable that the British government would have accepted an independent Southern Rhodesia upon the death of the Federation in 1963. However, the preservation of the Commonwealth was the predominant concern of the British government, and thus persevered with the gradual introduction of black majority rule to Rhodesia to avoid being forced to 'choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth' (in Harold Macmillan's words).
The 1964 Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was the first held after the collapse of the federation, and, even though federal Prime Ministers had attended during federation, and Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers had before federation, this invitation was not extended to Prime Minister Ian Smith. This was seen as the utmost slight, particularly as newly independent Malawi – Southern Rhodesia's former federal partner – was in attendance. Before federation, the Southern Rhodesian government had attended every meeting since 1932, and its official position was that it was already a member of the Commonwealth, hence entitled to attend as a matter of right.
On 11 November 1965, Smith issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI).
Commonwealth reaction.
On the day of UDI, the United Kingdom imposed the most stringent financial and economic constraints it had imposed upon any country (including Egypt during the Suez Crisis) since the Second World War. In vetoing loans to Rhodesia from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other institutions; imposing a trade embargo on arms, sugar, and tobacco; making it harder for Rhodesians to access London financial markets than the Soviet Union; and removing Commonwealth Preference, the British government was seen to have done everything possible to punish Rhodesia economically, except to impose an oil embargo, which was itself forthcoming on 17 December 1965.
This was not enough to placate some Commonwealth members, who demanded a military response. Two, Ghana and Tanzania, even suspended diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom as a reaction to the United Kingdom's refusal to use military force to oust Smith. An emergency Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers convened in Lagos, Nigeria (the only one held outside London) on 10 January 1966 to address the crisis. At this meeting, Wilson pledged that sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth would bring the crisis to an end 'within a matter of weeks, not months'. However, on 14 January, Wilson stated that military intervention could not be ruled out, and, on 25 January, also stated that there would be no negotiations with the Rhodesian administration except on how to bring about an orderly return to direct rule.
Negotiate or not?
The 1966 full Prime Ministers' Meeting, held in September, saw the Commonwealth as a whole close to collapse, as African members suspected that the UK was on the verge of breaking its pledges not to negotiate over the issue of NIBMAR. Nonetheless, despite Harold Wilson describing it 'by common consent, the worst ever held up to that time', the meeting passed without cataclysm, but led to a hiatus in PM meetings until 1969 (at the behest of Wilson, and opposed by Arnold Smith). Meanwhile, the UK had been conducting exploratory talks with the Rhodesian government, aboard HMS Fearless (in 1966) and HMS Tiger (1968) that led to Rhodesia declining very favourable terms. Similarly favourable terms were proposed in 1971, but discarded when the British government determined that they were largely rejected by the African population.
However, this movement towards negotiation and appeasement of the Salisbury regime was turned on its head over the following two years, thanks in no small part to pressure from the Commonwealth. The Singapore Declaration, issued at the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, articulated the political principles of the Commonwealth, including the elimination of racial discrimination. With the incorporation of this implicit commitment to opposing Rhodesia into the Commonwealth's aims, and the increasingly disparity of British economic interests in Africa, the UK chose the Commonwealth over Rhodesia.
Beginning of the end.
The hardening of the United Kingdom's line came as part of a wave of bad news for the Rhodesian regime. The Carnation Revolution in Portugal led to the end of Portuguese assistance from Mozambique, and, in its place, put an independent Mozambique with a left-wing government, which was eager to aid guerillas from Rhodesia. South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster attempted "détente" with the newly independent Angolan and Mozambican governments, and, believing a stable majority-governed country to be in South Africa's interests, persuaded Ian Smith that white minority rule could not continue forever in Rhodesia.
All this brought Rhodesia to the negotiating table with moderate African leaders, leading to the Internal Settlement under which Rhodesia became Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Commonwealth flatly refused to recognise Rhodesia-Zimbabwe, and did not lift its sanctions. At the 1979 CHOGM, the Heads of Government issued the Lusaka Declaration, once again committing itself to ending racial discrimination. The official communiqué of the meeting invited Rhodesia-Zimbabwe's new Prime Minister Abel Muzorewa and Ian Smith to a constitutional convention with the leading guerilla leaders, giving rise to the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979.
Ceasefire and independence.
The agreement demanded a ceasefire, reverted Rhodesia back into the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, with full control from London, and paved the way for an election in 1980. To implement the Lancaster House Agreement, at the behest of Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal and Kenneth Kaunda (and in the face of opposition from Lord Carrington), the Commonwealth created the Commonwealth Monitoring Force (CMF). This included 1,097 Britons, as well as representatives of Australia, Canada, Fiji, Kenya, and New Zealand, totalling 1,548 service personnel. They organised ceasefire assembly places, at which guerillas could disarm and reintegrate into their communities in time for the election. Observers expected the operation to fail, as the composition and swiftness of deployment seemed to fly in the face of convention wisdom. Nonetheless, it succeeded in maintaining peace, demilitarising the militia and guerillas, and presiding over a peaceful election that election observers deemed free and fair.
The resounding victory of Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF in March 1980 led to Southern Rhodesia's independence as the Republic of Zimbabwe later that year. Upon independence, Zimbabwe joined the Commonwealth: five decades after Southern Rhodesia's government had mistakenly believed that it had in the wake of its invitation to the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference. The end of the Rhodesian crisis was a victory for Commonwealth principles, and their application to the policies of a member: in this case, the United Kingdom itself. Shridath Ramphal played a vital role in the affair, whilst it was the 1979 Commonwealth Head of Government Meeting that played host to the deliberations and resolutions of the crisis, and a Commonwealth military force that kept the peace.
For its part, Mozambique was recognised as a 'cousin state' of the Commonwealth, and was rewarded for its opposition to the Rhodesian regime with accession to the Commonwealth in 1995: becoming the only member without direct constitutional links to another.
Zimbabwe under Mugabe.
Zimbabwe and the Harare Declaration.
In recent times, Zimbabwe has dominated the agendas of most Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGMs). President Robert Mugabe's government is accused of abusing human rights, rigging elections, undermining the Zimbabwean economy. The matters his Government is accused of contravene the basic principles of the Commonwealth, as outlined in the Harare Declaration, issued at the 1991 CHOGM in (ironically enough) Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
After the Zimbabwean people rejected Mugabe's proposed new constitution in a February 2000 referendum, the situation deteriorated rapidly, as violence against opponents increased. To address these issues, in September 2001, Zimbabwe sent a delegation to meet with the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which is responsible for upholding the Harare Declaration. Zimbabwe promised to end the violence and defend human rights, as required of them as Commonwealth members, but failed to do so. As a result, the United Kingdom pushed to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. This has been characterised by Mugabe, and South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a neo-colonial campaign, but this is derided as ungrounded revionism and racist itself.
Initial 12 month suspension.
The 2002 CHOGM was delayed in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, but Zimbabwe was still top of the agenda. 
On 4 March 2002 the CHOGM statement issued at Coolum, Australia implicitly rejected calls by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for punitive action to be taken against Zimbabwe for alleged violence and intimidation surrounding the Presidential Election Campaign. CHOGM, instead, "expressed their deep concern", and called on all parties to work together "to create an atmosphere in which there could be a free and fair election". CHOGM also “noted that a Commonwealth Observer Group would report to the Commonwealth Secretary-General immediately after the Zimbabwe presidential election of 9–10 March 2002” and confirmed their agreement to:
Shortly after the presidential election had concluded, the Report of the Commonwealth Observer Group was submitted to the Troika. Even the Government of Zimbabwe concedes that its conclusions were “adverse”. On 19 March 2002 the Troika, being the competent Commonwealth body, suspended Zimbabwe for a 12 month period. The Zimbabwe government disputes that there were legitimate grounds for its suspension. Zimbabwe considers that the CHOGM statement only permitted the Troika to go beyond an expression of collective disapproval if something adverse was reported on in the Commonwealth Observer Group Report pertaining to the period after the CHOGM statement issued and ending at the time when the voting in the election ended (7 days in total). The Zimbabwe government considers that although adverse findings were contained in the Report, none of them related to that period and therefore the Troika did not have competence to suspend it from the Commonwealth.
Purported further suspension.
Unlike all other previous Commonwealth country suspensions, Zimbabwe’s was for a definite period of 12 months. In the case of a suspension for a finite period there is no need for such a suspension to be lifted. It automatically lapses unless it is renewed or extended. The Zimbabwe Government and the Southern Africa Development Community contend that this therefore meant that in the absence of a renewal or extension, Zimbabwe's suspension by the Troika would automatically lapse on 19 March 2003. A split emerged in the Troika. Australia was in favour of a further suspension. South Africa and Nigeria (i.e. the majority of the Troika) were not. Indeed, the Zimbabwe Government points to the letter dated 10 February 2003 from the President of Nigeria to the Prime Minister of Australia in which he stated “that the time is now auspicious to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe with regard to her suspension from the Commonwealth Councils.” According to the Zimbabwe Government, the President of South Africa also contacted the Prime Minister of Australia to convey the same message.
Notwithstanding that there had been no Troika decision, on 12 February 2003, the Prime Minister of Australia and the Secretary General of the Commonwealth announced that Zimbabwe would remain suspended until the next CHOGM in December 2003. This “purported” further suspension was disputed by the other members of the Troika and Zimbabwe for the reasons described abvoe. Moreover, the Southern African Development Community formally confirmed its position that Zimbabwe’s one-year suspension had lapsed on 19 March 2003. This was reaffirmed at a meeting of the troika of the SADC Organ for Politics, Defence and Security — namely Lesotho (chair), Mozambique and South Africa, with Zimbabwe invited — in Pretoria in late November 2003.
Final suspension and Zimbabwe’s withdrawal.
Failing to get Mugabe to meet with the opposition MDC Morgan Tsvangirai, Chairperson-to-be Obasanjo refused to invite Mugabe to the CHOGM.
The rest of the CHOGM's deliberations on Zimbabwe were marked by the same African disunity, foiling Mbeki's repeated attempts to have Zimbabwe readmitted. Ultimately he CHOGM rejected the Mbeki led minority group and implicitly rejected the views of the majority of the Troika that Zimbabwe’s suspension had already terminated. Instead, the CHOGM statement (tabled by Canada and Kenya) treated Zimbabwe as a country that was still suspended and determined to continue its suspension for an indefinite period, appointing a six-member panel to advise on the way forward. The committee, composed of the Heads of Government of South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, Jamaica, Australia, and Canada, ruled by six-to-one (South Africa being the one) against lifting Zimbabwe's suspension.
Following the CHOGM, the SADC (supported by Uganda) issued a statement in which it expressed deep concern at what it called the ‘dismissive, intolerant and rigid attitude’ shown by some Commonwealth members toward Zimbabwe. SADC has consistently pleaded for greater patience and understanding of Zimbabwe, and cautioned against lecturing and hectoring. 
A separate and not directly related matter at the CHOGM was an attempt by Mbeki to oust Secretary-General Don McKinnon, who was up for election but whom convention dictated should not be challenged. However, only seven (of eighteen) African Heads of Government voted for Mbeki's candidate (along with the four South Asian countries), Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar, allowing McKinnon to win by 40 votes to 11.
Zimbabwe withdraws and reaction.
In an official letter to the Commonwealth Secretariat dated 11 December 2003, Zimbabwe formally terminated with effect from 7 December 2003 its membership of the Commonwealth. This confirmed President Mugabe’s decision to leave the organisation following the CHOGM statement issued in Nigeria, which indefinitely suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. On 19 November 2003, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe made a detailed statement on the whole affair to the Parliament of Zimbabwe.
The withdrawal marked only the third occasion (after South Africa in 1961 and Pakistan in 1971) that a country had withdrawn voluntarily, although Ireland had voluntarily declared itself a republic in 1949 thereby ending its membership.
Since Zimbabwe's Withdrawal.
British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary David Miliband and outgoing Secretary-General Don McKinnon both expressed their approval of Zimbabwe's return to the Commonwealth if the country resolved its infringements of the Harare Declaration, especially under a new government. Mugabe has stated that Zimbabwe would never rejoin the Commonwealth, calling it an 'evil organisation'. Before the 2008 parliamentary election, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, whose party won the vote, announced that, under his leadership, Zimbabwe would seek a return to the Commonwealth. It has been compared to South Africa's withdrawal in 1961, on the occasion of which Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker said that there would always be a 'candle in the window' until South Africa returned: the reentry of Zimbabwe would vindicate the Commonwealth's moral commitment to the Zimbabwean people and its principles.
OLD Suspension.
The 2002 CHOGM was delayed in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, but Zimbabwe was still top of the agenda. In January 2002, three members of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group – led by the UK – attended to have Zimbabwe suspended, but could not muster the requisite five (of eight) members to impose the sanction. The CMAG decided to leave the deliberations over Zimbabwe's future in the Commonwealth until after the upcoming presidential election.
The Commonwealth would send the only fully multi-national observer group to Zimbabwe, to report on whether the elections were free and fair. The CHOGM in March appointed the "troika" of Chairperson-in-Office John Howard and his predecessor (Thabo Mbeki) and successor (Olusegun Obasanjo) to assess whether Zimbabwe had breached the Harare principles, and the punishment to be imposed if it did. The report assessed that the elections had not been free or fair, and had been rife with intimidation and fraud. As a result, the troika announced on 19 March that Zimbabwe was to be suspended from the Commonwealth until the 2003 CHOGM with immediate effect. Failing to get Mugabe to meet with the opposition MDC Morgan Tsvangirai, Chairperson-to-be Obasanjo refused to invite Mugabe to the CHOGM. At the CHOGM, Mbeki attempted to oust Secretary-General Don McKinnon, who was up for election but whom convention dictated should not be challenged. However, only seven (of eighteen) African Heads of Government voted for Mbeki's candidate (along with the four South Asian countries), Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar, allowing McKinnon to win by 40 votes to 11.
The rest of the CHOGM's deliberations on Zimbabwe were marked by the same African disunity, foiling Mbeki's repeated attempts to have Zimbabwe readmitted. To resolve the impasse, Canada and Kenya proposed a committee to resolve the issue of whether to lift Zimbabwe's suspension. The committee, composed of the Heads of Government of South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, Jamaica, Australia, and Canada, ruled by six-to-one (South Africa being the one) against lifting Zimbabwe's suspension. In response, Robert Mugabe announced on 7 December that Zimbabwe was withdrawing from the Commonwealth: marking only the third occasion (after South Africa in 1961 and Pakistan in 1971) that a country had withdrawn voluntarily.
British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary David Miliband and outgoing Secretary-General Don McKinnon both expressed their approval of Zimbabwe's return to the Commonwealth if the country resolved its infringements of the Harare Declaration, especially under a new government.

History.
The town gained municipality status jurisdicción municipal in 1850 while Juan N. Alvarez was in power. The municipality was originally named San Luis Allende but was changed to the current name in 1883. In 1944, it became the seat of the District of Altamirano. It borders the municipalities of Zapotitlán Tablas, Tecoanapa, Malinaltepec Metlatonoc, Azoyú, Igualapa, Cuautepec, and Ayutla de los Libres.

Michael Posner (lawyer)

Michael H. Posner (born November 19, 1950) is an American lawyer, the Founding Executive Director and later the President of Human Rights First (formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), the former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) of the United States, and currently a Professor of Business and Society at New York University Stern School of Business.
Early years.
Posner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received a B.A. from the University of Michigan. He received his J.D. from the University of California, Berkeley Law School (Boalt Hall). He is a member of the California Bar (inactive) and the Illinois Bar. After graduating, Posner spent a year documenting atrocities committed in Uganda. His work in Geneva for the United Nations earned him esteem as a human-rights advocate.
Human Rights First.
In 1978, Posner was recruited by Jerome Shestack and James Silkenat to become the founding executive director of the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights, a non-profit, nonpartisan international human rights organization with offices in New York and Washington, D.C. that works on a range of domestic and international human rights issues. He focused on refugee protection, advancing a rights-based approach to national security and combating discrimination. The organization was renamed to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and, in 2003, renamed again to Human Rights First. In his role, Posner built the organization from a staff of two, a few volunteers and a budget of $55,000 to its current staff of 60 and an annual budget of almost $9 million.
Torture Victim Protection Act.
Posner has also focused efforts to strengthen systems of accountability in countries where human rights violations occur, especially for crimes like torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. He proposed, drafted, and campaigned for the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), which was adopted by Congress and signed into law in 1992.
WITNESS.
Also in 1992, Posner helped musician/activist Peter Gabriel found Witness (human rights group), an organization that uses video and online technologies to shed light on human rights violations around the world. In its first few years, WITNESS was based at Human Rights First. WITNESS has since received numerous awards for their work including, the National Academy of TV Arts & Sciences Humanitarian Award and the "New York Times" Company Nonprofit Excellence award 
Role in the International Justice System and the International Criminal Court (ICC).
In 1998, Posner led the Human Rights First delegation to the Rome conference at which the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted.
McCain Amendment / End Torture Now Campaign.
Human Rights First launched its End Torture Now Campaign in 2004. Michael Posner and Human Rights First led the advocacy efforts in support of the McCain Amendment which bans U.S. soldiers and officials from engaging in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The amendment won broad bipartisan congressional support and was signed into law in December 2005.
Academic career.
Posner lectured at Yale Law School from 1981 to 1984, and again in 2009, and at Columbia Law School between 1984 - 2008.
Other organizations.
As a member of the White House Apparel Industry Partnership Task Force, Posner helped found the Fair Labor Association (FLA) in 1997, a multi-stakeholder initiative between apparel and footwear companies, universities and non-governmental organizations aimed at protecting the rights of workers in the apparel industry’s global supply chain. He sat on the FLA’s board of directors until 2009. Beginning in 2006, Posner worked on another multi-stakeholder initiative called the Global Network Initiative (GNI), which was launched in October 2008. He also served on the board of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights until 2009.
Human rights advocacy.
Posner has testified dozens of times before the U.S. Congress on a wide range of human rights topics including the protection of refugees, anti-Semitism, and human rights violations in the Philippines, Northern Ireland, El Salvador and many other countries. He is a frequent public commentator on these and other issues, regularly speaking at conferences and events in the United States and abroad. His opinion essays have appeared in publications including the "Boston Globe", "Jerusalem Post" "Washington Post", and "International Herald Tribune".
Obama administration.
On July 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Posner to serve in the State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. He was named to the position on September 23, 2009.
Confirmation.
In his statement as the nominee for Assistant Secretary of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 28, 2009, Posner affirmed that "[s}ince the late 1970s, I often have looked to the U.S. government as a key ally in the struggle to protect human rights around the world. As a non-governmental advocate, I have witnessed and often benefited from the incredible power and moral authority of the United States to lead on these important but often complicated issues. The U.S. government's potential to provide leadership on human rights democracy and the rule of law is part of what Secretary Clinton has referred to as the smart power".
Posner later recalled the personal lessons of the Holocaust that helped shape his vocation as a human rights advocate. Posner was raised with a consciousness of the horrors of the Holocaust and "internalized two important lessons. The first is that governments that fall into the hands of dictators and demagogues are capable of unspeakable brutality and horror. The second, more hopeful lesson is that courageous people can and often do stand up to oppression and it is our duty to help them".
During his testimony, Posner gave a brief synopsis of his previous involvement with the U.S. government in their mutual effort to promote and protect human rights. His first appearance before the Senate was in 1978 when Posner testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the trade sanctions against Idi Amin's Uganda. Posner commented that "this was the first of many instances where I have seen and been part of efforts to harness the political, diplomatic and economic power of the United States Government as a force for good". Congress passed a total ban on trade with Uganda and the people regained control of their country within the year. He went on to describe other shared successes including "the work we did with Andrei Sakharov and other dissidents in the former Soviet Union, especially through the Helsinki process. I experienced it in the 1980s when President Reagan stood behind Philippine "people's power" and ensured a successful transition of power from Marcos to Aquino. I saw it in Northern Ireland where George Mitchell and the Clinton Administration provided a roadmap for peace through the Good Friday Agreement. And I witnessed it as the Bush Administration, working closely with Congressional leaders like Senators Cardin and Voinovich and Congressman Chris Smith, took a leading role in challenging European anti-Semitism and other racial and religious persecution through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe".
Posner closed with an affirmation that "he promotion of democracy and human rights here, and around the world, helps define us – and who we are as a people".
Posner's confirmation by the 111th Congress was welcomed by the international human rights community. Amnesty International USA Executive Director Larry Cox issued the following statement: 
“Michael has been a brilliant advocate on behalf of protecting the rights and dignity of people the world over. At this time of great opportunity to advance the rights of those whose freedoms are denied, it is invaluable to have an advocate of Michael’s accomplishment in this role”, said Cox. “Amnesty International looks forward to continuing to work with now-Secretary Posner on crucial issues concerning the global protection of human rights for all people”.
At his Swearing-in Ceremony at the State Department, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton commented that "as soon as confirmation was completed, literally, he was on a plane, going to lead the first ever U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Council. Our team there under Mike’s leadership not only made significant progress on women’s rights and human security issues, but co-sponsored a successful resolution with Egypt upholding freedom of expression and freedom of religion. And Mike went on to Warsaw to present the Obama Administration’s proposal for advancing the “Human Dimension” of the Helsinki process. I think I only talked to him two times during that period, because I had great confidence that he would indeed be successful as we rejoined the Human Rights Council and it exceeded our expectations".
U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue.
In May 2010, Posner was a key negotiator in a "U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue" in Washington, D.C. On May 14, Posner gave the press conference after the event, where he described the U.S. approach to the meeting as, "Part of a mature relationship is that you have an open discussion where you not only raise the other guy’s problems, but you raise your own." To that end, he said the American side had brought up the United States' "treatment of Muslim Americans", as well as Arizona's recently passed Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, which Posner said had been brought up "early and often", "as a troubling trend in our society".
Posner's comments proved controversial in the United States. Arizona's two senators, Republicans Jon Kyl and John McCain, wrote an open letter to Posner that stated, "To compare in any way the lawful and democratic act of the government of the state of Arizona with the arbitrary abuses of the unelected Chinese Communist Party is inappropriate and offensive", and called for a retraction and apology. The conservative "New York Post" called the comments "misguided moral equivalence" and "despicable", citing China's treatment of its own Muslim population, the Uyghurs, as well as its policy of sending back refugees who arrive from North Korea, "where certain, agonizing death awaits them".
The State Department defended Posner's actions. Spokesman P. J. Crowley disputed the notion Posner was apologizing to China when he was actually "standing up" for America by demonstrating how debate works in a "civil society". Crowley also reiterated the Obama administration's concerns about the Arizona law, stating, "There is, as many have said, real concerns about -- that this Arizona law will inevitably devolve into racial profiling. That would be a fundamental challenge to human rights around the world".
Internet freedom.
As Assistant Secretary of State, Posner has played a leading role in implementing Secretary Clinton’s vision for Internet freedom. Posner frequently speaks on the topic of Internet freedom and the role of the Internet in advancing human rights and helping people build sustainable democracies.
Under Posner’s leadership, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has played a leading role in supporting democratic activists in their use of new technologies, particularly in the Middle East. Posner led efforts described as “uncharacteristically cool” to fund millions of dollars in technology development meant to aid pro-democracy activists around the world. Digital activists commended Posner’s bureau in this approach in an open letter to Congress in March 2011, saying, “The State Department, and particularly the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), has taken significant interest in supporting technologies that enhance Internet freedom, and reached out to leading organizations in a collaborative and open approach".
Strategic Dialogues.
Posner has participated in more than a dozen strategic dialogues since joining the State Department. Both Secretary Clinton and Posner have placed great emphasis on building partnerships beyond the state, and giving civil society a stronger voice in shaping the political decision-making process. In her July 2010 speech in Kraków, Poland, Secretary Clinton said, “markets and politics usually receive more attention. But civil society is every bit as important. And it undergirds both democratic governance and broad-based prosperity”. In February 2010, Posner and Secretary Clinton launched a Strategic Dialogue with Civil Society, an endeavor to help streamline and strengthen dialogue with non-governmental organizations and other members of civil society. Clinton and Posner engaged in a town hall style discussion with over fifty civil society representatives, domestically and internationally.
In the summer of 2010, Posner participated in the U.S.-Russia Civil Society Working Group of the Bilateral Commission, which focused on prisons and migration, as well as the Civil Society to Civil Society Summit, where Secretary Clinton told participants “we need creative, committed, courageous organizations like you and yours to find innovative solutions, to expose corruption, to give voice to the voiceless, to hold governments accountable to their citizens, to keep people informed and engaged on the issues that matter most to them”.
Economic and social rights.
Posner has been a vocal proponent of the Obama Administration’s integrated approach to human rights and the inexorable relationship between national security and economic, social, and political rights. On March 24, Posner delivered a keynote address, “The Four Freedoms Turn 70: Ensuring Economic, Political, and National Security in the 21st Century”, at the American Society of International Law. The speech took place on the anniversary of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous Four Freedom speech. Posner’s speech re-examined the Four Freedoms, or “moral cornerstones”, and discussed the important intersection between political and economic rights, which he said are “inexorably linked”. According to Posner, “Human dignity has a political component and an economic component”. Posner highlighted the turmoil in the Middle East as evidence that the shaping of U.S. national security must include the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that only if the two are interlinked will peaceful societies flourish economically, socially, and politically. The unrest in the Middle East, according to Posner, “once again demonstrates the fallacy of trying to divide America’s “hard” strategic interests from our “soft” interests, including our commitment to human rights”. Posner stated, “The recent protests demonstrate the centrality of human rights to those interests and the links among civil, political, economic and social rights”.
Voluntary Principles.
Since March 2010, Posner has been involved in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Established in 2000 (the United States is a founding member), the Voluntary Principles—an initiative by governments, NGOs, and companies—provides guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the safety and security of their operations within a framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Voluntary Principles are the only human rights guidelines designed specifically for oil, gas, and mining companies. On March 22 and 23, 2011, Posner chaired the 11th annual Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Plenary Meeting in Washington, a multi-stakeholder forum where human rights issues in the extractives sector, particularly in areas of conflict and civil strife, were addressed. Posner also participated in the Annual Plenary Meeting in London in March 2010 and in Ottawa in March 2012. Later in May and November 2012, Posner travelled to Libya and Nigeria respectively to conduct multi-stakeholder meetings regarding implementation of the VPs. Currently there are seven governments, 20 companies, 12 NGOs, and four observers participating in the Voluntary Principles.
Human Rights Reports.
Posner has been actively engaged in reporting on global human rights situations through the State Department’s annual Human Rights Reports, which are submitted to Congress by the Department of State in compliance with Sections 116(d) and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended. The report offers a comprehensive record of human rights situations of almost 200 countries and territories worldwide, and uses information from nongovernmental and international organizations, U.S. embassies and consulates, and other sources. At the 2010 Human Rights Report roll-out in April 2011, Posner called it “the single most comprehensive report on human rights produced by anybody in the world—194 countries, 2,200,000 words, 7,000 pages”. That year's report was viewed by more than one million people.
Posner highlighted three trends identified in the 2010 report:
The following year, at the rollout of the 2011 Human Rights report, Posner emphasized two worrying trends:
The 2011 report was designed to be more concise, focused and user-friendly.
Universal Periodic Review.
Posner has been a proponent of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established by the UN General Assembly in 2006 as a process through which the human rights records of the United Nations’ 193 Member States is reviewed and assessed. In November 2010, Posner traveled to Geneva as one of three co-heads of the 32-person interagency U.S. government delegation submitting the United States’ first report through the UPR to the UN Human Rights Council. Speaking of the UPR at a press conference at the Foreign Press Center in April 2011, Posner stated, “We are very open to the notion that people in this country have not only a right but are well open to be critical of what we do, and we engage them in that criticism”. During the week of the UPR hearing, Posner defended the United States' engagement with the UN Human Rights Council against domestic criticism, saying "this is what principled engagement looks like". He reiterated the Obama administration's stance that there was no room for torture or cruel treatment of detainees in U.S. policy: "We're not mincing words. We're not winking and nodding", he said. "The prohibition against torture and cruel treatment applies to every U.S. official, every agency, everywhere in the world. There is an absolute prohibition as a matter of law and policy".
International Religious Freedom.
Since being sworn in as Assistant Secretary, Posner has engaged on a number of fronts promoting religious freedom, particularly in the Middle East and South Central Asia. Following the release of the 2009 International Religious Freedom Report, Posner discussed religious freedom issues in the Middle East before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. Said Posner, “Religion is a global phenomenon and all nations, including the United States, wrestle with how best to accommodate their religious diversity. We are convinced that the freedom to profess, practice, and promote one’s religion is a basic human right, a social good, a source of stability, and a key component of international security”. Posner has engaged on international religious freedom issues in meetings with Egyptian Coptic Christians, Chinese religious freedom advocates, Vietnamese, Pakistani, and Afghan officials, and others since being sworn in as Assistant Secretary.
Honorary degrees and awards.
Posner has received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, the University of Hartford and the College of the Holy Cross. He is also the recipient of the Fellows Award for distinguished service, Young Lawyers of the American Bar Association (1990); the Distinguished Service Award, Boalt Hall Alumni Association (1993); the Wolfgang Friedmann Memorial Award for outstanding contributions to the field of international law, Columbia University "Journal of Transnational Law" (1993); the Dr. Jean Mayer Global Citizenship Award, Institute for Global Leadership at Tufts University (2006); and the Builders of the "New" New York Award, New York Immigration Coalition (2007).

<doc id="20818099" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20818099" title="The Kestrels">
The Kestrels

The Kestrels were a vocal harmony quartet from Bristol, England, most notable as the group through which the songwriting team of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway first met and started composing jointly. They were one of the busiest vocal groups in England during the late 1950s and early 1960s, singing back-up behind Joe Brown, Billy Fury, Eden Kane, and Benny Hill, amongst others, and made dozens of television appearances between 1958 and 1964.
Career.
The quartet's origins were in the mid-1950s, when they were in their early teens at school together. Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway, and Roger Maggs' earliest influences were skiffle and rock and roll, and they began getting booked to play local dances. The trio expanded to a quartet with the addition to Geoff Williams, who extended their harmonies upward into the falsetto range. They quickly started to focus on singing and became established as a harmony vocal group. Their main influences were American rhythm and blues harmony groups such as The Platters and The Penguins, whom they did their best to emulate vocally.
The group members went through the Army at the same time, continuing to work together whenever possible, and it was during this period that they got their name. They initially started working together as the Beltones and the Hi-Fi's, but their manager, taking his lead from the manufacturer of the pencil he had in his hand at the time, decreed that they should become The Kestrels. It also fit in with an American tradition of harmony vocal groups that were named after birds (the Crows, the Penguins etc).
The Kestrels' debut single for Pye Records, "In The Chapel In The Moonlight," originally released as the B-side of their cover of Jack Scott's "There Comes A Time," came close to charting in late 1959.
The group bounced briefly over to Decca before returning to Pye Records, and a long-term contract to record for that label's Piccadilly imprint. Their subsequent releases failed to chart, but they remained busy on their own performances and also backing Pye's resident star, Lonnie Donegan, on some of his records (including the 1962 gospel album "Sing Hallelujah") and his live performances. The Kestrels finished their military service early in 1960, and were able to resume their music work full-time. They carried on, trying several different approaches to choosing their songs, but mostly covering American hits. In 1964, Pete Gullane left and was replaced by Roger Cook.
In 1998, Sequel Records brought out a double album pairing thirty songs by The Kestrels, with thirty songs from fellow Bristolian group The Eagles.
They had a reunion in 1997, and over the subsequent years have raised substantial funds for charity. In 2009 they released a charity CD (produced by Greenaway) entitled "The Kestrels, Still Flying After 50 Years".
Geoff Williams, one of the original quartet, suffered a heart attack and died on 20 August 2010 aged 71, whilst on holiday in Crete.

Österreich 2 (abbreviated to Ö2; previously known as "Österreich-Regional", ÖR) is the name given to the regional radio service for Austria and South Tyrol, Italy, aired by the ORF public broadcasting corporation. It consists of nine stations serving the nine federal states respectively. All regional radio stations are also broadcast via satellite at 19.2° east.
Stations.
The Ö2 radio stations are:
Operation.
The nine regional stations broadcast a large amount of regional content and offer news, weather, traffic, regional reports and music, all produced in their own radion studio (one in each state).
In the last few years, the regional stations were transformed to format (Oldies) radio stations – their target audience being the group 35+, which makes them clear market leaders in reference to market share and coverage. The music played by these radio stations is mostly oldies, schlager and classic hits, although some regional radio stations, such as Radio Oberösterreich, also broadcast classical music, literature articles and free radio productions, similar to the nationwide Ö1 programme. One of the longest produced regional programmes was daily "Autofahrer unterwegs", ("drivers en route") with 15,153 episodes produced between 1957 and 1999. Due to its popularity, this program was broadcast by all stations throughout Austria.
Up until the 1990s, many Ö2 programmes were dominated by folksy pop music ("Volkstümliche Musik"), often derogatory called "housewives' radio". Just before private radio stations were allowed to broadcast in Austria, initially confined to one particular state, the music choices in some Ö2 radio stations became more internationalized. In turn, the new regional private radio stations tried to gain marketshare by focusing on a contemporary hit radio format, rather competing with nationwide ORF Hitradio Ö3 than with the Ö2 stations. Since the publicly funded Ö2 radio stations have considerable financial resources and more staff, it is easy for them to hold their market share, not only in radio, but also in the journalistic sector.
With the exception of world news coverage, all regional radio stations produce their own content 24 hours a day, with a lot of regional content. Regional news (generally broadcast every half hour), detailed journals ("Landesrundschau" etc.), reports and service elements ensure high listener loyalty. Music programming is chosen through based on many criteria and is mostly made up of oldies, classic hits and even traditional "Volksmusik". The balance between different genres varies between the stations; some concentrate on oldies, while others mainly play German schlager and folksy music. During the night, each radio station broadcasts its own non-stop music program, which is only interrupted for the news.
Up until the mid-1990s, all Ö2 radio stations had the same framing programme, which only got interrupted for a few hours for regional content. This collective radio was first called "Österreich Regional" but was changed during its later years to "Österreich 2". To expand its programme, the regional studios contributed their own programs, such as "Autofahrer unterwegs", "Turnier auf der Schallaburg" ("Tournament at the Schallaburg") and other formats. After the introduction of computers to radio broadcasting in the late 1990s, production costs were significantly reduced, which allowed the ORF to fully regionalize its radio. The name "Österreich 2" was eliminated completely, as all regional radio stations now carry the name of their state.

Renfrew Airport

Renfrew Airport was the former domestic airport serving the city of Glasgow until it was decommissioned in 1966.
It was located in the Newmains area of Renfrew, approximately 2 kilometres east of Abbotsinch Airfield which would eventually replace it. It consisted of a main terminal building and ancillary buildings, and a main runway which ran west south-west of the terminal.
Already in existence as a military facility during the First World War, it first handled scheduled flights in 1933 with the first regular destination being Campbeltown.
Despite the construction of a new terminal building in 1954 (with a parabola arch), it became evident that the airport was unable to cope with the increasing demands for domestic air travel in the 1960s. The final departure took place on 2 May 1966 - its destination being the new Glasgow Airport a few hundred metres away.
After the airport was closed, the runway became the first urban part of the M8 motorway. Opened in March 1968, it connected the new Glasgow Airport to Bishopton in the west and Glasgow city centre (via Hillington) in the east. The entire airport was demolished in 1978. A Tesco supermarket and Arkelston Primary School was built on the former terminal site which opened for business in March 1980, and the whole of the surrounding area is now covered with housing.
The only trace of the airport left is the Viscount Bar pub which was an ancillary building. It is situated opposite where the main terminal sat.
In fiction.
The airport features briefly in the second novel of a space opera series by Angus MacVicar, "Return to the Lost Planet." One of the characters is about to fly back from Scotland to Berlin, but the hero and his companion join him at the last minute on the bus from St. Enoch, Glasgow, to the airport, and persuade him to stay and help them.

Lu Gambino

Lucien Anthony "Lu" Gambino (September 21, 1923 – July 16, 2003) was an American football running back. He played college football for Indiana University, and after military service in the Second World War, the University of Maryland. While playing for Maryland, he set the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) season scoring high for 1947 with 16 touchdowns and 96 points and was named the 1948 Gator Bowl most valuable player. Gambino played professional football for two years with the Baltimore Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), an early competitor of the National Football League (NFL).
Early life.
Gambino was born in Berwyn, Illinois on September 21, 1923. He attended J.S. Morton High School in Cicero, Illinois, where he was a football and track & field standout. Gambino enrolled at Indiana University in 1941, and he played football for the Hoosiers on the freshman team in 1941 and on the varsity team in . That season, head coach Bo McMillin led Indiana to a 7–3 record, and the Hoosiers recorded six defensive shutouts and outscored their opponents 256 points to 79. At Indiana, Gambino played alongside consensus All-America back, and future Colts teammate, Billy Hillenbrand. Shortly thereafter, Gambino dropped out of school to join the United States Army Air Forces and serve during the Second World War.
College career.
Gambino was selected in the 1945 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears in the 26th round as the 271st overall pick. In 1946, he was discharged from the Army and enrolled at the University of Maryland. He considered Indiana to be a far superior football program and called Maryland a "cow school," but it was located relatively close to his mother, who was widowed and living alone in Baltimore. During the 1946 season, Gambino saw limited playing time for a mediocre Terrapins football team directed by head coach Clark Shaughnessy. The following year, head coach Jim Tatum was hired, and he engineered a reversal of the team's fortunes. Tatum took the mentorship of Gambino as a personal project and aimed to develop him into the team's featured back.
As a senior in 1947, Gambino set the NCAA season scoring high with 16 touchdowns for 96 points. In the fifth meeting against rival , Gambino scored three touchdowns to help Maryland take away its first victory of the series, 27–0. He also scored three touchdowns against and , and two against where he also passed for a third. During the season, Gambino rushed for a total of 904 yards on 125 attempts, and as of 2009, he was Maryland's third-leading rusher in terms of single-season yards per carry (7.23). He was also Maryland's season kickoff return leader, and returned seven kicks for 174 yards, an average of 24.85 yards.
Maryland finished the regular season 7–2–1 and secured the school's first-ever bowl game appearance. In the 1948 Gator Bowl against Georgia, he was honored as the Most Valuable Player. During the 20–20 tie, Gambino rushed to score all three of the Terrapins' touchdowns on one-, 24-, and 35-yard runs. He compiled 165 rushing yards, a school bowl rushing record that stood for 60 years until finally broken by Da'Rel Scott in the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl. In 1992, for his achievement as the bowl game's "first superb running back," Gambino was inducted into the Gator Bowl Hall of Fame.
At season's end, he was named a first-team All-Southern Conference player, an All-America Catholic player, and an Associated Press honorable mention All-American. The Touchdown Club awarded Gambino the Arch McDonald Trophy as the best player in the Washington, D.C. area. Prior to the start of the 1948 season, the Southern Conference ruled that his college eligibility was exhausted and that he would be unable to play another year of college football. Gambino called the decision "crooked" and asserted that the standing rules did not count returning veterans' pre-war playing career against their eligibility. Geary Eppley, a Maryland athletics official and member of the Southern Conference executive committee, filed a request for a special session to consider a rule change, but it failed to garner support from the two-thirds of the member schools required to call such a meeting.
Professional career.
As the issue of his college eligibility was playing out, Gambino was being courted by several professional football teams. The Chicago Bears of the NFL, which had drafted him during the war, still had a strong interest in him, as did the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who held Gambino's AAFC draft rights.
He played two seasons for the Colts from 1948 to 1949. During his first year, he saw action in nine games including one as a starter. On 54 carries, he rushed for a total of 194 yards and a touchdown. Gambino also recorded six receptions for 28 yards and made three kickoff returns for 57 yards. The following season, he played in ten games and started in six. He made 56 carries for 208 yards and ten receptions for 67 yards and a touchdown. At the time, Gambino was one of four Colts players who were bald. "The Baltimore Sun" published an article that explored the unusual occurrence and concluded that it had "nothing to do with wearing a helmet." In "When the Colts Belonged to Baltimore", author William Gildea described Gambino: "In street clothes he looked like Robert Mitchum—wide-brimmed hat, long overcoat, baggy but creased trousers, a cigarette between his fingers, a craggy smile. Yesteryear's running back."
Baltimore released him during the summer of 1950. In the winter, Gambino had knee surgery to correct a bone spur. He was then picked up by the New York Giants and placed on the reserve list in July 1951. His professional playing career, however, was ultimately cut short by his knee. Gambino married Vivian née Senese and lived in North Riverside, Illinois. He died of heart disease on July 16, 2003 at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois. Gambino was 79 years old.

Principle of deferred decision

Principle of Deferred Decisions is a technique used in analysis of randomized algorithms.
Definition.
A randomized algorithm makes a set of random choices. These random choices may be intricately related making it difficult to analyze it. In many of these cases "Principle of Deferred Decisions" is used. The idea behind the principle is that the entire set of random choices are not made in advance, but rather fixed only as they are revealed to the algorithm.
Applications.
The Clock Solitaire Game.
The principle is used to evaluate and determine the probability of "win" from a deck of cards. The idea is to let the random choices unfold, until the iteration ends at 52, where if the fourth card is drawn out of a group labeled "K", the game terminates.

Vorontsov Palace (Saint Petersburg)

The Vorontsov Palace () is a Baroque palace compound which occupies a large parcel of land wedged between Sadovaya Street and the Fontanka River in Saint Petersburg, Russia. 
The palace of 50 rooms was built at enormous expense by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli for Count Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, Empress Elizabeth's chancellor and maternal relative. The palace took 8 years to build, starting in 1749. After his niece Elizabeth fell from grace, Vorontsov was effectively exiled from the court and sold his main residence to the crown. 
Paul I of Russia gave it to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, of which he was Grand Master. Another Italian architect working in Russia, Giacomo Quarenghi, was then asked to modernise the palace. In 1798-1800, Quarenghi added a Catholic chapel to serve exiled French aristocrats who resided in the Russian capital at the turn of the 19th century. See Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller for details.
Since 1810 the Vorontsov Palace has housed a succession of exclusive military schools, including the famous Page Corps (1810-1918) and the Suvorov Military School (from 1955). The palace is screened from Sadovaya Street by an elaborate cast iron grille and is separated from the Fontanka Embankment by a large garden. The Chapel of the Order of Malta went through extensive restoration in 2003 and is currently used for organ recitals.

Radio Österreich International

Radio Österreich International (RÖI) (Austrian Radio International) was the international radio station, broadcast by the ORF. RÖI was launched in 1955 by order of the Federal Chancellery, to increase the presence of Austria in foreign countries. The radio station was broadcast world wide in shortwave on different frequencies. At the end of the 1990s, it was also receivable via the Astra Digital Radio. The station had its headquarters and transmitters in Moosbrunn, on the outskirts of Vienna.
Programming.
Many programs were broadcast in different languages, which all had a big regular listenership.
The most famous programs were the:
All current articles used in the news were made by the ORF national radios.
Retreat and end.
In the year 2000, the Federal Chancellery, under the cabinet Schüssel limited the budget of the radio, to shorten the amount of programs. Some foreign offices also had to be closed.
In the year 2002 the Federal Chancellery completely stopped the payment of the channel. The ORF tried to continue the radio itself, with a new concept. Many programs made by national radios were used to save money, for example those from Ö1, FM4 and Ö3. The regional Ö2 radios contributed with folk music.
At the end of 2003 the Board of Governors decided to – against the protest from many people and staff – discontinue the Radio Österreich International for financial reasons.
The transmitters and offices which were only completely modernized in 2000 are now rented to foreign radio stations.
Ö1 International.
Since Radio Österreich International was closed down, the ORF started to broadcast the program from Ö1 worldwide over shortwave, but in strongly reduced coverage and quality. Only one element from the old RÖI remained on the new Ö1 International: the "Report from Austria". It gets broadcast on Ö1 International to different times instead of the normal Ö1 program.
Other foreign language productions.
The national radios also have some foreign-language elements in their program.

History.
The Suriana region served as the site of crossing migrants, so presumably Tepecoacuilco was first inhabited by one of these primitive tribes, who came from the coast of Michoacán. Later, the Olmecs to the territory, and tribes settled on the Mezcal River, and numerous objects of Olmec style have been excavated from this region. 
Tribes settled in Tepecoacuilco in the first millennium of the current era, including one called Chontales which inhabited the Tepecoacuilco area. This tribe had its main seat in Ixcateopan, and formed a powerful dynasty in this area. The Chontales faithfully preserved their cultural characteristics, and achieved important progress in political and social organization. This government was in element patriarchal, each village was governed by a Lord or the Patriarch and priests in temples. Their main gods were the rain god Tlamacasqui and the goddess Acxoyatl. They lived in huts built of adobe with palm roofs. Men wore cloaks tied at the shoulder and loincloths, the women long petticoats. Their diet consisted of tortillas, corn, and vegetables. 
In the 11th century, invaders penetrated the territory, Nahua tribes, which came from the north-west. Some of them settled by the Balsas River, to conquer the region and the Chontales. In this tribe was known as the Nahua-coixca, which means "Plain of snake." The Coixcas arrived and were completely primitive, surviving by hunting, farming and living in caves. Their warrior god was Huitzilopochtli.

<doc id="20818429" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20818429" title="Micro Transport Protocol">
Micro Transport Protocol

Micro Transport Protocol or µTP (sometimes also uTP) is an open UDP-based variant of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol intended to mitigate poor latency and other congestion control issues found in conventional BitTorrent over TCP, while providing reliable, ordered delivery.
It was devised to automatically slow down the rate at which packets of data are transmitted between users of peer-to-peer file sharing torrents when it interferes with other applications. For example, the protocol should automatically allow the sharing of an ADSL line between a BitTorrent application and a web browser.
Development.
µTP emerged from research at Internet2 on QoS and high-performance bulk transport, was adapted for use as a background transport protocol by Plicto, that was founded by Stanislav Shalunov and later it was acquired by BitTorrent, Inc. in 2006, and further developed within its new owner. It was first introduced in the µTorrent 1.8.x beta branches, and publicized in the alpha builds of µTorrent 1.9.
The implementation of µTP used in µTorrent was later separated into the "libutp" library and published under the MIT license.
The first free software client to implement µTP was KTorrent 4.0. libtorrent implements µTP since version 0.16.0 and it's used in qBittorrent since 2.8.0. Tixati implements µTP since version 1.72. Vuze (formerly Azureus) implements µTP since version 4.5.0.5. Transmission implements µTP since version 2.30.
µTP congestion control.
The congestion control algorithm used by µTP, known as Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT), aims to decrease the latency caused by applications using the protocol while maximizing bandwidth when latency is not excessive. Additionally, information from the µTP congestion controller can be used to choose the transfer rate of TCP connections.
LEDBAT has been described in an Internet-Draft,
but the details of the µTP implementation are different from those of the draft.
µTP also adds support for NAT traversal using UDP hole punching between two port-restricted peers where a third unrestricted peer acts as a STUN server.

57 Division (Sri Lanka)

The 57 Division is a newly formed infantry division of the Sri Lanka Army. A principal offensive division it is currently deployed for combat operations in the Wanni region.
Formation.
With the start of Eelam War IV, a phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War, the Sri Lankan military launched an offensive to capture the Eastern Province from the LTTE. The Sri Lankan military had captured the Eastern Province from the LTTE by July 2007. Soon after this, the military's focus was shifted to the North, and a new offensive began to capture the Northern Province from the LTTE.
A new division named as the 57 Division had been created by the Sri Lanka Army on 26 February 2007. This was created as an offensive division, with the task of neutralising LTTE threats on civilian settlements in Vavuniya and Mannar. Three brigades comprised the 57 Division, named as 571, 572 and 573. The 571 Brigade was commanded by Colonel G.V. Ravipriya, while the 572 Brigade was commanded by Colonel Senerath Bandara. The 573 Brigade was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Prathap Thillekeratne. Participating in the northern offensive, the 57 Division under the command of Major General Jagath Dias, commenced operations in March 2007. It was deployed to advance on Kilinochchi along the western flank of the Wanni region.
A new brigade named as the 574 Brigade was added to the 57 Division in October 2008, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Senaka Wijesuriya. The command of the 572 Brigade was taken over by Lieutenant Colonel Dhammika Jayasundera during this time.
Sri Lankan Civil War.
Operations.
In late March 2008, the 57 Division was given the objective of capturing the Madhu church and surrounding areas by the Sinhala and Tamil new year in April. The 57 Division captured this area on 24 April 2008. After securing Madhu, Palampiddi became the next objective, which was captured on 17 May. After capturing the village of Mundumurippu in May and Periyamadhu in June, the 57 Division continued its advance into LTTE held territory and linked up with the 58 Division on 30 June 2008.
A new army division was created during the same time to hold the ground captured by the 57 Division. This new division, which was named the 61 Division, was given the task of holding the areas captured by the 57 Division up to Palampiddi, enabling the 57 Division to focus on the offensive.

American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky

The American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky was a pseudo-judicial process set up by American Trotskyists as a front organization following the first of the Moscow Trials. It had no powers of subpeona, nor official imprimatur from any government. It was composed of historians, sociologists, journalists, authors, and other notable figures, including Edmund Wilson, Suzanne La Follette, Louis Hacker, Norman Thomas, John Dos Passos, Reinhold Niebuhr, George Novack, Franz Boas, John Chamberlain and Sidney Hook. John Dewey, then seventy-eight years old, agreed to head its Commission of Inquiry.
History.
In March 1937, The American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky initiated the so-called Dewey Commission (officially the "Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials"). The inquiry was named after its Chairman, John Dewey. Its other members were Carleton Beals, an authority on Latin-American affairs; Otto Ruehle, biographer of Karl Marx and former member of the Reichstag; American journalists Benjamin Stolberg and Suzanne LaFollette (Secretary); Alfred Rosmer, who in 1920-21 had been a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International; Wendelin Thomas, leader of the Wilhelmshaven sailors’ revolt in November 1918 and later a Communist member of the German Reichstag; Edward A. Ross, Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin; former literary critic of "The New York Times" John Chamberlain, Carlo Tresca, Italian-American anarchist leader; and Mexican journalist Francisco Zamora.
A sub-commission, comprising the first five commission members listed above, conducted thirteen hearings at Trotsky's home in Coyoacan, Mexico, D.F., from April 10 to April 17, 1937. Leon Trotsky was defended by the lawyer Albert Goldman. John Finerty acted as the commission’s legal counsel.
During the course of the "trial", committee member Mauritz A. Hallgren, formerly an editor of "The Nation" magazine, made headlines with a public resignation from the committee published in the pages of the "New York Times." Hallgren charged that the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky had "become an instrument of the Trotskyists for political intervention against the Soviet Union." Hallgren's January 27, 1937 letter of resignation was later published as a 1-cent propaganda pamphlet by the Communist Party's International Publishers.
Albert Einstein, although noting that Trotsky deserved the opportunity to prove his innocence, was critical of the Dewey inquiry: "The question is raised because Trotsky is an extremely active and adroit politician, who might well search for an effective platform for the presentation and promulgation of his political goals in the public sphere. . . . I'm afraid that the only result would be Trotsky's own self-promotion without the possibility of a well-ground judgment."
Conclusions of the inquiry.
Following months of investigation, the Dewey Commission made its findings public in New York on September 21, 1937. The commission purported to clear Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials and, moreover, exposed the scale of the alleged frame-up of all other defendants during these trials.
Among its conclusions, it stated that "the conduct of the Moscow trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no effort was made to ascertain the truth.

Name.
Vikrče was attested in written sources in 1394 as "Weykers", and in 1436 as "Waikers". The name probably developed from the plural demonym "*vykъrčane" 'people living on cleared land', derived from the noun "*vykъrčь" 'cleared land'. A less likely possibility is that the name is derived from the Old High German personal name "Wîchart".

Hands on Tzedakah

Hands On Tzedakah is a 501 (c) 3 public charity headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. Founded in 2003, the organization provides funding for various social service programs in the United States, Israel and other countries.
Activities.
As of June 30, 2009, Hands On Tzedakah had raised and distributed over $5,000,000 to support more than 100 projects in the United States, in Israel, and in other parts of the world. These projects have provided services to more than 25,000 individuals.
HOT's primary focus is to support essential safety-net programs addressing hunger, poverty, health care and disaster relief. HOT assists programs providing support to the economically disadvantaged, disabled, elderly, and victims of abuse and terrorism. HOT also provides scholarship support to students in need.
One program which HOT administers in Israel is "Sandwiches for Schools" through Table to Table. In 2008, over 1700 sandwiches were provided every day to 29 schools in the center of Israel. Table to Table volunteers and partners meet every morning at 5 separate locations to prepare the lunch meal: a sandwich, paid for by Hands on Tzedakah, accompanied by fruit and vegetables "rescued" by Table to Table through its Project Leket, a produce harvesting initiative that has seen over 1,000,000 kilograms of fruits and vegetables "saved" over the last two years.
Sandwiches for Schools provides in 2009 over 3,000 sandwiches daily, and is the largest program of its kind in Israel. "Hands On Tzedakah" has been fighting hunger in Israel for the last 4 years, providing food packages to indigent family members of the Israeli Border Patrol, to poor families, to soup kitchens and to youth centers. "Expanding the initiative was important for our donors, so we approached Table to Table", says Ron Gallatin, co-founder of Hands on Tzedakah. Ronald Gallatin paraphrases a statement made by a friend: "You spend one third of your life learning, one third of your life earning and one third of your life returning." However, Gallatin says "My plan is a quarter, a quarter and a half."
HOT connects the donors with the recipients and facilitates communication between the donors and the projects. In addition, HOT listens to the donor, seeking out new initiatives that are important to him/her. Whenever possible, donor dollars are leveraged through matching funds from other donors and organizations.
The initial criteria for funding requires that the project or need meet the parameters of the mission statement. If a program meets these parameters then prior to any substantial program funding, HOT engages in a "Hands On" process by researching the program and obtaining and reviewing information on budgets and other financial information, including tax returns and accounting reports. Also, there is a belief that utilizing volunteers is essential.
In cases where funds are distributed to individual intermediaries who have developed programs that meet the criteria, HOT insists upon an on-going interaction with regular financial and operating reports to Hands On Tzedakah so that there is satisfaction that the funds allocated to them are used as intended.

Flag and pennant patterns

The flag and pennant patterns are commonly found patterns in the price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.). The patterns are characterized by a clear direction of the price trend, followed by a consolidation and rangebound movement, which is then followed by a resumption of the trend.
Flag pattern.
The flag pattern is encompassed by two parallel lines. These lines can be either flat or pointed in the opposite direction of the primary market trend. The pole is then formed by a line which represents the primary trend in the market. The pattern is seen as the market potentially just taking a “breather” after a big move before continuing its primary trend. The chart below illustrates.
Pennant pattern.
The pennant pattern is identical to the flag pattern in its setup and implications; the only difference is that the consolidation phase of a pennant pattern is characterized by converging trendlines rather than parallel trendlines. The image below illustrates.

Tomasz Kucharzewski (August 13, 1968 – March 8, 2008) was a Polish-Canadian martial artist. Kucharzewski initially gained fame while competitively fighting in Kyokushin kaikan and Shidōkan styles of karate. Even though he proved to be greatly successful in karate, winning numerous national and international titles, later in his career he became more involved with mixed martial arts and kickboxing.
Biography and career.
Born in the city of Częstochowa, Poland, Kucharzewski started training in karate at the age of 14. He had won three Polish national titles in Kyokushin kaikan style of karate and one European international title by the time he was 20 years old. He moved to Canada at age 23 in 1991 and settled in Windsor, Ontario from where he fought in an estimated 300 fights including five K-1 competitions. Kucharzewski was known by his contemporaries for his calm and friendly demeanor which led Albert Mady, his coach of 16 years, to describe him as "happy-go-lucky". During his run of five consecutive years from 1992 to 1996 of being crowned the International Shidōkan Champion, Tomasz Kucharzewski proved to be a dominating feature in the ring, enough so that the 35-year veteran karate teacher Roger Salick called him "indestructible" during Kucharzewski's run for his fourth straight title.
During the latter part of his life, Kucharzewski suffered a knee injury and was not as active in training and fighting anymore. He was found dead in his downtown Windsor apartment by family members on March 8, 2008. Although an autopsy was performed on him, the cause of death was not immediately known.
According to Monika Kucharzewski, Tomasz' younger sister, doctors said that his death could have been caused by cardiac arrhythmia.

The 2008 SunTrust Indy Challenge was the ninth round of the 2008 IndyCar Series season and took place on June 28, 2008 at the Richmond International Raceway, in Henrico County, Virginia. At the start, Ryan Hunter-Reay spun just before the start/finish line, which brought the yellow out immediately. The first 7 laps were run under yellow with Tony Kanaan leading from the pole position. On lap 8, the green came out, but only one lap was completed before the next yellow. Will Power was driving below Hélio Castroneves, lost control, and crashed in turn 4. The race finally got going on lap 21, when the green came out once again. On lap 31, A. J. Foyt IV touched wheels with John Andretti, and Foyt crashed in the wall in turn 2. His Vision Racing teammate Ed Carpenter ran over debris from the crash, and both cars were sidelined. During the caution, a handful of cars pitted, including Danica Patrick and rookie Jaime Camara, but most of the leaders stayed on the track.
Kanaan continued to lead when debris brought out the caution again on lap 67. All of the leaders pitted, while Camara and Patrick stayed out and took the first two spots. On the restart, Camara led the field, but Buddy Rice spun and tagged the wall on the frontstretch. The field checked up, and Darren Manning, Ryan Briscoe and Bruno Junqueira were involved in a separate crash. Camara led at the next restart, while Kanaan, Patrick, and Castroneves went 3-wide for second. Behind them in turn 2, John Andretti and Vitor Meira tangled, and crashed hard in the wall. Patrick returned to the pits, and topped off with fuel. Camara continued to lead, and impressively held off Kanaan on the restart. On lap 116, Marco Andretti caught up to Camara, and took the lead for the first time.
Graham Rahal crashed on lap 133 in turn 4. Many of the leaders pitted, but Marco Andretti stayed out to lead. Another restart saw only three green laps, as yet another crash occurred, this time involving Hunter-Reay and Mario Moraes. Around this time, some teams anticipated that rain might end the race early. Marco Andretti gave up the lead on lap 204 when he made his final pit stop. That put Kanaan back into the lead. On lap 217, after a brilliant run in the top five, Camara lost control and crashed on the frontstretch. The yellow trapped Andretti a lap down, and kept Kanaan in the lead after the final sequence of pits stops. The rain held off, and Kanaan led the rest of the way for his first victory of the season.

Since Radio Wien advanced to being a modern hit radio, Radio Niederösterreich was also able to position itself on the highly competitive Viennese radio market, next to Radio Arabella and Radio Burgenland. Looking at market shares, in Vienna Radio Wien is only 5% ahead of Radio Niederösterreich.
The ORF Niederösterreich Studio is located in Sankt Pölten, but has 4 little offices across the state, which are in Amstetten (Studio Mostviertel), Gmünd (Studio Waldviertel), Hollabrunn (Studio Weinviertel) and in Wiener Neustadt (Studio Industrieviertel). With this, all 4 state districts are covered and faster news coverages are possible.
In the ORF Niederösterreich Studio, the daily "Niederösterreich heute" news are also produced for TV, as well as other coverages for the TV channel ORF2.
Frequency.
Radio Niederösterreich is available in Lower Austria and Vienna, on the frequencies 91,5 MHz (Sankt Pölten 1-Jauerling 100 kW ERP) and 97,9 MHz (Wien 1-Kahlenberg 100 kW ERP).

Zbilje

Zbilje (in older sources also "Svilje", ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. The settlement includes the hamlets of Na Brodu near the bridge across Lake Zbilje and Žeje to the west, on the south side of Žeje Hill ().
Geography.
The settlement lies next Lake Zbilje (), a reservoir created in 1954 by building the Medvode hydroelectric power plant. The lake is a popular tourist site. Fields lie to the north and west of the settlement.
Name.
Zbilje was attested in written sources in 1311 as "Villach" (and as "Sbyliach" in 1341, "Willagk" in 1379, "Zwilach" in 1410, "Zwillach" in 1444, and "Swillach" in 1499). The origin of the name is uncertain. The medieval transcriptions of the name without initial "S-" or "Z-" indicate that it may have been created from the prepositional phrase "*z Biljan" (with a genitive form of the demonym "*Biljane", later yielding "-Bilje"). A second possibility is that the name is derived from the personal name "*Sъbylъ", preserved today in the Slovene surname "Sbil". A less likely possibility is that it was created from the personal name "*Bylъ" with the prefix "*sъ". In the 19th century the German name was "Swile".
History.
The settlement originally stood 1 km north of its present site, on the right side of the road to Podreča. At some point, the old settlement burned down, and the villagers moved to the current location, where they built their houses. When the fields are plowed at the old site, this occasionally turns up pieces of the old road that used to run through the village.
Church.
The local church in the settlement is dedicated to John the Baptist, built in 1883 on the site of an earlier church that was consecrated in 1496. The main altar dates to 1665. The painting of Saint Andrew on the right side of the altar is a work by Marko Layer, and the painting of Saint Valentine on the left side of the altar was painted by Matej Trpin in 1915. The church was formerly a pilgrimage church and was known as Saint John the Baptist in Lešovje ().

Mayor Guillén de Guzmán

Mayor Guillén de Guzmán (1205 – Alcocer, 1262), a member of one of the most aristocratic families in the court of King Ferdinand III of Castile, her parents were Guillén Pérez de Guzmán and his wife María González Girón, daughter of Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón and his first wife Sancha Rodríguez, and sister of Pedro Rodríguez de Guzmán, Castile's first adelantado and father of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán.
Biographical sketch.
Her name is registered in contemporary chronicles and documents for being the lover of prince Alfonso de Castilla, future king Alfonso X of Castile, son of Ferdinand III of Castile and Beatriz de Suabia. In 1255, Alfonso gave her lands in La Alcarria which included Cifuentes, Viana de Mondéjar, Palazuelos, Salmerón, Vadesliras and Alcocer. With the collaboration of King Alfonso, she founded the Monastery of Santa Clara de Alcocer in an unpopulated village called San Miguel del Monte within the jurisdiction of Alcocer. The foundational charter dated September 22, 1260 was confirmed by her brothers Pedro and Nuño Rodríguez de Guzmán.
Issue.
From her relationship with Infante Alfonso she had one daughter:
Death and burial.
She died in early 1262 and was buried in the monastery of the Poor Clares at San Miguel del Monte. Years later, on July 24, 1276, King Alfonso executed an agreement with Juan Gonçalves who made a walnut-wood sepulchre with a bas-relief image of Mayor. The parchment document was auctioned at Christie's in 2009.
The convent, as well as her sepulcher were moved to Alcocer years later. Her body, which remained intact until the beginning of the 21st-century, disappeared in 1936 along with a polychromatic sculpture considered among the best funerary art from the Middle Ages in Guadalajara.

Adorations

"Adorations" is Killing Joke's first single from their sixth studio album, "Brighter than a Thousand Suns". It was released in August, 1986.
"Adorations" was released as several version including remixes, and even on cassette. "Adorations (the Extended mix)" was featured as an A-side on a 12" vinyl, with the B-side of "Exile", and "Ecstasy (the Extended mix)". Both original versions of the songs were originally featured on the CD and cassette releases of "Brighter than a Thousand Suns". The single was released under E'G Records in the UK, Virgin Records in Spain, and Virgin Schallplatten GmbH in Germany. "Adorations (the Supernatural mix)" was also released on a 12" vinyl in the UK and featured "Love Like Blood (the '86 Remix)" and "Exile" as B-sides. The 7" vinyl single release feature "Adorations", a shortened, non-remixed, version of the original "Adorations" featured on their studio album, as an A-side, with "Exile" as its B-side. The single was released in the UK, France, and Spain. E'G Records also released a 7" limited edition double vinyl single exclusively in the UK, and featured the remix of "Adorations" as the A-side, "Exile" as the B-side, "Ecstasy" as the C-side, and "Adorations (instrumental mix)" as the D-side.

Throughout all the releases, "Adorations" was mixed by Julian Mendelsohn and Zeus B. Held, and produced by Chris Kimsey and Stewart Levine.
Reception.
"Adorations" was the first single to show the "new sound" that Killing Joke had produced. There was some appreciation - Kerrang! described "Adorations" as "a brilliant, uplifting slice of swooning synth romanticism, with Jaz Coleman in full croon. A guilty KJ pleasure if there ever was one." However, reviews were mixed at best. As described by Jaz Coleman in a 1991 interview with MTV pertaining to their eighth studio album, "Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions", "we went through hell." This was primarily because the members of Killing Joke did not agree on the material to write, and as a result, Paul Raven and Paul Ferguson were fired in 1988 by Coleman.

Hakeem Abdul-Shaheed

Hakeem Abdul-Shaheed, aka Midget Molley, born Robert Edward Molley on March 4, 1959, is an American convicted drug dealer and organized crime leader. Robert Molley acquired the nickname 'Midget' from his family, in reference to his short stature. He stands at 5'2".
Early life.
Robert "Midget" Molley was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey to Benjamin Franklin Molley, a Pentecostal pastor, and Helen Louise Molley. He was the ninth of twelve children. Midget Molley's father died of a brain tumor in 1969, obliging his mother to seek work in local hotels, away from the home where six of the Molley children still lived.
Around the age of seven, family members noticed that Robert was not growing at the normal rate as kids his age, thus they began joking that he would be a midget. The title stuck and Robert became known as Midget Molley.
At the age of ten Midget Molley acquired a reputation as a hustler, associating with local criminals whose shoes he shined. Midget Molley admired their stories of kingpins and gangsters like Nicky Barnes, whom he sought to emulate. At 14, he ran errands for a local drug dealer.
Around this same time Midget Molley became a member of the Nation of Islam, under the national leadership of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. He belonged to Temple #10, located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the Nation of Islam he was known as Brother Robert 8X.
In 1976 Molley changed his name to Hakeem Ali Abdul-Shaheed to reflect the path the Nation of Islam had taken after the death of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Attempted murder conviction.
In 1980 Abdul-Shaheed was arrested and charged with attempted murder. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and served six at State Prison before release.
Late 1980s.
Abdul-Shaheed was released and had returned to drug dealing by September 1986. He began trading cocaine supplied by Angel Diaz-Rivera and his wife Gloria, members of Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel of cocaine distributors. Abdul-Shaheed ran a three-member cocaine dealing operation with Victor "Shorty" Fernandez, a Dominican man, and Lucy "Luz" Bertone, a Puerto Rican woman. Each of the three received 600 kilos of cocaine per shipment. Bertone and Fernandez dealt in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, New York, while Abdul-Shaheed distributed his drugs in New Jersey, Syracuse, New York, Washington, DC, Maryland and Atlanta, Georgia.
Hakeem Abdul Shaheed (aka Robert E. Molley or Midget Molley), and most of its 60 some members were believed to be Five Percenters. Shaheed, a resident of Atlantic City and Vineland, called his group the ASO Posse and often flaunted his drug-financed wealth by wearing a gold crown.
On January 1, 1989, Abdul-Shaheed walked into Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino Ballroom wearing a paper Burger King crown and surrounded by 60 of his most trusted distributors.
1989 conviction.
In February 1989 Abdul-Shaheed and around 16 others were arrested after a seven-month investigation by the United States Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Abdul-Shaheed was suspected of two murders in Atlantic City, one in Syracuse, New York, two in Washington, DC, one in Maryland, and three in Atlanta, Georgia. He was convicted of none.
In 1990 Abdul-Shaheed was convicted of being a drug king pin and sentenced to 240 months in Federal prison under the 848 statute. The crown he had worn was never found, though federal agents have photographs of Abdul-Shaheed wearing it. Shortly after Shaheed’s arrest, several Jamaican drug dealers from Brooklyn Jamaican Posse moved into the Atlantic City projects to take over his territory.
The last eight months of Abdul-Shaheed's incarceration was spent on death row, where he was housed after being brutally tortured for two hours by a number of prison guards at the infamous United States Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois.
Nine guards and staff members of that prison were eventually removed from the USP Marion, which is notoriously known as the birthplace of Alcatraz.
In 2006 he was released, and now lives in Atlantic City.
Abdul-Shaheed now travels the country as a consultant, motivational speaker and advocate against abuse in American Prisons.
Abdul-Shaheed also heads a nonprofit organization called, THE D-BEAR YOUTH FOUNDATION, which deals with gangs & gang violence, drug use & sales, and teen sex.
Books.
In 2007 Ali Rob wrote a novel based on Abdul-Shaheed's life and times, "The Myth of Midget Molley". A later book, "Resurrection of A Legend", also explores Midget Molley's life.

Zgornje Pirniče

Zgornje Pirniče is a settlement in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
Zgornje Pirniče (literally, 'Upper Pirniče') and neighboring Spodnje Pirniče (literally, 'Lower Pirniče') were attested in written sources in 1392 as "Pernekk" (and as "Pernek" in 1394 and "utrumque Bernh" in an 18th-century copy of a document from 1118). The original form of the name may be reconstructed as the plural demonym "*Pyrьničane", ultimately derived from the common noun "*pyro" 'spelt', referring to a local cultivar and meaning 'people living where spelt is grown'. Another possibility is that the name developed from a plural demonym derived from the Old High German name "Ber(i)nhard" or the Middle High German name "Pern(a)hart".
Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.

<doc id="20819040" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20819040" title="Hashtag">
Hashtag

A hashtag is a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with the hash symbol ("codice_1"). It is a form of metadata tag. Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services such as Facebook, Google Plus, Instagram and Twitter may be tagged by putting "#" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g., "New artists announced for #SXSW2014MusicFestival ") or appended to it.
Hashtags make it possible to group such messages, since one can search for the hashtag and get the set of messages that contain it. A hashtag is only connected to a specific medium and can therefore not be linked and connected to pictures or messages from different platforms.
Origin.
The hash symbol was often used in information technology to highlight a special meaning. In 1970 for example, the hash symbol was used to denote "immediate" address mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used "#" in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor.
The hash symbol then appeared and was used within IRC networks to label groups and topics. Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an ampersand '&').
The use of the hash symbol in IRC inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network. He posted the first hashtag on Twitter: 
Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests, as both English- and Persian-language hashtags became useful for Twitter users inside and outside of Iran.
The first use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings," on 26 August 2007, according to lexicographer Ben Zimmer, chair of the American Dialect Society's New Words Committee.
Beginning July 2, 2009, Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced "Trending Topics" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular.
Style.
On microblogging or social networking sites, hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a post: before the body of a post, within the body of a post (usually as part of the body, as in "This is a #hashtag" or "This is #CamelCase") or after the body of a post as a postscript.
When creating a hashtag, proper etiquette is key. The misuse, or overuse, of hashtags can lead to permanent account suspensions, unfollowing, and/or upsetting the social media community. It is important to ensure hashtags directly relate to the topic being discussed. Although the use of hashtags is relatively new, social media sites, such as Twitter, have created rules for proper hashtag usage. The Twitter Rules state the following policies regarding hashtags:
The following behaviors and others like them could cause your account to be filtered from search, or even suspended:
-Adding one or more topic/hashtag to an unrelated tweet in an attempt to gain attention in search.
-Repeatedly tweeting the same topic/hashtag without adding value to the conversation in an attempt to get the topic trending/trending higher.
-Tweeting about each trending topic in turn in order to drive traffic to your profile, especially when mixed with advertising.
-Listing the trending topics in combination with a request to be followed.
-Tweeting about a trending topic and posting a misleading link to something unrelated.'” 
The quantity of hashtags used in a post or tweet is just as important as the type of hashtags used. It is currently considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Any contribution exceeding three hashtags is seen as the "absolute maximum, and and doing so risks “raising the ire of the community.'”
In response to the, often, misused and misunderstood usage of hashtags, Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake performed a spoof for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon which aired on September 24, 2013.
Function.
Hashtags are mostly used as unmoderated ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can "trend" and attract more individual users to discussion using the hashtag. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the "Trending Topics" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users, and neither can they be "retired" from public usage, meaning that hashtags can be used in theoretical perpetuity depending upon the longevity of the word or set of characters in a written language. They also do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes as espoused by those who make use of them.
Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using "#cakefestival" rather than simply "#cake". However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. In order for topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.
Hashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and "follow" (subscribe) or "list" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.
Hashtags can be used on the social network Instagram, by posting pictures and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags. Some because they are too generic like #photography #iPhone #iphoneography and therefore do not fulfil a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.
Hashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to actually categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. This can help express humor, excitement, sadness or other contextual cues, for example, "Just found out my mom is my health teacher. #awkward" or "It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm"
Use outside of social networking websites.
The feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on YouTube and Gawker Media; in the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments are used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees are not logged into the website. Real-time search aggregators such as the former Google Real-Time Search also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the "river" of Twitter posts which can result from search terms or hashtags.
Application.
Memes.
One phenomenon specific to the Twitter system are micro-memes, which are emergent topics for which a hashtag is created, used widely for a few days, then disappear. These hashtags also show up in a number of trending topics websites, including Twitter's own front page.
Definitions for some hashtags are available at hashtag.org. Other sites, such as hashable.com, have adopted the hashtag to use for other reasons.
Promotion.
The hashtag phenomenon has also been harvested for advertisement, promotion and contingency coordination. Most larger organizations will only focus on one or a small number of hashtags. However some individuals and organizations use a large number of hashtags to emphasise the broad range of concepts in which they are interested. The decision on whether to specialise in particular hashtags or promote a range depends on the marketing strategy of those involved.
Mass broadcast media.
Since 2010, television series on various television channels promote themselves through "branded" hashtag bugs. This is used as a means of promoting a backchannel of online side-discussion before, during and after an episode broadcast. Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement (for example, a motion picture trailer).
While personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames in order to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or "branded" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., #edshow as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style in order to "trend" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style in order to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. #SunnyFX) and instantaneous, "temporary" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts. Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the Nielsen television ratings system.
The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "keywords" by AOL in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of commercials and series episodes.
Purchasing.
Since February 2013 there is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and American Express that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express.
Event promotion.
Organized real-world events have also made use of hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants in order to find each other on both Twitter and, in many cases, in real life during events.
Companies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.
Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as #OccupyWallStreet and #LibyaFeb17, have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion.
Consumer complaints.
Hashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms in order to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term "bashtag" has been created to describe situations in which a corporate social media hashtag is used to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, McDonald's created the #McDStories hashtag so customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. The marketing effort was cancelled after just two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were expecting.
In popular culture.
During the April 2011 Canadian party leader debate, then-leader of the New Democratic Party Jack Layton referred to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's crime policies as "a hashtag fail" (presumably "#fail").
The term "hashtag rap", coined by Kanye West, was developed in the 2010s to describe a style of rapping which, according to Rizoh of "Houston Press", uses "three main ingredients: a metaphor, a pause, and a one-word punch line, often placed at the end of a rhyme". Rappers Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Drake and Lil Wayne are credited with the popularization of hashtag rap, while the style has been criticized by Ludacris, The Lonely Island and various music writers.
On September 13, 2013, a hashtag, #TwitterIPO, appeared in the headline of "The New York Times" front page article regarding the IPO of Twitter.
Tbt is an abbreviation of Throwback Thursday and is a hashtag used on Thursdays for pictures or posts that show activities from the past, anything from a week old to several years old. The Tbt hashtag has no special function, it just make it easier for people to reach out with their photos or posts to a larger amount of people on the social platforms.
"Hashtag heel" is a moniker used by WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler.
Bird's Eye foods released in 2014 a shaped mashed potato food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called "Mashtags". 
Adaptations.
In July 2012, Twitter adapted the hashtag style to make company ticker symbols preceded by the dollar sign clickable (as in $AAPL), a method that Twitter dubbed the "cashtag". This is intended to allow users to search posts discussing companies and their stocks.

Senior CLASS Award

The Senior CLASS Award is awarded to the most outstanding senior student-athlete in 10 NCAA Division I sports. An acronym for "Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School," the Senior CLASS Award focuses on the total student-athlete and encourages them to use their platform in athletics to make a positive impact as leaders in their communities. The awards were sponsored by Lowe's until 2012 and were popularly known as the "Lowe's Senior CLASS Awards" during this time.
History.
The award was born in 2001 when sportscaster Dick Enberg suggested a national award for senior basketball players during the CBS telecast of the NCAA Final Four championship game. In that game, Shane Battier led Duke to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball title. Battier's decision to turn down the NBA and return for his senior season was one of the media stories of the year in college basketball. Soon after, Premier Sports Management, in partnership with Lowe's, announced the formation of the Senior CLASS Award. Enberg agreed to serve as honorary chair of the award and CBS Sports provided broadcast support, announcing the winner each year during the Final Four telecast. The scope of the award program was expanded in 2007 with the addition of six NCAA Division I sports: (men's and women's soccer, lacrosse, men's hockey, softball, and baseball). The Football Bowl Subdivision was added in 2008 and women's volleyball was added in 2010. The current spokesperson is CBS Sports's Emmy-award winning sports broadcaster Jim Nantz.

McIDAS

McIDAS, the "Man computer Interactive Data Access System", is a pioneering weather forecasting tool developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s and used continually to this day. In its early incarnations it was widely used to generate graphics for television stations, but today is used primarily by the NOAA and related agencies. Users of the McIDAS system developed a similar version for microcomputers and sold by ColorGraphics Weather Systems that generated much of the computerized weather imagery seen on television in the US in the 1980s.
History.
ATS.
In 1953 Verner Suomi measured the heat budget of a corn field for his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago. For the rest of his professional career he worked in the field of remote measuring using radiometers, often working with Robert Parent. They developed a remote sensing radiometer with the intent of flying it into space and measuring the heat budget of the Earth. Their first attempt was fitted to Vanguard TV3, but this exploded on launch. A similar experiment flew on Explorer 7 in 1959. This experiment demonstrated the impact of cloud cover on the heat balance of the Earth.
To further develop the field of satellite-based meteorology, NASA and National Science Foundation (NSF) grants led to the creation of the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. At the SSEC, Suomi and Parent developed the Spin Scan Cloudcover Camera (SSCC) to accurately measure and map cloud cover. The SSCC imaged a single strip of the Earth at a time, feeding out its information directly to a radio for broadcast to the ground. Fixed to the body of a rotating satellite, the SSCC would build up a 2D image as the satellite spun and rotated in its orbit.
SSCC was launched on ATS-1 on 6 December 1966. On 5 November 1967 ATS-3 launched the Multicolor Spin Scan Cloudcover Camera, which provided the first color meteorological imaging. Data from these instruments was captured on realtime printouts, and required manual work to cut and paste the successive strips into a single image, and then into multiple time-lapse images. Although a number of advances were made while examining this data, the work was tedious and time consuming.
WINDCO.
In order to speed up the process of examining the data, Suomi started an internal competition to develop an automated solution. Two teams were set up, one developing an analog solution and another using software. The software solution, by Smith and Phillips, was able to demonstrate the ability to calculate wind speed and direction based solely on the images of the clouds. Based on this success, Suomi was able to gain additional funding from NASA and the NSF to develop a prototype all-computerized image processing system.
Known as WINDCO, the system consisted of a video disk for storing imagery and a Raytheon 440 minicomputer controlling it. The computer was used to record the imagery from the satellites, buffering a single frame from the strips and then storing it out along with timing information. The user interacted with the resulting video to select points on the frames that represented the same point as it moved over time, the output of their selections being punched to paper tape. The paper tape was then read by the 440 and copied onto punched cards containing instructions for the UNIVAC 1108 mainframe, which converted them into a vector map overlaid on top of a map of the Earth.
At a demonstration to NOAA, NASA and NSF on 12 April 1972, the system demonstrated the ability to generate 1000 wind vectors per hour. The attendees were impressed, but noted that the system was unable to correlate data from the satellites, which originated in a very specific format, with data being collected from other sensors, like automated weather stations. They encouraged the SSEC team to continue development, make the system even more automated, and include the ability to combine data from any source.
McIDAS.
The biggest problem in developing a fully automated solution was finding a machine within their budget with the speed and storage capabilities required. The team eventually settled on a Datacraft/5 computer equipped with 96 kB of core memory and two 5 MB hard drives, one fixed, one removable. The new software, McIDAS, was much more automated, with the user's primary role in the data acquisition phase reduced to checking the quality of the vectors being automatically generated by the software. An image enhancement system was added to help see the clouds in low-light areas.
McIDAS accepted data from a number of sources. Cloud imagery was buffered on tape and then fed in as needed, data from the Synchronous Meteorological Satellite could be fed in directly from a satellite feed at 1.7 MB a second, FAA data at 75 bit/s, or National Weather Service radar at 1200 bit/s. All of this data could be overlaid on hand-drawn vector maps. The system was later extended to support data from the Earth Resources Technology Satellite and the Mariner planetary probes. A command line interpreter allowed the user to call up data with short commands, codice_1 would generate a display of the 500 mb temperature data from the 1200 UTC measurements over the USA.
The first McIDAS system was complete in June 1972, but tuning continued for several months. In October 1973 a real-time feed from McIDAS to the local WHA-TV state public television service was installed. Upgrades and new data feeds continued to be added; local weather radar maps, feeds for the newer generation GOES satellites and others were added by 1976. Demand for the system was so high that the system had to be upgraded several times for additional performance and storage, with 24-hour scheduling for workstations. A system was later installed at the US Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory.
Continued demand resulted in the creation of a second-generation version of McIDAS based on six Harris/6 computers connected together using a custom networking system they called "burn lines". Two of the machines acted as database servers with 300 MB disk drives, while the other four supported up to 18 workstations each with 80 MB drives. Remote terminals inside the University were set up over 9600 bit/s lines, and later another was set up at the National Environmental Satellite Service center in Kansas City, where data from the Landsat series was processed. After a tornado in Wichita Falls, Texas killed several people in 1979, Congress directed that a new McIDAS be set up at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (now known as the Storm Prediction Center), which was completed in January 1981.
The West German Space Agency started the task of converting McIDAS to an Amdahl mainframe in 1976, and a similar system was later installed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Newer versions were written for the IBM System/370 and IBM 4331. With the improved performance these machines offered, the distributed architecture of the second-generation McIDAS was no longer needed and systems returned to a single-server installation. In 1984 development started on a standalone version for the IBM PC using EGA or VGA graphics, first on DOS and later on OS/2. These versions spread McIDAS beyond the university and laboratory, and users were soon found at television stations and weather prediction agencies around the world.
A fourth-generation system, the current version, was built on Unix. This started in 1989 as a McIDAS environment for Vis5D. In 1993 that McIDAS was the basis for development of a supported version using X, which was released in 1996 as McIDAS-X. With standardized networking, the Unix version allowed low-cost terminals to be attached to the Unix workstations, and client versions for OS/2 and Windows NT were developed. As of December 2009, McIDAS-X is tested and supported by SSEC on AIX, Enterprise Linux, HP-UX, IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows XP workstations.
The fifth generation of McIDAS is actively being developed. This new package, named McIDAS-V, is a free, open source visualization and data analysis tool that displays weather satellite (including hyperspectral) and other geophysical data in 2- and 3-dimensions. McIDAS-V can also analyze and manipulate the data with its powerful mathematical functions. McIDAS-V is built on SSEC's VisAD and Unidata's IDV libraries, and contains "Bridge" software that enables McIDAS-X users to run their commands and tasks in the McIDAS-V environment. The functionality of SSEC's HYDRA software package is also being integrated into McIDAS-V for viewing and analyzing hyperspectral satellite data.
Current versions of the various McIDAS packages can be downloaded from the McIDAS Download Software page.

Tawalisi

Tawalisi (ca. 1350 C.E - 1400 C.E.) is a fabled Southeast Asian kingdom described in the journals of Ibn Battuta. Ibn Battuta said he reached Tawalisi after a sea voyage of 71 days, 34 of which were spent rowing due to no wind. He said he reached China from Tawalisi after a voyage of 17 days. The commentators have never been able to decide the port of departure for the 71 day voyage, and so have concentrated on the 17 day voyage from Tawalisi to China.
A long list of guesses as to the location of Tawalisi have included Pangasinan, Luzon, Sulu, Celebes (Sulawesi), Cambodia, Cochin-China, the mainland province of Kwangtung, and practically every island in South Asia beginning with "ta".
Both Sir Henry Yule and William Henry Scott consider Tawilisi and its warrior-princess Urduja to be fabulous, fairy-tale, fiction.
But based on linguistics and considering the Chinese perspective in the 13th-14th centuries A.D., Tawalisi might be a Chinese pronunciation of Jawa rsi which could mean kingdom of Java or king of Java. While the original name of the duchess of the said land was actually spelled in Arabic by Ibn Battuta as WHR DJ in his Rihlah which might be misread as Urduja instead of reading it as Wahre Daja (Bhre Daha) due to the lack of geographical perspective and the lack of knowledge in the Arabic script congruent to the period when it happened. Bhre Daha was a title given to Dayah Wiyat (literally means "princess vagina"), the twin sister of Bhre Kahuripan, as duchess of Daha (also known as Kediri). Both duchesses were daughters of Raden Wijaya and Gayatri. After the death of Kala Gemet both duchesses assumed power as rajah kembars (twin rulers) and both were given the title Tribhuana tongga dewi (meaning Madjapahit empress). And it was to be remembered that Java had been attacked by Mongols they called Tatars first in the last part of the 13th century A.D. and second during the reign of Kala Gemet. Hence, it is very clear that Java at that time especially the royal court had also been linguistically influenced by the Turkic speaking Tatars. Thus, the Bhre Daha could talk in Turkic as been observed by Ibn Battuta during his visit in her court.
Tawalisi is what was the Bengal at the time. As the quote from Ibn Battuta directly describes the region, as there was strong mixture with the Turks, as well as it being a vast country at the time bordering China:
"Thereafter, we reached the land of Tawalisi, it being their king who is called by that name. It is a vast country and its king is a rival of the king of China. He possesses many junks, with which he makes war on the Chinese until they come to terms with him on certain conditions. The inhabitants of this land are idolaters; they are handsome men and closely resemble the Turks in figure. Their skin is commonly of a reddish hue, and they are brave and warlike. Their women ride on horseback and are skillful archers, and fight exactly like men." ~ Ibn Batuta of India, 14th-century traveler

The Gunsaulus Mystery

The Gunsaulus Mystery is a 1921 silent race film directed, produced and written by Oscar Micheaux. The film was inspired by events and figures in the 1913-1915 trial of Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan.
Plot.
The body of Myrtle Gunsaulus, a young African-American girl, is discovered in the basement of a New York City factory. Arthur Gilpin, the African-American janitor who discovered the body, is arrested and charged with her murder.
Arthur’s sister Ida May (Evelyn Preer) contacts her former boyfriend, the attorney Sidney Wyeth (Lawrence Chenault), to defend Gilpin in court. During the trial, Wyeth redirects attention for the murder away from Gilpin to Anthony Brisbane, a white man with a history of sexual deviancy. Gilpin is exonerated while Brisbane is revealed as Myrtle Gunsaulus' killer.
Production.
Oscar Micheaux, the most prolific African-American filmmaker of the race film genre, had previously addressed the issue of violence by whites against blacks in his 1920 feature "Within Our Gates", which aroused controversy. That film’s storyline, which included a portrayal of racial lynching and the sexual attack by a white man against a black woman, resulted in censorship rulings in Atlanta and other major cities throughout the U.S.
Micheaux tackled another controversial subject with his 1921 "The Gunsaulus Mystery". The plot was based on the 1913 murder of Mary Phagan and the trial of Leo Frank. After an African American was first interrogated, police attention turned to Frank, the Jewish-American manager of the factory. He was prosecuted and convicted of the crime. After appeals had failed, he received commutation of his death sentence, but Frank was kidnapped and lynched on August 17, 1915.
Micheaux shot "The Gunsaulus Mystery" at the Estee Studios in New York City and distributed the film through his Micheaux Film Corporation. Evelyn Preer, the star of "Within Our Gates", also starred in this production.
Micheaux revisited the subject again in 1935 with a sound remake, which was released under the titles "Murder in Harlem" and "Lem Hawkins' Confession". Especially in this version, Micheaux used the conventions of the detective story to introduce differing narratives and rework the binary nature of the trial, in which an African-American man and Jewish-American man had testified against each other.
No print of "The Gunsaulus Mystery" is known to exist in any archive or private collection, and it is considered to be a lost film. Events of the Mary Phagan murder would be covered in detail in the lengthy 1988 four-hour TV miniseries "The Murder of Mary Phagan".

Trümmerfrau

Trümmerfrau (literally translated as "ruins woman" or "rubble woman") is the German-language name for women who, in the aftermath of World War II, helped clear and reconstruct the bombed cities of Germany and Austria. With hundreds of cities having suffered significant bombing and firestorm damage through aerial attacks (and in some cases, ground fighting), and with many men dead or prisoners of war, this monumental task fell to a large degree on women.
Degree of damage.
Four million out of the sixteen million homes in Germany were destroyed during Allied bombings in World War II, with another four million damaged. Half of all school buildings, forty percent of the infrastructure, and many factories were either damaged or destroyed. According to estimates, there were about 400 million cubic metres of ruins.
Removal of ruins.
Between 1945 and 1946, the Allied powers, in both West Germany and East Germany, ordered all women between 15 and 50 years of age to participate in the postwar cleanup. For this purpose, previous restrictive measures protecting women in the labor force were removed in July 1946. Recruitment of women was especially useful since at that time, because of the loss of men in the war, there were seven million more women than men in Germany.
Usually, private enterprises were given assignments to remove the ruins, together with a permit to employ the women for that purpose. The main work was to tear down those parts of buildings that had survived the bombings, but were unsafe and unsuitable for reconstruction. Usually, no heavy machinery was used. The main tools were picks and hand-winches. After tearing down the ruins, the remnants had to be further demolished, down to single bricks that could later be used in rebuilding. A chain of women would transfer the bricks to the street, where they were cleaned and stacked. Wood and steel beams, fireplaces, wash basins, toilets, pipes and other household items were collected to be reused. The remaining debris was then removed by barrows, wagons and lorries. It was later reused to fill up holes in the streets or to make new bricks.
"Trümmerfrauen", both volunteers and regular workers, worked in all weather. They were organized in "Kolonnen" (columns) of ten to twenty people.
Later works and recognition.
In the Soviet Occupation Zone, the "Nationales Aufbauwerk" (National Reconstruction Works) was founded, in order to coordinate the efforts of the "Trümmerfrauen". 
In West Germany, the removal works continued as "Notstandsarbeiten" (State-of-emergency Works), until the cities were cleaned and the reconstruction could begin.
In both parts of Germany, as well as in Austria, the efforts of the "Trümmerfrauen" were recognized with numerous ceremonies, memorials, awards and exhibitions.
Their role was also considered important in changing post-war gender roles, though the concept of women as independent workers was taken up more eagerly in the official views of East Germany than in West Germany, where, once peace and economic prosperity was restored, a tendency reemerged in some parts of society to return women to their traditional family role only.
Across Germany.
Aachen.
On 4 October 2006, a weekly newspaper published the memories of the Trümmerfrau Elisabeth Stock (83) of which the following passage is cited:
"...it were mostly women who shoveled their way through the rubble of Aachen's inner city that was totally destroyed; just for one bowl of soup from the Americans, we hammered and dragged debris all day long, even the pickaxe was part of our equipment, ...that's probably one reason why they put a memorial plaque for Aachen's Trümmerfrauen at the back of the townhall."
Berlin.
Within the four occupied sectors of Berlin approximately 10 per cent of the buildings were irreparably destroyed. In the central districts of Berlin Mitte, Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg, Tiergarten, and Wedding up to 30 per cent were destroyed. For this reason, the Trümmerfrauen had to work hard and their commitment gained widespread recognition:
In 1946, the Allied headquarters published a series of stamps, the so-called „Bärenmarken“, for the whole of Berlin. The graphic designers Alfred Goldhammer and Heinz Schwalbe created four images with symbols of the reconstruction, e.g. a bear with a brick, a bear with a shovel, a bear with a beam and a young oak tree in front of the ruins at Belle-Alliance square. 
On 13 October 1950 the mayor of East-Berlin Friedrich Ebert offered a newly built flat to a former Trümmerfrau in honour of her commitment. The flat was located in one of the terraces in the street which was formerly called Stalinallee and had been designed by Hans Scharoun.
Erika Heß, mayor of the district of Wedding, initiated the founding of a club for the Trümmerfrauen. Its members were invited for coffee and cake once a year and also received assistance when they needed to complete official business. In addition, excursions were organised.
Bremen.
In May 2005, the Bremen organisation "Friedensforum" initiated a two-hour meeting under the motto "Mother's Day - in a different way". Additionally to various activities like music performances or discussion groups etc., a Trümmerfrau and a pupil met for public discussion.
Chemnitz.
In 2001, due to an initiative of the 1998 founded club "Verein figürliches Glockenspiel im Alten Rathaus-Turm zu Chemnitz e.V" together with the support of numerous donators a carillon with a total number of 25 bells was being installed. Three times a day, the six figures, with the height of 1 metre, are coming out of the tower. One of them is shaped like a Trümmerfrau. The rubble woman has a brick on her knee which she holds with her left hand. In the right hand she has got a hammer. The figures were designed by the sculptor Johannes (Hannes) Schulze from Plauen and forged by the bell foundry "Rudolf Perner Karlsruhe und Passau".

Alliance for Labor Action

The Alliance for Labor Action (ALA) was an American and Canadian national trade union center which existed from July 1968 until January 1972. Its two main members were the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, although it had some smaller affiliates.
Formation and growth.
The Teamsters had been expelled from the AFL-CIO in 1957 for corruption. The UAW had disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO on July 1, 1968, after UAW President Walter Reuther and AFL-CIO President George Meany could not come to agreement on a wide range of policy issues or reforms to AFL-CIO governance. Although Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons was originally seen as a proxy for jailed Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, Fitzsimmons had begun taking a more leftist stand on a number of public policy issues. Reuther was particularly impressed that Fitzsimmons had been the only other national labor leader present at the funeral of Martin Luther King, Jr.
On July 24, 1968, just days after the UAW disaffiliation, Fitzsimmons and Reuther formed the Alliance for Labor Action to organize unorganized workers and pursue leftist political and social projects. While Reuther himself remained active in the ALA, Fitzsimmons assigned Teamsters leader Harold J. Gibbons as his union's liaison.
Fitzsimmons and Reuther offered the AFL-CIO a no-raid pact as a first step toward building a working relationship between the competing trade union centers, but the offered was rejected. AFL-CIO President George Meany denounced the ALA as a dual union, although Reuther argued it was not. The ALA later passed a resolution permitting ALA members to raid AFL-CIO unions or organize in jurisdictions claimed by AFL-CIO unions if the AFL-CIO-affiliated union was not doing enough to organize workers into union. Although Reuther had a lengthy list of unions he hoped would join the ALA, few did so. In September 1968, the 110,000-member International Chemical Workers Union (now part of the United Food and Commercial Workers) affiliated with the ALA, and was expelled from the AFL-CIO a year later. Ten of the largest local unions (representing 40,000 members) belonging to the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union disaffiliated from that international union, formed a new union (the National Council of Distributive Workers of America), and joined the ALA. Although the United Rubber Workers and the Glass Workers both expressed official interest in joining the ALA, neither did so. The ALA's founding split the American Federation of Teachers, which debated joining but never formally considered such an act.
Program and dissolution.
The Alliance's initial program was ambitious. The two member unions provided the ALA with an annual budget of $4.5 million, the same amount they would have paid to the AFL-CIO in per capita dues. A major organizing drive targeting African American workers was launched in Atlanta, Georgia, in the fall of 1969 involving 50 staff organizers (half of them black), 200 volunteer member-organizers, a $4 million budget, and an extensive public relations campaign. But the campaign failed: After 28 months, only 4,590 workers had been organized, and 94 of 196 elections won.
The ALA's agenda also included action on a number of progressive issues. It engaged in a widespread community unionism effort. But its attempt to organize blue-collar workers, the poor, and local citizens into community unions was hampered by a lack of experience in community organizing. The ALA program turned into a grant-making operation working through the UAW's existing structure, awarding more than $2.5 million in funds in two and a half years. Although it had little organizational involvement in the anti-Vietnam War peace movement, the ALA called for an immediate end to the war, endorsed anti-war rallies, and its leaders marched in anti-war marches. The trade union center also supported universal health care, and gave an important early boost to modern efforts to pass federal legislation on the issue.
Reuther's death in a plane crash on May 9, 1970, near Black Lake, Michigan, dealt a serious blow to the Alliance. The group halted operations in July 1971 after the Auto Workers (almost bankrupt from a lengthy strike at General Motors) was unable to continue to fund its operations, and the ALA formally disanded in January 1972. The Ford Foundation assumed control over the community grant programs upon the ALA's disestablishment.
The UAW re-affiliated with the AFL-CIO on July 1, 1981. The Teamsters re-affiliated with the AFL-CIO on October 24, 1987.
Historical assessment.
Some commentators conclude that the ALA is unimportant, historically. For example, Harold Meyerson argues that "the Alliance for Labor Action, alas, never really did anything." Others conclude that it never could have evolved into a major force in the American labor movement: The UAW was no longer a potent political force by 1968, the UAW was on the verge losing half a million members and agreeing to major contract concessions in the auto industry, and neither the UAW nor Teamsters had much organizing capacity (neither had engaged in any significant efforts to organize new members for decades).
Other commentators disagree. The ALA, some historians say, gave the anti-war movement a voice for the first time within the labor movement. Although the ALA's own community organizing efforts failed, they encouraged and promoted a long-lasting (if small) community organizing effort in some major cities which survived into the 21st century. Commentators at the time of Reuther's death and a quarter-century later have also concluded that it was Reuther's untimely demise which led to the ALA's failure, rather than anything inherent in its members, structure, or goals.
