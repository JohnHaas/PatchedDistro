Quiabelagayo

Quiabelagayo (alternatively written Guiebelagayo or Quiepelagayo) is a Zapotec name associated particularly with the Oaxacan Valley pre-Columbian site of Dainzu (known also as "Macuilxochitl" or "Macuilsuchil"). In Zapotec mythology and religion, Quiabelagayo has been interpreted by some researchers such as Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal as a local Oaxacan equivalent of the central Mexican deity Macuilxochitl, or "Five Flower".
In post-conquest censuses and maps of the region, particularly the "Relacion geografica de Macuilxochitl ", Quiabelagayo is marked as the indigenous Zapotec toponym for the town San Mateo Macuilxochitl, the settlement adjoining the site of Dainzu. 
The derivation of the name is uncertain. John Paddock deconstructs the name "Quiabelagayo" as composed of the Zapotec word-stems for "rock", "serpent", and "five". Pictographically the "Relacion geografica de Macuilxochitl" translates or associates the name as "five flower". Joseph Whitecotton suggests that "quia-" should be read as "rock" or "hill" instead of "flower", and proposes that "bela" or "pela" means "reed"; therefore "quiabelagayo" can with justification be interpreted as "Hill of 5-Reed".

Sherbrooke St Gilbert's Church

Sherbrooke St. Gilbert's Church is a congregation of the Church of Scotland serving the Pollokshields and Dumbreck areas on the south side of Glasgow, Scotland. It is within the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow.
History.
The church was designed by the architect William Forsyth McGibbon. The hall was completed in 1894 and the church itself in 1900, as Sherbrooke United Free Church. In 1929 the United Free Church united with the Church of Scotland.
Following a serious fire in 1994, the church was restored by the architect James Cuthbertson. A new 3 manual Lammermuir pipe organ was installed.
The present congregation was created from the union of the former separate ex-UF Sherbrooke Church and St Gilbert's Parish Church (which had been part of the pre-1929 Church of Scotland).
Building.
The church building is located at 240 Nithsdale Road, close to Dumbreck railway station.
Shortly after the completion of a major refurbishment, the church was destroyed by fire in 1994. The burnt out shell of the building was, however, able to be restored. The rebuilt sanctuary has notable, modern stained glass windows.
Ministry.
The current minister (since 2003) is the Reverend Thomas L. Pollock.

Great Nordic Biker War

The Great Nordic Biker War, sometimes called the Great Northern Biker War or Great Scandinavian Biker War, refers to the violent gang war that began in 1994 and continued until 1997 in many parts of Scandinavia, mainly involving Hells Angels MC and Bandidos MC but also involving many prospect and support clubs. The cities mainly affected by the war were Copenhagen in Denmark, Helsinki in Finland, Oslo in Norway, and Helsingborg and Malmö in Sweden.
Overview.
The Copenhagen MC War (1983–85).
On 30 December 1980, the then "United MC" was appointed the first Hells Angels chapter in Scandinavia. Their long-standing opponents "Filthy Few" were not keen to accept the new chapter at any level. Along with several members of other Copenhagen MC-clubs they formed the hard anti-HA MC-crew known as "Bullshit MC". They settled at Christiania, benefited from the cannabis trade there, and, in September 1983, paid a visit to a well-known Hells Angels pub. This visit instigated a bloodbath that would last for the following two years and four months. The result of this first Scandinavian MC-war was the murder of eight Bullshit members (including three presidents), one Hells Angels member, and two innocent people. In addition, Bullshit MC members were also prime suspects for the murder of two non-bikers during the war. When the police visited the former club house of Bullshit in 1986, they also found the corpse of a man beneath the clubhouse floor.
The first war was limited to Copenhagen alone, unlike the second, and the number of deaths during the Copenhagen war met or exceeded the number of deaths in the following war. Unlike the second war, the first had a clear winner and no "peace treaty" was required.
The second MC War in Scandinavia.
In 1984 Morticians MC was formed and by the early 1990s, there were many motorcycle clubs across Scandinavia. In 1992, the Morticians and Hells Angels, who had been on good terms until then, became rivals as both clubs transformed from bike enthusiasts into criminal organizations. The Morticians then changed their name to Undertakers MC and became allies of the Bandidos, whose only European chapter was based in Marseille, France at that point. In 1993, the Undertakers merged with the Bandidos to become Bandidos MC Denmark. In 1994 the Hells Angels tried to prevent Morbids MC from growing into an established biker gang and potential rival in Sweden. The Morbids then joined an alliance with the Bandidos, who backed-up their prospect club. Outlaws MC also joined with the Bandidos in Norway. This eventually led to a drug-trade war between the two most powerful outlaw biker gangs in Scandinavia, the Hells Angels and the Bandidos, which the police described as a "deadly game" to prove 'who's the toughest'. Many of the port cities in Scandinavia, particularly Copenhagen, were used to smuggle drugs in from Spain and the Netherlands.
The war.
According to a 1997 report by "The New York Times", the Bandidos presence in the Nordic countries at the time of the war consisted of around 130 members from at least seven chapters while the Hells Angels contingent was made up of around 290 members in total from 15 chapters, with 85 in Sweden, 110 in Denmark, 70 in Norway and 25 in Finland.
The first incident was a shooting at the clubhouse of Morbids MC, on 26 January 1994 in Helsingborg, Sweden, but no one was injured or killed. In February 1994, there was a shoot-out between Hells Angels and Bandidos members in the same city, resulting in the death of Joakim Boman, a Hells Angels member. Just days later, an anti-tank rocket was fired at the Hells Angels clubhouse. On 22 June 1994, the president of Klan MC, an ally of the Bandidos in Finland, was shot dead by the Hells Angels and on 19 February 1995, the war reached Norway as a shoot-out in Oslo between the Hells Angels and Bandidos ended in one biker being wounded.
Michael "Joe" Ljunggren, the president of Bandidos MC Sweden, was assassinated on 17 July 1995 and the Bandidos retaliated by firing anti-tank rockets at the clubhouses of Hells Angels prospect clubs in Helsinki, Finland and Helsingborg, Sweden nine days later. Two Bandidos members were later sentenced, Kai Tapio Blom was given six years imprisonment and Antti Tauno Tapani was given four years. When Bandidos MC Finland's president arrived at a Helsinki court house for the trial of Blom and Tapani, he was attacked and beaten by Hells Angels members. A Hells Angels-owned tattoo parlour in Helsinki was later destroyed in retaliation.
On Christmas Day 1995, two Hells Angels members were beaten up by Bandidos at a nightclub in Copenhagen, signalling the beginning of the war in Denmark. In January 1996, there was a series of bombings in Norway, Hells Angels prospect club, Screwdrivers MC's clubhouse in Hamar and the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Oslo were the targets. A Hells Angels-owned bar in Helsinki, Finland was also bombed a month later. On 1 March 1996, the Hells Angels attacked the Bandidos' Helsinki clubhouse where two Bandidos members suffered gunshot wounds. Jarkko Kokko, the vice-president of Bandidos MC Finland and one of the men shot, died sixteen days later in hospital from his wounds. Two Hells Angels prospects were later arrested for the murder, Ilkka Ukkonen was sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison and Jussi Penttinen was given six years.
On 10 March 1996, there were twin attacks on Bandidos members at airports in Denmark and Norway; at Fornebu airport in Oslo, several Bandidos were wounded and at Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen, Bandidos who were returning from a weekend in Helsinki were shot, three wounded and one, Uffe Larsen, was killed. Six Hells Angels members and associates were arrested and sentenced to a total of 53 years in prison, and one was given a life sentence. In April and May 1996, there was another series of bombings as the Hells Angels clubhouses in Helsingborg, Sweden and southern Denmark were attacked and the clubhouse of a Hells Angels prospect club, Avengers MC, was also attacked in Aalborg, Denmark.
Jan "Face" Krogh Jensen, a Danish Bandidos member, was shot and killed in Drammen, Norway on 15 July 1996 and Hells Angels supporter was shot six days later in Oslo. Two Hells Angels were also shot and wounded that month in Malmö, Sweden and at Jyderup prison in Denmark. On 28 August, the vice-president of Hells Angels MC Sweden was shot and wounded in Helsingborg.
In October 1996, there were three attacks on Hells Angels clubhouses; on the 3rd, an explosion in Malmö wounded twelve innocent bystanders and three days later, an anti-tank rocket was fired at a clubhouse in Copenhagen during a party. Hells Angels member Louis Linde Nielsen and guest Janne Krohn were both killed. Bandidos prospect Niels Poulsen was convicted of carrying out the attacks and sentenced to life in prison. On the 30th, a car bomb exploded outside the Hells Angels clubhouse in Oslo. Toward the end of 1996, there were shootings of Bandidos members in Horsens and Aalborg in Denmark.
At the beginning of 1997, a member of Hells Angels, Kim Thrysöe Svendsen was murdered in Aalborg and the president of the Outlaws, Thore "Henki" Holm, and a French member were shot and wounded by a member of Untouchables MC, a Hells Angels ally. Bandidos' foot-soldiers were also shot in Amager and Køge in Denmark. The Bandidos responded by ordering shootings on Hells Angels members and allies in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen.
On 4 June 1997, a car bomb exploded outside a Bandidos clubhouse in Drammen, Norway, killing Irene Astrid Bækkevold, a civilian passing by in her car. A Hells Angels member was finally convicted of the bombing in 2002. Three days later, Björn Gudmandsen was killed and three other Bandidos' were wounded after a shooting in Liseleje, Denmark. Hells Angels member Vagn Smith was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The last incident happened on 11 April when the Bandidos clubhouse in Dalby, Denmark was bombed.
The war ended on 25 September 1997 as "Big" Jim Tinndahn, the president of all of the Bandidos' European chapters, shook hands with Hells Angels Europe president Bent "Blondie" Nielsen in front of Danish TV news cameras.
Aftermath.
By the end of the war, 11 murders and 74 attempted murders had been committed and 96 people were wounded. Both clubs signed a treaty saying that no more chapters would be opened up in Scandinavia, but both sides had already broken the treaty by the end of the 1990s. In Denmark, a law that banned motorcycle clubs from owning or renting property for their club activities was passed. The law has subsequently been repealed on constitutional grounds.

Buckeye Manufacturing Company

The Buckeye Manufacturing Company was a company originally formed to manufacture horse and buggy parts. It was started in the later part of the nineteenth century and by the early part of the twentieth century was making parts and materials for the Buckeye gasoline buggy automobile as well as for the Union automobile and the Lambert automobile. The company was organized in 1884 in Union City, Ohio, originally under the name of Lambert Brothers and Company. One of the subsidiaries was the Pioneer Pole and Shaft Company, which was run by George A. Lambert, the son of John W. Lambert. Other subsidiaries were the Union Automobile Company, Lambert Automobile Company, and the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company — run by John W. Lambert.
History.
The Buckeye Manufacturing Company started with the sum of money of two thousand dollars. They initially started to manufacture buggy neck yokes and other carriage parts. They had a crew of six men and a few young boys that were helpers. The company name was changed to "J. H. Osborne and Company" within a few years. They added a line of hardware specialties to the business. Some hand-powered, wood-boring drills have been located bearing this company's name and its Indiana address. By 1890 Mr. Osborne dropped out of the company and the name reverted to the Buckeye Manufacturing Company. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company factory burned in 1891. There was a loss of $15,000 in buildings and materials of which $12,000 was covered by insurance. They constructed new buildings to replace the ones lost.
The stationary Buckeye engine designed and invented by John William Lambert was patented in 1894. The company then started manufacturing these stationary engines since at the time there was no market for Lambert's automobile. In that same year the company was reorganized and incorporated with a capital stock of $100,000. John William Lambert became the company's president with his parents taking key positions. His father became the vice president and his mother become the secretary and treasurer.
The Buckeye Manufacturing Company then moved to Anderson, Indiana where it was built in the Evalyn industrial park at Third and Sycamore Streets. The company expanded in 1903 with the purchase of on Columbus Ave in Anderson, Indiana. The Anderson Weekly Herald newspaper reported that the new factory would have up to of factory floor space and employ 350 to 400 people. The factory was to have the latest up to date equipment and electric cranes. The cost of the new buildings would be $150,000. A contract for the iron frame steelwork of the buildings was to be signed with the general contractors within a few days of the newspaper article. The factory manufactured gasoline engines and pressed steel articles for Lambert's automobiles.
The property was known as the Hannah Croak property owned by a Mrs. Hannah Carey and a Mrs. Pfafflin. The transaction was conducted by the Sears Real Estate Company. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company then shared its name with "The Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company." The new factory began making Lambert automobile parts and materials in mass production beginning in 1905.

Buckeye gasoline buggy

The Buckeye gasoline buggy or Lambert gasoline buggy was the first practical gasoline automobile available for sale in America, according to automobile historians.
History.
John William Lambert made America's first such automobile in 1891, according to a five-year extensive study by L. Scott Bailey, a well-known automobile historian, editor, and publisher. The study found substantial evidence to enter this claim on Lambert's behalf. The evidence from Bailey's study shows that Lambert designed, built, and ran a gasoline engine automobile in the early part of 1891 that he put on the market. It shows that neither Henry Ford nor the Duryea Brothers have the distinction of building the first such practical working internal combustion gasoline engine automobile in the United States. In Europe Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler produced the first gasoline automobiles in 1885/1886. The Duryea brothers made their automobile in 1893 and started the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1895 mass-producing cars. Henry Ford started mass-producing cars in 1899 at the Detroit Automobile Company.
Lambert initially designed and built his "horseless carriage" gasoline automobile in 1890. He successfully tested it in January 1891 inside an farm implement showroom he owned in Ohio City, Ohio. Lambert's three-wheeled surrey-top gasoline-powered buggy was his own design. It had a single cylinder, four-stroke engine. This, the Buckeye gasoline buggy, was a one-seat tricycle with large rear wheels.
Lambert designed a sales brochures advertising its specifications in January 1891. He mailed this brochure out to prospects in the first part of February 1891 with a price of $550. Later in the month of February 1891 he was running his automobile on the main street of Ohio City. Bailey points out there are several letters on file dated in the latter part of February and the early part of March 1891 requesting additional information on this "horseless carriage" that Lambert described in the brochure. Other letters of inquire continued, however Lambert ultimately was not able to sell any.
This first model had a wipe spark ignition and dry cell batteries. The automobile had two speeds forward and none going backwards. A hand steering device was added later when the automobile was used outside on the roads. The weight of the car was 585 pounds. It had wooden wheels with steel rims for extra wear. The carburetor was a surface vaporizer with a flexible diaphragm "compensator." This was patented by Lambert on May 17, 1902. The original model cost Lambert $3200. In 1904 it was lost in a fire when a grain elevator building that he was having remodeled burned to the ground.
In 1895 Lambert decided to manufacture stationary gasoline engines. He moved to Anderson, Indiana and there started Buckeye Manufacturing Company. In that same year he announced he would "soon have a gasoline vehicle on the market" to be called the Buckeye. He sent a picture to the newspapers, which was of the Buckeye gasoline buggy he made in 1891. This endeavor also did not come to fruition. Instead he continued experimentation and devised the friction gearing disk drive transmission. He invented and developed a friction transmission that would be the key feature on all of his future automobiles he would make. Lambert's first model design of 1891 was eventually modified and developed into the Union automobile which first was sold in 1902.
Festival.
Lambert Days is a community celebrating that honors the life of John W. Lambert, the first gasoline-powered single-cylinder vehicle, and the world's first car wreck. This is an annual three-day event that takes place in Ohio City, Ohio on the third weekend of July. Activities and events: Car Show, Art Festival, Flea Market, Sporting Events, Parade, Live Entertainment, and Lambert Automobile Displays.

Others before Duryea.
In the late nineteenth century, there were many individuals in the United States working on a "horseless carriage", some of which paralleled the time frame of Lambert. Some notable individuals with verifiable primary sources that invented such vehicles before the Duryea brothers were Henry Nadig, Charles H. Black, and Elwood P. Haynes.
Henry Nadig.
Henry Nadig of Allentown, Pennsylvania invented a vehicle that history records he built sometime between 1891 and 1893. In 1905, Nadig reports that he began to construct a "horseless carriage" in 1891 and when he finished it, he then ran it on Fourth Street in Allentown. The original 1891 vehicle was extensively modified in the winter of 1892–93 to the point it could be almost considered a different vehicle. This vehicle was driven "for pleasure" for the next ten years. As of 1992, this vehicle was owned by a David K. Bausch of Allentown. About 70% of the original vehicle still existed, however it was in "rough" condition and needed complete restoration. The historical importance of this particular vehicle is that it may be the oldest America-made gasoline-powered automobile that still exists.
Charles H. Black.
Charles H. Black reported that he completed and tested his first steam engine "chug buggy" in 1891. He rejected a steam engine "as too cumbersome and hard to manage" for use in an automobile. He then went about making a gasoline engine vehicle. Later in 1891 he then tried such a "horseless carriage" out in Indianapolis
on the paved streets of Circle and Delaware. He drove this vehicle around Indianapolis for the next twenty years. A business card of C.H. Black Manufacturing Company showed a picture of this vehicle with the writing "Estimates furnished for power-equipped vehicles of any style." The business card was dated 1892.
Elwood P. Haynes.
Elwood P. Haynes, who successfully made his trial run of his automobile on July 4, 1894, arranged a meeting with Lambert shortly thereafter. He told Lambert, a close friend of his, that he planned on manufacturing the car and wanted to advertise it as "America's First Car" to be able to promote sales. Lambert agreed not to refute this even though Lambert's three-wheeled automobile is considered to be the first successful gasoline automobile available for sale in the United States. He let his friend Haynes take the honors. A mistake Haynes made was that the Duryea brothers and others predated him. Lambert never broke his promise to his friend, however when he went into production he often made reference to his "1891" gasoline engine horseless carriage buggy but never said it was "America's First Car" made. The Smithsonian Institution has not declared Lambert the inventor of the first commercially available self-powered gasoline engine automobile because he himself never made this claim.
Others with prior patents.
George B. Selden.
George B. Selden applied for a patent on a vehicle in 1879 of an "improved road engine" based on a compression engine that used liquid-hydrocarbon fuel (i.e. gasoline). The patent covered the basics of constructing a horseless carriage of a self-propelled automobile, however he had not actually built such a vehicle. Selden worked off the principles of George Brayton's two-cycle gasoline engine patented in 1872. Blayton had exhibited his engine at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 and Selden then decided to use that engine or a modified version of it as the basis for a patent. He went about drawing up a model of a vehicle and applied for a patent strictly based on the drawing alone. Selden then used legal evasive tactics to stall the patent's acceptance each year making minor amendments until he felt it was favorable for commercial production of the American automobile. The idea behind this was that he wanted to secure the claim of being the first to have invented the automobile and get the seventeen-year legal rights to all the automobile royalties. He legally stalled the process until he was forced to complete the application process. This was sixteen years after he first applied for the patent
and a few months before the actual mass-production of automobiles by car manufactures. History records of automobile technology do not support his claim as being the first to have invented the automobile because at the time he was issued the patent Selden had not been able to make a working model. This evasion and stalling of finalizing a patent then had much influence as to how future automobile patents were handled from then on.
Frank A. Huntington.
A "vehicle" was patented by a F. A. Huntington of San Francisco on January 11, 1889. This was about six months after Carl Benz received a patent in the United States for a "self-propelling vehicle." There seems to be no further record if Huntington built his 1889 gasoline engine vehicle or if there was a west coast sales distribution of the vehicle before 1891. Huntington's 1889 patent was four years before the Duryea brothers built their first car in 1893. Huntington's patent number 411,196 states:

Pomatiopsidae

Pomatiopsidae is a family of small, mainly freshwater snails, (some also occur in other habitats) that have gills and an operculum, aquatic gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Rissooidea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Pomatiopsidae are well known as intermediate hosts of Asian schistosomes.
Distribution.
Species in the family Pomatiopsidae occur worldwide. The generic diversity of Pomatiopsinae is particularly high in the Japanese Archipelago, where four of the eight genera, including two endemics, are recorded. The subfamily Triculinae radiated as aquatic snails in freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.
[[File:Pomatiopsidae map.svg|left|thumb|upright=3.0|Approximate distribution map of Pomatiopsidae.
Notes: Distribution of "Tomichia" includes also Central Africa,
"Cecina" has eight species.]]
Description.
The American malacologist William Stimpson first defined this taxon as Pomatiopsinae in 1865. Stimpson's diagnosis reads as follows:
Subfamilies.
The family Pomatiopsidae consists of 2 subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005) that follows classification by Davis (1979):
Family-group name Rehderiellinae Brandt, 1974 is also in Pomatiopsidae, but it is not allocated in detail.
Genera.
Genera within the family Pomatiopsidae include:
Subfamily Pomatiopsinae
Subfamily Triculinae - there are over 20 genera in Triculinae
tribe Triculuni
tribe Jullieniini
tribe Lacunopsini
tribe Pachydrobiini
Rehderiellinae is not allocated to a subfamily
Ecology.
The Pomatiopsidae have various life habits: aquatic, amphibious, littoral, halophilic, cavernicolous and even terrestrial. Terrestrial taxa occur only on the Japanese Archipelago located in East Asia ("Blanfordia"). "Tomichia" and "Coxiella" include several halophilic species occurring on saline lakes.
Pomatiopsidae invaded freshwater habitats from marine ones in one or in two independent lineages. They also invaded terrestrial habitats from freshwater habitats in two independent lineages.

Royal Pains

Royal Pains is a USA Network television series that premiered on June 4, 2009, starring Mark Feuerstein, Paulo Costanzo, Jill Flint, Reshma Shetty, Brooke D'Orsay, Ben Shenkman, and Campbell Scott.
The series is based in part on actual concierge medicine practices of independent doctors and companies. The series was renewed for a fourth season by USA Network on September 15, 2011. On September 25, 2012, "Royal Pains" was renewed for its fifth and sixth seasons.
Series synopsis.
The series follows Hank Lawson, a young emergency room doctor, who after being wrongly blamed for an important patient's death, moves to the Hamptons and becomes a reluctant "doctor for hire" to the rich and famous. When the administrator of the local hospital asks him to treat the town's less fortunate, he finds himself walking the line between doing well for himself and doing good for others.
Location.
Principal production of the show's pilot occurred in the Hamptons. However, other locations throughout Long Island were used, with Oheka Castle being the most prominent. Although actually located 60 miles to the west, in Huntington, Oheka served as the Hamptons home of Boris, the German nobleman who offers his guest house to Hank and Evan. In later episodes, exterior and aerial shots of Oheka are used to introduce scenes in the guest house.
In one episode, a Long Beach drive-thru convenience store, Dairy Barn was used as a fictional hot dog stand; a sign can be seen in the opening of that scene. Also, several scenes were shot on the bay side of Point Lookout. Other places used as fictional Hamptons locations include Northport Village in the Town of Huntington, Old Westbury Gardens, Freeport's Nautical Mile, which served as the exterior and parking lot of Hampton Heritage Hospital (in one scene, Freeport's charter coat can be seen across the bay) Caumsett State Historic Park and Oyster Bay Town Hall, which was transformed into the entrance of the Hamptons Heritage Hospital emergency room. Catalina Beach Club in Atlantic Beach, New York was transformed for the pilot episode into the fictional Hampt Inn, the hotel Hank and Evan stayed in upon their arrival in the Hamptons. Downtown Locust Valley, another haunt of the wealthy on Long Island's Gold Coast, plays downtown East Hampton in at least one episode (where Evan and Paige go shopping), with interior shots in a store as well as street scenes.
For several beach scenes, West Neck Beach (Huntington) was used and a food shopping scene was filmed in Southdown Market in Huntington. Huntington Hospital is now used for Hamptons Heritage Hospital.
Two episodes of the second season take place in Cuba, but were filmed in Puerto Rico.
Production.
The pilot was filmed on location on Long Island, New York in the spring and fall of 2008. The pilot was directed by Jace Alexander, who also filmed the pilot of "Burn Notice", another USA Network show, which airs in the hour before "Royal Pains". Andrew Lenchewski wrote the pilot and Rich and Paul Frank executive produced the project, with Lenchewski co-executive producing and John P. Rogers producing. The series was then picked up for a 12-episode season. On February 24, 2011, the show completed its second season. The show was renewed for a 6th season Season 6 is being filmed in New York and will premiere in June 2014 
Reception.
"Royal Pains" has become one of the highest rated shows on cable. The series premiere was watched by 5.57 million viewers, the highest series premiere for the USA Network since "Psych" in 2006. With episodes two and three watched by 5.59 million viewers and 6.5 million, respectively, it was the first show in five years to have viewership increase from week two to week three.
DVD releases.
Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the first season of "Royal Pains" in Region 1 on May 25, 2010, and released it in Region 4 on August 25, 2010. Season Two was released in Region 1 on May 17, 2011. A DVD was released on January 3, 2012 containing the first 10 episodes of the third season. Episodes are also available on iTunes.
Novel series.
Beginning in 2011, D.P. Lyle began publishing a book series based on the television series, under Signet Books' Obsidian imprint.
Legal issues.
On July 6, 2010, Hayden Christensen, the actor best known for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in the Star Wars saga, and his older brother, Tove, filed a lawsuit against the USA Network in a Manhattan Federal Court. In the suit, the brothers claimed to have pitched to the USA Network an idea for a new television series, called "Housecall", which involved a concierge doctor who made house calls to the rich and famous. The two brothers also claimed that a USA Network executive told them that, "prior to learning about "Housecall", he was unaware of concierge doctors and that he thought it was a fascinating idea." A USA Network spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit. On May 10, 2011, a Manhattan judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to justify a breach-of-contract claim because the claim concerns "materials that are not copyrightable, such as ideas." The decision was reversed on appeal in June 2012, the court holding that Christensens' claims were not pre-empted by copyright law. The opinion stated, "There are several qualitative differences between such a contract claim and a copyright violation claim," and added that sister appellate circuits recently had come to this same conclusion.

Ray Shearer

Ray Solomon Shearer (September 19, 1929 – February 21, 1982) was a professional baseball player. He played in two games in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Braves in 1957, one as a left fielder and the other as a pinch hitter.
Early career.
Born in Jacobus, Pennsylvania, Ray was originally signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers before the 1950 season and had a big year in his first season in pro ball, hitting .317 for the Sheboygan Indians and leading the class D Wisconsin State League with 30 home runs and 137 RBIs. Ray spent the next eight seasons (1950–57) in the minors, hitting over .300 three different times with double-digit figures in home runs seven of those years. The Dodgers traded Shearer to the Milwaukee Braves for Jim Frey on July 4, 1956.
1957: MLB cup of coffee.
Ray played for the Wichita Braves of the American Association in 1957, hitting .316 with 29 home runs in 138 games. He was given a late-season promotion to the majors, and made his MLB debut on September 18, with the Milwaukee Braves. He started the game in left field for the Braves who were hosting the New York Giants. In his first plate appearance, Ray struck out against Johnny Antonelli. He walked in his second plate appearance before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning.
Moment in the spotlight.
On September 29, on the final day of the 1957 season in front of 45,000 fans at County Stadium, Ray helped the Milwaukee Braves to a come-from-behind victory. The Braves who had already clinched the pennant, were trailing the Cincinnati Redlegs 3-2 in bottom of the ninth inning when Joe Adcock led off the inning with a base hit off new Redlegs' pitcher Bill Kennedy. The Redlegs brought in Mel Roach to pinch run for Adcock, and Del Crandall to pinch-hit for pitcher Don McMahon. After Crandall flied out to center field, Shearer was brought in to pinch-hit for catcher Carl Sawatski. Shearer came through with a single to right field advancing Roach to third base with the tying run, with Ray now becoming the winning run on first base.
Andy Pafko struck out against Kennedy for the second out of the inning, bringing up Red Schoendienst. Red kept the inning alive with another single, his league-leading 200th hit of the year, advancing Ray to second base while Roach scored the tying run. Light-hitting shortstop Félix Mantilla then came to bat and drove a single to left field, scoring Ray and giving the Braves a 4-3 victory for their 95th win. Ray's base hit was the only one for the 28-year-old outfielder giving him a lifetime .500 batting average in the major leagues. Interestingly, it was also Kennedy's final major league appearance.
Return to the minors.
After his late season call-up to County Stadium in Milwaukee in 1957, his only shot at the big leagues, Ray would spend the rest of his career in the minors, playing five more seasons, all in class A ball or better. He played with teams like the Nashville Vols, Atlanta Crackers, Louisville Colonels and Richmond Virginians and finished out his 13-season minor league run in 1962 with the York White Roses and the Augusta Yankees. Ray was 32 years old when he left baseball and had put together a minor league stat sheet that shows him hitting at a .288 average with 204 home runs while appearing in 1,614 games.
Ray died in York, Pennsylvania at the age of 52.

Union Automobile Company

The Union Automobile Company began to make automobiles in Union City, Indiana in 1902. It built the Union automobile from 1902 through 1905. The company was located in Union City, Indiana from 1902 to 1905. In 1905 it moved to Anderson, Indiana. 
History.
John William Lambert's first automobile marketing success was with the model called the "Union." The reason it was called the Union automobile was because of favorable agreements and concessions from Union City chamber of commerce. Most of the automobile components for the Union automobile were made at the Buckeye Manufacturing Company in Anderson, Indiana, owned and operated by Lambert. 
The Union automobile was initially released in 1902. The first friction disk-drive gearless transmission automobile, as designed by Lambert, was on the road in 1901 as an experimental vehicle. The motor for the automobile was a pair of opposed 6 by cylinders, far in front, crosswise, side chains to rear drivers. One model was a single seater that weighed 1,400 pounds (640 kg) and was equipped with a motor. Another model was 1,800 pounds with a motor. The motors were built by the Buckeye Manufacturing Company. The motors ran up to 1,500 revolutions per minute and as low as 150 rpm. They had a make and break ignition with current furnished by a magneto. The first model was quickly followed by a second friction driven model, same motor placed crosswise in extreme rear of the car. 
Union Automobile Company built in 1904 through 1905 a 5-seater tonneau model. This automobile came with a ten horsepower engine in 1904. In 1905 it was available in a model or a model. In 1905 the majority of the factory production was done in the Anderson plant. That plant had always made the engines and transmissions for the Union automobile from the start. In that same year the name of the automobile changed from the Union automobile to the Lambert automobile.
Union Automobile Company manufactured a medium weight gasoline automobile for business purposes and for personal use. The stock of this company was principally owned by the Buckeye Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of parts of carriages and buggies, and the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company of Anderson, Indiana — both of which were owned by the Lambert family. Over three hundred of the initial "Union" automobiles had been made and sold.

Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company

The Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company was a company founded by John William Lambert in the later part of the nineteenth century as part of the conglomerate of the Buckeye Manufacturing Company.
History.
Early in Lambert’s life when he was in his early twenties he had formed a partnership with his father, and under the firm style of J. W. Lambert & Company, The company was engaged in the manufacture of fork handles and spokes. In the later part of 1891 he moved to Ohio City, Ohio after failing in his initial attempt to make and sell "horseless carriages." There he ran an agricultural implement store, a grain elevator and a lumber yard. In 1893 Lambert came to Anderson, Indiana moving some of his machinery there. This was the nucleus for the factory plant he made in Anderson. The factory covered of brick construction and was equipped with modern machinery of the day. The company Lambert ran made farm implement equipment and stationary gasoline engines for farms and other commercial uses. In 1893 the company was incorporated under the firm name of the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company and the Buckeye Manufacturing Company. He employed about 250 people at the time. 
The factory tooled up with equipment for the manufacture of automobiles in 1900 with the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company making the automobile engines and the Buckeye Manufacturing Company making the other automobile parts. The officers of the companies were B. F. Lambert as the president, George A. Lambert as the secretary, and John Lambert the treasurer and general manager. The capital stock of the companies was $100,000, which would be millions in 2008 dollars.
Before the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company built automobile motors they manufactured stationary engines. A partial description of the Lambert gasoline stationary engines were described in "Gas, Gasoline and Oil-engines" written by Gardner Dexter Hiscox in 1910 as: 
There was a "Leaflet" given out by the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company on their engines giving directions to the operator. It was a guide to their gasoline engines giving special instructions for how the internal action of the engine was performing by just the sound of how it was operating.

When You're Strange

"When You're Strange" is a 2009 documentary about the Doors. It is written and directed by Tom DiCillo and for the first time makes material from Jim Morrison's 1969 film fragment "" publicly available.
Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek has stated that "This will be the true story of the Doors," and that the film will be "the anti-Oliver Stone," referring to the 1991 film about the group that Stone directed, and which drew criticism from many Doors fans and several people who knew Morrison. Manzarek's comment is a bit confusing, however. Stone's film was a dramatization of real-life events, unlike "When You're Strange", which is a documentary.
Production.
The documentary was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2009. It received somewhat favorable reviews from that showing, but the narration (by director DiCillo) was singled out by most viewers as very seriously flawed for its monotonic delivery. Due to the rash of complaints about the narration, Johnny Depp was hired to redub it. A few months later, DiCillo pronounced the film "just about locked" and announced that there would be a showing of the new "redux" version. It debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival on Sunday, June 21, 2009. 
The completed film was also shown at the London Film Festival on October 16-18, 2009. The film was released in theaters on April 9, 2010, with a on April 6, 2010. It was released in Canada on April 15, 2010. PBS showed this film as part of its series "American Masters" on May 12, 2010. The film was released on DVD on June 29, 2010. In France the film, distributed by MK2, was released under its original title and received an excellent reception.
Reception.
Doors guitarist Robby Krieger believes that the film puts together a more accurate portrayal of Morrison than the 1991 biopic; "‘I think when you see the Oliver Stone movie – I'm amazed how good Val Kilmer did – but, you know, the problem with that movie is that the script was kind of stupid. It doesn't really capture how Jim was at all. This gives you a much better insight into how his mind worked, I think.’"
Overall Krieger felt ‘really happy’ about how the film has turned out, crediting in particular the editing work.
The surviving members of the band decided not to get too involved in the project to try to get the right neutral balance that an outsider would try to achieve." 
The film was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Series following its airing on "American Masters" on PBS. In December 2010 the film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video and subsequently won the award in February 2011.

<doc id="20771463" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20771463" title="Spray foams (insulation)">
Spray foams (insulation)

Spray foam insulation is an alternative to traditional building insulation such as fiberglass. A two-component mixture composed of isocyanate and polyol resin comes together at the tip of a gun, and forms an expanding foam that is sprayed onto roof tiles, concrete slabs, into wall cavities, or through holes drilled in into a cavity of a finished wall. 
History.
Polyurethane, the most common type of spray foam insulation, was developed and used by the military in the 1940s and applied to airplanes. It wasn't until the 1970s that it started to be used as foam insulation. 
Various systems are used to apply the spray foam. The two component high pressure system is generally used in new home construction. It is a quick expanding type of spray foam. The two component low pressure spray foam is another system that is used primarily for remodel jobs where there are existing walls with drywall already in place. This is also known as a slow rise formula and often referred to as injection foam.
Types.
Spray foam comes in different types.
Spray foam insulation can be categorized into two different types: open cell and closed cell.
Open cell foam insulation
Open cell is a type of foam where the tiny cells are not completely closed. Open cell is less expensive because it uses fewer chemicals. It is a very good air barrier but does not provide any type of water vapor barrier. It is much more sponge-like in appearance. It is often used for interior walls because it provides sound reduction by damping the movement of existing insulation. It is not recommended for outdoor applications.
Closed cell foam insulation
Closed cell foam insulation is much denser than open cell. It has a smaller, more compact cell structure. It is a very good air barrier as well as a water vapor barrier. It is often used in roofing projects or other outdoor applications, but can be used anywhere in the home.
Benefits.
Spray foam insulation saves on energy costs and lowers utility bills. Studies by the US Department of Energy show that 40% of a home's energy is lost as the result of air infiltration through walls, windows and doorways. Buildings treated with spray foam insulation typically insulate as much as 50% better than traditional insulation products.
Insulation that is sprayed in buildings protects against moisture, which provides the benefit of reducing the chance of harmful mold and mildew. Eliminating mold growth reduces the likelihood of rotting wood in a home, and allergic reactions to mold spores. 
In addition to building temperature and moisture control, spray foam insulation is often used to reduce noise. Foam insulation serves as a barrier to airborne sounds, and reduces airborne sound transfer through a building's roof, floor and walls.
In the United States, homes treated with spray foam insulation often qualify for state and federal tax deductions.
Thermal resistance.
R-value is the term given to thermal resistance to heat flow. The higher the R-value of an insulation product, the more effective the insulation properties. 1.8-2 pound polyurethane foam has the highest R-value of readily available insulation used in homes and buildings.
Polyurethane is a closed-cell foam insulation material that contains a low-conductivity gas in its cells. As a result of the high thermal resistance of the gas, spray polyurethane insulation typically has an R-value around R-5 to R-6 per inch. In comparison, blown fiberglass typically has an R-Value of only R-2 to R-4 per inch.
Foam insulation blocks all three forms of heat transfer.
Conductive heat transfer
The flow of thermal energy through a substance from a higher to a lower temperature region. Foam thermoset plastics block conductive heat transfer due in part to having very loose molecular bonds; In addition the cells of the installed spray foam are either filled with air in the case of open cell foam or 245fa in closed cell foam.
Radiant heat transfer
The process by which heat energy in the form of light (usually IR unless the substrate is hot enough to glow in the visible range) is emitted more strongly by warm surfaces and absorbed by other materials especially those of low IR reflectivity (think matte black finish). Radiant heat transfer does not require a medium. Thermoset foams, such as spray foam insulation, have the ability to reflect radiant heat. This is due to the reflective (shiny, in terms of IR) surfaces within the cell structure of the foam.
Convective heat transfer
Heat which is created elsewhere that is transported by means of a fluid, such as water or in our case air.Spray foam insulation's most important attribute is the ability to air seal creating a custom airtight envelope within the building structure. The added benefit to air sealing is the ability to block convective heat transfer from interior to exterior during heating months and vice versa during cooling months, as the heat cannot escape through gaps in the buildings envelope without the aid of air movement from infiltration as a means of transport.
Disadvantages.
Health effects.
Isocyanates are powerful irritants to the eyes and gastrointestinal as well as the respiratory tracts. Direct skin contact with isocyanates can also cause marked inflammation. Some people say that their eyes feel like they have sand in them at the onset of problems. Some break out in a rash on their arms, chest, and neck. 
Overexposure to isocyanates can sensitize workers, making them subject to asthma attacks if they are exposed again. Respiratory irritation may progress to a chemical bronchitis. Additional exposures can make the onset easier with less isocyanate necessary to start the attack.
Sporadic cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) have also been reported in workers exposed to isocyanates. The symptoms may seem like the flu, with fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Other symptoms may include a dry cough, chest tightness, and difficult breathing. Individuals with chronic HP often experience progressively more difficult breathing, fatigue, and weight loss. Individuals with acute HP typically develop symptoms 4-6 hours after exposure.
Quality foams in recent years have nearly eliminated some or most of these problems.
Spray foam insulation is typically non-toxic only after it has cured. While curing spray foam emits a gas that causes blurred vision and trouble breathing. Using full face and respiratory protection while applying the product is recommended. After being sprayed, it expands to roughly 100 times its original volume. As a result, it is able to fill vacant air gaps, and will expand and contract in relation to the building.
Expansion damage.
Expanding foams are in some cases able to exert considerable force on anything that tries to contain them.
Damage to roofs.
Foam has often been applied to the underside of timber framed roofs, primarily as a cure for slate slippage on old roofs with decaying nails. But this can cause serious structural problems. Water reaching the timber structure is no longer able to drain & evaporate away, and timber can saturate and rot. The foam makes inspection of the timber structure impractical.
The adhesion between foam and slate also makes later reuse of the slates impossible, adding significant extra cost to the eventual reroof. Because of these two problems, spray foam lining timber framed roofs is now regarded as bad practice in the UK.
Asphalt roof manufacturers recommend against using spray foam directly on the under-side of roof sheathing called a hot roof. The lack of ventilation allows high heat buildup which is the primary cause of deterioration in asphalt shingles.
Danger of explosions.
Due to propellant gas emission using spray foam in small rooms is highly dangerous. After the use of only few cans without venting the room there is enough gas (propane/butane) to be lit by the sparks of a drill or vacuum cleaner causing a heavy explosion.
Environmental properties.
Insulation of all types stop a good deal of energy loss. Some types including spray foams also seal air leaks. Insulation can also save energy in hot climates by reducing air conditioning use.
Spray foam insulation levels vary, with some providing up to an R-value of 6.7 per inch.

Left without being seen

Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) is a healthcare term often used by emergency departments (ED) to designate a patient encounter that ended with the patient leaving the healthcare setting before the patient could be seen by a certified physician. Often the inclusion of this phrase in a medical record is the result of ED overcrowding (i.e. the patient could no longer wait in the ED to be seen by a physician, so they left without alerting a healthcare professional). Typically, those patients who leave an emergency department without being seen are not at an increased risk of death, and often do not require inpatient hospital admission.

Lambert friction gearing disk drive transmission

The Lambert friction gearing disk drive transmission was invented by John William Lambert originally in 1904. The invention relates to a friction disk drive transmission for automobiles that is gearless. He saw the need for a simple transmission of engine power to an automobile's drive wheels. 
Description.
The main or driving disk is faced with a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, "In practice I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of a high degree of efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum."
The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving. 
The aluminum disk was twenty-two inches in diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just over a quarter of an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen inches in diameter with a working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.
The speed regulation was done by a steel bell crank, forked and carrying a U-shaped shoe to engage the grooved hub on the driving wheel at one end, and having the other end linked to the speed change and reversing lever. The wheel slid freely on the sleeve when moved away from the disk. All the speeds, from the highest to the lowest, could be done in either direction. The Lambert transmission always used side chains to the rear wheels and a balance gear connected to the splined sleeve on which the wheel slide and a steel shaft which supported the sleeve. The key feature of the Lambert automobile was the friction disk drive carried over from the Union automobile. 
Lambert applied for a patent on this transmission which became No. 761,384 finalized May 31, 1904. The patent has six claims:
"1. In a power-transmitting mechanism, the combination, of a pair of shafts, a friction-disk carried by each shaft, one disk having a bearing part of aluminium and the oth er a fiber part bearing upon said aluminium bearing part."
"2. In power-transmitting mechanism, the combination of a drive-shaft and a driven shaft, a friction-disk carried by each shaft, the face of one disk being provided with an aluminium bearing-plate detachably secured thereto and the attaching means being outside of the usual working area of the bearing-plate against which the periphery of the other disk bears."
"3. In a power-transmitting, mechanism, the combination of a driving-shaft, a friction-disk on said shaft bearing a face of aluminium, and a driven shaft carrying a friction-disk, a fiber periphery secured to said disk and adapted to bear on the aluminium face of the driving-disk."
"4. In a power-transmitting mechanism, the combination with a driving-shaft, a friction-disk carried thereby, a bearing-plate of aluminium for said disk, means for detachably securing said aluminium plate to the face of said driving-disk, a driven shaft, the means for attaching the aluminium plate to the driving-disk being outside of the usual working area of the disk, a disk mounted thereon, a fiber periphery secured to said disk and adapted to bear on the aluminium face of said driving-disk."
"5. In a friction-transmitting mechanism, a wheel having a frictional surface of aluminium."
"6. In a frictional gearing, the combination with a friction-disk having a surface of aluminium, of a transmitting-disk having an elastic frictional surface bearing upon said aluminium surface."
1910 invention.
The improved 1910 invention, patent No. 954,977, made additional improvements to the original friction driving mechanism and had the following claims:
1. "Power transmission mechanism including a power transmitting wheel, rigid pins projecting from the side thereof parallel with the axis of the wheel; a longitudinally movable shaft independent of and coaxial with said wheel, rigid arms projecting radially from said shaft near said wheel and provided with ball sockets, balls fitting in said sockets so as to be slidable on said pins, and means insertible in each socket for 
tightening the ball therein, whereby said shaft may have longitudinal movement and the parts have no angular play."
2. "Friction power transmission mechanism including a power transmitting wheel, a longitudinally movable shaft independent of and coaxial with said wheel, rigid pins projecting from the side of said wheel, rigid arms extending radially from said shaft near said wheel with their outer ends apertured and split, one end of the apertured portion of each arm being contracted and having a concave bearing surface, a ball adapted to fit in the aperture of each arm against said bearing surface and surrounding said pin so as to be slidable thereon, a tubular plug screwed into each arm with a concave bearing surface on the inner end to engage said ball, and means for clamping the split end of each arm."

<doc id="20771568" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20771568" title="Cochrane's Craft">
Cochrane's Craft

Cochrane’s Craft, which is also known as Cochranianism, is a tradition of the Neopagan religion of Witchcraft founded in 1951 by the English Witch Robert Cochrane, who himself claimed to have been taught it by some of his elderly family members, a claim that is disputed by some historians such as Ronald Hutton and Leo Ruickbie. 
Cochranianism revolved around the veneration of the Horned God and the Mother Goddess, alongside seven polytheistic deities which are viewed as children of the God and Goddess. Cochranian Witchcraft has several features that separate it from other traditions such as Gardnerian Wicca, such as its emphasis on mysticism and philosophy, and Cochrane's attitude that it was not pagan, but only based upon paganism.
Beliefs.
Deities.
As in most forms of Neopagan Witchcraft, Cochranians worship both a Horned God and a Triple Goddess. The Goddess is viewed as the White Goddess, a term taken from Robert Graves' poem, "The White Goddess". She is also viewed as a triad of three mothers or three sisters, which both Cochrane and Evan John Jones noted as having similarities with the Wyrd sisters or Norns of Germanic paganism.
In Cochrane's Craft, the God is associated with fire, the underworld and time, and has been described as "the goat-god of fire, craft, lower magics, fertility and death". The God was known by several names, most notable Tubal Cain, Bran, Wayland and Herne. Cochrane's tradition held that these two deities had a son, the Horn Child, who was a young sun god.
Cochrane, like Gardner, believed that there was a being beyond the God and the Goddess; the Godhead, although he referred to this deity as "the Hidden Goddess". He also referred to it as "Truth".
Mythology.
Cochrane told of a cosmogony myth, which involved Night, "a feminine being with force, but without form, giving birth to man and with him she discovered love, and so all things began". He said that the Elder Gods had seven children who each created a realm to rule over from a castle, as well as creating the elements of earth, air, fire and water, each of which had a god ruling over it.
Philosophy.
In a letter to occultist William G. Gray, Cochrane said:
Practices.
Cochranians wear robes whilst performing rituals.
Origin.
Around the time that the British 1735 Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, and it became legal to practice witchcraft in the United Kingdom, Cochrane, who was in his early twenties, founded a coven, and named it the "Clan of Tubal Cain" after the Biblical figure Tubal Cain (the first blacksmith), as a reference to his work in that profession.
Cochrane initiated his wife Jane and several others into the craft, and they then joined the coven. Among these was Evan John Jones, who would later become an author upon the subject of pagan witchcraft. Jones had met Cochrane through his wife Jane, as they both worked at the same company.
The group performed their rituals either at Cochrane's house, or, more often, at Burnham Beeches, though they also performed rituals at the South Downs, after which they would stay the night at Doreen Valiente's flat in Brighton.
Describing his creation of his Witchcraft tradition, one of its later adherents, Shani Oates, remarked that "Like any true craftsman, he was able to mold raw material into a magical synthesis, creating a marvelous working system, at once instinctively true and intrinsically beautiful."

<doc id="20771604" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20771604" title="Supracondylar humerus fracture">
Supracondylar humerus fracture

A supracondylar fracture is a fracture, usually of the distal humerus just above the epicondyles, although it may occur elsewhere. While relatively rare in adults it is one of the more common fractures to occur in children and is often associated with the development of serious complications.
Classification.
It may be of a flexion type or an extension type, depending upon the displacement of the distal fragment of bone.
Extension type:
The most common type, accounting for 95% of all supracondylar fractures. The distal fragment is displaced posteriorly.
Flexion type:
The least common variety (5%), where the distal fragment is displaced anteriorly relative to the proximal segment.
Displacements:
The displacements may present in one of a number of ways: posterior shift, posterior tilt, lateral or medial shift, proximal shift or internal rotation.
There are three types based on the degree of separation of the fractured fragments. 
According to a website for orthopedic surgeons, “This is the most common elbow fracture in children, about 60% of fractures in children. It is most common in children <10, peak incidence is between the ages of 5-8 years of age. Primarily in children who are around age 7 years, which is often a period of maximum ligamentous laxity; therefore, the elbow hyperextends when the child tries to catch himself or herself during a fall. During the hyperextension process, the olecranon (elbow bone) process is forced against the weaker, immature metaphyseal bone of the distal humerus, producing the typical extension-type supracondylar fracture”.
Presentation.
Presenting complaints:
The child presents with history of a falling on an outstretched hand followed by pain, swelling and inability to move the affected elbow.
On examination:
Unusual prominence of olecranon process but because it is a supracondylar fracture, the three bony point relationship is maintained, as in a normal elbow.
Neurovascular complications.
(a) tear or entrapment of the brachial artery; (b) spasm of the artery and (c) compression of the artery relieved by manipulation of the fracture (d) compression of median nerve.
Causing Pink and Pulseless hand in supra condylar fracture.
Thus there is loss of circulation of forearm, causing lack of reperfusion of tissues resulting in tissue death causing compartment syndrome.
Therefore the complications of elbow dislocations include the following:
Mechanism.
The fracture is caused by fall on an outstretched hand in 70% of cases. As the hands hits the ground, the elbow is hyperextended resulting in fracture above the condyles. This fracture is most commonly seen in children between the ages of 5-15 yrs. It is a very important clinical condition where medical attention is necessary.
There are two ways supracondylar fractures occur, high impact on a hyperextended elbow or a supracondylar flexion of more than 90 degrees.
Fractures of the distal humerus are most commonly due to a falling on your hand with arms fully extended, causing direct trauma to the elbow. The distal condylar complex would shift in either the posterolateral or posteromedial direction, which account for approximately 95% of supracondylar fractures.
The remaining 5% of these fractures result from a direct blow to the posterior aspect when the elbow is flexed more than 90°. In these cases, the distal condylar complex is more likely to displace in the anterolateral direction.
Patho-anatomy.
The fracture lines extend transversely through the distal end above the condyles.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis is usually by X-ray. The fracture can however be difficult to identify and often a joint effusion is used to increase one's suspicion of the presence of a fracture. The existence of an effusion can be determined by the presence of the sail sign.
Upon examination the doctor will evaluate the arm for signs of damage to the nerves and blood vessels; they will look for swelling and deformity. This will allow the doctor to determine a likely diagnosis. Damage to the elbow is a common injury in children; injuries to blood supply of the arm may necessitate early surgical intervention.
Most of the supracondylar fractures are minor and require a period of rest, analgesia and compression prior to graduated formal rehabilitation.
In the event of a more severe injury, the fracture will be visible on an x-ray. It is important in diagnosis to understand the dynamics of an x-ray because growth plate fractures may not show up like normal broken bones. It is a good idea to compare the x-ray of the injured elbow to the opposing side for analysis.
If rest does cause the fracture to heal then the child must be referred to a specialist for assessment of the injury.
Treatment.
Surgery leads to improved outcome of "displaced" factures.

Education.
Schmidt-Ott had a degree in law.
Career.
From 1888, Schmidt-Ott was at the "Preußisches Kultusministerium" (PrKM, Prussian Culture Ministry), officially the "Preußisches Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Kunst und Volksbildung" Prussuan Ministry of Science, Arts, and Culture. For many years, he was assistant to Friedrich Althoff. From 1903, Schmidt-Ott was head of the arts division, and from 1917, he was the "Preußischen Kultusminister" (Prussian Minister of Culture).
From 1911 to 1919, Schmidt-Ott was on the boards of trustees of all the institutes of the "Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft" (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society). From 1920 to 1937, Schmidt-Ott was second vice-president (practically, acting vice president) of the KWG and then honorary member of the supervisory board of the society.
The "Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft" (NG, Emergency Association of German Science) was founded on 30 October 1920 on the initiative of leading members of the "Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften" (PAW, Prussian Academy of Sciences.) – Fritz Haber, Max Planck, and Ernst von Harnack – and the former "Preußischen Kultusminister" Friedrich Schmidt-Ott. The physicist Heinrich Konen, due to his relationship with Schidt-Ott, was involved in the founding and organization, and he became a longstanding member of its main committee. Members of the NG included all German universities, all polytechnics ("Technische Hochschulen"), the five scientific academies, and the "Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft". From 1920 to 1934 Schmidt-Ott was president of the NG, when he was then succeeded by Johannes Stark, who was a supporter of the "deutsche Physik" movement. When Minister Bernhard Rust of the "Reichserziehungsministerium" (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) fired Schmit-Ott from the presidency of the NG, he told Schmit-Ott it was on the personal order of Adolf Hitler.
From 1934 to 1945, Schmidt-Ott was chairman of the "Stifterverband der Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft" (Donor Federation of the Emergency Association of German Science), founded in 1920 to collect donations for the "Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft".

The invaders decided to abandon the older city of Sirkap and build a newer city on the other side of the Lundi-nala. The wall of the city is about 5 kilometers long and about 5.4 meters thick. The city wall covers an area of around 2300 x 1000 meters seen along the east-west direction, and is laid out in a typical Central Asian style, complete with suburbs. Sirsukh was left uninhabited when the White Huns invaded the Punjab at the end of the fifth century CE. To the north-east of the city flows the Harro river whereas to the south the Lundi-ravine is present.
The ancient city was excavated only on a very small scale in 1915-16 CE, and further excavation work has been impeded by a high water table which threatens the integrity of ancient structures. It was included in the World Heritage List of the UNO in 1980 as part of Taxila.
Wall.
The wall of the city is made of large stone bricks with smaller stone bricks in-between the larger ones. It is remarkably smooth on the outer side. Circular bastions are present in the wall at small distances for defence. These bastions contain holes for archers who could shoot arrows at the enemy outside.

The UK Kid

Thomas Jones is a British professional wrestler and promoter better known by his ring name The UK Kid. As well as founding his own promotion Varsity Pro Wrestling, Jones has competed in various other professional wrestling promotions in the United Kingdom including All Star Wrestling, LDN Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, Real Quality Wrestling and Catch Wrestling Council.
Career.
Thomas Jones began training at the age of 16 under Kris Kay in Gosport, England. At the age of 18 he moved to San Antonio, Texas to train at the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy (later Texas Wrestling Academy) under Shawn Michaels. He later went on to train at the Dory Funk's Funking Conservatory. Following his training he went on to make his professional wrestling debut in August 1999, and later would make his debut in the United States against Kris Krugar in San Antonio, Texas.
Varsity Pro Wrestling.
In 2006, Jones began running the Varsity Pro Wrestling (VPW) promotion and School of Excellence, performing throughout England as he trained future British stars Chris Andrews, Rob Holte, Robbie Everest, Sam Andrews and others. He also began the training process for WWE superstar, Sheamus. The school runs regular sessions several times per week and features guest trainers such as Bob Holly, Kip James and The Road Dogg several times per year.
Jones' VPW wrestling events have received wide acclaim as the best on the British wrestling circuit, with many former WWE wrestlers on the roster including Bob 'Hardcore' Holly, former D-Generation X member The Road Dogg, D'Lo Brown, Chris Masters, Kip James (AKA Billy Gunn), Shawn Daivari and Al Snow.
In 2007, Jones made an unsuccessful pitch for investment in VPW on the BBC Two show "Dragon's Den".
In February 2008, Jones, as the UK Kid, worked an angle on a VPW event in Portsmouth with Billy Gunn, interfering after Gunn's match, beating him with a chair and leaving him bleeding. Gunn vowed revenge on the next VPW Portsmouth show, though it came at the hands of another individual. When a change to Gunn's contractual status with TNA made him incapable of attending the VPW show in May, he sent long-time friend Bob Holly to "teach the UK Kid a lesson", something that Holly accomplished in a tables, ladders and chairs match held in front of over 600 rabid fans.
This highly successful event was followed up with a return to the Portsmouth Guildhall in August, an event that began with the UK Kid revealing that he had arranged for a 15 foot steel cage to be provided and challenged Holly to a rematch. Holly declined, saying that he had already beaten the Kid in a TLC match, so felt it would be unfair to prevent others on the roster getting a chance to humble Jones' arrogant alter-ego. Holly backed "The Devon Powerhouse" Chris Andrews for the match and offered him support in a backstage interview before the match. In the main event of the show, the UK Kid and Andrews wrestled in the cage for over 20 minutes with Andrews obtaining a large gash on his forehead as a result of the intense action. The resourceful UK Kid eventually managed to fight off Andrews' onslaught long enough to retrieve a roll of electrical tape he had sneaked into the cage before the match, and used it to secure Andrews to the ring ropes. With Andrews immobilised, the UK Kid brought a chair into the ring and began pounding his opponent. Bob Holly, who had defeated Matt Vaughn earlier in the evening and was watching backstage, returned to ringside, entered the cage and snatched the chair away from the UK Kid. A tense moment followed before Holly, to the shock of the audience, began beating the defenceless Andrews. Andy Boy Simmonz, Jason Dunce, Jake McCluskey and a host of VPW officials all attempted to come to Andrews' rescue but were prevented from entering the cage by both Holly and the UK Kid. Eventually the beat-down subsided and Andrews - now a bloody mess - was helped backstage and to a local medical facility.
In October, on the next VPW Guildhall show, The UK Kid and Holly revealed their "International Alliance", explaining that Chris Andrews needed to be put in his place, as he was not an International Superstar like either of them. Andrews brought backup in the form of Billy Gunn's long time tag team partner, The Road Dogg and they issued challenges to Holly and the UK Kid respectively. Later that night, UK Kid defeated The Road Dogg by pinfall, following interference by Bob Holly.
Come February 2010 and the promotion's return to Portsmouth, the evening started badly and just got worse for the UK Kid. During an interview segment, he and Bob Holly belittled teenage sensation "Mr. Moonsault" Jake McCluskey, who had just picked up first VPW victory. An impromptu match followed where McCluskey took advantage of the UK Kid's overconfidence, wrapping him up in a small package for his second victory of the night. In the main event of the evening, Holly and the Kid teamed up in a losing effort against Chris Andrews and Billy Gunn. 
The following evening in Basingstoke saw the UK Kid gain a measure of revenge, pinning Billy Gunn in a singles match but later being on the losing team in a six man tag match between himself, Bob Holly and Rob Holte facing Gunn, Jake McCluskey and Chris Andrews.
Work for other promotions.
In August 2006 The UK Kid teamed with Charlie Rage to lose to The Big Show in a handicap match at Wembley Arena, London for WWE.
On August 28, 2008 at Scottish School of Wrestling's "Tainted Tradition" event The UK Kid won the SPWO UK Championship after defeating 9 other men in a 10-man Battle royal.
On April 17, 2012, the UK Kid wrestled a dark match for WWE at the London tapings of "SmackDown", losing to Antonio Cesaro.

Christopher Gadsden (bishop)

Christopher Edwards Gadsden (November 25, 1785 – June 24, 1852) was the fourth Episcopal Bishop of South Carolina. 
Gadsden was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1785, the son of Phillip Gadsden and his wife, Catherine Edwards. He was a grandson of Christopher Gadsden, the South Carolina Revolutionary leader. As a youth, he attended both the Episcopal Church of his father and his mother's Congregational Church. He married Eliza Bowman in 1816. She died in 1826, and Gadsden remarried in 1830 to Jane Dewees, the youngest daughter of William Dewees. He had no children by his first marriage, but had eight with his second wife.
Beginning in his junior year, Gadsden attended Yale University, graduating in 1804. He was ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1807 by Bishop Moore, and in 1810 was ordained priest by Bishop Madison. Soon thereafter, he became rector of St. John's Church in Berkeley County, South Carolina. In 1814, Gadsden became rector of St. Philip's Church in Charleston, the oldest congregation in the diocese. He received a doctorate of divinity the following year from South Carolina College.
In 1840, after the death of Bishop Bowen, a dispute arose in the diocese over who would succeed him. Gadsden was elected, and was consecrated bishop in Trinity Church in Boston. Gadsden was the 35th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated by Alexander Viets Griswold, George Washington Doane, and Samuel Allen McCoskry. Gadsden was active in expanding the membership of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, usually visiting each congregation once a year. In 1852, at the diocese convention, he announced that ill health would prevent him from continuing his ministry, and he died shortly thereafter, in June of that year.

<doc id="20771923" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20771923" title="Ken Wright (auto racing mechanic)">
Ken Wright (auto racing mechanic)

Kenneth W. Wright was born in 1940 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and was a race car driver and mechanic for, among other teams, Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), the first African American auto racing team to acquire national sponsorship in the United States.
Early years.
Wright's friendship with the Miller brothers - Dexter G. and Leonard W. - began at age five. His love of hot rods and race cars began in earnest at age 13, when Leonard W. Miller would visit his community in a 1940 Ford hot rod convertible. Riding in the car, and watching the advanced modifications made to the motor, sparked Wright's interest in becoming a full-time automotive technician after graduating from Conestoga High School in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. He took every auto class offered in the school.
In 1956, Wright co-founded the Black Hawk Auto Club, with Horace “Buddy” Sparrow and other African American youth living in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood of Wayne, Pennsylvania. In 1957, a trip with the club to the York Dragway in York, Pennsylvania piqued his interest in becoming a drag racer.
After high school, he began his apprenticeship training at Sharpless Auto Body in Devon, Pennsylvania, where he learned all aspects of automotive collision repair. After learning the basics, he attended the Spring Garden Institute of Technology in Philadelphia, along with Dexter Miller. He graduated in 1962. After graduation he was employed at Horsiey’s Automotive Service Center in Narberth, Pennsylvania.
In the midst of the Civil Rights era and the Vietnam War, Wright’s skills were extremely rare among African Americans. He was one of only a few to hold jobs in the auto body trade at a mainstream facility in one of the wealthiest regions of America. Citizens in the community, including African Americans, would note Wright’s capacity at every pass.
Educator.
In 1966 Wright joined the School District of Philadelphia, where he taught automotive collision repair to adults aged 18–35 at the John F. Kennedy Center for Vocational Education. While employed by the district, he obtained a B.S. in education from Temple University in 1979. He retired from the district in 2002.
Race car driver.
In 1969-70, Wright drove a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) 1955 Chevrolet station wagon to dozens of track victories for Miller Brothers Racing at Atco Dragway in Atco, New Jersey, Englishtown Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base drag strip in Burlington County, New Jersey, and the Maple Grove Raceway in Mohnton, Pennsylvania.
Black American Racers Association (BARA).
When Leonard W. Miller helped launch the Black American Racers Association (BARA) in 1972, Wright became a charter member. Through this unique group, which comprised 5,000 African American auto racers from coast to coast and encompassed drag racing teams, mechanics, car collectors, and participants in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) sports car competition, Wright met Ron Hines, a founding member of BARA, and African American NASCAR legend Wendell Scott.
Road racing mechanic.
In 1973, Wright and Hines joined forces with Miller’s Brown & Williamson Tobacco (Viceroy Cigarettes)-sponsored Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR) team that fielded second-generation African American driver Benny Scott in Formula Super Vee (FSV) road racing on circuits such as Pocono Raceway, Lime Rock Park, Watkins Glen International, and Road Atlanta.
Ken Wright’s broad base of other technical skills, including painting, welding, tuning motors, rebuilding transmissions and rear ends, and complete suspension work, transferred readily to BAR’s initiatives. Wright prepared the Lola T-324 and T-620. He became a loyalist of the team and was critical to its extraordinary milestones through the 1970s - a period some call “the last decade of the golden era of American road racing.”
Wright remained on the BAR team after Viceroy’s unmatched sponsorship expired in late 1975. He was a VIP guest for Benny Scott’s and Leonard W. Miller’s induction into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame at the New York Hilton in Manhattan in 1976. The event’s master of ceremonies was actor Bill Cosby. Celebrities among the more than 1000 attendees at the formal extravaganza included African American female track star Wilma Rudolph, legendary soul singer James Brown, boxing promoter Don King, ABC television sports commentator Howard Cosell, and boxing legend Jersey Joe Walcott.
Leonard W. Miller started an independent effort in FSV racing after African American driver Tommy Thompson persuaded him to continue the BAR concept in 1977. Ken Wright was a critical component of that team, helping it advance to an SCCA Northeast Championship at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania.
The team, including Ken Wright, traveled to the Milwaukee Mile to race on the famed one-mile oval. FSV racing transitioned into the Mini-Indy series, where select races were paired with Indy Car events held on popular oval courses under the United States Auto Club (USAC). Wright also traveled to Texas World Speedway in College Station, Texas and other FSV races around the country that BAR entered.
At a Mini-Indy event on September 27, 1978, Tommy Thompson was killed in a crash coming off the fourth turn at the 1.5-mile kidney bean-shaped Trenton Speedway, when a competitor abruptly stopped in front of him, due to a catastrophic mechanical failure.
Retirement.
Ken Wright retired from hands-on mechanical race car preparation after Thompson’s death, working instead with recreational motor boats and restoring his 1961 Chevrolet Corvette.
For two years BAR did not compete in auto racing, then it started afresh in grassroots competition under other names. Ken Wright remained a booster for the team, but Ron Hines emerged from retirement in 1980 to catapult BAR into several dirt track victories with his superior engine knowledge at the Flemington Speedway in Flemington, New Jersey with 19-year-old African American driver Bruce Driver.
In later years Miller Racing Group, Inc. became the solid outgrowth of BAR, recruiting African American grassroots stock car drivers for NASCAR competition in the Southeast and a Jamaican driver for Formula BMW Americas from 1990 to the present. Leonard W. Miller’s son, Leonard T. Miller, has been a significant element in those efforts.
Ken Wright, Ron Hines, and Leonard W. Miller remain in close contact, attending and entering classic car shows and competitions around the United States.

Bill Boddy

William "Bill" Boddy, MBE (22 February 1913 – 7 July 2011) was a British journalist who was the editor of "Motor Sport" from 1936 to 1991. After 1991 he still contributed regularly to "Motor Sport" magazine, continuing a career that lasted eighty-one years.
Career.
His first published article, in "Motor Sport" in 1930, was on the history of the Brooklands track where he had first gone in 1927. He worked with "Brooklands Track & Air" for two and half years from 1931. Bill Boddy drove the original HRG sports car, 1,497 c.c., at the Lewes Speed Trials on 4 September 1937 with a best time of 27.4 sec, finishing third in the novices class. Boddy entered his Lancia at the Prescott opening rally on 10 April 1938; his 1924 Aston Martin being commended by the judges in the Best Kept Car Competition. He also entered the Lancia 1,352 c.c. at the first Prescott speed hillclimb on 15 May 1938. Sydney Allard won the last speed event to be held in England prior to World War Two. Having set the fastest time at the Horndean Speed Trials, his car overturned past the finish line. Both he and his passenger, Bill Boddy, were thrown clear and uninjured.
Throughout World War II he was employed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Farnborough working on Air Publications, but he kept "Motor Sport" going in his spare time for the duration. After the war, he recruited Denis Jenkinson for "Motor Sport" to provide race reports. In February 1946 "Motor Sport" published a four-page "Obituary" for the Brooklands circuit, with the headline: "Built at his own expense for the nation's good, by the late Mr. H. F. Locke King - 1906. Betrayed by bureaucracy and declared an industrial area - 1946." 
He was awarded an MBE in 1997. Boddy leaves three daughters and lived alone after the death of his wife, Winifred.

Halton railway station, Lancashire

Halton railway station served the village of Halton in Lancashire, England. It closed in 1966, but the station building and part of one platform survive beside the cycle path along the disused line.
In reference books the station is sometimes referred to as Halton (Lancs) to distinguish it from another Halton railway station in Cheshire.
History.
The station was opened on 17 November 1849 by the "little" North Western Railway. It was linked to Halton village by a railway-owned narrow toll bridge across the River Lune. A rebuilt version of the bridge is still in use, free of charge.
The original timber station was destroyed by fire on 3 April 1907. A spark from the engine of a passing Heysham– boat train set fire to a wagon of oil drums by the goods shed. The fire brigade were unable to cross the narrow bridge and it was left to a special trainload of railway workers from Lancaster to pass buckets of water from the river. The station was rebuilt in brick and timber and the building survives to this day, used as storage by Lancaster University Rowing Club, with a public car park occupying the former track bed.
The station closed on 3 January 1966, along with the whole line between and Morecambe. No other station survives. Cyclists and walkers can travel along the former line in either direction. Beneath the trackbed, east of the station, can be heard running water that is extracted from the river to an underground pumping station in Quernmore Park.

Herpyllus ecclesiasticus

The spider species Herpyllus ecclesiasticus is commonly called the eastern parson spider, after the abdominal markings resembling an old-style cravat worn by clergy in the 18th century. It is mainly found in Central USA, with finds stretching from North Carolina to southern Alberta, Canada.
Although this spider presents a startling appearance, living indoors as it frequently does, it is not considered harmful. However, some people do have allergic reactions to their bites. This spider has shown solely cursorial hunting behaviour, as opposed to web-spinning methods of prey capture, when reared in lab conditions.

Maria Fortunata d'Este

Maria Fortunata d'Este (24 November 1731 – 21 September 1803) was a Modenese princess by birth and a "princess of the blood of France" by marriage. By her marriage to a second cousin Louis François Joseph de Bourbon, "Prince of Conti", she became the Countess of La Marche and later the Princess of Conti and was a member of the French court of Louis XV and Louis XVI. She was the last Princess of Conti and died without issue.
Biography.
She was born at the Ducal Palace of Modena, the fourth daughter and eighth child of Francesco III d'Este, Duke of Modena, the Sovereign Duke of Modena and his young wife Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans, "Mademoiselle de Valois" — granddaughter of Louis XIV of France and Madame de Montespan. Her older sister Maria Teresa was her eldest surviving sibling followed by her brother the future Ercole III d'Este, Duke of Modena. The rest of her siblings would die unmarried. 
Maria Fortunata was known to have been very pious and at the same time rather timid but charming. Her mother separated from her father in the 1740s after an affair with the Duke of Richelieu was discovered at the Modenese court. Exiled to France, Charlotte Aglaé still managed to help arrange the marriages of two of her daughters. The eldest Maria Teresa Felicitas married her second cousin, the Duke of Penthièvre, the wealthiest man in France and the future in laws of Philippe Égalité. Maria Fortunata also married a cousin, Louis François Joseph de Bourbon, the heir to the Prince of Conti.
Marriage.
As the heir of his father, her husband was known by the courtesy title of "comte de La Marche" at court. The marriage contract was signed in Milan on 3 January 1759 by the French ambassador to the court of Turin. A wedding by proxy took place in Milan on 7 February of the same year. It was celebrated in person on the 27th of February at Nangis-en-Brie in France. Maria Fortunata's father settled upon her a dowry of one million livres. In addition, upon her arrival in France, her husband was given a gift of 150,000 livres from King Louis XV. The young "comtesse de La Marche" was presented to the King, the Queen and the rest of the royal family on 5 March 1759 by the Dowager Princess of Conti, her husbands widowed grandmother as well as her mothers own first cousin. The couple did not get along and never had any children. Many at court said this state of affairs was due to the influence of her husband's mistress, Marie Anne Véronèse, known as "Mademoiselle Coraline". Véronèse had been a dancer at an Italian theatre. Louis François and his mistress had two illegitimate children together, born in 1761 and 1767. In 1768, Maria Fortunata was asked to present her niece Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, "Mademoiselle de Penthièvre", to the King and the court. Her niece would eventually marry Louis "Philippe" Joseph d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, the future "Philipe Égalité", in April 1769.
In 1770, the marriage of the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI, and the Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria took place. "Marie Fortunée", as she was known in France, and her husband were one of twelve couples invited to dine with the newlyweds in the Opéra of the Palace of Versailles, which had been constructed for the royal wedding.
Princess of Conti.
In 1776, Marie Fortunée's father-in-law died making her husband the head of the House of Conti. Pious, discreet and very cultured, Marie Fortunée was not destined to be part of the new Queen's inner circle at Versailles. She maintained very good relations with her brother-in-law, the Duke of Penthièvre, who had lost his wife in 1754. She also got on well with her two nieces, the Princess of Lamballe and the future Duchess of Orléans.
While at the French court, in 1784 she met Gustav III of Sweden, styled incognito as the Count of Haga who was a guest at he Hôtel de Toulouse and later on she met Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great. She also met her niece Maria Beatrice d'Este and her husband Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in 1786. The latter pair were styled as the Count and Countess of Nettembourg. Ferdinand was a son of Empress Maria Theresa.
Exile.
The Conti couple officially separated in 1777 even though they had lived apart since 1775. In 1780, Marie Fortunée acquired the Château de Triel, a place which would become her favourite haunt. During the crisis of 1789, when the Estates General was called at Versailles, Marie Fortunée supported the royal family and even took part in a march to the Church of Saint Louis. She later escaped revolutionary France under the name of the "comtesse de Triel". After first taking refuge in Brussels, Marie Fortunée eventually settled in Chambéry, then a part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1791, she moved again, this time to Fribourg which was a small village in Switzerland known for its large settlement of "émigrés". The town also had strong religious ties, another attraction for the pious princess.
In 1794, she let her great-niece Adélaïde d'Orléans stay with her after her escape from France. Adélaïde's mother, the duchesse d'Orléans, had been imprisoned in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The elderly Marie Fortunée and Adélaïde d'Orléans set up a new home in Bavaria. During the spring of 1800, the pair and their household were forced to flee again to Hungary in oder to avoid the hostilities of Napoleon. It was while in Hungary that she received another visit from her niece, Maria Beatrice. The princess was the heiress of Marie Fortunée's elder brother, who had lost the duchies of Modena and Reggio in 1796 as a result of the Napoleonic creation of the Cispadane Republic.
Death.
1801 saw the reunion of Adélaïde d'Orléans and her mother, the now dowager Duchess of Orléans, in Barcelona after her release from prison and exile from France. Later, Marie Fortunée decided to retire to the "Convent of the Visitation" in Venice. She moved to the convent on 19 October with three of her maids and her faithful friend, the "comtesse des Roches", who had accompanied the princess all throughout her exile in Europe. A victim of pleurisy, the princess died on 21 September 1803 at the age of seventy-one. She was buried in the chapel of the convent. Her brother, Ercole III of Modena, and her sister, Matilda d'Este, are also buried there. 
The "comtesse des Roches" died some time after Marie Fortunée and was also buried there. Marie Fortunée's husband died in 1814.

Niki – Rock 'n' Ball

"Niki – Rock 'n' Ball" is a game produced by Bplus for the WiiWare. It was first released in Europe on and later in North America on . The game runs on 2.5D graphics.
Gameplay.
The game lets players choose between two control style and ways of holding the Wii Remote: vertical or horizontal. Two players can play together using two Wii remotes. While holding the Wii remote vertically, players can tilt the remote left and right to accelerate left or right. Players can jump by swinging the Wii remote up or by pressing A; players can to change Niki into rock form by holding B and back to normal form by releasing B. While holding the remote horizontally players use the left and right buttons on the D-pad to accelerate left or right. Players can press the "2" button to jump, and they can hold the "1" button to transform Niki into rock form; they can release the same button to turn back to normal. Pressing the "+" button pauses the game.
Players must collect all of the six ZeLeLi pearls in proper order and defeat all the monsters to complete a stage and advance in the game. However, new monsters constantly appear on each stage, and players lose a life if any monster touches Niki. If a player takes too long in any given stage, it starts to flood. If the stage gets filled to the top, players lose a life. The game ends when all the players' lives are lost. The stages are not limited by the sides of the screen: if Niki moves off the left side of the screen he appears again at the right hand side. If players finish a level fast enough, they obtain a collectible medal. If players touch a fireball, then they become invincible and become able to jump higher for a short time.
Plot.
The game is set in the far future. In one planetary system all the living creatures have been transformed into balls and attacked by the monsters. Players take control of Niki, who has been turned into a ball and attempt to stand up against the monsters to protect his village. When Niki comes across a mysterious ZeLeLi amulet, which gives him the ability to change into a hard rock, giving him the ability to defeat the monsters. Players must help Niki chase away all the monsters before they become too overwhelming in number and take over his village.
Reception.
The game received generally positive reviews. WiiWare World rated the game with an 8/10, praising the fun gameplay structure, the colorful graphics and the game's various monsters. Citing WiiWare World: "Features like the co-op mode and high score mechanic add replayability so there’s something to come back to after finishing each of the game’s many stages." In the summary, they "highly recommend taking a spin in Niki’s world." Wiiloveit.com gave Niki – Rock 'n' Ball a 24/30 "Very Good," calling it "a real gem with some great controls that just needed a bit of practice, and an art style that really began to work in line with the rest of the game." They positively mention the game's music and conclude with saying that it is "a very good retro-style game that'll keep you going back for more."
In contrast, IGN gave the game a rating of 4.7, saying that the concept is weak, the controls are terrible, and that the art style "screams 'homebrew'". GameSpot, who gave the game a rating of 5.0, also called the controls imprecise and the art style bland. The game holds a score of 44 on Metacritic, meaning that the game received "generally negative reviews".

Pleyel et Cie

Pleyel et Cie ("Pleyel and Company") is a French piano manufacturing firm founded by the composer Ignace Pleyel in 1807. In 1815, he was joined by his son, Camille, as a business partner. The firm provided pianos to Frédéric Chopin, and also ran a concert hall, the Salle Pleyel, where Chopin performed his first – and last – Paris concerts. Pleyel's major contribution to piano development was the first use of a metal frame in a piano. Pleyel pianos were the choice of composers such as Debussy, Saint-Saëns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky and of the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.
History.
Pleyel pioneered the player piano with the Pleyela line of pianos. These were often very small pianos of a very unusual design.
Pleyel was the first to introduce the upright piano to France, adapting the best features of pianos built in Britain. They introduced these pianos by 1815. Their pianos were such a success that in 1834 the company boasted 250 employees and an annual production of 1000 pianos.
The company's success led them to invest in experiments, resulting in the Double Piano in 1890. Although not the first company to experiment with building two pianos into the same frame, Pleyel (who patented it as "Duo-Clave") was by far the most successful and produced the largest instruments. A very small number of Double Pianos were manufactured in the 1890s and continued to be made until the 1920s. CDs can be bought today of performances on some of these pianos.
In 1913, Pleyel built the "Jungle Piano" for use by Albert Schweitzer in his hospital in Lambaréné (French Equatorial Africa – now Gabon). It was fitted pedal attachments (to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard) and built with tropical woods that would acclimate to conditions there.
Toward the end of the 19th century, the Pleyel firm produced the first chromatic harp. In the early 20th century, at the behest of Wanda Landowska, it helped to revive the harpsichord.
Today.
Pleyel continued to manufacture pianos until November, 2013, under the corporate auspices of the Manufacture Française de Pianos company. In the 1980s, the Pleyel company bought out the Erard and Gaveau piano companies which also manufactured pianos in France. The Pleyel pianos of today incorporate improvements of these companies and others. In the last two decades, Pleyel Piano was bought by the same family which had bought the Salle Pleyel concert hall in order to revive the name and quality of Pleyel pianos. They built a new factory in the south of France and started making a line of newly designed and improved pianos. Then, in 2008, they decided to downsize the factory and lines of pianos. They moved the factory back to Paris and opened a new factory where they began introducing new pianos designed by famous designers.
The red spruce used by Pleyel comes from the Fiemme Valley in Trentino, Italy. After a piano is fully assembled, it is moved into a voicing room where an expert with an arcane assortment of tools will spend 30 to 40 hours fine-tuning the instrument. In November 2013, the company announced that it would cease piano manufacture in France.

The Gunslinger (novella)

"The Gunslinger" is a novella by Stephen King, originally published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" in October 1978. In 1982, "The Gunslinger" was collected with four other stories King published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" as "". "The Gunslinger" formed the first chapter of the book, and was slightly revised for the inclusion.
Plot.
The story begins with the sentence, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." The gunslinger comes across a hut in the desert owned by a farmer named Brown, who has a pet raven named Zoltan. The gunslinger stays the night and, at Brown's urging, tells him the story of what happened to him the last time he came across people.
He had been traveling through Tull, the last town before the desert began. He made his way to the local saloon and learned from Allie, its bartender, that the town drunk Nort had died from eating narcotic devil-grass. The man in black (calling himself "Walter O'Dim") brought Nort back to life and told Allie that if she said a particular word to Nort, he would tell her everything he saw and heard during his time in the afterlife. Sensing that Walter had laid a trap for both him and Allie, the gunslinger warned her never to say the trigger word in Nort's hearing.
He next met and interrogated Sylvia Pittston, a fanatical preacher who believed that the man in black had impregnated her with the offspring of the Crimson King. She warned her congregation to beware of the gunslinger, referring to him as a malicious "Interloper," and eventually stirred the entire town to attack him. Even Allie joined the mob, having fallen into Walter's trap and gone insane from Nort's revelations. The gunslinger killed all 58 residents of Tull, then headed out into the desert.
After telling Brown his story, the gunslinger fills his water skins and continues across the desert, in pursuit of his quarry.
Among other minor additions and deletions made by King for the 2003 revised version of the novella, the word "parsecs" in the opening paragraph was changed to "eternity," and the story of Tull is expanded by King to include an additional exchange between Allie and Walter.

Teacher's Highland Cream

Teacher's Highland Cream is a brand of blended scotch whisky produced in Glasgow by the American company Beam Inc. Teacher's Highland Cream blend was registered in 1884. Teacher's uses over 45% single malt, with Ardmore single malt being the main scotch in its blend to make Teacher's Highland Cream blended Scotch. It also uses over 30 different single malt whiskies.
In 1830, William Teacher took advantage of the new "Excise Act" and began selling his whisky. From 1832 he was selling it from his wife's grocery shop in Glasgow. By 1856, with help from his sons, he was granted a licence for consumption and opened his own dram shop. William died in 1876, leaving his two sons William Jr. and Adam in charge. They moved the business to St. Enoch Square where it remained until 1991. Teacher's opened their Ardmore single malt facility in 1898, ensuring a guaranteed supply of scotch for their Teacher's Highland Cream blend. With the end of Prohibition in the United States, Teacher's sent its first shipment on the Cunard steamer "Scythia". Teacher's acquired the Glendronach distillery in 1957, to meet the growing demand for blended scotch. With this increase in demand, Teacher's built a modern blending and bottling plant in Glasgow in 1962. During 1976, William Teacher & Sons Ltd. joined Allied Distillers.

Encuentro Beach, Dominican Republic

Encuentro Beach is an isolated stretch of beach in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic. Located between the more heavily populated cities of Sosúa and Cabarete this popular surfing beach is accessible to the public via dirt roads.
Encuentro Beach consists of five distinctive breaks:
Coco Pipe is a serious, powerful and hollow reefbreak which favors high tide and North or Northwest swell. This wave is almost always bigger than it looks from the beach, with a heavy vertical drop. This was first surfed by Bam Rossiter, who managed to ride a 589ft wave fakie.
Bobo's Point is a series of consistent peaks with a hollow but easy take off. It is powerful when overhead and best at low to mid tide on a Northeast swell.
La Derecha, meaning "the right", is the North Coast's most consistent surf spot. Two peaks, outside and inside with two distinct take off zones, and a reef that breaks like a point combine to create a wave that breaks with any swell direction and any size.
Destroyer is a powerful, hollow and shallow left, over a sharp reef. This dangerous wave breaks best at 8 to 10 feet (3 meters).

Hugh Audley

Hugh Audley (baptised 13 January 1577 – 15 November 1662), also known as "The Great Audley", was an English moneylender, lawyer and philosopher. Following his death, he was the feature of a popular 17th century pamphlet titled "The way to be rich according to the practice of the Great Audley", which compared his humble beginnings to his ultimate fortune.
The first recorded date of Audley's life is his baptism in January 1577. He was the tenth of eleven children of John Audley, a mercer, and his wife Maudlin or Margaret Hare, daughter of a wealthy Cheapside mercer named John Hare. His father died in 1579, and left "considerable property, both real and personal". After being admitted to the Inner Temple in 1603, he became a clerk of the Court of Wards and Liveries, a position for which he allegedly paid £3000, until it was abolished in 1660. In his position, he became extremely rich, and survived a £100,000 loss after the court's suppression in 1646. However, all the money and records remained in his possession long after this event.
Through his wealth, Audley was able to buy and invest in land. He bought the manor of Ebury, in Westminster, from Lionel Cranfield, the first Earl of Middlesex. Deeply in debt, the Earl sold it cheaply, but had a negative opinion of Audley himself, whom he described as "barbarous", with "looks show his disposition", and one who bore himself "loftily respectless and peremptory". The property later passed through his great-grandniece, Mary Davies, wife of Sir Thomas Grosvenor. Her inheritance enriched the Grosvenor family through one of Audley's legacies, which still present today: Audley Street, running through the old Ebury estate in Mayfair, is named after Hugh. On another occasion, when he bought land in Buckenham, Norfolk, Audley withheld the payments promised and harassed the creditors with law suits. His cunning was revealed and condemned by William Hone, who described an incident with a draper with a £200 debt. Audley bought the debt, for which the draper offered him £50; but Audley refused. Instead, he forced the draper to sign a contract ordering him to pay a penny, doubled every month, for twenty years, which gradually accumulated into more than the actual debt. According to the anonymous and posthumous pamphlet, Audley had "the clue of a resolved mind, which made plaine to him all the rough passages he met with".
Audley died in his 86th year, at the home of the rector of St. Clement Danes, London, on 15 November 1662. On 21 November, his body was interred in the Temple Church in London.

Arabs in France

Arabs in France are people of Arab descent living in France.
Demographics.
French people of Arab origin (predominantly from Maghreb but also some from Mashreq areas of the Arab world) in France forms the second largest ethnic group after French people of European origin. 
There are no official figures concerning the demographic of French people of Arab descent because ethnic statistics are forbidden in France but the estimates varies from 3 to 3,5 million. 
Most of the Arabs have settled during the period of French economic growth during the 60s and the early 70s, but many immigrants in this period managed to bring to France their family after 1973. They have settled mainly in the industrial regions in France, especially in the Paris region but also in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Languedoc-Roussillon, Alsace, Rhône-Alpes and Corsica.
Maghrebis.
Many French people have Maghrebi ancestry since the Arabs in France are predominantly Maghrebis. 
Mashrekis.
Many famous French people like Éric Besson, Carlos Ghosn, Jacques Saadé, Élie Aboud, Abdel Rahman El Bacha, Antoine Sfeir, Philippe Aractingi, Andrée Chedid, Matthieu Chedid, RAmez, Henri Jibrayel, and Reem Acra are of Lebanese ancestry, both Christian and Muslim background since Lebanon is 59% Muslim and 41% Christian.

Brooklands Museum

Brooklands Museum Trust Ltd operates the independent Brooklands Museum as a charitable trust and a private limited company incorporated on 12 March 1987; its aim is to conserve, protect and interpret the unique heritage of the Brooklands site. 
The museum is located south of Weybridge, Surrey and was first opened regularly in 1991 on of the original 1907 motor-racing circuit. It includes four Listed buildings: the 1907 Brooklands Automobile Racing Club Clubhouse and Members' Hill Restaurant buildings, the 1911 Flight Ticket Office, and a 1940 Bellman aircraft hangar.
Surviving sections of the 1937 Campbell Circuit, the 1907 Finishing Straight and Members' Banking (the steepest section of the former racing circuit), the 1909 Test Hill, and a WW2 'Bofors' gun tower are all important parts of the Brooklands Scheduled Monument which was extended in 2002. The entire Brooklands site was designated a Conservation Area by Surrey County Council in 1989. The Brooklands Trust Members, formed in 2008 after the Friends of Brooklands Museum and the Brooklands Club amalgamated, and is the official supporters' organisation for the Museum.
History of Brooklands.
Brooklands was the birthplace of British motorsport and aviation and the site of many engineering and technological achievements throughout eight decades of the 20th century. The racing circuit was constructed by local landowner Hugh Locke-King in 1907 and was the first purpose-built racing circuit in the world. Many records were set there. Many aviation firsts are also associated with Brooklands, which soon became one of Britain's first aerodromes. It attracted many aviation pioneers prior to World War I, and was also a leading aircraft design and manufacturing centre in the 20th century, producing a remarkable total of some 18,600 new aircraft of nearly 260 types between 1908 and 1987 (see McSwein, D R).
Brooklands-based aircraft companies such as Bleriot, Hawker, Sopwith, Martinsyde, and Vickers were key players in the early years of aviation and were crucial to its early development. The 'Daily Mail Round Britain Air Race' of 1911 started and finished at Brooklands, and both the event and the location later influenced the theme of the classic 1965 Twentieth Century Fox British film comedy 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines' (based at the fictitious but remarkably similar 'Brookfield'). Flying training was an important function of the aerodrome both before World War I and between the wars. Visitors can see many displays and exhibits portraying the contribution made by Brooklands to the British aircraft industry in both world wars, and also in the post-war years with Vickers and later the British Aircraft Corporation and British Aerospace.
Vickers purchased the site in 1946 for £330,000, which allowed them to produce civilian aircraft. The most notable of these was the Vickers Viscount, of which 444 were built between Brooklands and Bournemouth. In 1959 the Vanguard was test flown from Brooklands. In 1962 the test flight for the prototype VC10 also took place at Brooklands, and subsequently all 53 production VC10's were flown out as well before being completed and test flown at Wisley.
Collection.
The Museum is open daily and displays a wide range of Brooklands-related motoring and aviation exhibits ranging from giant racing cars such as the 24-litre Napier-Railton, motorcycles, and bicycles to a unique collection of Hawker and Vickers/British Aircraft Corporation-built aircraft including Concorde (G-BBDG). 
Certain other museum exhibits (for example, the flyable Bleriot XI and Sopwith Camel replicas built by Mike Beach and Viv Bellamy, respectively) are maintained in 'live' condition and perform regular engine running demonstrations at museum events during the year. An exhibition about Grand Prix motor racing which features a Formula One simulator can also be seen. A major new visitor attraction, 'The Concorde Experience', opened in August 2006, centenary celebrations occurred in 2007 and a full-size modern working replica of Alliott Verdon Roe's 1908 'Avroplane' was completed and unveiled on 7 June 2008. 
The Museum also owns and, until late 2009, operated an airworthy Vickers Vimy replica which was built in America in 1994 to re-enact the design's three record-breaking long distance flights of 1919-20. Having helped commemorate the 90th anniversaries of the world's first Transatlantic flight and the first flight from England to Australia, the aeroplane was finally retired and flown into Brooklands on 15 November 2009. Less than a week later it was on display with a supporting exhibition in the Museum's main hangar. In early 2011 the Museum received (on loan from its owners) the historic fuselage of the Supermarine Swift F.4 prototype, WK198, which held the World Absolute Air Speed Record when flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow in Libya on 26 September 1953. 
The Museum celebrated the centenary of the opening of the Brooklands Circuit in 2007, 100 years of aviation at Brooklands in 2008 and the Test Hill's centenary in 2009. Centred on a restored Hawker Hurricane, a new exhibition about Brooklands in the Battle of Britain was unveiled on 15 September 2010; this explains how the major aircraft factories there made Brooklands a prime target for Luftwaffe bombers in 1940 and lists the names of almost 90 people killed when Vickers was badly bombed on 4 September and also the names of Luftwaffe aircrew casualties that day. Another new exhibition about the Vickers Wellington is centred on the Loch Ness Wellington, 'R' for 'Robert' and was officially opened by Robin Holmes, Penelope Keith, Norman Parker and Ken Wallis on 15 June 2011 - the 75th anniversary of the first flight of the type's forerunner, prototype Vickers B.9/32. 
In 2012, a significant Brooklands aviation anniversary - 50 years of the Vickers VC10 airliner - was marked by the staging of a VC10 Symposium and the official opening of a new VC10 exhibition by the late Sir George Edwards' daughter Angela Newton on 29 June - half a century after this remarkable aeroplane was first flown here by 'Jock' Bryce, Brian Trubshaw and Bill Cairns.
On the evening of 29 September 2012, with help from museum volunteers, contractors moved the ex-British Airways/Heathrow Airport 40% scale Concorde model G-CONC to a new location at the south end of Brooklands Drive, where it now marks the main entrance to Brooklands Museum.
The Brooklands contribution to the Royal Air Force's legendary 617 Squadron 'Dambusters' attack on Germany's Ruhr Valley reservoirs on 16-17 May 1943 was commemorated on 12 May 2013 by three impressive flypasts of Brooklands Museum given by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Avro Lancaster - as a special 70th anniversary tribute to Barnes Wallis and the Vickers-Armstrongs design and experimental department engineers who made the 'Upkeep' mine such a successful weapon.
The Museum's latest aviation exhibit is an impressive full size replica of the Sopwith Schneider floatplane, built by volunteers at Brooklands and funded by the Kingston Aviation Heritage Trust who donated it to the museum on 27 November 2013.
London Bus Museum.
In August 2011, the new London Bus Museum opened in new premises on land at Brooklands Museum. Formerly the private Cobham Bus Museum from 1972-2011, LBM is itself an Accredited Museum (provisional), displaying some 35 historic London buses dating back to the 1870s, together with associated artefacts, and is run by the London Bus Preservation Trust, a Registered Charity. Entry to London Bus Museum is on a joint ticket with Brooklands Museum with one admission charge covering both museums.

The Oracle and the Mountains

"The Oracle and the Mountains" is a short story by Stephen King, originally published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" in February 1981. In 1982, "The Oracle and the Mountains" was collected with several other stories King published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" as "". "The Oracle and the Mountains" formed the third chapter of the book, and was slightly revised for the inclusion.
Plot.
Roland and Jake manage to make their way out of the desert, into lusher territory. They come across a Speaking Ring. At night, Jake is drawn to the ring by the Oracle contained within, but Roland saves the boy before the Oracle can drain him to death via sexual intercourse. 
Roland restrains Jake at their campsite and gives him the jawbone taken from the skeleton in the way station, as a means of warding off the Oracle's influence. He then goes down to the Speaking Ring, taking mescaline to fortify himself. When he reaches the ring, he has a powerful psychosexual exchange with the Oracle, who tells him of Eddie Dean and Susannah Dean.
The next day they leave the campsite and eventually come to a mountain. The man in black is there, and taunts Roland, telling him they will speak on the other side. Roland asks Jake to make his choice as to whether he wishes to leave the gunslinger or accompany him, and Jake agrees to come with him, knowing that Roland plans to sacrifice him in order to reach the man in black.

Treasury Library Canada

Treasury Library Canada is the second studio album by Canadian indie rock band Woodpigeon, self-released by the band in 2008, and later officially released in February 2009. The band initially noted that it was: really only intended it as a between-album-album to tide things over on the upcoming UK tour and to give folks something new to listen to this summer, but it's getting props. If you ask us, it's really only Album #1.5. Album #2's on the way. But hey. How often is it that your tour CD gets written up in nice, big ways? We're not complaining. We've only printed 1,000 of them, and at the moment the big box at WPHQ has just dwindled down to 200 left.
However, after its official release in 2009, vocalist/guitarist Mark Hamilton stated that:I consider "Treasury Library Canada" a proper record in its own right these days, given the reaction it’s received. Although, admittedly, when it was first released in our own self-pressed edition, that sold out in just a few weeks, I thought we were destined to print up 1000 of the things and then have 800 in my closet for the rest of time. As an album, I think its creation, however, is a little strange. The majority of the songs were either tunes written for "Songbook" and not used (otherwise I’d have made a double debut record, and where do you go from there?), or songs written while struggling with the recording and mixing of "Songbook", so it almost felt like a sideline commentary on that for a while. In reflection, though, I think it’s actually brought a bit more awareness to the songs that are on it, because I largely didn’t think people would really be listening to these things. Thus the name "Treasury Library Canada" and the idea of pulling down some books from your childhood that you’d never even read then, and realizing how amazing they are.

Regina Folk Festival

The Regina Folk Festival (RFF) is an annual folk music festival held in Victoria Park in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Occurring the second weekend in August, the festival is a three-day annual event that attracts around 20,000 people and over 500 volunteers. It is Western Canada's longest-running music festival. Since 1999, its artistic director has been Sandra Butel. The organization is run by Butel and Manager of Operations, Jeannie Straub.
History.
The festival was first held in 1969 on the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan. This led to the creation of the Regina Guild of Folk Arts (RGFA). Since that time, the RGFA has continued to present both an annual festival (the Regina Folk Festival) and year-round music performances (the Regina Folk Festival Concert Series). For sixteen years RGFA produced and staged the Regina Folk Festival at various indoor venues.
In 1985 the festival was moved outdoors to historic Victoria Park in the heart of downtown Regina. The 1994 festival was cancelled due to debt.
In March 2006 the membership of Regina Guild of Folk Arts Inc. voted to change the name of the organization to Regina Folk Festival Inc. (RFF Inc.) In 2009 the festival will celebrate its fortieth anniversary.
Headliners in 2006 included Steve Earle, Ani DiFranco, Feist, Niyaz, and Utah Phillips. Those in 2007 included Blue Rodeo, Bruce Cockburn, Michael Franti, Iris DeMent, Los de Abajo and Buck 65.
In addition to the concerts, there are also daytime workshops, and free children's performers.

<doc id="20772303" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20772303" title="Minimal mappings">
Minimal mappings

Minimal mappings are the result of an advanced technique of semantic matching, a technique used in computer science to identify information which is semantically related.
Semantic matching has been proposed as a valid solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem, namely, supporting diversity in knowledge. Given any two graph-like structures, e.g. classifications, databases, or XML schemas and ontologies, matching is an operator which identifies those nodes in the two structures that semantically correspond to one another. For example, applied to file systems, it can identify that a folder labeled “car” is semantically equivalent to another folder “automobile” because they are synonyms in English.
The proposed technique works on lightweight ontologies, namely, tree structures where each node is labeled by a natural language sentence, for example in English. These sentences are translated into a formal logical formula (according to an unambiguous, artificial language). The formula codifies the meaning of the node, accounting for its position in the graph. For example, in case the folder “car” is under another folder “red” we can say that the meaning of the folder “car” is “red car” in this case. This is translated into the logical formula “red AND car”.
The output of matching is a mapping, namely a set of semantic correspondences between the two graphs. Each mapping element is attached with a semantic relation, for example "equivalence". Among all possible mappings, the minimal mapping is such that all other mapping elements can be computed from the minimal set in an amount of time proportional to the size of the input graphs (linear time) and none of the elements in the minimal set can be dropped without preventing such a computation.
The main advantage of minimal mappings is that they minimize the number of nodes for subsequent processing. Notice that this is a rather important feature because the number of possible mappings can reach n*m with n and m the size of the two input ontologies. In particular, minimal mappings become crucial with large ontologies, e.g. DMOZ, where even relatively small (non-minimal) subsets of the number of possible mapping elements, potentially millions of them, are unmanageable. 
Minimal mappings provide usability advantages. Many systems and corresponding interfaces, mostly graphical, have been provided for the management of mappings but all of them scale poorly with the number of nodes. Visualizations of large graphs are rather messy. Maintenance of smaller mappings is much easier, faster and less error prone.

Oneida stirpiculture

Stirpiculture is a word coined by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, to refer to eugenics, or the breeding of humans to achieve desired perfections within the species. Noyes derived stirpiculture from the Latin word "", which means "stock, stem, or root" (Carden). 
Origin of the Oneida stirpiculture experiment.
Up until the late 1860s, John Humphrey Noyes believed in only having children with purpose and preparation. In this communal society, it was not simply about the preparedness of the parents, but rather the preparedness of the community to support a new generation. "A mistake was considered a serious detriment to the society" (Kinsley 13). In the early years of the community, when poverty was an issue, the community did not feel adequately prepared to take on the raising and support of children. Therefore, procreation was discouraged in these early days before the financial successes of trap-building. An "accidental" conception was thought to be a failure in male continence, the act that was meant to prevent unwanted pregnancies through the withholding of male ejaculation during intercourse. 
In the 1860s, the Oneida Community experienced a shift in the themes of reproduction philosophy. Noyes had begun to read Darwin's "Principles of Breeding" and Sir Francis Galton's papers and books on subjects ranging from anthropology, meteorology, horticulture, and eugenics (Circular, Vol II, No. 3, March 27, 1865). Thoroughly intrigued by his readings, Noyes expanded upon these ideas and considered the potential benefits in the use of scientific propagation to create a superior human being. Previous studies in eugenics set goals of a physically superior human being, but Noyes was more interested in perfecting the soul by breeding for religious and virtuous qualities.
The experiment.
By the late 1860s, the Oneida Community began its experiment with stirpiculture, which Noyes governed fully. Noyes required each person to have specific qualities pertaining to his own idea of human perfection. "The Circular", a newspaper run by the Oneida Community for the Community, had several articles outlining Noyes' idea of what the Oneida Community should strive to achieve in its experiment: all of the qualities of Christianity's patriarchs' (Abraham's obedience, Jesus as the Son of God) (Circular Vol II, No. 3, April 3, 1865).
Participants.
Noyes was the main judge of the men and women selected to parent children in the experiment, but he also sought the aid of a committee. This committee approved and denied requests of community members to have a child. Many members applied as couples, and some of the couples were actually encouraged by the committee itself. There was a set of standards by which each candidate should meet; older men in the Community were especially sought after according to Ascending Fellowship, as Noyes believed they were much wiser and spiritually sound. Women, on the other hand, were typically between the ages of 20 and 42. Both men and women were chosen based on spiritual and virtuous qualities, as opposed to physical ones. Each potential parent was required to sign a contract committing themselves to the experiment, and most importantly to God and his human representative: Noyes (Carden 62). Most important in these pledges were the promises to avoid any "personal feelings in regard to child-bearing" because it was believed that this quality would help them to better serve the experiment and most importantly, the community.
Raising the Children.
Children at Oneida were raised communally. This means that they were not raised specifically by their biological parents. They were brought up under the supervision of community members who were assigned the job of child care. Many community members helped out with this, and therefore the children were surrounded with guidance and support from multiple sources. The stirpcults were brought up in a healthy country environment with plenty of fresh air, good food, and attention, and Oneida was isolated from chronic diseases that might have affected children in more crowded areas. As they grew up in the years following the breakup, their families and friends encouraged them to go to college and to achieve worldly success Practice of Perfection.
The First 15 Months.
Once a child was born, it stayed with its mother for the first 15 months of life. During this period the mother was allowed and even encouraged to breast feed the child. Breast feeding is one of the only instances in which a strong attachment between mother and child is encouraged. This was due to its ability to encompass both scientific and natural views of life. Socially, this attachment is not important because it is a bond between child and mother, but rather that it is an establishment of a relationship between child and caretaker.
The Children's House.
Once weaned from breast feeding, the child is sent to live in the Children's House. In the early days of the community, this "house" was actually a succession of rooms in the "Middle House" (Kinsley 14). For a certain period of time after being weaned, children still slept with their mothers at night. Once they reached a certain age, they were discouraged from sleeping in their mothers' rooms. Still concerned with creating a bond between the child and the community, he/she would often sleep in the bed of a community member. This member changed periodically so no special attachments could be formed.
Values of Non-Attachment.
There were certain guidelines established by the community to help direct parents to establishing an appropriate relationship with their child. Most of these guidelines were an extension of the principles of non-attachment and commitment to the communal ideal. The concern was that an excessive relationship would fail to appropriately teach the child the social fundamentals of the community. It was acceptable to be attached, as long as it was a general emotion of love and trust to the community rather than to a particular individual (Youcha). A mother's excessive attachment to her child was a potential cause for illness or suffering on the child's part. In cases like this, it was often prescribed that the mother or child be moved to another community site for a temporary amount of time (Kinsley). 
Results.
The experiment with stirpiculture in the Oneida Community lasted between the years 1869-1879. Fifty-eight children were produced as a result of the stirpiculture experiment. Most women and men only produced one child. Some produced two or three, and 13 of those were recorded as "accidental conceptions". To prove his religious and social prowess, as well as that of his bloodline, John H. Noyes and his son Theodore produced 12 children between them, 11 of which survived (Carden 64). The development and nourishment of these children were very diligently attended to, and values such as non-attachment were impressed on children, even at a very young age. Many of the children lived long and were very well-educated; however, it has been offered that perhaps the children's environment lent them these abilities.
Each child at Oneida was very well supported and cared for within the community. They were given a lot of play time and rooms to do it in, as the Oneidans believed in the importance of exercise. Both girls and boys were provided an education, and some of the children even went on to college. They were under constant guidance of older community members. Theodore Noyes, son of John H. Noyes, kept detailed records of the growth and development of the children produced and raised in the Stirpiculture experiment. Only one was reported to have physical disabilities (Ellis). The children learned the importance of non-attachment and commitment to the community, however it is apparent that some special relationships did occur.

State of Mind (Fish song)

"State of Mind" was the first solo single by Fish, released about a year after his departure from Marillion and preceding the release of his first solo album "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors". It is also the first-ever record Fish did outside Marillion except for his 1986 collaboration with Tony Banks on the single "Shortcut to Somewhere" from the Banks album "Soundtracks".
The a-side track is a slow to mid-tempo rock song with strong bass and percussion elements and some Celtic folk elements. Lyrically, the song articulates the general political discontent in the late Thatcher years. In terms of music, lyrics and general mood, it is perhaps closest to the Marillion song "Sugar Mice" (1987). The b-side "The Voyeur (I Like To Watch)" is a harder, although mainly keyboard-based rock song, somewhat similar to Peter Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey"; the lyrics criticise "TV voyeurism". "The Voyeur" was also included as a bonus track on the CD version of "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors". Fish co-wrote both tracks with keyboardist Mickey Simmonds, the dominant musical composer on his debut solo album. Guitarist Hal Lindes has additional credits on "State of Mind".
Cover art.
The cover was designed by Mark Wilkinson, who had created all of Marillion's artwork until Fish's departure, and has continued to work with Fish since then. The cover shows close-ups of the faces of the couple that also features on the cover of "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors" with an hourglass between them. The back-cover features an illustration of an atomic explosion inside the hourglass. The single was also the first to feature the circular "Fish" logo designed by Wilkinson, which has been used on all solo releases since then (except for the 1997 album "Sunsets on Empire" and the singles from it.)

Chart positions.
"State of Mind" was the first of five UK top 40 singles by Fish. On 28 October 1989, the it entered the UK singles charts at position 32, which would remain its highest position. The following week, it dropped to 36; in the third and final week, it was at 58. In terms of peak chart position, this was Fish's third most successful single.

Fortress synagogue

Fortress synagogue is a synagogue built to withstand attack while protecting the lives of people sheltering within them.
Fortress synagogues first appeared in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th century at a time of frequent invasions from the east by Ottoman, Russian and Walachian troops. The Old Synagogue, Przemyśl is a typical example. The region also had fortified churches, of which St. Andrew's Church, Kraków is a surviving example. 
The Old Synagogue, Kraków, a rare surviving fortress synagogue, was rebuilt in 1570 with an attic wall featuring loopholes and windows placed far above ground level, features borrowed from military architecture. It has been altered many times since.
Walls were thick masonry, with heavy buttressing to withstand assault. Like other fortifications, the synagogues were often built on hills. The Husiatyn Synagogue is another example of a surviving, 16th-century fortress synagogue.

The Slow Mutants

"The Slow Mutants" is a novella by Stephen King, originally published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" in July 1981. In 1982, "The Slow Mutants" was collected with four other stories King published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" as "". "The Slow Mutants" formed the fourth chapter of the book, and was slightly revised for the inclusion.
Plot.
Roland and Jake make their way through a railway tunnel using a hand car cart created by the Great Old Ones. During this time, to distract the boy, Roland tells him a story of his childhood (which is also told in ' and ').
At age fourteen, Roland discovered his mother having an affair with his father's court magician, Marten Broadcloak. Marten taunted Roland in order to spur him into an early trial to prove his worth as a gunslinger, in order that he would fail and be sent into exile, therefore ending potential trouble for the Good Man and Crimson King to whom Marten secretly swore allegiance. Roland faced his teacher Cort, using his hawk David as his weapon and deliberately sacrificing him in order to gain the upper hand, and passed the trial. 
While traveling through the mountain, Roland and Jake are attacked by a pack of slow mutants, who block the track in an attempt to catch them. Jake clears the obstruction just in time for them to escape, and they travel on to the edge of a deep chasm spanned by a dilapidated trestle. They abandon the hand car and start crossing on foot. Nearing the other end, Jake slips and Roland catches him, but the man in black arrives to offer Roland a choice: let the boy die or never catch him. Roland lets Jake fall to his death and exits the tunnel with the man in black.

Born in Italy, Romagnoli trained as a cameraman and a director. While working at a film studio, he met Margaret O’Neill, an American information officer for the Marshall Plan. She became his supervisor, and the pair married in 1952. Due to American government regulations, Margaret lost her job. The couple left for America in 1955.
The pair moved to Watertown, Massachusetts, and Romagnoli got a job as a cameraman at WGBH-TV. He later worked as a cinematographer. After a trip back to Italy, the couple put forward the idea of an Italian home cooking program. "The Romagnolis’ Table" made its debut in 1973 and lasted until 1975. The show was originally broadcast on WGBH but was later shown by PBS.
After the show ended, Romagnoli opened up a restaurant under the same name. The restaurant operated for 10 years and closed in 1989. Romagnoli also opened two sister restaurants and released three cook books.

Plot.
After sacrificing Jake in the mountain, Roland makes his way down to speak to the man in black. The man reads Roland's fate from a pack of Tarot cards, including "the sailor" (Jake), "the prisoner" (Eddie Dean) "the lady of shadows" (Susannah Dean), "death" (but not for Roland), and the Tower itself, as the center of everything. The man in black states that he is merely a pawn of Roland's true enemy, the one who now controls the Dark Tower itself.
Roland attacks the man in black, who retaliates by knocking Roland out with an incantation. Roland enters a terrifying visionary hallucination revealing the nature of the cosmos. When Roland awakens, he finds that nothing is left of the man except his skeleton, and that he himself has aged ten years. He takes the skeleton's jawbone with him as he departs, as a replacement for the one he had given to Jake in "The Oracle and the Mountains." 
The gunslinger continues traveling by foot until he reaches the Western Sea.

The 2008 ABC Supply Company A.J. Foyt 225 was the sixth round of the 2008 IndyCar Series season and took place on June 1, 2008 at the Milwaukee Mile, in West Allis, Wisconsin. Marco Andretti took the lead from the pole position, and led the first 40 laps. He was chased early by Scott Dixon and teammate Tony Kanaan. Graham Rahal, who started on the outside of the front row, shuffled back, but remained in the top 5 for the first half of the race. The first half was mostly green, with only a minor caution involving Oriol Servià and another for debris. Later in the first fuel segment, Andretti's handling started to suffer, and Dixon took over the lead. Hélio Castroneves took over second, and Andretti fell back as deep as tenth.
On lap 130, Rahal went high in turn three to pass Darren Manning. He got into the marbles, and brushed along the wall in turn four. After holding the lead for 136 laps, Dixon was finally challenged by Ryan Briscoe. Briscoe took over the lead on lap 177, and held it until a green flag pit stop on lap 194. After a sequence of pit stops, Castroneves, Andretti and Dan Wheldon all cycled near the front. When all pit stops were complete, Briscoe held a half-second lead over Dixon. The two battled for the lead over the final 21 laps.
With less than three laps to go, Andretti dove underneath Ed Carpenter in turn one. The cars touched, and both cars spun into the wall. Vitor Meira became caught up in the smoke, and rode up over Andretti, becoming airborne. He landed upright, and all drivers were uninjured. The race finished under caution with Briscoe picking up his first career IndyCar victory, and 300th overall win for the Mooresville, North Carolina-based Penske Racing in all motorsports series.

Rhinopias eschmeyeri

Rhinopias eschmeyeri is a Scorpionfish from the Indo-West Pacific. It grows to an average size of 16.6 cm in length. Common names in English are Eschmeyer's scorpionfish and Paddle-flap scorpionfish. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. Although some have raised questions as to whether R. eschmeyeri is a morphological variant of Rhinopias frondosa rather than a separate species, a 2006 study by Motomura and Johnson confirmed the species' existence and distinguished it from other members of the genus Rhinopias. 
Description.
Eschmeyer's scorpionfish has a maximum length of and its dorsal fin has twelve spines and eight to nine soft rays while the anal fin has three spines and five soft rays. 
According to Motomura and Johnson (p. 502), R. eschmeyeri "differs from R. aphanes and R. frondosa in having two tentacles on the underside of the lower jaw (vs. 12-18 tentacles in R. aphanes and 9-24 in R. frondosa), lacking tentacles on the frontal below the eyes in anterior view (vs. 2-4 tentacles present in the two species), lacking distinct tentacles on the lateral surface of the body above the lateral line (vs. present), having short tentacles, without distinct branches along distal margins, on the supraocular and posterior lacrimal spines (vs. long tentacles, with distinct branches) . . . and having head, body, fins, and tentacles usually without distinct pigmentation or markings (vs. with elongate black-margined white markings each with a central region of yellow, green, or brown in R. aphanes and with numerous distinct circular dark-margined spots in R. frondosa)." In the two comparison photos at right, one can observe these differences in the number of tentacles on the underside of the jaw, the presence or absence of tentacles in front below the eyes, and the branched or unbranched form of the tentacles above the eye, as well as the obvious difference in pigmentation and markings.
Distribution and habitat.
"R. eschmeyeri" is native to the tropical western Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from the coasts of East Africa to Japan, Indonesia and the northern half of Australia. Its depth range is and it is usually found on coral reefs or rubble seabeds.

Rhinopias aphanes is a Scorpionfish from the Western Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a length of TL. Information on this species is based on three specimens of "Rhinopias aphanes" that were collected from Australian waters and compared to a previously recorded Holotype. The distribution of this species seems to be restricted the coral reefs of the Western Pacific. This species is thought to be a benthic fish, resting on the sea floor. It has been observed that they are very reluctant to leave the bottom and rarely swim. Rather, they locomote using walking and hopping-like movements using their pelvic and pectoral fins. The prey of "Rhinopias aphanes" consists of small fish.

Kenneth Wilkinson

Kenneth Ernest Wilkinson (28 July 1912 – 13 January 2004) was an audio engineer for Decca Records, known for engineering classical recordings with superb sound quality.
After working for small recording companies, Wilkinson was taken onto the staff of Decca, where he engineered many recordings, working with producers such as John Culshaw and conductors including Sir Georg Solti, Hans Knappertsbusch and Benjamin Britten. He trained a whole generation of celebrated Decca engineers.
Wilkinson so closely identified with the Decca sound that he retired when the company was absorbed into the PolyGram group in 1980.
Life and career.
Early life.
Wilkinson was born in London. He attended the Trinity Grammar School, Wood Green in north London on a scholarship. He left school at the age of sixteen in 1928, and worked for the publishing house, Cassell's. When one of the firm's accountants left to join the World Echo Record Company, Wilkinson went with him, and was present at the company's first electrical recording at the old Clerkenwell Sessions House off Farringdon Street in London. In that job, which involved him in the early electrical recording process, he met Jay Wilbur (James Edward Wilbur), a dance bandleader who interested him in the technical side of recording. The company folded, and Wilkinson took a job in charge of the recorded music at an ice rink in Brighton.
Decca.
Wilbur had joined Crystalate, another record company, and invited Wilkinson to join him at its studios in Hampstead. Wilkinson's job as a junior there included shaving waxes, removing the surface of used recording waxes to make them blank for re-recording. At Crystalate he met the recording engineer Arthur Haddy (1906–1989). When Decca acquired Crystalate in 1937, Wilkinson and Haddy (who would become the technical director at Decca) now worked for the new company.
An attempt to volunteer for the Royal Air Force during World War II was refused because Decca was involved in top secret government research. Wilkinson would work on submarine navigation, recording Luftwaffe night fighter signals, and on navigation aspects of the dam buster operations of Barnes Wallace. With Haddy, he also worked on Decca's recording equipment, disc cutters, and recording techniques including "ffrr" (full frequency range recording). He was also involved in recording two of Decca's most popular artists: Vera Lynn and Mantovani.
Wilkinson's early recordings as an engineer were for monaural 78 rpm releases. With Charles Munch bringing the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra to record in London for the first time, Wilkinson had to find a new recording location as Kingsway Hall was already booked. He found an outstanding acoustic in Walthamstow Town Hall, which was booked for the sessions for 8–11 October 1946. For these sessions, he also served as producer. On November 19, he was back at Walthamstow recording the London Symphony Orchestra in that venue for the first time. Victor Olof (1898–1976) was the producer for this session and many future ones with Wilkinson as engineer. Their collaboration included a complete set of Sibelius's symphonies recorded between 1952–1955 in Kingsway Hall.
LP and stereo.
Decca was an early adopter of the LP album, which put it ahead of its direct competitor EMI. The company was also an early exponent of stereophonic recording. Wilkinson would make the move to stereo recordings for Decca in April 1958, but until then he remained the engineer with the monaural recording team (for a time there were parallel recording teams) because mono was considered the more important release. In the early 1950s, together with Roy Wallace (1927–2007) and Haddy, he developed the Decca tree spaced microphone array used for stereo orchestral recordings. Decca began to use this for recordings in May 1954 at Victoria Hall in Geneva, a venue Wilkinson did not record in. He preferred recording in London and Paris although he also recorded in Amsterdam, Bayreuth, Chicago, Copenhagen, Rome, and Vienna. 
Wilkinson discussed the use of the Decca tree in an interview with Michael H. Gray in 1987.
You set up the Tree just slightly in front of the orchestra. The two outriggers, again, one in front of the first violins, that's facing the whole orchestra, and one over the cellos. We used to have two mikes on the woodwind section – they were directional mikes, 56's in the early days. You'd see a mike on the tympani, just to give it that little bit of clarity, and one behind the horns. If we had a harp, we'd have a mike trained on the harp. Basically, we never used too many microphones. I think they're using too many these days.
Wilkinson's method of selecting recording venues was recounted in an article on concert hall orchestral sound written by the conductor Denis Vaughan in 1981:
I have recorded in many halls throughout Europe and America and have found that halls built mainly of brick, wood and soft plaster, which are usually older halls, always produce a good natural warm sound. Halls built with concrete and hard plaster seem to produce a thin hard sound and always a lack of warmth and bass. Consequently when looking for halls to record in I always avoid modern concrete structures.
Legacy.
Wilkinson went on to engineer at hundreds of recording sessions. He was said to have worked with more than 150 conductors. He was the engineer most responsible for Richard Itter's Lyrita recordings (which Decca produced). Itter always requested Wilkinson as engineer, calling him "a wizard with mikes". 
Wilkinson's stereo recordings with the conductor Charles Gerhardt (including a series of Reader's Digest recordings and the RCA Classic Film Scores series) and the producer John Culshaw made his name and reputation known to record reviewers and audiophiles. His legacy was extended by the fact that he trained every Decca engineer from 1937 onwards.
Wilkinson, always called "Wilkie" in the music business, was known as a straight-talking man, interested only in the quality of the work. The Decca producer Ray Minshull (1934–2007) recalled Wilkinson's methods in an interview with Jonathan Valin in March 1993: 
Everyone loved and respected Wilkie, but during a session he could be exacting when it came to small details. He would prowl the recording stage with a cigarette – half-ash – between his lips, making minute adjustments in the mike set-up and in the orchestral seating. Seating arrangement was really one of the keys to Wilkie's approach and he would spend a great deal of time making sure that everyone was located just where he wanted them to be, in order for the mikes to reflect the proper balances. Of course, most musicians had a natural tendency to bend toward the conductor as they played. If such movement became excessive, Wilkie would shoot out onto the stage and chew the erring musician out before reseating him properly. He wanted the musicians to stay exactly where he had put them. He was the steadiest of engineers, the most painstaking and the most imaginative. In all of his sessions, he never did the same thing twice, making small adjustments in mike placement and balances to accord with his sense of the sonic requirements of the piece being played.
Among Wilkinson's favourite recordings was Britten's "War Requiem". This was recorded in January 1963 at one of Wilkinson's favourite venues, Kingsway Hall, with Culshaw as the producer. Among other recordings engineered by Wilkinson were Wagner's "Parsifal" recorded live at Bayreuth in 1951, of which the critic Andrew Porter wrote, "...the most moving and profound of spiritual experiences ... Decca have recorded, superbly, a superb performance", and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique with Sir Georg Solti conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in May 1972 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Krannert Center.
Wilkinson retired from Decca when the company was taken over by the PolyGram group in 1980. He made no free-lance recordings. His work was released on Lyrita and Reader's Digest records (as mentioned above) and RCA Records with recordings licensed through Decca. His recordings were characterised by the producer Tam Henderson in an appreciation: "The most remarkable sonic aspect of a Wilkinson orchestral recording is its rich balance, which gives full measure to the bottom octaves, and a palpable sense of the superior acoustics of the venues he favored, among them London's Walthamstow Assembly Hall and The Kingsway Hall of revered memory".
Personal life and awards.
Wilkinson married Miriam Tombs in 1938, and they had four children (two sons, two daughters). 
On retiring, Wilkinson received a special gold disc produced by Decca with extracts of his recordings. He received three Grammys for engineering: 1973, 1975, and 1978. He also received an audio award from "Hi-Fi" magazine in 1981 and the Walter Legge Award in 2003 "…for extraordinary contribution to the field of recording classical music".
Wilkinson died in Norwich at the age of 91.

Scorpaenopsis macrochir

Scorpaenopsis macrochir is a scorpionfish from the Pacific. Its common names are the rough humpback scorpionfish or the flasher scorpionfish, and it occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a maximum size of in length.
Description.
"Scorpaenopsis macrochir" has a broad spiny head with a wide space between the eyes, a highly arched back and a divided upper opercular spine. It has twelve spines in its dorsal fin and nine soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and five soft rays. The general color of this fish is brown mottled with white and it can grow to a length of . The large pectoral fin is flushed with yellow and orange on its inside and has a complete broad black band near its margin and no large back spots. This fish is one of five very similar species of humpback scorpionfish and can be distinguished from "S. diabolus", S. gibbosa" and "S. obtusa" by the markings on the inside of the pectoral fin. From "S. neglecta" it can also be told by the presence of two to six points on the nasal spine. 
Distribution and habitat.
It is indigenous to the tropical and subtropical waters of western and northwest Australia, the Moluccas, and Philippines to the Marquesan and Society islands, north to Ryukyu Islands, south to Rowley Shoals, and Tonga; Mariana and Caroline Islands in Micronesia. "S. macrochir" is typically found on soft substrates, where it sometimes buries itself, as well as camouflaged among rubble where it lies in wait for a passing meal. 
In aquaria.
This fish occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade, and is often confused with its larger relative "Scorpaena diabolus" (the devil scorpionfish). However, the flasher scorpionfish is smaller. Like other "Scorpaenifomes", it possesses venomous dorsal spines which deliver its venom. Although it is venomous, these spines are never used to attack other organisms, but are solely for defensive purposes. As its common name suggests, this fish possesses bright orange and yellow "flash colors" on the inner surfaces of its pectoral fins to ward off and confuse would be attackers. These bright colors also serve as a warning that this fish is venomous.

Samuel D. Lockwood

Samuel Drake Lockwood (August 2, 1789 – April 23, 1874) was an Illinois politician who served as the state's Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Supreme Court Justice.
Lockwood was born in Poundridge, New York. His father, Joseph, was an hotelier. His mother was Mark, née Drake. Samuel was the oldest of four. His siblings were Jesse (b.1791), Rebecca (b.1792), and Cornelius (b.1793). Joseph died of yellow fever in 1799, two days after Cornelius died of the same disease. The following year, Mary married Duncan McCall and moved to Canada with Rebecca, leaving Samuel and Jesse at a private school in New Jersey for a few months before being taken in by their uncle, Francis Drake. He studied law with Drake and was admitted to the bar in Batavia, New York in 1811. 
Lockwood practiced law in Batavia for a year before relocating his practice to Sempronius, New York for about a year and a half. From 1815 until August 1818, he had a law partnership in Auburn, New York with George B. Throop. Lockwood ended that practice when he decided to move to the new state of Illinois. In 1818, he and a friend, William H. Brown descended the Ohio River, disembarking at Shawneetown. They walked across the state to Kaskaskia and Lockwood eventually settled in Carmi.
In 1821, Lockwood was elected Attorney General. During his brief term as Attorney General, Lockwood successfully prosecuted the only known duel to come to trial in Illinois. He resigned after only a year when Governor Edward Coles appointed him as Secretary of State when Illinois' first Secretary of State, Elias Kane, was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. Three months later, Lockwood received an appointment as the Receiver of Public Moneys from President James Monroe. One of the reasons Lockwood accepted the appointment from Madison was that it would afford him the time and money to ensure that Illinois would remain a free state. Lockwood received an appointment to the First Board of Canal Commissioners. Lockwood was given the duty of contracting with engineers to survey the route of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Also in 1824, The Illinois Supreme Court was reorganized by the legislature and Lockwood was appointed a judge on the Supreme Court and remained on the court until 1848.
In the 1820s, Lockwood resisted the adoption of a pro-slavery Constitution for Illinois, but he was one of the framers of , in 1848.
In his retirement, he returned to Batavia, New York, where he died at age 85.

Georgia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Georgia, and its broadcaster Georgian Public Broadcaster (GPB), announced in August 2008 that it would be withdrawing from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia. The country later returned to the contest in December 2008, and planned for its third entry at the contest.
After a national final was held on 18 February, the third Georgian entry for Eurovision was decided to be Stefane & 3G with "We Don't Wanna Put In". The song however was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and could not compete in the contest in its current form due to perceived political connotations in its lyrics. On 11 March, Georgia announced its withdrawal from the contest in response to the EBU's rejection.
Withdrawal and return.
Georgia's broadcaster, Georgian Public Broadcaster (GPB), originally announced in August 2008 that they would not be participating at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. This was due to the 2008 South Ossetia war, involving Georgia and Eurovision host Russia, and in protest to Russia's foreign policies. GPB went on to say that they refuse to "participate in a contest organised by a country that violates human rights and international laws".
GPB later reversed their decision to boycott the contest in December 2008. This was after talks between GPB and the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), as well as the victory for Georgia at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008, in which Russia gave their top marks to Georgia.
In February 2009, an online campaign "Boycott MoscowVision" emerged calling on the public broadcaster not to participate in the song contest.
National final.
In its third year of participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, the Georgian public broadcaster GPB opted to organise a public national final again. Singers and songwriters could send in their songs until February 5, when a jury picked the finalists. The national final was broadcast live on February 18 from GPB's own TV studios, with the winner being decided by a combination of SMS voting and the verdict of an expert jury.
On 6 February GPB released the names of the ten competing artists. The song titles and songwriters were revealed on 13 February.
The winner of the contest was Stefane & 3G with the song "We Don't Wanna Put In". Only the top three acts were announced on the night, with Keti Ordjonikidze and Boris Bedia making up the remaining top three songs.
Song controversy and withdrawal.
Shortly after "We Don't Wanna Put In" was selected, the song received widespread coverage due to political connotations in its lyrics. The song, a jab at Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, gained news coverage in countries around Europe, however the song was rumoured to be ineligible to compete, due to rules forbidding "lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature". A spokesperson for GPB denied that the song was of a political nature, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers of the contest, refused to make a statement until the song was officially submitted to them. A protest was held in Moscow over the song on 2 March 2009, organised by the Young Russia political group.
On 10 March, the EBU told GPB that the song's lyrics did not comply with the rules of the contest, and asked them to either re-write the lyrics of the song, or select another to compete.
On 11 March, GPB announced that it would not change the lyrics of the song, or the song itself, saying that it does not have political connotations within its lyrics, and perceiving the EBU's rejection of the song as political pressure from Russia. The country therefore withdrew from the contest. Confirmation of the withdrawal given, when the running order was announced on 16 March, and Georgia was not included.

New America Media

New America Media is a multimedia ethnic news agency and a coalition of ethnic media. Founded in 1996 by the nonprofit Pacific News Service, NAM is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, DC. In addition to producing and aggregating news by and for ethnic communities, NAM also engages in social marketing campaigns, partners with journalism schools across the country, spearheads various youth media programs, and produces a National Directory of Ethnic Media, which contains over 2,500 media partners and functions as an emergency messaging service.
History.
New America Media represents the third generation of ethnic news coalitions descending from the non-profit Pacific News Service, founded in 1969 PNS was created by historian Franz Schurmann and journalist Orville Schell as an alternative news source on the United States’ role in Indochina during the Vietnam War. After the war ended in 1974, PNS shifted its lens from the Far East to the American West under the guidance of executive editor Sandy Close, who would become the nonprofit organization’s executive director.
In 1991, PNS created its first youth media project, YO! Youth Outlook, a multimedia collective of youth-centric news content. YO! publishes a monthly print magazine, hosts youth forums, speakouts, and blog-a-thons, offers youth journalism internships, and produces live radio and YO! TV broadcasts.
In 1996, PNS became New California Media. NCM maintained PNS’s status as an alternative news source providing support for ethnic media voices, and expanded it with editorial and marketing workshops for ethnic media at the organization’s annual Expo & Awards, dubbed the “ethnic Pulitzers” by the News Hour with Jim Lehrer. NCM also initiated multilingual polling on issues affecting ethnic Californians: the role of ethnic media in their daily lives, the impact of September 11, the progress of American race relations.
Also in 1996, Sandy Close co-founded The Beat Within with social worker David Inocencio. The Beat provides a weekly writing and discussion program in Bay Area juvenile detention centers, and from those programs, compiles material into a weekly magazine of written and visual work by incarcerated youth. The Beat model has expanded into over 40 Bay Area juvenile halls, with pilot programs in several other regions including Washington, D.C.
In 2005, the organization expanded from New California Media into New America Media. The James Irvine Foundation has called NAM “...the most diverse media organization in the country,” and Sandy Close has been honored with an Ashoka Senior Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship and an Academy Award.
Youth Programs.
NAM’s youth programs include:
• YO! Youth Outlook
• The Beat Within
• Silicon Valley De-Bug, a multimedia online magazine by and for South Bay Area youth
• Roaddawgz, a drop-in space and artistic outlet for homeless San Francisco youth
• The kNOw, a Fresno-based youth multimedia program

William Furst

William Wallace Fuerst (March 25, 1852 – July 11, 1917) was an American composer of musical theatre pieces and a music director, best remembered for supplying incidental music to theatrical productions on Broadway.
Biography.
Furst was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He studied music in Baltimore, and was a church organist at the age of 14.
Career.
Furst's comic opera "Electric Light" was produced and conducted by him in 1878, and for the five seasons following he received engagements as conductor of opera. By the 1880s, he was composing theatrical music for productions starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Maude Adams, Otis Skinner, William Faversham, Viola Allen and Mrs. Leslie Carter. He composed the music for five Shakespeare productions by Margaret Anglin at the Berkeley Stadium in California, as well as her production of "Electra". One of his earliest operettas was "My Geraldine" (1880).
In the late 1880s and early 1890s, Furst was the orchestra director at the Tivoli Theatre in
San Francisco, California. He composed his only opera, "Theodora", for the Tivoli. In 1892, he composed the successful operetta "The Isle of Champagne". In 1893, he published "The Girl I Left Behind Me" and moved to New York City, becoming the music director at the now-demolished Empire Theater. The same year, he composed the music (along with Charles Alfred Byrne and Louis Harrison) for the musical "Miss Nicotine" with Lillian Russell and Marie Dressler Another such Empire piece was "The Little Trooper", starring Della Fox (1894) followed by "The Little Minister" (1897). In 1898, he composed another such piece for the Empire, "A Normandy Wedding" (an adaptation of the French "Papa Gougon"), which received an enthusiastic reception in New York at the Herald Square Theatre.
By 1900, Furst also had fairly steady work as a composer/arranger of incidental music to accompany theatrical productions. He produced music for, or was music director for numerous plays, including a steady stream of dramas produced by David Belasco and Charles Frohman. Two plays by Belasco which had Furst's musical accompaniments, "Madame Butterfly" and "The Girl of the Golden West", were made into operas by Giacomo Puccini who attended their New York productions. Musicologist Allan W. Atlas has shown that Puccini modeled some music heard in his opera La fanciulla del West on Furst's music. His last theatrical composition was music for "Joan the Woman", starring Geraldine Farrar.
Death.
Furst died in 1917 at his home in Freeport Long Island, New York at the age of 66. An enthusiastic gardener, Furst tripped in his garden, injuring his foot, which led to a brain clot. He was survived by his widow Charlotte and his daughter, Mrs. Lillian Martin.

Legacy.
Much of the music composed by William Furst remains unpublished. Since he wrote "for hire," many of his works remained with David Belasco. They now form a part of the David Belasco Collection of Incidental Music and Musicals in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. His work for "Madame Butterfly" and "The Girl of the Golden West" have been cataloged separately.

Joseph Kahn (shipping executive)

Joseph Kahn (c. 1916 – December 3, 1979), was a shipping industry executive who served as the chairman of Seatrain Lines, an innovator in the way ships carried freight.
Kahn immigrated to the United States in 1930 from the Soviet Union. Kahn enlisted in the United States Army at the beginning of World War II, ascending through the ranks from private to first lieutenant.
He had worked for Kahn Brother and Pinto, the family fur business, which he left in 1950 to start Transeastern Associates, which started with the purchase of a surplus World War II-era Liberty ship and had expanded into ownership of 36 bulk cargo carriers. Transeastern was created together with Howard Pack, another furrier who was also looking to get out of the family fur business and start something new.
Both Kahn and Pack had been in the fur trade before turning to shipping, though they had not been associated in the fur business. Asked about the fur connection after their 1965 purchase of Seatrain, Kahn answered that "there may be a moral in this, but I don't know what it is".
In an April 1967 speech to the United States Merchant Marine Academy alumni association, Kahn advocated for rules to benefit the domestic shipping industry, including retention of cabotage laws that require domestic shipping be by ships owned and built in the United States and manned by American crews. He also pushed for a requirement that all foreign aid shipments be on American ships. that the United States Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service use American-flagged vessels exclusively and that at least half of oil imported into the United States be on American-flagged ships.
By the time of Kahn's death, Seatrain had expanded into shipbuilding, and had 3,000 employees and annual revenues of $250 million. Kahn served on the American Bureau of Shipping's board of managers and was president of the American Maritime Association.
Kahn was a longtime critic of what he felt was a failure of the United States government to create a competitive merchant fleet sailing under the US flag. Kahn stated that the United States Navy was mistaken in counting on the loyalty of foreign-owned ships to be available in case of an emergency. Kahn stated that the "United States is too big, too strong, too powerful not to have its own capability in the construction and manning of ships".
A resident of Manhattan, Kahn died at University Hospital at age 63 on December 3, 1979 after a brief illness.

JPEG-avi

The JPEG-AVI format uses the AVI RIFF form with minor changes.
Similar to the AVI, the JPEG-AVI file format uses the mandatory "hdrl" and "movi" LIST chunks.
JPEG-DIB frames are key frames, as they all are addressable. Their format is as specified in ISO 10918.
The index chunks contain the key frames entries for each data chunk to provide random access for finding JPEG-DIB video frames from a large interleaved AVI-file.
The JPEG-AVI format is very similar to the AVI file format.
The major differences are as follows -
(1) The chunk 'strf' contains EXBMINFOHEADER structure members for describing data of the stream format.
(2) The Chunk "strh" contain FOURCC code "JPEG" for still images and "MPEG" for motion images with specific data for initializing the appropriate codec.
(3) The Chunk "movi" or "rec" contains JPEG-DIB data.
(4) The Chunk "index" contains the entries for all JPEG-DIB frames as all frames are the key frames. This allows random access to JPEG-DIB frames, which was not otherwise available.

Homes and Communities Agency

The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is the non-departmental public body that funds new affordable housing in England. It was established by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 as one of the successor bodies to the Housing Corporation, and became operational on 1 December 2008.
Background.
On 17 January 2007, Ruth Kelly announced proposals to bring together the investment functions of the Housing Corporation, English Partnerships and parts of the Department for Communities and Local Government to form a new unified housing and regeneration agency. It would also incorporate the functions of the Academy for Sustainable Communities and the government's advisory team for large applications. 
In the following months, Professor Martin Cave, Director of the Centre for Management under Regulation at University of Warwick, led the most comprehensive review of English housing regulation for 30 years. Reporting in June, the Cave Review recommended that a new regulator be set up, separating the regulation and investment responsibilities of the Housing Corporation. 
On 15 October 2007, Yvette Cooper announced that the Government accepted the recommendation of the Cave Review to transfer the Corporation's regulatory powers to an independent body, subsequently named as the Tenant Services Authority (TSA). The new investment body was initially announced as "Communities England", and later renamed as the Homes and Communities Agency.
Management.
The Chief Executive for the new body was announced as Sir Bob Kerslake in December 2007. Kerslake had led the regeneration of Sheffield as chief executive of the City Council since 1997.
On 17 October 2008 the Housing Minister Iain Wright announced the Board members of the HCA including Robert Napier (chair), Kate Barker, Candy Atherton, and Shaukat Moledina (previously Vice-Chair of the Housing Corporation). 
Kerslake was appointed as a Permanent Secretary at the agency's parent Department for Communities and Local Government in September 2010. The HCA announced that it would appoint an interim Chief Executive from existing staff.
New initiatives.
The HCA's Kickstart programme provided grants to developers in order to rescue stalled projects during the recession, helping to maintain employment and output of new homes. One of the most groundbreaking Kickstart projects was a £45.6 million investment in Berkeley Homes to provide 555 new homes for rent on the open market, located in London, the south east and south west. 
However, after a campaign for disclosure by "Building Design" magazine, the agency revealed that many Kickstart projects failed to meet CABE's standards of good design.
Future of the agency.
Housing minister Grant Shapps announced early on that the TSA would be abolished as part of the cull of quangos by the coalition government after the 2010 general election. In June 2010, he said that the HCA would be retained but become "smaller, more strategic - with the HCA's functions being delivered under local leadership."
In September 2010, the HCA was also included on a list of organisations being considered for closure. However, Shapps announced in October that the TSA would be merged into the HCA. In November, he confirmed that the HCA would be retained, but reformed to cut running costs.

Barndominium

The barndominium, a portmanteau of barn and condominium is a new type of building growing in popularity, especially in rural areas of the United States. These homes have been seen in environments as varied as Texas ranches and Connecticut equestrian communities.
A non-traditional structure, the barndominium is a steel frame and sheet metal building, originally designed as a storage building or barn structure that has been repurposed by the addition of living areas to previously open space. This type of building is typically built on an existing property or multi-acre homesite and the structure often acts as a dual purpose living and shop or workspace areas.
These homes offer features not usually found on typical homes including oversized roll-up doors and single enclosed areas large enough to hold things like boats and recreational vehicles.

Sturla Jónsson (Political Party)

Sturla Jónsson, formerly known as the Forward Moving Party (), is a newly formed Icelandic political party. The party was known as the Forward Moving Party from its founding on 17 December 2008 to 5 April 2013 when it was renamed after its founder.
The chairman of the party is Sturla Jónsson, teamster and protester, who is today most commonly known for his participation in a documentary movie about the Icelandic financial crisis in 2009. The political ideology of the party is currently unknown. It was officially founded on 17 December 2008, and in early 2009 it managed to collect more than 300 signatures for the purpose of running in the April 2009 parliamentary election. The party was granted the election letter A, but then subsequently failed to recruit enough candidates to actually represent the party and participate in the election. So it was never approved to participate, despite of having applied with sufficient signatures.
In January 2013, it was rumoured by several Icelandic websites that the party was planning to contest the April 2013 parliamentary election. On 23 February, the party announced it had indeed now collected the minimum of 300 signatures, and applied to participate in the election with list letter K. The party received list letter K from the Ministry of Interior on 8 March 2013, and then established its election campaign centre in Sturla's old workshop with the main purpose to start composing a valid candidate list. When the deadline for submitting candidate lists expired on 12 April, the party was approved to participate in one of the six constituencies: Reykjavík South.
It shall be noted, that Sturla Jónsson's attempt also to list in other constituencies as a single independent candidate (without a list), was disapproved both by the electoral committees in these constituencies and by the National electoral Commission. This disapproval was expected, as the Icelandic constitution and election law stipulates that independent candidates are not allowed to run in parliamentary elections, unless they manage to join forces with other independent candidates to establish a full complete candidate list for a new group named "independent candidates" in the constituency they intend to run. Another peculiarity for the party's top candidate, is that he resides in the Reykjavík North constituency, but opted to list his party list in the Reykjavík South constituency, and thus will not be able to vote for himself. Sturla explained he believed the biggest support base for his party was to be found in his neighbour constituency, which was the reason he had preferred to list there, but also used the opportunity to highlight that his party would actively work to reform the election law, so that Iceland in future elections should not be divided into any vote limiting constituencies, but instead only have one list of available parties and candidates for the entire island. Beside of this single political point, the party however has not yet published a political program on their official website.

Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński

Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński (fl. 1692-1713) was a Polish composer.
Szarzyński was a Cistercian monk; virtually nothing else is known of his life. He may have been involved with the choir of the Collegiate Church at Lowicz, where many of his compositions were preserved. His works are dated from 1692 to 1713, and the level of technical competence displayed in his works indicates that he must have had significant formal training.
All but one of his surviving works are sacred in nature. He wrote solo motets for voice, violin, and continuo, which are in concertato style. He also wrote a number of choral works. Many of his pieces interpolate melodies from popular religious tunes. His lone surviving nonreligious work is a sonata for two violins and continuo.

3rd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery

The 3rd Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery was a unit that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was organized from already mustered unattached companies of heavy artillery raised for the defenses of the Massachusetts coast.
History.
Beginning in January 1863, and continuing until early 1864, twelve companies of heavy artillery were raised in Massachusetts and mustered into service to garrison the military forts along the coast of the state. The units were designated "unattached" as they did not belong to a particular regiment. 
In the spring of 1864, the 3rd Unattached Company, along with the 6th through 12th, were ordered to Washington, DC, where they were to garrison the forts protecting the capital. Massachusetts' Governor Andrew called for the companies to be given regimental status, and when it was granted, several other companies since raised were sent to Washington to complete its complement, and was officially made a regiment in the fall of 1864.
Except for Company I, the regiment continued with its duty of manning forts in the vicinity of the capital. A portion of the regiment was mustered out on 17 June 1865, while the remaining companies served until 18 September.
Company I
The 13th Unattached Company, which later became Company I, had been recruited in Springfield, MA and was largely composed of mechanics who were employed at the city's National Armory. Because of their engineering skills, they were detached from the regiment and attached to the Army of the James, and were engaged in building bridges and roads. During the Siege of Petersburg, they were in charge of holding the pontoon bridge placed across the James River. They were the last men of the regiment to be mustered out, doing so on 26 September 1865.
The Unattached Companies.
The other unattached heavy artillery companies raised in Massachusetts, the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th, had become the 1st Battalion Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery in 1863.
Complement.
The regiment consisted of 94 officers and 1803 enlisted men.
Losses.
Two officers and 39 enlisted men died from disease or accident. None were killed in action.

African linsang (genus)

The African linsangs also known as Oyans are two species classified in the mammalian subfamily Viverrinae, in the family Viverridae. There is one genus, Poiana.
Both linsang genera ("Poiana" and the Asian "Prionodon") were formerly placed in the subfamily Viverrinae (of Viverridae), along with several other genera, but recent research suggests that their actual relationships may be somewhat different. The linsangs are remarkable for their morphological resemblance to cats, family Felidae, which is greater than in the other viverrids. As the relationship between linsangs and cats was thought to be rather distant (the two groups belonging to different families within the superfamily Feliformia), this was considered an example of convergent evolution. However, DNA analysis indicates that while the African linsangs ("Poiana") are true viverrids closely related to the genets, the Asiatic linsangs ("Prionodon") are not and may instead be the closest living relatives of the Felidae family. The similarities between Asiatic linsangs and cats are thus more likely to be due to common ancestry, while the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent.
The name "linsang" is from Javanese "linsang" or "wlinsang", which used to be wrongly translated as "otter" in English dictionaries. Linsangs are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. Both species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between the two species.
The species of African linsangs are:

Major General Syed Shahid Hamid () HJ (17 September 1910 – 12 March 1993) was a 2 star general in the Pakistan Army and a close associate of President Field Marshal Ayub Khan who played an important and an instrumental role in bringing Field Marshal Ayub Khan to power in the 1958 coup d'état that overthrew the government of President Major-General Iskander Mirza. Major General Syed Shahid Hamid was the first Master General of Ordnance (MGO) of Pakistan Army. A descendant of Amir Kulal, General Shahid Hamid was an inside player in the crucial months during Independence in 1947. A veteran intelligence officer, he authored numerous books, notably the "Autobiography of a General" which was last published in 1965. His other books are "Courage is a Weapon", "Early Years of Pakistan" and "So they Rode and Fought".
However, the most important book written by him was "Disastrous Twilight" which was the diary he kept from 1945 till 1947. This was the time he served as Private Secretary to FM Sir Claude Auchinleck, c-in-c of the Indian Army. In this book considerable doubt is cast on the impartiality and the integrity of the last Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten.
It was this lack of impartiality that was one of the main factors in creating the chaos of the independence of Pakistan and India. This was done by manipulating the findings of the Radciffe Boundary Award.
He is the uncle of the Bombay-born British novelist, Salman Rushdie, a fierce critic of the ISI that Gen. Hamid founded.
Early life.
Syed Shahid Hamid was born in Lucknow, India. He was admitted in 1923 to Colvin Taluqdar school (Lucknow) and following that by the Aligarh Muslim University where he received his B.A. in Mathematics, followed by his M.A. in mathematics from Aligarh Muslim University. He was accepted to Royal Military College Sandhurst, England in 1932. He received a commission on the Unattached List, Indian Army on 1 February 1934. He arrived in India on 16 February 1934 and was shortly afterwards attached to the 2nd battalion the Prince of Wales Volunteers (South Lancashire) regiment at Allahbad. On 12 March 1935 he was admitted to the Indian Army and joined the 3rd Cavalry at Meerut. His senority as a Second Lieutenant was antedated to 31 August 1933. He was later transferred to the Royal Indian Army Service Corps where he served in Kohat, Fort Sandeman and Risalpur. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 30 November 1935 and to Captain on 31 August 1941.
Military career.
During the Second World War, he saw extensive service on the Burma front where his eyes were badly injured, He was in the retreat from Rangoon and finally was evacuated from Shewbo to Calcutta. On being declared fit for duty he was posted to Staff College, Quetta in 1943 and was a Senior Instructor at the Command and Staff College,Quetta. Auchinleck made him his private Military Secretary and he played an influential role in the decision making of Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck during in World War II. Shahid Hamid was an inside player in the crucial months leading up to the Partition. During his time in Delhi, he resided at 12 Willingdon Crescent.
Shahid Hamid was at the centre of the political storm during Partition when Auchinleck attempted to keep the army united and was then forced to divide it between India and Pakistan, while the Viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten, went ahead and divided the South Asia. A few months ago, after the partition, then-Colonel Shahid Hamid told the local journalist, Ahmed Rashid, that he was finishing a book on the drawing-up of the Radcliffe Award which delineated the border between India and Pakistan. Hamid told Ahmed Rasid that, in his book, he could prove conclusively that Mountbatten fiddled the boundary in Punjab in favour of India.
Senior appointments.
Shahid Hamid opted for Pakistan and was inherited in Pakistan Army. As a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1948, he set up the now-famous Inter Services Intelligence from a small office in Karachi. He saw the army in action in Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, and had led the military operations in Kashmir. In 1951, at the age of 41, he became the youngest general in the Pakistan army - a record that is still unbeaten. During the 1958 martial law imposed by Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Shahid Hamid was the adjutant-general of the army, and had played an important role in bringing the Field Marshal to power in 1958. In 1960, he was made the first Master General of Ordnance (MGO) of the Army. Major General Hamid took retirement from the Army in 1964, and was given an honorary discharge. After his retirement, he went into private business but was summoned back to public life in 1978 by President Zia ul-Haq, under whom he served as a federal cabinet minister for three years.
Post-retirement.
Shahid Hamid was deeply interested in education and he helped found, and was then patron for 20 years of, the Sir Syed College, which today educates 3,500 students. He was one of the earliest travellers in Pakistan's mountainous Northern Areas and opened up the region for local people and tourism by pushing through road projects and writing books and articles which publicised the beauty of the area.
Hamid as scholar.
For the last 20 years he spent his days writing and researching books. He wrote six books on the Northern Areas, the politics of independence and the Pakistan army, and an autobiography. His last book - the first volume of an intended three-volume work, Pakistan and its Early Years - was published only last week. Shahid Hamid had numerous friends in England, where he invariably spent the summer, while a visit to 'Shaigan', his home in Rawalpindi, became essential for any foreign diplomat, journalist, scholar or military man. British cabinet ministers, US secretaries of state and Russian scholars were frequent visitors. In recent months he had been thrilled by the opening up of central Asia to Pakistanis for the first time and he was planning a trip there to discover more about his forefathers.
Legacy.
Although a professional soldier, thoroughly methodical and a man who lived the day by a clockwork timetable, the general was famous for his overwhelming hospitality, his generosity to everyone and his intense curiosity about every aspect of life and letters. At heart he was a romantic who still believed in the essential good faith of people, although Pakistan's elite society has become increasingly corrupt and uncaring.

Joan Huffman

Joan J. Huffman is an incoming Republican member of the 31-member Texas State Senate from District 17, which includes a portion of populous Harris County. Huffman will also be the sixth currently serving female member of the chamber. Only one in five voters participated in the special election held on December 16, 2008, Huffman defeated her Democratic opponent, Chris Bell, a former one-term member of the United States House of Representatives, 24,431 (56 percent) to 19,104 (44 percent). Bell was his party's unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 2006, having lost in a five-candidate general election to Republican Governor Rick Perry, 39-30 percent.
Bell had led in the initial balloting on November 4, when the first round of the special election was held in conjunction with the presidential and congressional elections. He obtained 38 percent of the vote to Huffman's 26 percent. Bell and a second Democratic contender, Stephanie Simmons, had a combined 52 percent in the first round. The runoff contest, however, allowed Huffman to consolidate supporters of three other Republican candidates, Austen H. Furse (born 1960), Kenneth R. Sherman (born 1962), and Grant P. Harpold (born 1963), who trailed in the first balloting. Huffman's term extends to January 2011. She succeeds Senator Kyle Janek, a Republican physician who resigned earlier this year for business reasons. She faces Republican primary voters on March 2, 2010, and, if nominated, all voters on November 2, 2010. 
Huffman spent $750,000 of her own money in the Senate campaign, what she calls "an investment in Texas." Bob Perry of Perry Homes in Houston, no relation to Governor Perry, gave Huffman $125,000. Bell received a million dollars for Texas trial lawyers, and the state Democratic Party sent a busload of activists to the district to conduct door-to-door solicitation.
In addition to Harris County, Senate District 17, said to resemble a crowbar, includes portions of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Jefferson counties. From 1981 to 2002, the seat with a different configuration was held by the attorney J. E. "Buster" Brown, then of Lake Jackson, and later a lobbyist in Austin.

German Social Democratic Party of Poland

German Social Democratic Party (, DSDP) was a political party in Poland, founded on March 26, 1922.
Foundation.
The party emerged from a fusion of the Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia) organizations of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and the Teschener-Schlesien organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAPÖ). These were German and Austrian Social Democratic party branches in areas transferred to Poland after the Silesian Uprisings. The founding meeting took place in Bielsko. Johann Kowoll was appointed chairman of the DSDP. The party, although geographically limited to Upper Silesia, intended to organize German workers throughout the Polish republic.
The newspaper "Kattowitzer Volkswille" ('Kattowitz (Katowice) People's Will'), the erstwhile organ of the SPD in Upper Silesia, became the organ of DSDP.
1922 elections.
On August 21, 1922, DSPP formed an electoral bloc together with the Independent Socialist Labour Party (NSPP). In the September 24, 1922, election to the Silesian Sejm the bloc contested under the name "Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Partei". The candidature won two out of 48 seats, to be held by Johann Kowoll and Karl Buchwald. Ahead of the November 5, 1922 Polish Sejm election, the electoral bloc fell apart. The NSPP leader, Bolesław Drobner, decided to withdrew their candidate lists and break the agreement with DSPP in protest of Kowoll and Buchwald joining the 'German Club' in the Silesian Sejm. After the break-up of the coalition the DSDP didn't field any candidates for the election, due to economic restraints.
Mergers.
Sometime around the end of 1923/early 1924 the SPD organization in West Prussia merged into the party. After this merger, the name German Social Democratic Party of Poland ("Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Partei Polens", abbreviated DSPP) was adopted.
The DSPP held its second party congress December 7–8, 1924.
On August 9, 1925 DSPP merged with the Łódź-based German Labour Party (DAP), forming the German Socialist Labour Party in Poland (DSAP). The merger was however only nominal, in reality DSPP and DAP continued to exist as separate parties until October 1929. On October 6–7, 1929, DSAP became a unitary political party.

It contains a level editor which allows users to make and share maps. The game is set in a medieval fantasy world and follows the story of Eirik, Kari and Asgeir. It was designed to be played with the DualShock 3 controller or the PlayStation Move controller. The game was created and developed in Portugal.
On August 23, 2011 the game was released into the Asian market including Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia.
Gameplay.
"Under Siege" places "special emphasis" on user-generated content and in game battles, according to the official website, and it is tailored for console gameplay and controls.
The gameplay is battle orientated and not focused on resource farming. The player's army build experience by fighting battles and each army can consist of multiple races. "Under Siege" features multiplayer gaming with online matches for up to 2 players online and split screen matches for up to two players. The game allows Deathmatch, Capture Point, Capture Treasure, and Survival multiplayer game modes.
Comic Book.
"Under Siege: First Encounter"
Prior to the game's release, a comic book titled "Under Siege: First Encounter" was released to set the scene.
Reception.
The game achieved an aggregate rating of 69% on video game review site metacritic, being generally received as a good real time strategy game, representing good value for money and with good production values but significantly hampered in general appeal by difficultly spikes, and a high overall difficulty level. 
In "Edge" the game was described as: "Under Siege may be a downloadable game, but it’s certainly not throwaway. It’s engaging and, if the controls can be mastered and the bugs forgiven, a satisfying sampler of RTS thrills for the uninitiated, and a stamina test for anyone who thinks they’re hard enough."
The Portuguese site Mygames, gave a score of 82/100, classifying the game as "Good", with the strengths: an RTS that works well in console, environment and art, the map editor, Online competitive and compatible with YouTube and Facebook and a lot of content at a low price. As weaknesses, states that is not accessible to all styles of players, the absence of voices, repeated elements and characters throughout the adventure, and the Move might work better.
The "Digitally Downloaded Website", specialized on downloadable contents, gave it a 4 stars out of 5. Reviewer said: "There is some fine tuning that the game could have used, however. Difficulty is spotty at best – even on the easiest levels it’s all too easy to accidentally wander into a massive enemy swarm because the fog of war is, frankly, too close to your units. And although the best effort has been done to get the controls down, it’ll never manage to be as intuitive as mouse and keyboard for the strategy genre. But it’s an impressive effort nonetheless, and a warm welcome back for the PSN. Given that everyone gets free PlayStation Plus subscriptions, take advantage of the fact this game is heavily discounted; it’s well worth the budget asking price." 
Eurogamer gave it a 7/10, saying: "A game that requires a degree of patience and tolerance before it truly clicks. If you have the required resolve, there's plenty to admire."
The French/Canadian site "Game Devoureur", states on its analysis that "In the end, Under Siege is one of those games exasperating at first, until we understand the game. It becomes a pure pleasure to lead his troops into battle, fail, learn, and try again finally succeed, which will result in extending the life of the single player campaign at least ten hours. A mechanism and a philosophy that is reminiscent of a Demon's Souls, all things and in very different styles. But Seed Studios went all the way to his ideas and the result is very pleasing. After RUSE, Under Siege proves that the RTS genre has its place on console, with or without motion control. Indeed, all who have played (and have understood) will tell you it's a great game, addictive and exciting, period!"
The Game Chronicles site reviewed "Under Siege" with a 7 out of 10. The reviewer states that: "Under Siege includes a fairly powerful level editor that's at least on par with most PC games. While the game's light on actual strategy and heavy on micromanagement and instant to instant tactics, it's still not a bad choice for people looking for quick, RTS-style skirmishes on the PS3."
The German site "Media Review" that specializes in reviewing games and movies, has given the game a rating of 8.2 out of 10, stating that: "Under Siege is a PS3 title, which have stunning graphics, rich Dolby surround sound and a brilliant pioneering control. The difficulty is, however - and especially - for RTS beginners too hard. To avoid frustration and motivation, gamers can also create their own matches and maps. However, the game has been upgraded with simple mounting options, or at least some sense of siege equipment. "Under Siege" fulfills its role as skirmish-frame. It is a solid PSN figure, ostensibly for the experienced tactician and strategist RTS - may be exactly right - both offline and online! 
The Swedish website "Level 7" gave it a score of 6/10. The reviewer stating that "the idea is good and the game is still quite entertaining in its simplicity. Under Siege falls, however, because of unnecessarily sloppy and ill-considered choice game mechanics which creates unnecessary irritation. The game, however, is really nice that and they added the ability to create your own maps." 
Awards.
Under Siege has won the Grand Prize for the "Zon Multimedia Awards 2010" held in January 2011 at the "Museu do Oriente" in Lisbon, Portugal. It also won 1st prize for "Applications and Multimedia Contents".

Prior to the creation of Lake Burragorang, the Warragamba River would have been formed by the confluences of the Coxs, Nattai, and Wollondilly rivers in the Burragorang Valley. Downstream, the river flowed through a gorge that varied in width from to , and was in depth. It was this configuration which allowed a relatively short but high dam wall in the gorge to impound a large quantity of water. 
Today, the Burragorang Valley and most of the Warragamba River is submerged beneath the lake, and the remaining section of the river flows only the north-east from the Warragamba Dam spillway to its confluence with the Nepean River.

Baqai Medical University was founded in 1988 on the outskirts of Karachi, and is ranked number 3 in the HEC rankings for medical universities in Pakistan. Courses are in medicine, dentistry, health management sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, and veterinary science, and there are interdisciplinary courses.
History.
Most medical colleges in Pakistan were set up by the country's Provinces or by the Federal Government, but the history of Baqai Medical University is an example of private enterprise. 
Dr Fareed Uddin Baqai and his wife Dr Zahida Baqai were medical practitioners and surgeons who had been educated in Pakistan and the United Kingdom and began to practice in Karachi, which at that time was the capital. In the late 1960s, the Baqaians started a private sector hospital in Nazimabad, Karachi, the Baqai Hospital Nazimabad, which became a general hospital with 350 beds and modern facilities aimed at middle-income private patients, also doing charitable work. 
In the 1970s it was clear that a more massive programme of community development was needed, with medical education built around community development, together with ancillary institutions. In 1976 the Baqai Foundation acquired land on the outskirts of Karachi, on the M-9 Super Highway. There it established Pakistan's first rural medical centre, supported by secondary and tertiary health-care structures. The Baqais founded the Baqai Medical Complex. 
They convinced the government that health delivery could be through a programme of community-oriented medical education. This stimulated them to plan a medical college, the building of which was started in the 1980s. In 1988, the first MBBS students were admitted, although it was not until 1990 that the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council formally permitted the college to start clinical teaching at Baqai Hospital, Nazimabad. In 1992, the Baqai Foundation went on to establish the Baqai Dental College, the first such college for the huge city of Karachi. A department of Dental Materials was established. 
The medical college and the dental college are inspected by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council inspectorate. On completing their education, the first medical and dental students were granted their degrees by the University of Karachi. The PMDC recognised the university's degrees of MBBS and BDS.

A major redistribution in 1946 resulted in the multi-member divisions of Hobart and Launceston being split up—the old divisions remained as single-member divisions, whilst Hobart spawned Newdegate and Queenborough, and Launceston spawned Cornwall. A new division of West Devon was created from rural areas of Mersey, whilst Cambridge combined with parts of Macquarie to form the new Monmouth.

Linsang

Linsangs is an originally Javanese name applied to four species of tree-dwelling carnivorous mammals. The two African species belong to the family Viverridae, the two Asiatic species belong to the family Prionodontidae.
Both linsang genera (the African "Poiana" and the Asian "Prionodon") were formerly placed in the subfamily Viverrinae (of Viverridae), along with several other genera, but recent research suggests that their actual relationships may be somewhat different. The linsangs are remarkable for their morphological resemblance to cats, family Felidae, which is greater than in the other viverrids. As the relationship between linsangs and cats was thought to be rather distant (the two groups belonging to different families within the superfamily Feliformia), this was considered an example of convergent evolution. However, DNA analysis indicates that while the African linsangs ("Poiana") are true viverrids closely related to the genets, the Asiatic linsangs ("Prionodon") are not and may instead be the closest living relatives of the Felidae family. The similarities between Asiatic linsangs and cats are thus more likely to be due to common ancestry, while the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent.
The name "linsang" is from Javanese "linsang" or "wlinsang", which used to be wrongly translated as "otter" in English dictionaries. Linsangs are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. Both species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between the two species.
The species of African linsangs are:
The species of Asiatic linsangs are:

Canon de 6 système An XI

The Canon de 6 système An XI was a French cannon and part of the Year XI system system of artillery. It was part of the field artillery, and complemented the Gribeauval system.
[[File:Gribeauval 1813 emblem of Napoleon I.jpg|thumb|left|Emblem of Napoleon I on an 1813 Canon de 6 système An XI
The canon de 6 système An XI was used extensively during the Napoleonic wars. It was considered as a good intermediate between the Canon de 8 Gribeauval, considered to be too heavy for field artillery, and the Canon de 4 Gribeauval, considered as too light and lacking striking power.
One of the characteristics of the Canon de 6 is that its design is even simpler than that of the Gribeauval cannons, as it lacks reinforcing mould rings, except for the one before the muzzle.

PRISM model checker

PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a formal verification software tool for the modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit probabilistic behaviour One source of such systems is the use of randomization, for example in communication protocols like Bluetooth and FireWire, or in security protocols such as Crowds and Onion routing. Stochastic behaviour also arises in many other computer systems, for example due to equipment failures or unpredictable communication delays. Yet another class of systems amenable to this kind of analysis are biochemical reaction networks.
PRISM can be used to analyse several different types of probabilistic models, including discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, Markov decision processes and probabilistic extensions of the timed automata formalism. Properties to be verified against these models are expressed in probabilistic extensions of temporal logic.
Development of PRISM is primarily carried out at the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford. The tool is open-source software, released under the GNU General Public License.

North Central State Trail

The North Central State Trail is a 62-mile (100 km) recreational rail trail serving a section of the northern quarter of the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. Following a route generally parallel to Interstate 75, the trail goes northward from the Michigan town of Gaylord to the top of the Lower Peninsula at Mackinaw City. It serves the towns of Vanderbilt, Indian River, and Cheboygan.
History.
The North Central State Trail occupies what was once the northernmost segment of the Michigan Central Railroad. This Detroit-based railway, one of the largest and most profitable in the Lower Peninsula, constructed a land-grant section of trackage northward from its primary service area to Mackinaw City in 1882. This spur line served what was then a booming area of old-growth timberland.
The Michigan Central, which was affiliated with the New York Central Railroad, operated passenger trains on this section of railroad from 1882 until the early 1960s, serving tourist industries of Michigan's Northland.
North of Mackinaw City, train passengers and freight transferred onto the railroad car ferries operated by the Mackinac Transportation Company, a joint venture operated by the Michigan Central and two other railroads. On these ferries, railroad service was extended to St. Ignace and onward points on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
When the Mackinac Bridge was opened in 1957, passengers and freight shifted to automobiles. Trains last operated on a regular basis until the 1980s as a spur line of the Detroit and Mackinac Railway. 
The North Central State Trail's northern end in Mackinaw City is close to the docks once operated by the Mackinac Transportation Company.
Assets.
The North Central State Trail borders a substantial section of the shoreline of Michigan's Mullett Lake. It also borders the Cheboygan River. The trail also passes directly past Historic Mill Creek State Park located southeast of Mackinaw City.

Initially taught by painter Petera Schmidta from Szczecin. In 1805 she moved to Berlin with her brother Charles Frederick and studied under the Director of the KPM (Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur), Gottfried Wilhelm Volker.
In 1811 Beyer moved to Warsaw, where she was trained by Antoni Brodowski. In 1813 she married the director of the Warsaw lottery John Gottlieb Wilhelm Beyer (d. 1819), moving from the Lutheran faith to Calvinism. They had three sons, in 1818 was born the youngest Charles Adolf. Early widowed, Beyer had to maintain three sons and in 1824 in Warsaw opened a school of painting and drawing for women. She ran it until 1833. She painted still lifes, mostly watercolors, usually in dark warm colors. Beyer initialed her works HKA.
She is buried in the cemetery next to the children of Calvinist in Warsaw (q E, row 3, No. 13). The poet Stanisław Jachowicz honored her memory with the following lines for her obituary: "Prosta jak kwiatek, co go malowała/W niebiańskie strojny klejnoty,/Prawda w jej słowie, a w czynach jej – chwała,/W życiu zachęta do cnoty" ("Simple as a flower, as it painted / W heavenly adorned with jewels, / The truth in her words and her actions - glory, / In the life of an incentive to virtue").

The Hannibal Cavemen are a collegiate summer league baseball team located in Hannibal, Missouri, in the United States. They are a member of the West Division of the summer collegiate Prospect League.
History.
Built in 1938, Clemens Field had fallen into disrepair in recent years. Having last hosted professional baseball in 1955, the city debated whether Clemens Field was worth preserving. Soon afterwards, a group led by Roland Hemond (advisor to Arizona Diamondbacks president Derrick Hall) stepped forward with a plan to renovate Clemens Field and make it home to a 2009 team in the Central Illinois Collegiate League.
On June 10, ground was broken for Clemens Field's renovation. Almost two months later, on August 1, the Cavemen announced their name, which is an homage to the numerous caves in Hannibal which are popular with tourists. 
On November 11, the CICL announced it was merging into the new Prospect League, which the Cavemen will be joining as a member of the West Division.

The AmberWatch Foundation works to keep children safe from abduction and molestation by providing educational programs and tools. The organization's "Be Safe" Education Program is designed to educate children and their parents about the existence of child abductors and molesters, and provide a framework for protecting children against these threats.
History.
In 2004 Keith Jarrett was shopping with his daughter when he turned around to find her missing from his side. Jarrett eventually found his daughter after frantically searching the store, but the experience left him shaken. After the incident, Jarrett began conducting research about the resources available to concerned parents. He found a wealth of response-oriented organizations that focused on after-the-fact approaches, but was surprised by an utter lack of preventative resources. This led to the creation of the AmberWatch Foundation, a public, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that "compliments existing child safety education and focuses on empowering children with the information, tools, and support they need to avoid potentially dangerous situations in the first place."

Matthew Seligman is an English bassist who took part in the New Wave scene in the 1970s and the 1980s, best known as a member of the Soft Boys.
Biography.
Born in Pendaya, Cyprus, on 14 July, 1955, he moved to the UK 8 months later and grew up in Wimbledon, England. Influenced by Paul McCartney, Free’s Andy Fraser, and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads, he learned bass and subsequently, in his work with Thomas Dolby, moog. After a short spell with Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club, recording English Garden for CBS Records in 1979, he joined the Soft Boys for their 1980 album Underwater Moonlight (1980) with whom he subsequently recorded Invisible Hits (1981), Nextdoorland (2002) and Side 3 (2002).
In addition to the Soft Boys, Seligman was also in the early 80's a member of Local Heroes SW9 (playing on their first album, "Drip Dry Zone" (1980), with guitarist Kevin Armstrong), The Camera Club, the Thompson Twins and The Fallout Club. He also played bass with Robyn Hitchcock, and Thomas Dolby, with whom he recorded the US Billboard No.5 hit "She Blinded me with Science" (b/w "One of our submarines") in 1983, and the gold and platinum follow-up album, The Flat Earth.
Others with whom Matthew has recorded include Knox, the post-Japan outfit The Dolphin Brothers, Stereo MC's, The Waterboys, David Bowie (Live Aid (concert and DVD), Absolute Beginners), Sinéad O'Connor, Transvision Vamp (Tell That Girl To Shut Up, Baby I Don't Care), Morrissey (Ouija Board, Ouija Board, Yes I Am Blind), Nan Vernon, Tori Amos, Kimberley Rew and Alex Chilton. Production credits include a single with Brighton jangle pop outfit The Popguns (Crazy, 1991) and Gravy Deco for Robyn Hitchcock.
More recently, Seligman has been a member of Snail, along with Chris Bell and Jonathan Klein, and the Fire Escapes. In 2011-12 he contributed to Thomas Dolby's A Map of the Floating City and the Magical Creatures' "Wishing Machine" collections, also appearing with the former on tours of the UK and northern Europe, at the Blue Note in Tokyo in February, 2012 and at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, UK in July, 2012.
Matthew has always played a black Fender Jazz bass as his first choice instrument, and in addition uses an Ibanez with a C-ducer contact mic placed on the neck, close to the neck/body junction, for his fretless work primarily with Thomas Dolby, but also Peter Murphy and, more recently, in an ambient collection recorded with Japan/Hong Kong based musician Jan Linton for the Sendai Earthquake relief fund, due to be released by Entropy Records in 2012.
Matthew is also a lifelong Fulham F.C. fan. He moved to live in northern Japan in early 2005 and, after a 4 year spell back in the UK, recently returned to live there in July 2012, joining his wife, Hiromi, and daughter, Daisy (DoB: 10.10.01).

Conrad Weiser High School

Conrad Weiser High School is a public high school in Robesonia, Berks County, Pennsylvania and is part of the Conrad Weiser Area School District. It serves students in grades 9–12 in South Heidelberg Township, Heidelberg Township, North Heidelberg Township and Marion Township and the Boroughs of Wernersville, Robesonia and Womelsdorf. Eight properties in a housing development in West Cocalico in Lancaster County also attend the high school.
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, Conrad Weiser High School reported an enrollment of 971 pupils in grades 9–12, with 257 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. The school is not a federally designated Title I school.
Conrad Weiser High School employed 69 teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 14:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 12 classes were taught by teachers who were rated "Non‐Highly Qualified" under No Child Left Behind.
Graduation rate.
In 2012, the graduation rate at Conrad Weiser High School declined to 86%. In 2011, Conrad Weiser High School's graduation rate was 88%. In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. Conrad Weiser High School's rate was 88% for 2010.
According to traditional graduation rate calculations:
High school.
In 2012, Conrad Weiser High School declined to Corrective Action Level I due to chronic, low student achievement in reading and mathematics. In 2011, Conrad Weiser High School was in Making Progress in School Improvement Level II with lagging student achievement in reading and math. The high school was in "School Improvement Level II" due to chronic, low student achievement. Students may transfer to another high school where available.
Science in Motion Conrad Weiser High School does not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brings college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate. Ursinus College provides the experiences to schools in t he region.
College remediation.
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 38% of Conrad Weiser High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
Graduation requirements.
The Conrad Weiser Area School Board has determined that students must earn 27 credits to graduate, including: English 4 credits, Social Studies 4 credits, Math and Science a total of 3 per subject and 1 additional credit is either one, Gym 2 credits, Health 1 credit, Arts and Humanities 2 credits and 7 elective credits.
By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.

Reception.
R. Paul Dhillon of the Vancouver, British Columbia arts and entertainment Web site Straight.com (co-star Neeru Bajwa is Vancouver-raised), bemoaned "a lame plot and largely clichéd characters", and called it "another half-baked NRIs-in-the-Punjab tale", using the abbreviation for non-resident Indian, while he did praise "Ghuggi, who’s become Punjabi cinema's version of Jim Carrey", for "a very nuanced and controlled performance, right down to the accent and mannerisms of Indo-British lads". Frank Lovece of "Film Journal International" concurred, saying the "unexceptional romantic comedy won't turn any U.S. cineastes into Punjwood aficionados, and lacks the production values and star power Indian-American audiences have come to expect. ... The movie has modest charms ... but they're often drowned out by a bombastically melodramatic score, and lots of sitting-around-talking scenes with go-nowhere dialogue". Singah, he wrote, "shoots with dull, flattened lighting far removed from Bollywood's typical crystalline sheen". Maitland McDonagh of MissFlickChick.com took a middle ground, calling the film "overlong, painfully cliched but occasionally surprisingly sly and clever".

Military Bishop

Military Bishop (; ) is a military rank and position within the Finnish Defence Forces. The Military Bishop is the leader of both Lutheran and Orthodox priests and deacons serving in the army as military chaplains. The office was founded by Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in 1941. 
Though the Military Bishop is styled "bishop" and is a member of the Synod of Bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, he is not a "bishop" in the doctrinal sense of the term. Military bishops are not ordained as bishops and cannot in turn ordain priests. Their jurisdiction, the Finnish Defence Forces, does not constitute a diocese, and military chaplains belong to the dioceses of their assigned stations. Similarly, the service members belong to the parishes of their domiciles.

Western Greyhound

Western Greyhound is a bus operator based in Summercourt, Cornwall, United Kingdom. It operates many services throughout the county and also into Devon. Established in January 1998, it has been judged the Independent Bus Operator of the Year on several occasions. A fire at the depot in 2013 destroyed about one-third of the fleet.
History.
Western Greyhound was established in January 1998 to take over the three vehicles and the contracts of Cornishman Coaches, whose owner was retiring. The new company's managing director was Mark Howarth who had previously managed Western National, the local Badgerline (later FirstGroup) operation, and he was joined by Robin Orwell who had also worked for Badgerline. Within a few weeks R&M Coaches, another local operator, also sold out to Western Greyhound which brought one more vehicle and an office near Newquay bus station. This left one other independent bus operator in the town, Pleasure Travel Minicoaches, but this went out of business and the contracts were also taken on by Western Greyhound.
The company expanded beyond contract and private hire work with their first public timetabled services on 14 December 1998. These two routes (592 and 594) were contracts awarded by Cornwall Council and were operated by three new minibuses. Further contracts were awarded in 2001, and double deck buses were added to the fleet to operate school routes relinquished by First Devon & Cornwall. Since then many more routes have been added to the network including some from Plymouth Citybus and DAC Coaches in the south east, and Hookways in the north. There have also been new routes instigated, such as Newquay to Bodmin, linking the two largest towns in the county hitherto not connected by bus, and a coastal route from Newquay to St Ives.
The expanding fleet needed to operate these additional services saw the company move to a larger depot at nearby Summercourt. Initially it used established facilities there, but in 2004 a new purpose-built depot and offices were constructed. In the same year the old Newquay bus station was closed and replaced by a new facility. This is owned by Cornwall Council but is managed on their behalf by Western Greyhound, and their town centre shop was moved into new premises on the site. The company maintains its bus stops and uses satellite tracking to monitor its fleet.
The company won the Independent Operator of the Year at the UK Bus Awards in 2006, was runner up in 2007, but won it again in both 2008 and 2009.
2013 and 2014 depot fires.
On 13 May 2013 a serious fire broke out at the company's Summercourt depot. The alarm was raised at just after 01:00. Strong winds fanned the flames which reached more than height; the fire was put out by 05:00. The fire service prevented it spreading to the workshops or offices and no one was injured. Investigations suggested it was an arson attack. Thirty-four buses (about one-third of the fleet) were destroyed with a value in excess of £1 million. Certain services had to be withdrawn or reduced in frequency for a while but a number of buses were hired in from other companies as short-term replacements.
Buses were hired from Anglian Bus, Carmel Coaches, Arriva Midlands, Blackpool Transport, Nottingham City Transport, Norfolk Green, Summercourt Travel, Stagecoach South West and Stagecoach West.
A second fire broke out in January 2014 which destroyed three buses.
Area of operation.
Western Greyhound is based at Summercourt in Newquay. It operates throughout Cornwall and into Devon, serving Plymouth, Okehampton and Exeter.
From 2008 until September 2013 Western Greyhound operated the Truro park & ride service under contract to Cornwall Council. This is now operated by First Devon & Cornwall.
Fleet.
Western Greyhound operates a varied fleet. As at December 2012 (before the depot fire in May 2013) the fleet consisted of 97 buses, including 32 Mercedes-Benz step-entrance and 40 Optare low floor midibuses, most of which have coach seats. In addition, there is a small fleet of heritage vehicles that are used for special services and charters. Western Greyhound roster their heritage fleet on normal route services during the last weekend of June each year.
Liveries.
Most service buses are in a bright green livery with a thin yellow strip. A large fleet name and a greyhound logo are applied in white. The Citaros used on the Truro Park & Ride service were painted blue, One Mercedes-Benz/Plaxton Beaver midibus (599) and an Optare Solo carried a silver livery for a while but in 2012 (599) was repainted into a grey livery to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
Bright green has not always been the fleet livery. When the services were first introduced the main colour was pink. This was used for several years but when FirstGroup introduced a blue and pink livery to their buses in the area a decision was taken to change the buses to a green livery which was paler than the colour now used.

Ancient and Horribles Parade

Ancient and Horribles Parade, founded in 1926, is a nationally known Fourth of July parade on U.S. Route 44 (Putnam Pike) in the village of Chepachet, Rhode Island in the town of Glocester. Parades of horribles were a New England tradition dating back prior to the 1870s or earlier in various small towns across New England.
History.
The oldest known Ancient and Horribles Parade in New England occurred on July 4, 1851 in Lowell, Massachusetts and was named as a parody of the more somber Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest military organization in the United States. New Englanders in several cities started parading in concert with other New England towns in the middle of the 1800s in "Ancient and Horrible" or "Antique and Horribles" parades. The dress was meant to satirize politicians and other public figures. This had largely died out by 1900 in Vermont. Gloucester, Massachusetts continues to have a "Horribles Parade" into the 21st century but without the satirical political dimension the costumes once held. 
Glocester Rhode Island's "Ancient and Horribles Parade" was founded in 1926 when Calvin Coolidge was U.S. President. Coolidge was a member of the original Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in Boston. According to the 2008 chair of the parade, Connie Leathers, "...Rhode Islanders being Rhode Islanders made fun of them." The Parade features both traditional Fourth of July floats and marchers, such as veterans and fire trucks, as well as often irreverent, satirical displays commenting on political and cultural issues.

Ray Prosser

Thomas Raymond 'Ray' Prosser (born 2 March 1927) was a Welsh international rugby union prop who played club rugby for Pontypool and was capped 22 times for Wales. Prosser also represented the British Lions in their 1959 tour of Australia and New Zealand, and played invitational rugby for the Barbarians. He is often remembered more for his coaching of an extremely successful Pontypool side during the 1970s and 1980s.
Rugby playing career.
Prosser played much of his club rugby for Pontypool, whom he joined in the late 1950s. At club level he was placed mainly in the second row, but later switched to the front row during his international career. Prosser was an enthusiastic student of rugby and believed in regular playing and training. His playing style was robust and aggressive, whose work rate in the scrum and mauls was tireless. Prosser was often seen as over-vigorous, if not dirty, in some aspects of his play; especially in line outs where he would sometimes use his arms illegally on his opposite jumper.
Prosser was first selected for Wales during the 1956 Five Nations Championship, replacing Neath's Courtney Meredith in a game against Scotland. Under the captaincy of Cliff Morgan, Wales won the game 9-3, but Prosser lost his place to Meredith in the next game of the tournament in Ireland. After Wales lost the Welsh game against Ireland, Prosser was back in favour with the selectors and was part of the team that beat France in the last game of the competition. The victory over the French gave Wales the Championship trophy, making Prosser a Five Nations winning player.
During the 1957 Five Nations Championship, Prosser was rewarded with a position in the Welsh squad that would see him represent his country in the competition for the next three years without without missing a game. It was during the 1957 campaign that Prosser scored his only international points, when he scored a try in a win over France. As well as representing Wales over six Five Nations Championships, Prosser faced two touring Southern Hemisphere teams; Australia in 1958 and South Africa in 1960.
In 1959 Prosser was one of nine Welsh players to be selected to play in Ronnie Dawson's British Lions team when they toured Australia and New Zealand. Prosser was not a natural tourist, he had a fear of flying and was also homesick during the long five month tour. He also suffered an injury early in the tour, but after his recovery, he played with his normal good form, impressing in the game against North Auckland. Prosser was chosen to play in the final test against New Zealand, which the Lions won.

Coaching career.
Prosser was a leading committee man at Pontypool Rugby Club and after retiring from playing rugby was given the role of coaching the first team in 1969. Prosser brought the same commitment he practiced in his own personal fitness and training into his coaching techniques. His methods were revolutionary, producing one of the strongest Pontypool teams in the club's history. During Prosser's time at Pontypool, he oversaw the 'Pontypool Front Row', made up of Graham Price, Bobby Windsor and Charlie Faulkner, the three players represented Wales on 19 occasions. The players credited Prosser's commitment to fitness as a major factor in their rugby development. Prosser coached the Pontypool first team for 18 years.

Aristides Welch

Aristides J. Welch (1811 – April 9, 1890) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse breeder.
Welch owned Erdenheim Stud Farm at Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania. In 1870 he purchased the mare Maggie B. B. from Captain T. G. Moore and stood her at Erdenheim. In 1872 he purchased the sire Leamington. Welch's broodmare selections led to Leamington becoming the Leading sire in North America in 1875, 1877, 1879, and 1881. Among those bred to Leamington was Maggie B. B. who produced three Classic winners in all, two of which were sired by Leamington. Their first was the 1879 Preakness Stakes winner, Harold, and their second was Iroquois, who in 1881 became the first American-bred horse to ever win England's famous Epsom Derby. Maggie B. B.'s third Classic winner was the colt Panique by Welch's stallion, Alarm. Panique won the 1884 Belmont Stakes. [http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/MaggieBB.html]
Among Welch's clients was friend and fellow Lexington breeder, Hal Price McGrath, owner of McGrathiana Stud. McGrath's mare Sarong was one of Leamington's mates in his first season at stud for Aristides Welch, producing a colt which McGrath named Aristides in honor of his friend. The horse Aristides won the inaugural running of the Kentucky Derby. 
In May 1882, Aristides Welch sold Erdenheim Stud and the bulk of its bloodstock to Commodore Norman Kittson and his brother James of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

History of cities in Canada

Over the last 14,000 years, Canada's territory has developed from a place without human habitation, to one with many villages, towns, and cities. Canada's cities span the continent of North America from east to west, with many major cities located relatively close to the border with the United States. Cities are home to the majority of Canada's approximately 33 million inhabitants—just over 80 percent of Canadians lived in urban areas in 2006.
Early urbanization – 14,000 BCE – 1850 CE.
Settlements and villages, 14,000 BCE – 1541 CE.
During the Wisconsin glaciation 50,000-17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwestern North America (Alaska). Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years. Arriving in Canada around 16,500-13,000 years ago after initially inhabiting the territories of Alaska, archaeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first "widespread" habitation of Canada and further south occurred during the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum. Yet Canada's first people did not build towns or cities upon arrival. They were few in number compared to the size of the North American continent and most lived a nomadic subsistence lifestyle, following the migration of animal herds that provided food.
Over time, Canada's First Nations started to construct different kinds of settlements, though they were generally temporary. For instance, the semi-nomadic peoples of the Maritimes, Quebec, and Northern Ontario, such as the Mi'kmaq, Cree, and Algonquin constructed temporary camps and villages with wigwams and long houses as the basic architecture of settlement. Nomadic First Nations living on the Canadian Prairies developed tipis with thin wooden frames and an outer covering of animal hides for portability in erecting temporary camps, with the people often moving to a new location each day to follow the bison herds. In the interior of British Columbia, semi-permanent settlements were constructed by First Nations with pit houses. In the far north, the Inuit constructed temporary camps with igloos, a domed structure made of snow, and tents made of animal hides in the summer.
The Haida constructed villages on Canada's west coast. These people constructed settlements with large houses of red cedar planks, demonstrating advanced carpentry and joinery skills. The most advanced design was the six beam house, named for the number of beams that supported the roof. The front of each house would be decorated with a Totem pole, with the pole and sometimes the house brightly painted with artistic designs.
Near 1000 CE, many Iroquoian-speaking communities around the Great Lakes began to switch from a nomadic life to more permanent settlements. The richness of the soil in the St. Lawrence valley, along with the abundance of fisheries nearby and of forests rich in game animals, provided resources for the establishment of Iroquois villages. In what is today Southern Ontario and Quebec, the Iroquois constructed permanent agricultural settlements with populations of several hundred to several thousand people. These villages were made up of long houses and could have fortifications such as palisades.
Settlements, villages, and towns, 1541-1850.
Aboriginal peoples had been developing different kinds of settlements over thousands of years in Canada, but it was the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century which led to the establishment of the modern cities of Canada. Many of the new arrivals, both French and English, were from cities and brought with them the experience and knowledge of urban life. They used their knowledge and technology for city building, implementing techniques for the construction of permanent buildings, transportation and communication facilities, and the means of producing food for concentrated groups of people.
Cities were slow to grow in the early period of European colonization in Canada. Those who arrived did so within a colonial and mercantile context that emphasized the exploitation of the colony for economic purposes at a minimum of imperial expense. With the colonial economies in Canada based to a great extent on the fur trade, cities remained mostly administrative centres for the colonies. It was also a period of conflict between England and France, rival colonial powers until 1763, and between Britain and the United States of America from that point until the mid-nineteenth century. This turmoil discouraged the development of cities.
The towns.
Eastern cities such as St. John's (1583), Quebec City (1608), Montreal (1642), Halifax (1749), Saint John (1785), and Sherbrooke (1793) were founded in these years. More to the west, Toronto was established in 1793 as York. Of these cities, Montreal would become the most prominent city in Canada up to the 20th century. Toronto grew at a quick pace, gaining its status as a city and present name in 1834.
Montreal—1642
The area now known as Montreal has been a place of human habitation by Canada's native peoples for the last 8000 years. The first European, Jacques Cartier, reached the site in 1535, however it was only in 1639 that the first permanent white settlement was established by Frenchman Jerome Le Royer, leading to the establishment of Ville Marie, a Roman Catholic mission, in 1642.
After a series of brutal attacks by the Iroquois, defending their territory, the arrival of new colonists in 1653 ensured the future of the city. The settlement became a fur trading centre but endured continuous raids by warring Iroquois until the Great Peace of 1701 guaranteed its safety.
After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, all the French territory in North America, including Ville Marie, became part of British North America. The town was subjected to invasion and a brief occupation by American forces in 1775, but they were subsequently routed and Montreal retaken by the British, with Canadian and Indian help.
The arrival of British immigrants and the establishment of the North West Company, fur trading rival to the Hudson's Bay Company, with headquarters in Ville Marie, ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. The Eagle Foundry of Montreal built the Äccommodation¨, Canada's first steam powered vessel. The opening of the Lachine Canal in 1825 reinforced the location as a port. Coal gas street lighting was introduced in 1838.
The City of Montreal was established in 1832 with 27,000 inhabitants. During the period of its primarily European history, Montreal initially had a Francophone majority but Anglophone immigration tipped the balance by about 1830. From 1844 to 1849 Montreal served as the capital of the United Province of Canada.
The rise of the city - 1850–1920.
Factors for growth.
Canada's first cities appeared during these years. Fueled by the arrival of white, Christian immigrants from Europe, drawn by the hope for a better life in the new world, and a high domestic birth rate, they served as outposts of civilization in a land that was still mostly wild and inhospitable. In 1851 Canada's population stood at 2.4 million. By 1861 it had grown a third, to 3.2 million and by 1871 to 3.7 million.
Economic forces were also at play. The repeal of the Corn Laws in Britain in 1846 provided a symbolic end to the era of mercantilism and ushered in the era of capitalism. Private investment, mostly from Britain, provided the foundation for a nascent industrial structure based on transportation (the steam train), construction, electricity, public works, heavy manufacturing, consumer and industrial services and related financial institutions.
The introduction of a number of technological innovations also supported city growth, including the telegraph, water and sewer systems, the telephone, urban transit, the electric light, the skyscraper, central heating and the techniques of light and heavy manufacturing. These new transportation and communications technologies also led to the creation of a new ïnter-urban network of cities which contributed to their growth based on mutual interaction.
The fading fear of attack by the USA provided a peaceful context for urban growth and the movement away from colonialism towards democracy gave urban dwellers the power to influence the shape of their cities.
The construction of universities and cultural facilities in cities put a more human face on the harsh environment.
The British North America Act, an act of the British Parliament, which established an independent and democratic Canada in 1867, reflected the rural character of the country at that time. Of a population of 3,600,000 almost 2,900,000 were rural dwellers while 700,000 lived in cities. The political forces at play involved both federal and provincial powers. Therefore the BNA Act provided areas of exclusive jurisdiction for federal and provincial governments. Because cities were not predominant, the allocation of taxing powers for the financing of their growth, was left in the hands of the provinces. This would have important negative consequences a century later.
The Canadian Pacific Railway, created to realize the dream of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald for a transcontinental nation, was almost solely responsible for the emergence of the cities of western Canada during these years.
In Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church worked to maintain the rural nature of Quebec society, in the belief that this would help preserve the Catholic nature of the population and reinforce the Church's strength. One notable example of this policy was seen in the church sponsored attempt to ¨colonize¨ the rural Abitibi region of the province by farmers in the early twentieth century. The project failed because the region was only marginally suited to agriculture. This policy served to militate against urban growth in that province.
Furthermore the nature of immigration limited the growth of cities in Quebec. Most immigrants to Canada during these years were English- speaking and preferred to settle in large cities, including Montreal with an existing English speaking population. On the other hand there were few French-speaking immigrants and the mostly French-speaking cities elsewhere in the province, including Quebec City and Trois-Rivières could not rely on this source for growth.
Emigration too had a negative effect on the growth of cities in Quebec. Around 1900, economic conditions in Quebec were very difficult and about 1,000,000 French-speaking Canadians left the province looking for work in the textile mills of New England.
By 1901, cities had grown to a point where the Union of Canadian Municipalities was formed to represent their interests.
Changing structures – high rise cores and suburbs.
During these years the structures of cities evolved rapidly. In 1850 the city was essentially all ¨downtown¨. The main buildings, serving residential, commercial and industrial functions, were made of wood or stone, mostly four to five stories tall and self-supporting. Streets were of dirt or occasionally cobblestone and strewn with garbage and human excrement. Animals wandered about and horses were everywhere, solo, with rider or pulling wagons or carriages. In larger cities public transit was provided by horse cars on rails. Gas lights provided illumination at night. The force of life was provided by muscle power, animal or human.
This changed rapidly. The introduction of the self-supporting steel framed building in the 1880s led to the construction of skyscrapers of six floors and more. The introduction of electricity and telephones was marked by the installation of hundreds of telephone and hydro poles along city streets, supporting electric and telephone cables. Electric street lighting replaced gas lights. The construction of water and sewer systems eliminated human waste from the urban living space. The introduction of municipal garbage collection reduced the presence of garbage.
In the latter part of the century, the rise of the new middle class created a demand for housing beyond the city core. This was met by private contractors building individual homes on single lots in newly created suburbs, adjacent to the downtown core. Public transport was provided by the extension of the new electric powered streetcar to the suburbs. The downtown core began to lose its residential vocation and became a space increasingly devoted to commerce, industry and to a lesser extent, public life.
In the new century the introduction of the car began to make its own dramatic mark. By 1920, the horse was gone, most cities had paved roads in the downtown core and main paved roads served the rising numbers of cars in the suburbs. At this point the Canadian city came to resemble what we see today.
The cities.
Dominance of Montreal.
The rise of Montreal as Canada's metropolis was the most important feature of urban development during these years. In 1851 the population stood at 57,000, but grew to 90,000 by 1861, becoming in the process Canada's largest city. It would hold this position for more than one hundred years before being surpassed by Toronto.
Transportation made Montreal. Situated at the head of the St. Lawrence River, it became Canada's major port and rail centre. Ships from overseas arrived bringing goods and immigrants. First the Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers in 1854 followed by Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines in 1903 operated trans Atlantic passenger liners to Britain. Shippers from the Great Lakes system, notably Canada Steamship Lines Inc. brought grain for export.
The great Western Railway from Montreal to Windsor went into operation in 1854 carrying passengers and goods into the hinterland, followed by the Grand Trunk Railway from Montreal to Sarnia in 1860. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) one of the great railway companies of the world, established its headquarters there. The huge CPR Angus Shops (1904) and Montreal Locomotive Works (1901) formed the heart of Canada's heavy industrial capability, building steam engines and rolling stock for the railways. Canadian Car and Foundry manufactured street cars.
Other major manufacturing industries, grew along the Lachine Canal (1825), including Redpath Sugar, Darling and Brady, soap manufacturers, the St. Lawrence Glass Company, the Canadian Rubber Company, Laing Packing and Provisions (1852) and Belding Paul & Co. silk manufacturers provided consumer and industrial goods. The Imperial Tobacco Company (1912) became Canada's largest manufacturer of cigarettes. Morgans, Canada's first department store, opened its doors in 1845. The Montreal Telegraph Company, began offering service in 1847 and Canadian Marconi Company (CMC Electronics) was formed in Montreal in 1903.
Financing for this activity was provided by the banks of St. James Street (Saint Jacques Street) which became the heart of Canada's financial sector anchored by the Bank of Montreal (1817) and the Montreal Stock Exchange, founded in 1872.
Canada's first skyscraper, the eight-storey New York Life Insurance Company Building, was built in 1889. The elegant Queen's Hotel opened for business in 1893. In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for hockey as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena, was built in Montreal in 1898.
Engineering works included a steam-powered municipal water system in operation by 1857 and the massive Victoria Bridge (Montreal) built in 1859. The Montreal City Passenger Railway Company began offering horse-car service in 1861 and converted to electric powered streetcars in 1891. In 1884 the Royal Electric Company began providing electricity to the city.
During the First World War, Montreal became a major producer of munitions. Among other things, cordite was manufactured at Beloeil, Quebec, by Canadian Explosives Limited and at Nobel, Quebec, by British Cordite Limited.
Montreal's place as the largest French-speaking city in North America, as well as the home of a substantial Roman Catholic population, was reinforced by the establishment of Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal), the initial construction of which was completed in 1830. French-language newspapers including La Presse (Canadian newspaper) in 1884 and "Le Devoir" in 1910 and the Monument National theatre stood as pillars of cultural life. McGill University, founded in 1821, and the Montreal Star (1869) and Montreal Gazette (1785, originally a French language publication) newspapers stood as testaments to the vitality of the English-speaking community.
The Golden Square Mile, a residential area on the south slope of Mount Royal, became the home of Canada's wealthiest citizens, including William Dow, John Redpath, William Notman, James McGill, John Molson, Sir George Simpson (administrator) and Sir Hugh Allan.
By 1921 the city had 618,000 inhabitants.
Hopeful beginnings east.
Toronto, with a population of 30,000 in 1851, and Bytown (renamed Ottawa in 1855) with a population of 8,000, would become respectively the future economic and political capitals of Canada.
Toronto (1834)
As was the case with many Canadian cities, the place now known as Toronto was inhabited for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, by a number of tribes including the Cayugas, Mohawks, Neutral-Erie, Oneidas, Senecas and Wendat.
Between 1750 and 1759 the French operated a trading post, Fort Rouille, in the area where the Canadian National Exhibition is now located. The British purchased of land from the native peoples in 1787 and Governor John Graves Simcoe chose the site for the capital (which he named York) of the newly created Upper Canada. Concerned with military transportation to protect the new colony from US attack, he built roads west to what is now Windsor, east towards Montreal, and north, the present day Yonge Street.
York was attacked and burned to the ground by the American Army in 1813 and the British, in retaliation, attacked and burned the White House in Washington to the ground in 1814. Another US attack that same year was defeated. The town was renamed Toronto in 1834 and William Lyon Mackenzie served as the first mayor.
The growth of Toronto in the latter part of the century was rapid, with the population passing from 30,000 in 1851 to 56,000 in 1871, to 86,400 by 1881 and to 181,000 by 1891. In part this was due to Irish immigration resulting from the Great Irish Famine between 1845 and 1849. The presence of the Roman Catholic Irish among Protestants led to racial tension, culminating in the Julibee Riots of 1875.
Toronto's rise to prominence was initiated by the arrival of the train and telegraph. The railways connected Toronto to a wide hinterland. The Great Western Railway, from Montreal to Toronto to Windsor, was completed in 1854 and the Grand Trunk Railway, from Montreal to Toronto to Sarnia, in 1869. Along with the railways came the telegraph. Toronto was the first Canadian city to get service when it was introduced by the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Co. in 1846.
Industrial mass production, in this case of clothing, became part of Toronto's fabric. Livingstone and Johnston, (later W.R. Johnston & Company), founded in Toronto in 1868, was the first in Canada to cut cloth and sew together the component pieces. It used the newly introduced sewing machine as part of a continuous operation. William E. Davies established Canada's first large-scale hog slaughterhouse in Toronto in 1874.
Toronto became the home of the first plastics produced in Canada. The Rathburn Company of Toronto began to produce wood distillates including wood alcohol and calcium acetate, used to make acetic acid or acetone, in 1897. The Standard Chemical Company of Toronto, established in 1897, initiated the production of acetic acid in 1899 and formaldehyde, from the oxidation of wood alcohol, in 1909. This latter product was an essential element in the production of the fully synthetic, phenol-formaldehyde plastic (Bakelite).
Heavy manufacturing took hold in nearby cities. General Electric Canada, founded by Thomas Edison in nearby Peterborough in 1892, contributed to heavy manufacturing techniques through the fabrication of large electric generators and electric motors, which were used to supply the rapidly growing Canadian market for electrical generating equipment. Similar heavy electrical products were manufactured by Westinghouse Canada, established in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1897. Steel mills were established there as well.
Public services improved city life. A steam-powered municipal water pumping station was in service in Toronto by 1841, the same year that coal gas street lighting was introduced. Horsecar service began in Toronto in 1861. It was operated by the Toronto Street Railways until 1892, when it was replaced by electric streetcar service. The Toronto Power House and the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario began offering electricity to that city and the province in 1906.
The growth of the city could be seen in the construction of skyscrapers. The first self-supporting steel-framed skyscraper in Canada was the Robert Simpson Department Store at the corner of Yonge and Queen with six floors and electric elevators, built in 1895. This was followed by the Traders Bank of Canada, (15 floors, Yonge Street, 1905), the Canadian Pacific Building, (16 floors, 1913), the Royal Bank, (20 floors, 1915), the Royal York Hotel, 1929, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in 1931. Canada's first escalator was installed in 1904 at Eaton's Department Store on Queen Street.
The beginnings of the rise of Toronto as the cultural capital of Canada were seen in the establishment in 1827 of what would become the University of Toronto and the founding of The Globe (later the "Globe and Mail")in 1844. Book publishing also took root. Publishers of note included Musson Book Company, 1894, G.N. Morang, 1897, McLeod & Allen, 1901, the University of Toronto Press, 1901, Oxford University Press, 1904, John C. Winston, 1904, Macmillan Company of Canada Ltd., 1905, McClelland and Goodchild, 1906, (later McClelland and Stewart), Cassell and Company Limited, 1907, J.M. Dent and Sons, 1913 and Thomas Nelson and Sons Limited, 1913. Performing arts space was expanded with the completion of the Grand Opera House, in 1874, Massey Hall in 1894 and the Royal Alexandra Theatre in 1907. The Canadian National Exhibition, established in 1878 became a prominent feature of city and Canadian life.
With continued growth the city began to expand at the periphery and newly created adjacent towns were annexed. They included West Toronto, East Toronto, Parkdale and Brockton Village.
New Southern Ontario cities - the essence of Canada.
St. Catharines(1821), London(1826), Hamilton(1846), Oshawa(1850), Kitchener(1854) and Windsor(1854) founded in the mid-nineteenth century would eventually form the core of the most densely populated and heavily industrialized region of Canada.
Hopeful beginnings west.
For the most part, creations of the CPR, Winnipeg(1873), Calgary(1876), Regina(1882), Saskatoon(1883), Vancouver(1886) and Edmonton(1904) were strung like beads on a chain across Canada, linked by the new transcontinental railway. Victoria(1849) had earlier colonial origins. Vancouver would quickly become the most important.
Vancouver(1886)
Evidence indicates that native peoples, notably the Coast Salish, inhabited the area that became Vancouver for about 10,000 years before the arrival of European settlers. The first Europeans to explore the area included Spanish Captain José María Narváez in 1791 and British Captain George Vancouver in 1792. During his exploration Vancouver met with another Spanish expedition in the command of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores. Simon Fraser was the first white man to reach the area overland, which he did in 1808. However, native resistance to the presence of settlement was strong and it was not until 1862 that the first white settlement, the McCleery Farm, was established in what is now known as the Southlands district of Vancouver.
A year later, Moodyville was established on the north shore of Burrard Inlet as home to lumbering activity and a sawmill. Stamps Mill (1867) was established on the south shore of the Inlet in what is now downtown Vancouver. The quality of Vancouver lumber quickly gained a worldwide reputation and was used to provide masts for the Royal Navy and in the construction of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in the Forbidden City, Beijing.
A saloon built a mile to the west of Stamps Mill soon became an area of settlement eventually known as Gastown. It was named in honour of the talkative saloon owner ¨Gassy¨ John Deighton. The area was surveyed by the British colonial administrators and formally renamed Granville in 1871. The construction of the first federal penitentiary in New Westminster in 1878, bore witness to the lawlessness of the region.
The CPR made Vancouver. William Van Horne, President of the CPR, chose the area as the western terminus for the transcontinental railway and renamed it Vancouver in 1886. Along with the railway came transcontinental telegraph service, also operated by Canadian Pacific. Stanley Park was established by the new city council and a disastrous fire destroyed the city that same year. A new city quickly arose from the ashes complete with a modern water system, the cities' first sewer system in 1886, electricity in 1887 and streetcar services.
In 1891, the newly formed Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines began offering trans-Pacific steamship service from Vancouver with three large steel-hulled ships, the "Empress" liners: "India, China and Japan."In 1902, Canadian Pacific completed a trans-Pacific cable telegraph, linking Vancouver with Australia and New Zealand. This reinforced Vancouver's position as a Pacific transportation and communication gateway.
The population of the city mushroomed passing from about 5,000 in 1886 to 42,000 in 1900 and it became, in the process, Canada's third largest City. The appearance of the skyscraper provided visual evidence of growth, the first being the Dominion Building, (13 floors), in 1910, followed by the World (Sun) Tower, (17 floors), in 1912.
Vancouver society was especially turbulent during these years. The First War saw two general strikes and the city was hit by depression in the 1890s, 1919, 1923 and 1929. Racism was also present. The presence of a large number of Chinese in Vancouver, located there as a result of immigration to work on the CPR, lead to serious anti-Chinese rioting organized in part by the Asiatic Exclusion League in 1907. In 1914, 376 prospective Punjabi immigrants arriving aboard the ship Komataga Maru were refused entry into Canada on a technicality, the enforcement of which was racially inspired. They were forced to return to India.
After the first war working-class neighbourhoods, including Mount Pleasant, South Vancouver and Grandview-Woodland, began to appear. The CPR established Point Grey for development as an exclusive neighbourhood in 1908. Shaughnessy Heights was also established for the well-heeled.
The founding of the University of British Columbia in 1915 represented a significant development in the cultural field.
Holding their own.
During this period, the centre of Canada quickly shifted west and south leaving St. John's, Halifax, Saint John, Quebec and Sherbrooke far from the centre but still close enough, through marine and rail connections, for them to retain residual economic and demographic weight.
The City Dominant - 1920- present.
Introduction.
Until 1921 Canada was a largely rural nation. However by that date the balance had shifted. Of Canada's population of 8,787,000 people, roughly 4,300,000, or 50 percent lived in cities. This was the result of internal urban population growth, the steady influx of the rural population into the cities and the arrival of immigrants, most of whom settled in cities. This shift was permanent and the urban percentage of the population continued to increase for the remainder of the twentieth century. Over 85 percent of Canada's citizens were urban dwellers in 2008.
The production of wealth also became concentrated in cities during this period. Rural production (fishing, forestry, agriculture, mining), was outstripped by urban manufacturing and the service sectors. In 2008, about 90 percent of Canada's economy was urban based.
The Golden Age 1920- 1970.
A harmonious balance.
During this period there was a balance in the factors that contributed to city growth. The increase in population was supported by a number of elements including private investment for commerce and industry, which provided jobs and money for consumer spending and public investment in education and infrastructure including, roads, public transit, electric, water and sewer systems. Canada's mostly white, Christian population also provided a homogeneity of values that created a calm and harmonious context for growth.
City growth was somewhat stunted during the depression years of the thirties but experienced industrial growth during the hot house years of World War II and the boom associated with pent-up consumer demand in the post war years. This boom was accompanied and fueled by immigration, mostly from Europe.
The establishment of the Dominion Conference of Mayors in 1935 was symptomatic of growth of Canadian cities during these years. In 1937, this organization fused with the Union of Canadian Municipalities to become the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities. This organization was renamed the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in 1976.
The cities.
Metropolis : Montreal at its peak.
Montreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, which grew to 1.2 million in 1971.
The twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world's first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939.
Film production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, "Kinograms" in the twenties and "Canadian Cameo" from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the National Film Board of Canada, in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, "The World in Action" and "Canada Carries On", series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of Université de Montréal in 1919 and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1934. The Montreal Forum, built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team.
Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation founded the Montreal Neurological Institute at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada during WWII.
In the post-war years Canada formalized its wartime shortwave radio broadcasting activities with the creation of Radio Canada International. In 1945, this international radio broadcasting service was established with production facilities in Montreal and a huge shortwave transmitter site at Sackville, New Brunswick. Television was introduced to Canada by CBC, first in the French language by CBFT in Montreal on 6 September 1952. Radio-Canada established extensive production facilities for French-language programming, especially in the field of television drama. In the early seventies TVA also established a dynamic presence in this field.
The Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec (1949) and the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec (1950), were the first shopping centres built in Canada. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal.
The completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, in 1959, the Trans-Canada Highway, in 1962, Autoroutes 20 and 40 in Quebec and Highway 401, in Ontario, in 1968 strengthened Montreal's connection with other Canadian cities and with the continent. The construction of the Montreal Subway, in 1966 and Underground Montreal in the mid-sixties eased pedestrian movement in the downtown core and the suburbs. The World Fair, Expo 67 brought Montreal to the attention of the world as never before. La Ronde (amusement park) became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of Expo ’67.
Canada's first heart transplant was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.
A number of important skyscrapers were built in the sixties including, Place Ville Marie (Royal Bank), 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), 1962 and the Hôtel Château Champlain, in 1967.
Cultural institutions such at La Presse and Le Devoir newspapers and the beautiful Place des Arts (1963) performing arts theatre, symbolized the vigour of the French language in the city as did the development of a very vibrant popular music and theatre scene in the sixties and seventies with noted performers including Robert Charlebois, Louise Forestier, Diane Dufresne, Claude Dubois, Rene Claude and Denise Pelletier to name but a handful among dozens. Further intellectual growth was symbolized by the founding of the Université du Québec in 1968.
The Montreal Forum was home to the iconic Montreal Canadiens hockey team which won five Stanley Cup victories in a row from 1955 to 1960 becoming in the process the most successful professional sports team in history up to that time. The star player of the team Maurice Richard gained a reputation that lives to this day.
However all was not well with the city. The rise of the automobile put an end to streetcar manufacturing in the city. The conversion of the railways from steam to diesel in the fifties resulted in the closure of Montreal's huge locomotive manufacturing facilities. Political turmoil caused by the mailbox bombings of the separatist FLQ in the sixties put a chill into the public and world's perception of the city. The construction of the Boulevard Metropolitaine in the sixties, although it improved traffic low, divided the city along an east west axis. The massive trench of the new north south six-lane Boulevard Decaire divided the city east from west.
Toronto and Southern Ontario cities - waiting in the wings.
These cities experienced strong growth during this period that would see them gain national prominence in the latter part of the century.
Toronto: Toronto gained considerable industrial, cultural and demographic strength during the fifty-year period from 1920 to 1970.
The industrial strength of Toronto area was reinforced with the establishment in 1918 of an auto production plant by General Motors in nearby Oshawa, where it produced Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands and by Studebaker Canada Ltd. which produced cars in Hamilton from 1946 to 1966. Steel for the production of these cars came from the nearby mills of Stelco and Dofasco in Hamilton and gasoline, from refineries in Sarnia. The familiar, Canadian Tire, began operations there in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers. The Trans-Canada Airway was extended to Toronto in 1939.
The founding of what would become the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1922 and the establishment of the CBC radio English-language radio network headquarters with its associated production facilities in the city in 1936 were signal cultural events.
Notable landmarks of the period featured the Royal York Hotel, built in 1929 and Maple Leaf Gardens home to the fabled Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, completed in 1931. Important public works included the massive R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, in 1926 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, completed in 1939.
During the Second World War Toronto became an important centre for the production of weapons including the warplanes manufactured by de Havilland Canada and Avro Canada. Military vehicles were produced by General Motors in Oshawa. The Connaught Laboratories (Sanofi-Aventis) at the University of Toronto produced penicillin for wartime use.
Industrial capacity gained further strength with the establishment in the fifties, by the Ford Motor Company of Canada of a production plant in Oakville, which would eventually become a suburb of Toronto. The signing of the Auto Pact with the US in 1965 created massive investment in auto production facilities in Toronto and southern Ontario.
The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.
The CBC owned and operated CBLT-TV, Canada's first English-language television station, with related production facilities, went on the air there on 8 September 1952. The first private television broadcaster, CFTO, began operation in 1961.
Toronto was home to the construction of a number of advanced aircraft in the post-war years including the Avro Canada Jetliner, the Avro CF-100 jet interceptor and the fabled Avro Arrow. However the expense of the latter endeavour in the absence of a significant market forced the AVRO into bankruptcy in 1959.
Electric energy projects in the sixties and seventies included the Lakeview Generating Station, completed in Mississauga, in 1962 and the Nanticoke Generating Station (largest coal-fired plant in North America), in Nanticoke, Ontario, in 1978. In 1971 electricity produced from nuclear power became commercially available to Torontonians and other Ontarians from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario.
The field of transportation saw the completion of a number of significant works both local and national. Local works included the Toronto Subway, in 1954 and the GO Transit rail system in 1967. The PATH system built in the sixties, allowed pedestrians to move about the downtown core using underground passages. National projects with Toronto as a hub or important destination included the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1959, the St. Lawrence Seaway, 1959, the Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1962, and Highway 401 completed in 1968.
The Sunnybrook Plaza (1951) and York Mills, (1952), became the first shopping centres in the region. Skyscrapers of note included the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower in 1967, The Simpson Tower, 1968, the Royal Trust Tower, 1969.
By 1971 Toronto had a population of 2,630,000.
The rising east and west.
Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver would experience sustained growth but not enough to make them the metropolis.
Vancouver: In 1921 Vancouver had a population of 232,000.
The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 solidified Vancouver's place as Canada's largest western city and the third largest in the country, a place that it holds to this day. The canal made it possible for ships to carry cargo from Vancouver directly to ports in Europe. Freight rates that favoured the use of eastern Canadian ports over Vancouver were eliminated in the twenties and port growth boomed. The Vancouver Harbour Commission was established in 1913 and the shipping activity centred around the Ballentyne Pier, built in 1923, which at the time was the most modern in the British Empire.
The rise of the automobile lead to the construction of new bridges over False Creek including: the Granville Street Bridge, (1889 rebuilt 1954), the Burrard Street Bridge, 1932, and the Cambie Street Bridge, (1912 rebuilt 1984). Auto traffic to North Vancouver was facilitated with the construction of the first Second Narrow's Bridge in 1925 and by the completion of the Lion's Gate Bridge, in 1938, across the First Narrows.
Crime was a prominent feature of city life. Vancouver mayor L. D. Taylor practiced an ¨open town¨ policy that sought to manage activities such as prostitution, bootlegging and gambling, by restricting them to racially oriented areas including Chinatown, Japantown, and Hogan's Alley. He was defeated in 1934 by Mayor McGeer who promised to clean up the city.
In 1931 the population of Vancouver stood at 347,000. In the twenties and thirties Vancouver became the western anchor of a number of national communication and transportation networks. These included the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932, the Trans-Canada Telephone System, 1932, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network, 1936 and the Trans Canada Airway in 1938.
Cultural life received a boost with the establishment of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 1919 and the opening of the Orpheum (Vancouver) theatre in 1927.
By 1941 the population had grown to 394,000. During World War II, the air base at Boundary Bay became an important centre for the training of heavy bomber crews. The city also featured prominently in the construction of ships for the war effort. Fear of an invasion by Japanese naval forces lead to Canadian citizens of Japanese ancestry being sent to concentration camps in the BC interior 1942. Many of these citizens were from Vancouver.
In 1951 the population stood at 562,000 and further technologies became available. The Park Royal Shopping Centre, in West Vancouver, became the first in the city in 1950 and Empire Stadium, was built to host the 1954 British Empire Games. Vancouver became the western anchor of the new CBC national television network in 1958 and the western hub of the newly completed Trans-Canada Highway in 1962. The giant Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, was built in 1959 for passenger and vehicle ferry service to southern Vancouver Island and the nearby Roberts Bank Superport coal terminal was finished in the late sixties. A second, Second Narrow's Bridge was built in 1960 and the W.A.C.Bennett Dam, was completed in 1967.
The establishment of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in 1959 and of Simon Fraser University in 1965, enriched city cultural life. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the Westwood Motorsport Park was built in nearby Coquitlam, that same year. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond in 1967.
By 1971 Vancouver had a population of 1,000,000.
City in decline and subsequent revival - 1970–present.
Trouble in the city.
Canada's population stood at 21 million in 1971 and has grown to 33 million in 2008. City expansion has continued throughout this period.
However, Canadian cities have experienced a number of serious problems due largely to the fact that the increase in population has not been supported as it was earlier in the century. While private investment has largely continued apace during these years, public expenditures have not been able to match the increasing demand for public services, including, education, health, welfare, public transport and roads and other infrastructure. This is because the constitution, created 100 years before, was developed for a rural country and did not provide adequate taxing mechanisms for the municipal generation of revenue. Constitutionally, cities were creatures of the province. Entrenched resistance to change, especially at the provincial level, that would see more taxing power transferred to the cities, has prevented effective action to remedy this problem.
Furthermore the social harmony and cohesion of values that characterized the golden age have also been eroded by the changing values of the indigenous increasingly secular, individualistic and materialistic population as well as the arrival of immigrants whose diverse views often conflict with those of their adopted country. Pollution, from industry and car exhaust has become a serious problem.
Importantly, the Auto Pact of 1965 and investments by the Big Three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have served to stimulate the growth of the cities of southern Ontario in much the same way that the CPR fuelled the growth of the cities of western Canada 60 years before.
Changing structures – urban sprawl and downtown decay.
This era has been marked by urban sprawl. Population growth has been limited mostly to the suburbs and city boundaries have stretched far into what had been countryside mere decades earlier. With the extension of suburbia the provision of public services has become increasingly expensive as water systems, sewer systems and other structures have radiated from the city core.
Of particular note is the construction of superhighways throughout the sixties and seventies. These massive corridors while designed to move increasing volumes of auto traffic also served to physically divide cities. In Toronto Highway 401 divides the city north/south, the Don Valley Parkway(1966), east/west and the Gardiner Expressway(1966) separates the city core from Lake Ontario. In Montreal, the Autoroute Metropolitaine divides the city north/south and Boulevard Decarie, east/west. The Queensway (Ottawa) in Ottawa divides the city north/south. The presence of cars has become so dominant that a casual observer seeing a city for the first time would assume that the primary inhabitant was the auto.
The displacement of the weight of the residential population from the city centre has begun to remove to market for downtown services and the downtown cores have begun to deteriorate. The construction of huge ¨ shopping centres¨ in suburbia has accelerated this process. In 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.
Although there is deterioration in infrastructure it is important to note that the kind of slums that characterize many cities in the third world and the cores of many US cities, do not exist in Canada.
The cities.
The New Metropolis : Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe.
During the seventies the population of Toronto surpassed that of Montreal. In 1971 the populations of the respective Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) for Toronto and Montreal stood at 2.7 million and 2.6 million. By 1981 Toronto had surpassed Montreal with a population of 3 million versus 2.8 million for Montreal. In 2009 there are 5.5 million people in the Toronto area.
Factors for the growth of Toronto over Montreal included strong immigration, increasingly by people of Asian and Negroid backgrounds, the increasing size of the auto industry in Southern Ontario, due to the signing of the Auto Pact with the US in 1965, a calmer political environment (Quebec experienced two referenda on separation during these years, one in 1980 and the other in 1995), lower personal income taxes than in Quebec and a more benign linguistic/educational environment.
Improved transportation facilities aided growth. Union Station (Toronto) provided a hub for passenger rail service in the busy Windsor Quebec corridor and a focus for the subway service. Highway 401 provided an artery for automobile traffic east and west. Toronto Pearson International Airport became Canada's largest and a massive new terminal building was recently completed.
During this period, three of Canada's largest banks became headquartered in Toronto: the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. These along with the Manulife Financial Corporation, Sun Life Financial Inc. and Toronto Stock Exchange form the financial district, the financial heart of Canada. Toronto also became the corporate capital of Canada with the majority of Canadian companies having their head offices there. Notable examples include: George Weston Ltd., Onex Corp, Magna International Inc., Wal-Mart Canada Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
Toronto strengthened its position as the cultural centre of English-speaking Canada during these years. The Globe and Mail and the National Post, two of Canada's most important newspapers have their head offices there. The new CBC Canadian Broadcasting Centre was completed in 1993 and became the corporation's control facility for English language broadcasting in Canada. Also in 1993 Ryerson Polytechnical Institute gained full university status and became, Ryerson Polytechnic University. Roy Thomson Hall became the home of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1982. This along with the newly constructed Princess of Wales Theatre and the venerable Royal Alexandra Theatre now form the heart of the theatre district. Cultural institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Royal Ontario Museum have recently had their buildings renovated. The Four Seasons Centre became the new home of the Canadian Opera Company and National Ballet of Canada when completed in 2006. The Toronto Film Festival, established in 1976, has become after Cannes, the most important in the world and now sports a new headquarters, the Bell Lightbox, opened in 2010. Film production has received a boost with the newly completed, Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the east end on the waterfront. Toronto has also been home to the Hockey Hall of Fame (1943), since 1961.
The changing high-rise downtown core provided visual evidence of growth. New skyscrapers included, the Royal Trust Tower, 1969, First Canadian Place, 1975, the CN Tower, 1975, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, 1977, the First Bank Tower, 1979, Scotia Plaza, 1988, the Sky Dome, 1989, the BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, 1990 and the Bay Wellington Tower, 1990.
Recently constructed skyscrapers include: One King Street West, 2005, West 1, 2005, Harbourview Estates 2, 2005, Residences of College Park 1, Toronto, 2006, Quantum 2 (Minto Midtown), 2008, the Bay Adelaide Centre West, 2009, the RBC Centre, 2009, Success, 2009 and Montage, 2009. Canada's largest theme park, Canada's Wonderland opened in 1981.
Public administration was streamlined when the governments of Toronto and its five adjacent municipalities Etobicoke, North York, East York, York, and Scarborough were fused to form a ¨megacity¨ in 1998. The political heart of the City, Nathan Phillips Square is framed by Toronto City Hall, while the popular heart is focused on the new Dundas Square with its fountains and multiple large screen video panels, located on Yonge Street at the north end of the Eaton Centre. 
Rosedale, Toronto, a suburb established in 1909 continues to be home to some of Canada's richest and most famous citizens.
However Toronto faces problems common to large North American cities, ranging from pollution, to urban sprawl, to the deterioration of infrastructure, racial tension and inequality, increasing levels of violent crime, heavy traffic congestion, poverty and lack of public housing.
More importantly, recent economic developments have had a considerable negative impact on Toronto and the region. In 2007 the Canadian dollar reached par with the US dollar causing a decline in the export of the region's manufactured products because of their relative increase in price. Furthermore the increase in the cost of oil and gas created an additional cost burden for these same manufacturers resulting in a substantial loss of manufacturing jobs due to plant cutbacks and closures. The simultaneous decline of the North American auto industry with its many factories in the region, due to an increasing inability to compete with Asian auto manufacturers was accelerated by the increasing price of gasoline, which discouraged consumers from purchasing new cars.
This collision of multiple negative factors has hit the manufacturing and technological base of the region's prosperity very dramatically in recent years. The road to continued prosperity for Toronto lies in increased competitiveness through technological and managerial innovation.
Heavyweights.
Montreal, population 3,500,000 and Vancouver, metro population 2,300,000 have become poles of attraction based on manufacturing and transportation.
Montreal - Stagnation: The population of Montreal, a city with an attractive geographical location, has declined over the last thirty years, because of negative economic, social and political, and fiscal factors. 
The weight of the Canadian economy has shifted south and west over the last three decades. This has been to the benefit of Toronto, which grew in part because of the Auto Pact signed in 1965 and Calgary, which has grown since the eighties because of oil. But the shift has been to the detriment of Montreal.
Demographically the birth rate in Canada has fallen below replacement rate during this period. Other cities in Canada have relied on immigration for growth but this option has not been available to Montreal for political reasons. Because of the prominence of Quebec separatism immigrants who speak English or who want to speak English have avoided Montreal for a fear of persecution by the French-speaking majority and settled in other large Canadian cities. Furthermore the province of Quebec in spite of vigorous efforts has been unable to attract French-speaking immigrants in significant numbers from other parts of the world.
The separatist threat has resulted in a net loss of mostly English-speakers from Montreal during these years and has put a chill into foreign investment.
Since the seventies the government of Quebec has responded positively to a growing public demand for social programmes, which by the end of the century were some of the most generous in Canada. In order to finance these programmes, personal income tax in Quebec became the highest in Canada and remains so. This high level of tax has served to further discourage the net immigration to Montreal, from other provinces and from other countries.
In an attempt to counteract these negative factors the government of Quebec also instructed its provincial crown electric utility, Hydro-Québec, with headquarters in Montreal, to offer electricity to both domestic and industrial clients at below market rates. This did not overcome the negative weight of the factors mentioned above. It has on the contrary led to stunning levels of corporate debt, for which all Quebecers, including Montrealers, will be responsible through higher taxes and possibly at some point, higher hydro rates.
The population of the Island of Montreal has evolved as follows during this period: (1971), 1,959,000, (1981), 1,760,000, (1991), 1,775,000, (2001), 1,812,000.
In spite of these factors the economy of Montreal was transformed in the latter part of the century. The heavy manufacturing of the earlier years was replaced by the high value added output of the aviation and pharmaceutical sectors. Notable companies in the former include, Bombardier, Bell Textron, Pratt & Whitney and CAE. The latter sector included Merck Frost and Phizer. Montreal also remains home to a large number of corporate head offices including those of Power Corporation of Canada, the Bank of Montreal, BCE Inc., Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., Hydro-Québec, Ace Aviation Holdings (Air Canada), Ultramar Ltd. and Metro Inc..
The downtown core did experience some significant construction including, the Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière in 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon in 1992 and the Molson Centre, the new home of the Montreal Canadiens, in 1996.
The period began optimistically with the construction of the massive Mirabel Airport to the northwest of the city in 1975. However this soon turned to disappointment, embarrassment and financial catastrophe as the new huge facility failed to attract traffic and became a sleepy industrial airport at the end of the century. This failure is both a symbol and a practical reflection of Montreal's decline during these years. The 1976 Olympics produced mixed results. They did focus the attention of the world on the city and were a sporting success. However the stadium was not finished on time and city of Montreal and the province were left with massive debts that were only paid off early in the new millennium.
The French language cultural output of the city has flourished over the last thirty years. Large volumes of French-language television drama for the Radio Canada, TVA and TQS networks are produced weekly. There is a flourishing domestic and foreign film production industry. Special events including the Montreal International Jazz Festival (1980), the Canadian Grand Prix and Just for Laughs (1983), have gained international fame. The greatest export of Montreal on the international scene is surely the Cirque du Soleil, with several permanent shows around the world.
Organized crime has changed over the decades. Run mainly by Canadian families of Italian origin, these groups were pushed aside in the eighties by biker gangs. The Outlaws originally gained control of the illegal drug trade and prostitution but in the nineties a brutal turf war saw them replaced by the Hells Angels.
Vancouver: Since 1970 Greater Vancouver has grown dramatically with the help of immigration from Asia and from other parts of Canada. Throughout the period, immigrants from South Asia have arrived in large numbers and tended to settle in the south east suburbs, notably in rapidly growing cities like Surrey. Immigrants from South-East Asia, particularly China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Korea, have congregated more in the City of Richmond and on the south side of Vancouver proper. These communities are complex in that they include immigrants with considerable wealth whose influence has had considerable impact on the face of the urban landscape and conventional immigrants of more modest means who contribute to the region's workforce and small-scale capitalism, as well as generations now of children born and raised in the province. 
The skyline of the city has reflected this growth with new structures including the 62 floor mixed use Living Shangri-La, the tallest building in the city, which opened in 2009.
Tourism has increased noticeably with the city having become the starting point for major cruise ship lines operating trips north through the Inside Passage.
The world's fair of 1986, Expo´86, focused the attention of the world on Vancouver. The fair was sited at the east end of False Creek which, in the thirty years after World War Two, became an industrial eyesore. In the 1970s some of the land was repurposed for housing and the Granville Island Market complex; in the early 1980s still more land was reclaimed and used as the site for the construction of the facilities for the fair. At the same time a rapid transit system, SkyTrain, was built to facilitate the movement of pedestrians around the city. This system was subsequently expanded in the lead-up to the 2010 Winter Olympics. The whole of the area around False Creek has been the site of significant densification of housing, typified by the construction of luxury apartment and condominium towers on the north or Yaletown side and lower-profile condominiums on the south side which includes the Athletes Village built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
While most Canadian cities are characterized by the presence of freeways through part of the downtown core, Vancouver is the exception for the city has, to this point, managed to keep roads of this type out of the city centre. Extensive changes to the regional freeway system are underway, including most notably a new bridge over the Fraser River at Port Mann to replace a 1960s structure. While Vancouver officially brands itself as a green city and does much to encourage rapid and conventional transit, pedestrianism, and cycling as alternatives to automobile travel, the larger urban region continues to depend heavily on the individual automobile.
Although Vancouver is a profoundly wealthy city with some of the highest housing prices in North America and, indeed, the world, it is also home to significant poverty and social dislocation. The old core of the city was long home to transient industrial workers who made seasonal use of 'single room occupancy' (SRO) hotels around Main Street and Hastings Street. Since the 1970s that neighbourhood has suffered economically to such a point that the Downtown East Side (DTES) is often characterized as 'blighted' and 'Canada's poorest postal code.' It contains one of the country's highest concentrations of dedicated social housing and social services, and is home to INSITE, the nation's first safe-injection facility. Much of the poverty, transience, substance abuse, and survival sex trade in the neighbourhood has its origins in mental health issues, many of which became acutely visible with the end of mental health institutionalization in the 1980s. Demand for land in a city that is surrounded by mountains and water has increased pressure on the DTES and has generated conflict over the potential for displacement of long-term marginalized residents through 'gentrification.' These changes are rejuvenating aspects of the old downtown's economy while creating new challenges for individuals with complex health, social, and economic issues.
As of 2013, the City of Vancouver has a population of 603,000 and the Greater or Metro region has a population in excess of 2,300,000.
Contenders.
Oil and national politics as well as high-tech have made Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa, all cities with populations of one 1,000,000, significant national urban centres.
Regional cities.
Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, and Halifax are major regional centres. St John's and Saint John are smaller centres in Atlantic Canada. Whitehorse and Yellowknife are small and more isolated cities in the Canadian north, the serving as the capitals and largest cities of the Yukon and Northwest territories respectively.

HMS Nisus (1810)

HMS "Nisus" was a Royal Navy 38-gun fifth rate frigate, launched in 1810 at Plymouth, named for Virgil's character Nisus from "The Aeneid".
"Nisus" entered service in 1810 under the command of Captain Philip Beaver, and sailed for the Indian Ocean, where she participated in the squadron led by Admiral Albemarle Bertie which landed troops on Île de France and captured the island from the French in December 1810. 
By agreement, "Eclipse" and "Nisus" shared in the prize money for the capture of the "Renommée" on 20 May 1811 at the Battle of Tamatave, and one week later of the "Néréide". In August 1811, "Nisus" supported the Invasion of Java and was involved in a successful attack on the French fortified port of Cheribon, seizing the fort and defeating a French army sent to drive the British off. In September the force captured Surabaya. 
In 1814 command passed to Charles Marsh Schomberg and in 1815 she was laid up at Plymouth, prior to being broken up in 1822.

<doc id="20774101" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20774101" title="Burkeville, British Columbia">
Burkeville, British Columbia

Burkeville, British Columbia is a village located beside Russ Baker Way on Sea Island in Richmond, British Columbia. It was constructed in 1943 by the federal government of Canada. The street names have an aeronautical theme, many of which bear the names of airplane manufacturers. It also served to provide housing for workers employed at a plant operated by Boeing and was named after its then-president, Stanley Burke. After the war, many of the homes were sold to returning veterans. The village has since been annexed by the city of Richmond and is the only residential area on Sea Island, which otherwise is dominated by Vancouver International Airport.
The village was the hometown of aviation pioneer Dan McIvor.

Otofacial syndrome

Otofacial syndrome is an extremely rare congenital deformity whereby the afflicted is born without a jaw and subsequently a chin.
In nearly all cases, the child does not survive because of the inability to breathe and eat properly. Even with reconstructive surgery, the tongue is extremely underdeveloped, making unaided breathing and swallowing impossible.
Treatment.
The first challenge to survival is assisted breathing and tubal feeding. This is a lifelong affair, generally requiring the patient to spend nearly all of the time under direct hospital care.
American surgeons successfully used bone from the hip of an Irish teenager named Alan Doherty to rebuild a jaw and chin. Surgeons began the procedures in June 2007 and completed the final of seven surgeries on 25 August 2008. Doherty is now able to smile, but is still unable to breathe, eat, or speak on his own.

PRC2

PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) is one of the two classes of polycomb-group proteins or (PcG). The other component of this group of proteins is PRC1.
This complex has histone methyltransferase activity and primarily trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27 (i.e. H3K27me3), a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin. PRC2 is required for initial targeting of genomic region (PRC Response Elements or PRE) to be silenced, while PRC1 is required for stabilizing this silencing and underlies cellular memory of silenced region after cellular differentiation. These proteins are required for long term epigenetic silencing of chromatin and have an important role in stem cell differentiation and early embryonic development. PRC2 are present in all multicellular organisms. 
The mouse PRC2 has four subunits: Suz12 (zinc finger), Eed, Ezh1 or Ezh2 (SET domain with histone methyltransferase activity) and RbAp48 (histone binding domain)
PRC2 has a role in X chromosome inactivation, in maintenance of stem cell fate, and in imprinting. Aberrant expression of PRC2 has been observed in cancer.

Snowmageddon

Snowmageddon, Snowpocalypse and Snowzilla are portmanteaus of the word "snow" with either "Armageddon", "Apocalypse" and "Godzilla" respectively. Snowmageddon and Snowpocalypse seem to have first been published in the popular press in Canada during January 2009, and was also used in January 2010 by "The Guardian" reporter Charlie Brooker on January 16, 2010 in order to describe heavy snowfall across the United Kingdom during the preceding days. "The Washington Post", out of Washington, DC, ran an online poll asking for reader feedback prior to the First North American blizzard of 2010 on February 4, 2010, and several blogs, including the "Washington Post"s own blog, followed that up by using either "Snowmageddon" and or "Snowpocalypse" during the following days, before, during, and after the storm hit.
"The Washington Post" also popularized the terms "snOMG" and "kaisersnoze" (see Keyser Söze) in response to the February snowstorms.
During the evening preceding the first blizzard hitting Washington, DC, most of the United States federal government closed, and press coverage continued to characterize the storm using either "Snowmageddon", "Snowpocalypse", or both. The phrase was later popularized by the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on February 8, 2010, who used the term while speaking at the Democratic National Committee's meeting.
The term "Snowpocalypse" was used in the Pacific Northwest to refer to a snowstorm in December 2008. 
The 2008 children's book "Winter Blast" by Chris Wright, uses the term "snowmageddon" in the storyline of the book.

Umbilicaria mammulata

Umbilicaria mammulata, or Smooth Rock Tripe, is a foliose lichen found on boulders and rock walls.
Appearance.
"U. mammulata" is among the largest lichens in the world. The thallus of "U. mammulata" is usually 4 to 15 centimeters in diameter, but specimens have been known to reach in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. The smooth upper surface is a reddish-brown to grayish-brown color and the lower surface is pitch black. 
Ecology.
This species is found on boulders and steep rock walls in forests and around lakes. It grows on several types of rock substrate, such as acid rock, sandstone, quartz, and granitic rock. Like most lichens, "U. mammulata" is sensitive to air and water quality. If conditions are optimal, seeing rocks or cliffs covered in dinner plate sized thalli is not unusual. However, it has been suggested that "U. mammulata" is not as sensitive to pH and water quality as it is to the frequency and duration of precipitation.

Ogba people

Ogba Also called Ogba people is a Tribe in Rivers State, Nigeria originating from the Ancient Benin Empire. They are located within the south-south area in Nigeria. They speak the Ogba language.
Aligu-Alinso okanu is an Ogba clan. The Egi group comprises seventeen communities with a rich history of Nature resources. A study conducted in Ogbogu located in one of the largest oil producing regions of Nigeria has utilized two plant species to clean up spills. The first stage of cleanup involves Hibiscus cannabinus.
The area has produced prominent sons and daughters, including Chief Josiah Anukwu (HRH Eze Egi Etiti One of Ogba Land, Chief G U Ake (South - South and Rivers State PDP Chairman), Wilson Asinobi Ake (Senator for Rivers West), ,Chief Eze C C Nwuche King of Ahoada East, Chief Oris Onyiri (FMR PDP State secretary), Engr B.E Ojum (Fmr EDP NDDC), Chief Shadrack Akolokwu (NDDC Board member), HRM Dr Kingdom Elemchukwu Elenwa, (Eze Egi of Ogba Land) chief Isaac Agilebu (igwurugu ome) and many others
Ali-Ogba, (Ogba Kingdom) is an Ethnic group which main spoken language is called (Ogba Dialect) comprises the Egi and Igburu Section. they both speak one dialect with little difference with each other, having a combine population of about 280,000 people. It is located in the central Orashi-Sombreiro plains of Rivers State, Nigeria, is one of the major producers of the CRUDE OIL that fuels Nigeria’s economic development in recent decades. According to current oil company records, no local government in Nigeria produces as much crude oil and gas as the Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni (ONELGA) local government (Ellah 1995)
As a result of the oil industry, Ali-Ogba (Ogba Kingdom)has undergone significant political, social, economic and environmental changes during the past several decades. However, despite its image as one of the main contributors to the wealth of Nigeria, there is a lot of poverty in many communities resulting from unemployment, under-employment, low wage jobs and deterioration of the natural resource base.
At the same time that Ali-Ogba makes very significant contributions to the country’s economy, this oil producing area has remained economically marginalized and left in the backwaters of the country’s socio-economic and political development. This poses dilemmas for Ali-Ogba people. For example, while the oil industry in Ali-Ogba creates jobs and wealth, these benefits are not equally accessible to many Ogba people and many other Rivers state communities, compared to other Nigerians. This state of affairs in the oil producing communities of Rivers state prompted the Governor, Dr. Odili to speak out this past February urging oil firms to stop giving employment to non-natives at the expense of the indigenes of the areas of their operation. In the Governor’s own words:(Ellah 1995)
Historic and Geographic Context
Ali-Ogba people have some socio-cultural and political legacies that reinforce their common origin and bind them together as a people with common heritage and destiny. These include: geographic location, migration routes, language and political structure.
Geographically, Ali-Ogba stretches from about 4 50 N to 5 30’N and extends from about 6 25 E to about 6 40’ E. Spatially, it covers an area of 920 km2 in the northern part of the Niger Delta region located within the River Niger flood plains.. It is bordered on the west by the Orashi river and on the east by the Sombreiro river. In addition to the main drainage systems, there are the Omoku river and many back swamps, cut offs and interconnecting streams which form a maze of drainage channels superimposed on the area. At the peak of the rainy season, these interconnected waterways are a prominent feature of the landscape.Its location in the Sombreiro-Warri deltaic plains, which consists of coastal plains sands and other tertiary deposits – marine, mixed, and continental deposits typical of deltaic environments situates it in the rain forest zone of southern Nigeria. The area can be divided into four ecological zones:
The highest part of Ali-Ogba is the well drained lowland and farm mosaic with altitude ranging from 15m to22 m. In general, the land is characterized by a gentle sloping topography of less than 10 degrees in many areas. This relatively low altitude gives the area its characteristics flat and monotonous low relief interspersed by many wetland (swamp /creek basins), which crisscross the central low lands and empty into the two main river systems (Sombreiro and Orashi)(Ellah 1995)
As a result of its geographic location, Ali-Ogba enjoys all year round high temperatures averaging 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the day with over night lows ranging from 65 to 70 degrees. Also, the area has at least ten months of rainfall totaling over 80 inches per year with very high humidity in the summer months. The climatic conditions and topography support a wide variety of plant and animal life. The flora consists of economic trees especially oil palm trees and a variety of plants species of great pharmacological value as human elixir.(Ellah 1995)
Legends of origin.
Ali-Ogba communities constitute one of the minority ethnic groups of Nigeria and share common ancestry, socio-cultural elements and heritage. Oral history and folklore have it that Ali-Ogba people migrated to what is now called Ali-Ogba from the area of the then Benin Empire across the Niger about the 16th century.(Ellah 1995)
The Economy of Ali-Ogba==
The physical landscape of Ali-Ogba presents a variety of natural resources: relatively well-drained land and rich soils in many areas, fresh water rivers, creeks and wetlands, secondary forests and abundant sunshine and rainfall all year round. Underneath the earth surface are pools of natural gas and oil.(Ellah 1995)
As a result of these endowments, the natural environment supports an agricultural economy based on fishing and farming for production of a wide variety of crops such as cassava, yam, maize, coco-yam, plantain and banana, including many vegetables such as okra, pepper and different types of melon. In addition, fruit trees such as paw-paw (papaya) oranges, guava, mango and pineapples are widely grown in gardens around buildings in the communities. Thus, in many respects, Ali-Ogba mirrors other upland communities of Rivers state in the production of a variety of agricultural products illustrated below.

Kuhl received a B.A. in speech science from St. Cloud State University in 1967, an M.A. in speech science from the University of Minnesota in 1971, and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in speech science and psychology in 1973. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Central Institute for the Deaf at Washington University in St. Louis in 1976. Since 1977, she has been employed as a professor of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the University of Washington, with adjunct appointments in the departments of Linguistics, Psychology, Otolaryngology, Neuroscience, and Education. She serves as a co-director of the UW Institute for Brain and Learning Sciences, an interdisciplinary scientific research center on human learning, with her husband, Andrew Meltzoff.
Research.
Kuhl is internationally recognized for her research on early language and brain development, and studies that show how young children learn. Kuhl’s work has played a major role in demonstrating how early exposure to language alters the brain. It has implications for critical periods in development, for bilingual education and reading readiness, for developmental disabilities involving language, and for research on computer understanding of speech.
Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory.
Kuhl has proposed the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory to account for the developmental change by which infants' ability to discriminate speech sounds becomes increasingly specific to their native language as they age. The model shows that infants use their computational abilities to "crack" the speech code and that infants' social skills play an important role in learning.
Recognition.
Kuhl was one of six scientists invited to the White House in 1997 to make a presentation at President and Mrs. Clinton's Conference on Early Learning and the Brain. In 2001, she was invited to make a presentation at President and Mrs. Bush’s White House Summit on Early Cognitive Development: Ready to Read, Ready to Learn.
Kuhl's work has been widely covered by the media. She has appeared in the Discovery television series "The Baby Human"; the NOVA series "The Mind"; the "The Power of Ideas" on PBS; and "The Secret Life of the Brain," also on PBS. She has discussed her research findings on early learning and the brain on The Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, NHK, CNN, and in The New York Times, Time, TED_(conference), and Newsweek.
Kuhl is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Rodin Academy, and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. She has also been elected a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the Association for Psychological Science.
Kuhl was awarded the Silver Medal of the Acoustical Society of America in 1997, the Kenneth Craik Research Award from Cambridge University in 2005, and the Gold Medal from the acoustics branch of the American Institute of Physics in 2008. She received the University of Washington's Faculty Lectureship Award in 1998, and she was awarded the University of Minnesota’s Outstanding Achievement Award in 2007.

In 2011, the team suffered a detrimental loss to the team,4 student-athletes had died in a 2 car accident on January 16, 2011. Nick Bryson, Cody Hollinger, John Griffith, and Devaughn Lee had attempted to get air in a fellow Teammates car and when they landed they had spun sideways into the other lane and got hit broadside that had sent the car flipping into a nearby field. That year for the team then became about adversity and the ability to overcome it. With 4 crucial players gone the team was young and inexperienced, the first game of the 2011 season was filled with emotion and was dedicated to the 4 boys tragically lost in the accident. The game had 4 touchdowns for a total of 28 points. The town speculated each touchdown represented one of the boys and the total had represented another teammate who had also died in another car accident, due to a brain aneurysm in 2010. The Barons had finished that season 8-3 defying all odds that were against them.
Girls Softball.
In the 2011 season, the Manheim Central Girls Softball team were the LL League Section 3 Champions, the District 3 Champions, and were the runner ups in the PIAA Triple A States.

<doc id="20774380" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20774380" title="Import ratio">
Import ratio

Import ratio, in economics and government finance, is the ratio of total imports of a country to that country’s total foreign exchange (FX) reserves. The ratio can be inverted and is referred to as the reserves to imports ratio. This ratio divides a country's average foreign exchange reserve by a country's average monthly level of imports.
Relation to sovereign risk.
Credit restructuring is made more likely by a higher amount of imports relative to FX reserves. A less developed country will pay for imports with its foreign exchange reserves. The more it imports the faster these reserves are used up. Since satisfying a country's needs is considered more important than repaying foreign creditors the more a country imports relative to its foreign exchange reserves the greater the probability of debt rescheduling.

Springfield Model 1835

The US Model 1835 Musket was a .69 caliber flintlock musket used in the United States during the early 19th Century.
The Model 1835 was produced by the Springfield Armory, and was also produced by the Harper's Ferry Armory and other contractors. It was a smooth bore musket and fired a .69 caliber round ball. The Model 1835 is sometimes considered to be its own model number, but is often considered to be just a continuation of the Model 1816 Musket.The barrel was slightly longer than the Model 1816 and the total weight of the Model 1835 was slightly higher, but otherwise the Model 1835 was very similar to the Model 1816. Even though the final product was very similar, significantly different manufacturing techniques were used in the creation of the Model 1835, and a great deal of emphasis was placed on parts interchangeability. This paved the way for the Springfield Model 1842 which was the first musket to be constructed of all interchangeable parts.
Most 1835 muskets had the flintlock replaced with a percussion lock during the 1840s and 1850s. Some of the 1835 muskets also had their barrels rifled during this same period, if the barrel was deemed to be thick enough to be structurally sound after rifling.
The model 1835 was used by both the North and South during the American Civil War. The model 1835 was also used in the Mexican-American War.

Surya is glorified in Vedic mantras as the expeller of darkness and evil. The most sacred Gayatri mantra, composed by Sage Vishvamitra, worships the Sun as Savita. 
In the Ramayana, Lord Rama is initiated into the worship of Surya by Sage Agastya who teaches him the Aditya Hridayam. This helps Lord Rama to gain strength and vanquish evil.
On Mitrotsavam day, devotees conduct Pujas and worship the Sun for prosperity, health and courage. They extoll Mitra as the originator and sustainer of all life, as a Pratyaksha Devata. They perform Surya Namaskara, recite 108 names of Surya, and pray for help to ward off evil, infirmity and disease. Mitra worship is considered especially beneficial for ailments of the eye and mind.
In 2008, Mitrotsavam fell on Thursday, December 25.

The Eastern and Western Divisions of the National Football League, renamed the American and National Conferences in 1950 and then the Eastern and Western Conferences in 1953, were organized as a result of the disputed NFL championship of 1932. NFL owners agreed that thenceforth there would be an annual championship game, to be played between the teams with the best records from two divisions, Eastern and Western. The two-division/conference structure remained essentially stable for over 35 years, including the absorption of former All-America Football Conference teams in 1950, and the early expansion teams added in the 1960s in response to the American Football League. With the 1970 AFL–NFL merger the new, larger league was reorganized.
