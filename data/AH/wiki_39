Maize

Maize ( ; "Zea mays" subsp. "mays", from after Taíno "mahiz"), known in some English-speaking countries as corn, is a large grain plant domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica in prehistoric times. The leafy stalk produces ears which contain the grain, which are seeds called kernels. Maize kernels are often used in cooking as a starch. 
History.
Most historians believe corn was domesticated in the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico. 
The Olmec and Mayans cultivated it in numerous varieties throughout Mesoamerica, cooked, ground or processed through nixtamalization. Beginning about 2500 BC, the crop spread through much of the Americas. The region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops. After European contact with the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, explorers and traders carried maize back to Europe and introduced it to other countries. Maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed and as chemical feedstocks.
Maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas, with 332 million metric tons grown annually in the United States alone. Approximately 40% of the crop — 130 million tons — is used for corn ethanol. Genetically modified maize made up 85% of the maize planted in the United States in 2009.
Words for maize.
The word "maize" derives from the Spanish form of the indigenous Taíno word for the plant, "maiz". It is known by other names around the world. 
"Corn" outside North America, Australia, and New Zealand means any cereal crop, its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local staple. In the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, "corn" primarily means maize; this usage started as a shortening of "Indian corn". "Indian corn" primarily means maize (the staple grain of indigenous Americans), but can refer more specifically to multicolored "flint corn" used for decoration.
In places outside North America, Australia, and New Zealand, "corn" often refers to maize in culinary contexts. The narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word, as in "sweet corn", "corn on the cob", "popcorn", "corn flakes", "baby corn".
In Southern Africa, maize is commonly called "mielie" (Afrikaans) or "mealie" (English).
"Maize" is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike "corn", which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. "Maize" is used by agricultural bodies and research institutes such as the FAO and CSIRO. National agricultural and industry associations often include the word "maize" in their name even in English-speaking countries where the local, informal word is something other than "maize"; for example, the Maize Association of Australia, the Indian Maize Development Association, the Kenya Maize Consortium and Maize Breeders Network, the National Maize Association of Nigeria, the Zimbabwe Seed Maize Association. However, in commodities trading, "corn" consistently refers to maize and not other grains.
Structure and physiology.
The maize plant is often 2.5 m (meters) (8 ft) in height, though some natural strains can grow 12 m (40 ft). The stem has the appearance of a bamboo cane and is commonly composed of 20 internodes of 18 cm (7 in) length. A leaf grows from each node, which is generally 9 cm (3.5 in) in width and 120 cm (4 ft) in length. 
Ears develop above a few of the leaves in the midsection of the plant, between the stem and leaf sheath, elongating by ~ 3 mm/day, to a length of 18 cm (7 in) (60 cm/24 in being the maximum observed in the subspecies ). They are female inflorescences, tightly enveloped by several layers of ear leaves commonly called husks. Certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears. These are the source of the "baby corn" used as a vegetable in Asian cuisine. 
The apex of the stem ends in the tassel, an inflorescence of male flowers. When the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel dehisce and release pollen. Maize pollen is anemophilous (dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel.
Elongated stigmas, called silks, emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear. They are often pale yellow and in length, like tufts of hair in appearance. At the end of each is a carpel, which may develop into a "kernel" if fertilized by a pollen grain. The pericarp of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as "caryopsis", typical of the grasses, and the entire kernel is often referred to as the "seed". The cob is close to a multiple fruit in structure, except that the individual fruits (the kernels) never fuse into a single mass. The grains are about the size of peas, and adhere in regular rows around a white, pithy substance, which forms the ear (maximum size of kernel in subspecies is reputedly 2.5 cm/1 in ). An ear commonly holds 600 kernels. They are of various colors: blackish, bluish-gray, purple, green, red, white and yellow. When ground into flour, maize yields more flour with much less bran than wheat does. It lacks the protein gluten of wheat and, therefore, makes baked goods with poor rising capability. A genetic variant that accumulates more sugar and less starch in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called sweet corn. Young ears can be consumed raw, with the cob and silk, but as the plant matures (usually during the summer months), the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility. By the end of the growing season, the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water. 
Planting density affects multiple aspects of maize. Modern farming techniques in developed countries usually rely on dense planting, which produces one ear per stalk. Stands of silage maize are yet denser, and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter. 
Maize is a facultative long-night plant and flowers in a certain number of growing degree days > in the environment to which it is adapted. The magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize flowers is genetically prescribed and regulated by the phytochrome system. Photoperiodicity can be eccentric in tropical cultivars such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost. These attributes, however, may prove useful in using tropical maize for biofuels.
Immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA). DIMBOA is a member of a group of hydroxamic acids (also known as benzoxazinoids) that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests, including insects, pathogenic fungi and bacteria. DIMBOA is also found in related grasses, particularly wheat. A maize mutant (bx) lacking DIMBOA is highly susceptible to attack by aphids and fungi. DIMBOA is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the European corn borer (family Crambidae). As maize matures, DIMBOA levels and resistance to the corn borer decline.
Because of its shallow roots, maize is susceptible to droughts, intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils, and prone to be uprooted by severe winds.
While yellow maizes derive their color from lutein and zeaxanthin, in red-coloured maizes, the kernel colouration is due to anthocyanins and phlobaphenes. These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene which encodes an R2R3 myb-like transcriptional activator of the A1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols) while another gene (Suppressor of Pericarp Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a suppressor. The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments. The maize P gene encodes a Myb homolog that recognizes the sequence CCT/AACC, in sharp contrast with the C/TAACGG bound by vertebrate Myb proteins.
Genetics.
Many forms of maize are used for food, sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has:
This system has been replaced (though not entirely displaced) over the last 60 years by multivariable classifications based on ever more data. Agronomic data were supplemented by botanical traits for a robust initial classification, then genetic, cytological, protein and DNA evidence was added. Now, the categories are forms (little used), races, racial complexes, and recently branches.
Maize is a diploid with 20 chromosomes (n=10). The combined length of the chromosomes is 1500 cM. Some of the maize chromosomes have what are known as "chromosomal knobs": highly repetitive heterochromatic domains that stain darkly. Individual knobs are polymorphic among strains of both maize and teosinte.
Barbara McClintock used these knob markers to validate her transposon theory of "jumping genes", for which she won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Maize is still an important model organism for genetics and developmental biology today.
The Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center, funded by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and located in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is a stock center of maize mutants. The total collection has nearly 80,000 samples. The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes, plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants. There are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations (e.g., translocations and inversions) and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers (e.g., tetraploids). Genetic data describing the maize mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about maize genetics can be accessed at MaizeGDB, the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database.
In 2005, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) formed a consortium to sequence the B73 maize genome. The resulting DNA sequence data was deposited immediately into GenBank, a public repository for genome-sequence data. Sequences and genome annotations have also been made available throughout the project's lifetime at the project's official site.
Primary sequencing of the maize genome was completed in 2008. On November 20, 2009, the consortium published results of its sequencing effort in "Science". The genome, 85% of which is composed of transposons, was found to contain 32,540 genes (By comparison, the human genome contains about 2.9 billion bases and 26,000 genes). Much of the maize genome has been duplicated and reshuffled by helitrons - group of rolling circle transposons.
Breeding.
Maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on mass selection. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection, (C. G. Hopkins ca. 1896), hybrids made from selected inbred lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 inbred lines (D. F. Jones ca. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids. (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958) by the 1930s, companies such as Pioneer devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development. Internationally important seed banks such as CIMMYT and the U.S. bank at Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintain germplasm important for future crop development.
Genetic modification.
Genetically modified (GM) maize is one of the 25 GM crops grown commercially in 2011. Grown since 1997 in the United States and Canada, 86% of the US maize crop was genetically modified in 2010 and 32% of the worldwide maize crop was GM in 2011. As of 2011, Herbicide-tolerant maize varieties are grown in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, El Salvador, the EU, Honduras, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and USA, and insect-resistant corn is grown in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, the EU, Honduras, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Romania, Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, USA, and Uruguay.
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to contamination with Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.
Origin.
Maize is the domesticated variant of teosinte. The two plants have dissimilar appearance, maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short, bushy plant. The difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes.
Several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in Mesoamerica:
In the late 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of "Tripsacum", a related genus. This theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern genetic testing, which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.
The teosinte origin theory was proposed by the Russian botanist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov in 1931 and the later American Nobel Prize-winner George Beadle in 1932. It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. Teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them:
The domestication of maize is of particular interest to researchers — archaeologists, geneticists, ethnobotanists, geographers, etc. The process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. Research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of Oaxaca and Jalisco, because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there. Genetic studies led by John Doebley identified "Zea mays" ssp. "parviglumis", native to the Balsas River valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas teosinte, as being the crop wild relative teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize. However, archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the lowlands of the Balsas River valley, where stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in a 8,700-years old layer of deposits. A primitive corn was being grown in southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America 7,000 years ago. Archaeological remains of early maize ears, found at Guila Naquitz Cave in the Oaxaca Valley, date back roughly 6,250 years; the oldest ears from caves near Tehuacan, Puebla, date ca. 3,450 BC. Little change occurred in ear form until ca. 1100 BC when great changes appeared in ears from Mexican caves: maize diversity rapidly increased and archaeological teosinte was first deposited.
Perhaps as early as 2500 BC, maize began to spread widely and rapidly. It was first cultivated in what is now the United States, at several sites in New Mexico and Arizona, about 2100 BC. As it was introduced to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations. Maize was the staple food, or a major staple (along with squash, Andean region potato, quinoa, beans, and amaranth), of most pre-Columbian North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican civilization was strengthened upon the field crop of maize, through harvesting it, its religious and spiritual importance and how it impacted their diet. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity. During the first millennium AD, maize cultivation spread from Mexico into the U.S. Southwest and during the following millennium into the U.S. Northeast and southeastern Canada, transforming the landscape as Native Americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop. 
It is unknown what precipitated its domestication, because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell. However, George Beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily "popped" for human consumption, like modern popcorn. Some have argued it would have taken too many generations of selective breeding to produce large, compressed ears for efficient cultivation. However, studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded.
In 2005, research by the USDA Forest Service suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern United States corresponded with a decline of freshwater mussels, which are very sensitive to environmental changes.
Production.
Methods.
Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring. Its root system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a C4 plant (a plant that uses C4 carbon fixation), maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than C3 plants (plants that use C3 carbon fixation) like the small grains, alfalfa and soybeans. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize were "knee-high by the Fourth of July", although modern hybrids generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for silage is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the "milk stage", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of Africa, where periodic drought regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent famine. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop.
Maize was planted by the Native Americans in hills, in a complex system known to some as the Three Sisters. Maize provided support for beans, and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other legumes; and squashes provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil. This method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill apart was planted with three or four seeds, a method still used by home gardeners. A later technique was "checked maize", where hills were placed apart in each direction, allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions. In more arid lands, this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of deep furrows to collect water. Modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young, although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some Native American reservations.
In North America, fields are often planted in a two-crop rotation with a nitrogen-fixing crop, often alfalfa in cooler climates and soybeans in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, winter wheat, is added to the rotation.
Many of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate or to provide protection against natural pests.
Glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.
In midwestern United States, low-till or no-till farming techniques are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest. The fields are planted and fertilized. Weeds are controlled through the use of herbicides, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.
The technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming. Weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients, making them undesirable.
Before World War II, most maize in North America was harvested by hand. This involves a large numbers of workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use, but the maize combine was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.
For storing grain in bins, the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling. If the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high, grain dryers are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain. This can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases (propane or natural gas) and electricity to power the blowers.
Quantity.
Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain. The United States produces 40% of the world's harvest; other top producing countries include China, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, India, France and Argentina. Worldwide production was 817 million tonnes in 2009—more than rice (678 million tonnes) or wheat (682 million tonnes). In 2009, over 159 million hectares (390 million acres) of maize were planted worldwide, with a yield of over 5 tonnes/hectare (80 bu/acre). Production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world; 2009 forecasts for production in Iowa were 11614 kg/ha (185 bu/acre).
There is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades. This suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle, lodging resistance, tolerance of high plant density, disease/pest tolerance, and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant.
United States.
In 2010, the maize planted area for all purposes in the US was estimated at 35 million hectares (87.9 million acres), following an increasing trend since 2008. About 14% of the harvested corn area is irrigated.
In 2011, corn production went down around 1% to about 13 billion bushels.
The average yield in the U.S. was estimated to be 148.1 bushels per acre, making 2011 the lowest average yield since 2005. Corn production in the U.S. is expected to dramatically decline in 2012 due to widespread extreme to exceptional drought. 2012's average yield is estimated to be only 120 bushels per acre.
Pests.
Insects.
The susceptibility of maize to the European corn borer and corn rootworms, and the resulting large crop losses which are estimated at a billion dollars worldwide for each pest, led to the development of transgenics expressing the "Bacillus thuringiensis" toxin. "Bt maize" is widely grown in the United States and has been approved for release in Europe.
Uses.
Human food.
Maize and cornmeal (ground dried maize) constitute a staple food in many regions of the world. 
Maize is central to Mexican food. Virtually every dish in Mexican cuisine uses maize. On form of grain or cornmeal, maize is the main ingredient of tortillas, tamales, pozole, atole and all the dishes based on them, like tacos, quesadillas, chilaquiles, enchiladas, tostadas and many more. In Mexico even a fungus of maize, known as huitlacoche is considered a delicacy.
Introduced into Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century, maize has become Africa's most important staple food crop. Maize meal is made into a thick porridge in many cultures: from the polenta of Italy, the "angu" of Brazil, the "mămăligă" of Romania, to cornmeal mush in the U.S. (and hominy grits in the South) or the food called mealie pap in South Africa and "sadza", "nshima" and "ugali" in other parts of Africa. Maize meal is also used as a replacement for wheat flour, to make cornbread and other baked products. Masa (cornmeal treated with limewater) is the main ingredient for tortillas, atole and many other dishes of Central American food.
Popcorn consists of kernels of certain varieties that explode when heated, forming fluffy pieces that are eaten as a snack. Roasted dried maize ears with semihardened kernels, coated with a seasoning mixture of fried chopped spring onions with salt added to the oil, is a popular snack food in Vietnam. "Cancha", which are roasted maize chulpe kernels, are a very popular snack food in Peru, and also appears in traditional Peruvian "ceviche". An unleavened bread called "makki di roti" is a popular bread eaten in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan.
"Chicha" and "chicha morada" (purple chicha) are drinks typically made from particular types of maize. The first one is fermented and alcoholic, the second is a soft drink commonly drunk in Peru.
Corn flakes are a common breakfast cereal in North America and the United Kingdom, and found in many other countries all over the world.
Maize can also be prepared as hominy, in which the kernels are soaked with lye in a process called nixtamalization; or grits, which are coarsely ground hominy. These are commonly eaten in the Southeastern United States, foods handed down from Native Americans, who called the dish sagamite.
The Brazilian dessert "canjica" is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk.
Maize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. Sweet corn, a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such corn on the cob is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Cyprus, some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. Corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot "Hot Corn Girls", who were thus the precursors of hot dog carts, churro wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today. The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a vegetable in side dishes, salads, garnishes, etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize purée, tamales, "pamonhas", "curau", cakes, ice creams, etc.
Maize is a major source of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer.
Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed for livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.
Maize is also used as a fish bait, called "dough balls". It is particularly popular in Europe for coarse fishing.
Alternative medicine.
Stigmas from female maize flowers, popularly called corn silk, are sold as herbal supplements.
Chemicals.
Starch from maize can also be made into plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and many other chemical products.
The corn steep liquor, a plentiful watery byproduct of maize wet milling process, is widely used in the biochemical industry and research as a culture medium to grow many kinds of microorganisms.
Chrysanthemin is found in purple corn and is used as a food coloring.
Bio-fuel.
"Feed maize" is being used increasingly for heating; specialized corn stoves (similar to wood stoves) are available and use either feed maize or wood pellets to generate heat. Maize cobs are also used as a biomass fuel source. Maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel. They feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels (or wood pellets or cherry pits) into the fire.
Maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of ethanol fuel. Ethanol is mixed with gasoline to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles. High fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn lead to higher prices paid to farmers for maize. This led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil. 
The price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.
Maize is widely used in Germany as a feedstock for biogas plants. Here the maize is harvested, shredded then placed in silage clamps from which it is fed into the biogas plants. This process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as in the production of fuel ethanol.
A biomass gasification power plant in Strem near Güssing, Burgenland, Austria, began in 2005. Research is being done to make diesel out of the biogas by the Fischer Tropsch method.
Increasingly, ethanol is being used at low concentrations (10% or less) as an additive in gasoline (gasohol) for motor fuels to increase the octane rating, lower pollutants, and reduce petroleum use (what is nowadays also known as "biofuels" and has been generating an intense debate regarding the human beings' necessity of new sources of energy, on the one hand, and the need to maintain, in regions such as Latin America, the food habits and culture which has been the essence of civilizations such as the one originated in Mesoamerica; the entry, January 2008, of maize among the commercial agreements of NAFTA has increased this debate, considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields, and mainly the fact that NAFTA "opened the doors to the import of maize from the United States, where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports. (...) According to OXFAM UK, after NAFTA went into effect, the price of maize in Mexico fell 70% between 1994 and 2001. The number of farm jobs dropped as well: from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002. Many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers."). However, introduction in the northern latitudes of the U.S. of tropical maize for biofuels, and not for human or animal consumption, may potentially alleviate this.
As a result of the U.S. federal government announcing its production target of of biofuels by 2017, ethanol production will grow to by 2010, up from 4.5 billion in 2006, boosting ethanol's share of maize demand in the U.S. from 22.6 percent to 36.1 percent.
Ornamental and other uses.
Some forms of the plant are occasionally grown for ornamental use in the garden. For this purpose, variegated and colored leaf forms as well as those with colorful ears are used.
Corncobs can be hollowed out and treated to make inexpensive smoking pipes, first manufactured in the United States in 1869.
An unusual use for maize is to create a "corn maze" (or "maize maze") as a tourist attraction. The idea of a maize maze was introduced by the American Maze Company who created a maze in Pennsylvania in 1993. Traditional mazes are most commonly grown using yew hedges, but these take several years to mature. The rapid growth of a field of maize allows a maze to be laid out using GPS at the start of a growing season and for the maize to grow tall enough to obstruct a visitor's line of sight by the start of the summer. In Canada and the U.S., these are popular in many farming communities.
Maize kernels can be used in place of sand in a sandboxlike enclosure for children's play.
Additionally, feed corn is sometimes used by hunters to bait animals such as deer or wild hogs.
Fodder.
Maize makes a greater quantity of epigeous mass than other cereal plants, so can be used for fodder. Digestibility and palatability are higher when ensiled and fermented, rather than dried.
Commodity.
Maize is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity using corn futures contracts. These "futures" are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) under ticker symbol C. They are delivered every year in March, May, July, September, and December.
U.S. usage breakdown.
The breakdown of usage of the 12.1 billion bushel 2008 U.S. maize crop was as follows, according to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report by the USDA.
Comparison to other staple foods.
The following table shows the nutrient content of maize and major staple foods in a raw harvested form. Raw forms are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these staples are different from that of raw form of these staples reported in the table below.
Hazards.
Pellagra.
When maize was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-American peoples, it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity. However, a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a staple food. This was a mystery, since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous Americans, for whom maize was the principal staple food.
It was eventually discovered that the indigenous Americans had learned to soak maize in alkali-water—made with ashes and lime (calcium oxide) since at least 1200-1500 BC by Mesoamericans and North Americans—which liberates the B-vitamin niacin, the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as pellagra. This alkali process is known by its Nahuatl (Aztec)-derived name: nixtamalization. Besides the lack of niacin, pellagra was also characterized by protein deficiency, a result of the inherent lack of two key amino acids in pre-modern maize, lysine and tryptophan. Nixtamalisation was also found to increase the availability of lysine and tryptophan to some extent, but more importantly, the indigenous Americans had also learned to balance their consumption of maize with beans and other protein sources such as amaranth and chia, as well as meat and fish, to acquire the complete range of amino acids for normal protein synthesis.
Maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous Americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the Americas. In the late 19th century, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern U.S., as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin: the deficiency theory (which was eventually shown to be true) said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient, and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies. A third theory, promoted by the eugenicist Charles Davenport, held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain “constitutional, inheritable” traits of the affected individual. In 1914, the U.S. government officially endorsed the germ theory of pellagra, but rescinded this endorsement several years later when the evidence grew against it. By the mid-1920s, the deficiency theory of pellagra was becoming scientific consensus, and the theory was validated in 1932 when niacin deficiency was determined to be the cause of the illness.
Once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied, pellagra disappeared in the developed world. The development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise. Pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize.
Allergy.
Maize contains lipid transfer protein, an indigestible protein that survives cooking. This protein has been linked to a rare and understudied allergy to maize in humans. The allergic reaction can cause skin rash, swelling or itching of mucous membranes, diarrhea, vomiting, asthma and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. It is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population.
Art.
Maize has been an essential crop in the Andes since the pre-Columbian Era. The Moche culture from Northern Peru made ceramics from earth, water, and fire. This pottery was a sacred substance, formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes. Maize represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally.
In the United States, maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the U.S. Capitol building. Maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season, local agricultural productivity and culture. Bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins, gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses. A well-known example of architectural use is the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually.
A maize stalk with two ripe ears is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 1 lipa coin, minted since 1993.

The monument bears several engraved statements whose origins are not attributed. At issue was one particular inscription--"It was better before they came"--that Save Our State claimed was directed against Anglo whites. In fact, according to Baca, that sentence was uttered by an Anglo white Baldwin Park resident in the 1950s; he was lamenting the influx of persons of Mexican ancestry into the San Gabriel Valley following World War II. Save Our State continued the protests, which drew counter-protesters and required city expenditure on crowd control and riot police.

Kia Pregio

The Kia Pregio is a rear-wheel drive minivan based on the Kia Bongo and manufactured by Kia Motors from November 1995 until the beginning of 2006. It replaced the previous Bongo-based van, sold as the "Besta" in most markets. At one point, it slotted between the Kia Carens and the larger, front-wheel drive Kia Carnival/Sedona. The long-wheelbase version was known as the Kia Pregio Grand. 
Overview.
The original Besta had been receiving a lot of complaints due to engine problems, so when a new van was developed utilizing the more modern technology of the updated Bongo J2, it was decided to give it a new name. Thus, the Pregio appeared in 1995, with the diesel engine of the Bongo J2. The original Pregio received updates in 1998, 2000, and 2002. From 1997 a 3.0 OHV diesel engine with was also available and in 2001 a four-speed automatic transmission was added. For export markets, right-hand drive Pregios were only built in panel van form. The front suspension is independent with coil springs and double wishbones, while at the rear a live axle with elliptic leaf springs is found, to save space and to handle heavy loads. Disc brakes up front and drums at the rear were standard in Europe at least.
Late in its life, a intercooled turbodiesel engine of Mitsubishi origins (called TCi) was made available in European market Pregios. This unit could pass Euro III emissions standards for commercial vehicles and the van version could reach a top speed of . While earlier Kias had been using Mazda engineering, Hyundai's 1998 takeover meant that Mitsubishi parts found their way into Kia's vehicles. By late 2003 the Pregio underwent a thorough facelift.
In some markets, such as Brazil, the original Besta had developed a very good reputation and had redefined a minivan market where its only competition was the antediluvian (in production since 1950) Volkswagen Kombi. Thus the new Pregio was marketed as the "Kia Besta GS" in Brazil from August 1997. There was no need to change the name, even though "Besta" means "beast" in most Latin tongues, readily lending itself to jokes. The Besta not only dominated the van market; it was Brazil's highest selling import vehicle of all types from 1997 until 2001.
Facelift model.
A different looking Pregio debuted in late 2003, largely a facelift of the first model which could pass stricter European safety demands. It continued until its demise in 2006, due to dropping demand. The Pregio/Pregio Grand was dropped after the 2006 model year to make room for the more passenger oriented, while similarly-sized and with a short-wheelbase front-wheel drive Kia Carnival/Sedona (originally the Carnival/Sedona was sold only in long-wheelbase).
In Indonesia, a locally manufactured coachvan version of the Bongo III replaced the Pregio, it is marketed as the Kia Travello.

Henry's Fork Caldera

The Henry's Fork Caldera in Idaho is a caldera located an area known as Island Park, west of Yellowstone National Park. The caldera was formed by one of the world's supervolcanos in an eruption of more than 280 cubic kilometers 1.3 million years BP, and is the source of the Mesa Falls Tuff. 
The Henry's Fork Caldera is nested inside of the Island Park Caldera and the calderas share a rim on the western side. The earlier Island Park Caldera is much larger and more oval and extends well into Yellowstone Park. Although much smaller than the Island Park Caldera, the Henry's Fork Caldera is still sizeable at 18 miles (29 km) long and 23 miles (37 km) wide and its curved rim is plainly visible from many locations in the Island Park area. Of the many calderas formed by the Yellowstone hotspot, including the later Yellowstone Caldera, the Henry's Fork Caldera is the only one that is currently clearly visible. It is one of a succession of supervolcanoes and calderas that formed the Snake River Plain.
The Henrys Fork of the Snake River flows through the Henry's Fork Caldera and drops out at Upper and Lower Mesa Falls. The caldera is bounded by the Ashton Hill on the south, Big Bend Ridge and Bishop Mountain on the west, by Thurmon Ridge on the North and by Black Mountain and the Madison Plateau on the east. 
The Henry's Fork caldera is in an area called Island Park that is known for beautiful forests, large springs, clear streams, waterfalls, lakes, ponds, marshes, wildlife, and fishing. Harriman State Park is situated in the caldera. The peaks of the Teton Range are visible to the southeast. Snowmobiling, fishing, and Nordic skiing, and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the area.

Oghi (beverage)

Oghi (sometimes oghee, "òġi") is an Armenian spirit distilled from fruits or berries. Oghi, a clear fruit vodka, is also referred to as "aragh", which is the generic Armenian word for vodka of all kinds. It is widely produced as moonshine from home-grown garden fruits all across Armenia, where it is served as a popular welcome drink to guests and is routinely drunk during meals. Arguably, Armenian oghi is not "vodka" at all (see Vodka war) and merely became thought of as such during the Soviet regime in Armenia.
Mulberry oghi is commercially produced and exported under the brand name "Artsakh" by the Artsakh-Alco Brandy Company in Askeran District in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Oghi in the Armenian Diaspora.
In the Armenian Diaspora, "oghi" refers to the aniseed-flavored distilled alcoholic drink called arak in the Middle East, raki in Turkey, or ouzo in Greece. In Armenia, however, aniseed-flavored spirit is virtually unknown.. In the Prohibition-Era United States, Armenians produced bootleg Oghi from raisins and flavored it with anise. In the old country (pre 1915 Eastern Turkey), the oghi was often made from grape pomace, or from mulberries, and was sometimes flavored with anise,mastic, or even cardamom or orange peel, as well as other herbs or spices. In the region of Kharpert as well as nearby Chnkoosh, oghi was usually made from mulberries.

1995 Alabama Crimson Tide football team

The 1995 Alabama Crimson Tide football team represented the University of Alabama for the 1995–96 college football season, competing in the Western Division in the Southeastern Conference. The team played their home games at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. Gene Stallings led the Crimson Tide to a 8–3 record. Due to NCAA sanctions, no bowl appearance was made.
The early season victory over Southern Miss came in dramatic fashion, as Alabama completed a 36 yard pass on 4th down for a go ahead touchdown with under 30 seconds left in the game. The three games Alabama lost were also particularly noteworthy. The game against Arkansas featured a last minute 4th and goal touchdown pass by Arkansas giving them the win, however replays later showed the ball was likely trapped. This call, along with a missed twelve men on the field penalty on Arkansas' final drive lead to the suspension of the officiating crew the following week. The 41–14 blowout loss to Tennessee marked the Vols first win over the Tide since 1985, ending Alabama's 9 game unbeaten streak. The season ending loss at Auburn also featured a questionable last minute call regarding a pass. Alabama QB Freddie Kitchens had apparently hit Curtis Brown for a late go ahead touchdown, but officials ruled Brown out of bounds. Photos would later reveal that Brown had his right foot down upon making the catch, while video replay show him bobbling the catch.

Chuzhali

The existence of British rule brought great changes at the national level. Princely States gave way to States and the Union of India. The Kerala Land Reforms Act brought about drastic changes in the janmi (landlord)-kudiyan (tenant) relations. With the dawn of the Temple Entry Proclamation, an upsurge of social interaction began. The so-called underprivileged gained self-respect and self-confidence, paving way for a quantum leap forward. Nationalisation of forests also played a vital role in shaking the foundations of the hitherto unchallenged upper echelons of society. In many cases, landlords were turned into landless and vice-versa.
Once Karakkattedam had sway over vast acres of land. Records say that it had around of land directly and another indirectly, including devaswoms. Until 1960, Karakkattedam was considered to be one of the biggest landlords. During British period, Karakkattedam was entrusted with the powers to collect taxes. Both the Kerala Land Reforms Act and Nationalisation of forests affrected its edifice.
Main Nambiar families in this place are Padappayil, Palakkal, Edayath, Manheri and Arayakkil. In 'Malabar mannuel' William Logan mentioned Chuzhali as ideal place for gorilla war, since the main land of Chuzhali is surrounded by high altitude areas namely Kulathur, Thalakkulam, Edakkulm, and Kuunam. Chuzhali Nambiar was one of the commanders of Pazhashiraja's gorilla army. It is said that Pazhashiraja had visited Chuzhali during his struggle against British army. Chuzhali nambiar was caught by British army and was hung at Thalassery.
Now Chuzhali is main vote bank of Communist Party Of India (Marxist).
Chuzhali Bhagavathi is a famous temple situated in the middle of the Chuzhali village. The annual festival of this temple takes place during March–April. This festival is treated by people of Chuzhali as their village festival. The main attractive place of village is Kulathur 3 km from Chuzhali main town Chalilvayal.

New Rice Varieties.
‘Ezhome -1’ and ‘Ezhome – 2’ are the first high yielding, and non-lodging organic red rice varieties, for the saline prone Kaipad rice fields of Kerala, with awn-less, non-shattering grains, and favourable cooking qualities better than local cultivars. The average yields of ‘Ezhome -1’ and ‘Ezhome – 2’ are 3.5 tones/ ha and 3.2 tones/ha respectively under close planting and no management conditions of Kaipad. This yield is 70% and 60% more than that of local cultivars. These varieties differ in duration, and are having distinct morphological, qualitative traits, and different mode of salinity tolerance mechanism imparting varietal diversity to the unique ecosystem of Kaipad. 
These new seed varieties have been developed by the Kerala Agricultural University with the participation of farmers of Ezhome panchayat. This is the first venture of Kerala Agricultural University in development of a variety i) adopting the combined strategy of Global Breeding (traditional), and Participatory Plant Breeding, and ii) carrying out all stages of variety development directly in the problem area of farmers.

Etymology.
Name of this place of emanated from the name of a Vedic Sage Kapila, who conducted Dakshayaga for Daksha. Daksha is a Sanskrit word said to be a Prajapati or one of the Brahma's sons. The equivalent meaning in English is Competent. One of the daughter of Prajapati (often said to be the youngest) was Sati or Dakshayani, who had always wished to marry Shiva. Daksha forbade it, but she disobeyed him and did so anyway, finding in Shiva a doting and loving husband. Daksha disliked Shiva intensely, calling him a dirty, roaming ascetic and reviling the great yogi's cohort of goblins and ghouls.
From then on, he distanced himself from his daughter, Dakshayani/Sati, and his son-in-law, Shiva. This enmity culminated in a great sacrifice he had been hosting, one to which he invited all and sundry, family and allies, gods and rishis, courtiers and subjects. Consciously excluding Sati from the list, he also set up a statue of Shiva, which he defiled and mocked, at the entrance to his hall. Sati, ebullient at the thought of such a great event, and assuming that the daughter of the king was welcome no matter what, attended the festival. Snubbed by her father and treated with disdain, Sati nonetheless maintained her composure. Indeed, even her father's refusal to invite Shiva, her husband and thus a traditionally honored member of any Hindu family, was to some extent borne.
Shiva carrying the corpse of his consort दाक्षायनि (सती) Dakshayani (Sati).
However, on seeing the shameless insult to her husband in his absence, and the repeated slights King Daksha and his courtiers railed at Shiva, she committed suicide in grief for her beloved. Hearing the news, Shiva's attendants rushed inside the ceremony hall and started attacking all the guests present there, however, the demons invoked by Bhrigu defeated Shivas attendants and they retreated back to his abode. Upon hearing the news of his beloved wife's death, Shiva was furious that Daksha could so callously cause the harm of his (Daksha's) own daughter in so ignoble a manner. Shiva grabbed a lock of his matted hair and dashed it to the ground. From the two pieces rose the ferocious Virabhadra and the terrible Rudrakali, while Bhadrakali arose from the wrath of Devi herself. Upon Shiva's orders they stormed the ceremony and killed Daksha as well as many of the guests. Terrified and with remorse the others propitiated Lord Shiva and begged his mercy to restore Daksha's life and to allow the sacrifice to be completed. Shiva, the all-merciful One, restored Daksha's life, with the head of a goat. In his humility, and repentance for his graceless and sinful acts, Daksha became one of Shiva's most devoted, attendants.
According to belief this happened in this place now Known as Kankol. As this disgraceful event happened in this place, the second part of Daksha Yagna is happened in the place named Kottiyur, in Kannur District.

History.
According to our scriptures, during warfare, Lord Hanuman, when carrying a piece of Himalaya Mountain for the “Mritasanjeevani” herb, a part of the mountain dropped here in this region which was identified as Ezhimala. As per the study, rare herbal medicines still exist on this hill. 
Stepping deep into the history, this region was known as Elimala. Environment, weather conditions and in particular the fertile soil made this land suitable for habitation from centuries ago. It is believed that people were in existence at this village ever since the Stone Age Civilization (between BC 300 & AD 100). 
Once upon a time, "Ezhimannan", the ruler of Ezhimala, governed Kunhimangalam. At that time, the province of Ezhimala spanned between “Badagara” and “Mangalore”. In Sang literature, this area is referred to as “Ezhil Malai” which means high hillock. In the later years, it is widely believed that Ezhilmalai reduced to Ezhimala. In the history, this region is also known as “Elimala”, “Mooshika Sailam”, “Sapta Sailam”, “Mount Eli” and “Mount the Eli”. It was the seat of the renowned Mooshika dynasty. This dynasty reached its apex of grandeur during the administration of King Nandan. The vestiges of the history illustrate that it was an occupied region from the very ancient antiquity.
Ezhimala was also a well-known attraction of the ancient sailors. The Ezhimala hills are renowned for rare medicinal herbs with mythological significance. Here the sea is bluer than in other areas and the sand at this beach has a different texture. Carved stone pillars, prehistoric mosques, burial chambers, caves and granite platforms are visible at the foot of the hills; all these indicate presence of human life in this hilly region in the past. Mesmerizing sea view, 286m high hillocks and the reminiscences of ancient life, all are the facts that fascinated the sightseers. Then the Mount Dili lighthouse proved the center of attraction for tourists. This mountain range was an eminent milestone for sailors because of its majestic form and the lighthouse.
According to historians, during the 12th century when China’s main mode of transportation was through sea, ships from China and other countries sailed through the river “Changoorichal” which is the west frontier of this village. “Changoorichal” was named after the china’s biggest ship “Changu” anchored in this river. Also, Marco Polo, the famous voyager mentioned about Ezhimala in his travelogue.
Also residuals of four or five caves made of stones at “Thiyyar Vekkum Chal” are the reminiscences of the Stone Age civilization. There is a reference about 64 villages - 32 Tulu villages and 32 Malayalam villages - at the time of commencement of Kerala. Among these Tulu villages, Kunhimangalam is also mentioned. There is a story behind the origin of the name “Kunhimangalam”'.
It is evident from the history of Kunihmangalam, a Namboodiri family known as "“Kunhaangalam Taravadu”" ruled the so-called Kunhimangalam. They ruled the village in an acceptable manner, but over the time this family started to become extinct and at last one mother and a son left as the only members of the family. One day both the mother and son went to river Kaveri to pray for their departed family members and while coming back when they looked from top of the Gadikuzhi hills they noticed that soldiers of Chirakkal Tamburan triumph over the Kunhaangalam Taravadu. The mother and son ended their life in fire with grief. Later, it is believed that the mother emerged as Goddess “Veerachamundi” and the son as God “Veeran”. Due to the high adoration and gratitude towards this Namboodiri family, the people around this area constructed a temple at the same place where the Taravadu existed and they called it as “Kunhimangalam Molom”. The people started worshipping “Veerachamundi” and “Veeran” as their Goddess/God and the village is then being known as Kunhimangalam.
After several years, when all the activities centered in the then existed Kunhimangalam-Cheruthazham panchayat, the people of Kunhimangalam village got provoked and made confrontation for forming a separate panchayat for them. Under this circumstance, Kunhimangalam Panchayat came into existence during the year 1962. Initially the Panchayat Office was situated in a rented building in “Theru”. The first Panchayat President was Mr. U. Kunhiraman who administrated the panchayat under his commanding guidance for more than 24 years. The first panchayat election was conducted not based on the political parties as today. In those days people’s movements were very much effective and most of the works were carried out through such movements. Hindus and Muslims dominate the area. However, there are a few numbers of Christian families too. All these people from different communities co-existed peacefully adopting their own rites and rituals.
At present, the President of Kunhimangalam Panchayat is Mrs.C.Chandrika. The Panchayat is under development in various aspects. The neighboring towns Payyanur and Payangadi are very fast developing towns that influence in the economical and commercial aspects of this village.
Facilities.
Rural Dispensary, Children's Home, Various Cultural forum, Libraries, Agricultural Development Office, Mini Stadium, Fish Market, ICDP center, Three Post Offices, Telephone Exchange, Electricity office, the bold environmental organization SEEK operating with its HQ, Consumer (Maveli) store, Milk societies, Cinema theater, Village office, Panchayat office, Banks, Railway Station, etc. are some of the facilities available here.
There are two main roads and several link roads that connect this Village to the main centers of the district. National Highway 17 passes through this village. Also the railways cross through this village and the Railway Station is known as “Ezhimala”.
Trivia.
Kunhimangalam has "13 alphabets" in its name and coincidentally it is divided into "13 ‘wards’" and the district, which it belongs to, is the "13th district" of Kerala.
Religion.
In this village, human relationship is cherished much and nurtured the ethics of communal harmony and enhanced cultural heritage. We can proudly and sincerely state publicly that the poisonous seeds of social evil never flourished in this small land. Hindus, Muslims and Christians all breathe in a friendly atmosphere. More than mere human relationships, we can find communities loving each other, depending each other and raising the value of communal harmony and cultural heritage. The social equality can be witnessed through the involvement of Hindus and Muslims in each other's festivals and celebrations.
Christians are recently inhabited but Hindus and Muslims are integrated in most of the places. There are two main churches at this village; one at Kovvappuram and the other at Edat known as Capuchin Church at Edat. There are several mosques but the important one is the Jamayeth Mosque. A Hindu Nair family was involved in building up this mosque and a Muslim family was involved in the “utsav” of “Muchilottu Bhagavathi” which clearly shows the Communal harmony and cultural heritage of this village. Angadi and Koyappara are the most Muslim populated areas.
We can see the remains of many old temples, which were dented due to ageing. Also we can see the remains of a temple near the highway at Edanad, which had aesthetically carved doors and domes made of stones. Most of the temples do have yearly celebrations but Kannangattu Bhagavathi temple has its celebrations once in two years only. There are numerous temples of Sree Muthappan, the deity of the common man.
Economy.
The main occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture. Widely spread paddy fields, coconut trees, cashew nut trees and areca nuts are seen all over the place. The natural water resources available at all the three sides and the fertile soil of this village intensified the agriculture and thereby improving the business and industry. Most of the villagers are farmers and doing agriculture related jobs. Apart from cultivation, Beedi-cigar works and weaving are the other areas of employment. Until a few years ago, Kunhimangalam was one of the few self-reliant villages of Kerala. The vast paddy fields and vegetables farms, the earthen pots manufactured at Koyappara, the clothes made at Saliya theru, the bronze vessels and sculpture industry at Moosarikkovval, fishing from the Pullankode river, all made this village self-sufficient. However, today like many other places of Kerala Kunhimangalam is also mostly depending upon the foreign currency from the "Gulf Countries".
Education.
In the field of education, Kunhimangalam has got its own inheritance. It has helped a lot to strengthen the National Movement against the British rule as well as for the social revolution. The history of education in North Malabar has got strong influence in the agricultural movement of this region. The great leaders of freedom struggle of this area who started their work through agricultural movement had a broad and sincere vision towards the advantage of education among common masses.
The national and agricultural movements have made immense changes in the social, cultural and educational sectors. In the earlier years, after the primary education, the people of Kunhimangalam were dependent either on "Government High School" at Payyanur or the "Government High School" at Madayi for higher education. However, higher fees and lack of transportation facilities hindered most of the people to get higher education. There was a night school in “Panachira” from where several people got educated who are still alive. <br/The first school in Kunhimangalam was the Govt. L.P. School and its first headmaster was "Mr. P.M. Ramunni Master".
The first headmaster of Edanad West L.P. School was "Mr. Raghavan Master".
The founder and the first headmaster of Edanad U.P. School was "Sri V.V. Chindankutty Nayanar".
"Sri C.V. Gopalan Nambiar" was the founder and the first headmaster of Gopal U.P. School and he was the teacher for many of the erstwhile generation.
There are several kindergartens and educational institutions such as Four L.P. Schools, Three U.P. Schools, One unaided U.P. School, One High School, One Central School (Kendriya Vidyalaya), One College, English Medium Schools, etc. in this village.

Anti-nuclear protests

Anti-nuclear protests began on a small scale in the U.S. as early as 1946 in response to Operation Crossroads. Large scale anti-nuclear protests first emerged in the mid-1950s in Japan in the wake of the March 1954 Lucky Dragon Incident. August of 1955 saw the first meeting of the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which had around 3,000 participants from Japan and other nations. Protests began in Britain in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the United Kingdom, the first Aldermaston March, organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, took place in 1958. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1964, Peace Marches in several Australian capital cities featured "Ban the Bomb" placards.
Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s and demonstrations in France and West Germany began in 1971. In France, between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations. In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Many mass demonstrations took place in the aftermath of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and a New York City protest in September 1979 involved two hundred thousand people. Some 120,000 people demonstrated against nuclear power in Bonn, in October 1979. In May 1986, following the Chernobyl disaster, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program, and clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and police became common in West Germany.
In the early 1980s, the revival of the nuclear arms race triggered large protests about nuclear weapons. In October 1981 half a million people took to the streets in several cities in Italy, more than 250,000 people protested in Bonn, 250,000 demonstrated in London, and 100,000 marched in Brussels. The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in New York City against nuclear weapons. In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the arms race; the largest crowd of almost one million people assembled in the Hague in the Netherlands. In Britain, 400,000 people participated in what was probably the largest demonstration in British history.
On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades. In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants. In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched from downtown New York to the United Nations headquarters, calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons.
The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed renaissance and revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting governments on the defensive. There were large protests in Germany, India, Japan, Switzerland, and Taiwan.
Australia and the Pacific.
In 1964, Peace Marches which featured "Ban the bomb" placards, were held in several Australian capital cities.
In 1972, the anti-nuclear weapons movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to French nuclear testing there. Activists, including David McTaggart from Greenpeace, defied the French government by sailing small vessels into the test zone and interrupting the testing program. In Australia, thousands joined protest marches in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the tests; unions refused to load French ships, service French planes, or carry French mail; and consumers boycotted French products. In Fiji, activists formed an Against Testing on Mururoa organization.
In November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moritorium on uranium mining. In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere. A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium. In August, another demonstration brought 50,000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force.
On Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's largest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985. The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific.
In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to mark one year since the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia. There were also events in Sydney, and in Melbourne the protest included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are worried about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands.
Czech Republic.
As early as 1993 there were local and international protests against the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant's construction. Large grassroots civil disobedience actions took place in 1996 and 1997. These were organized by the so-called Clean Energy Brigades. In September and October 2000, Austrian anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated against the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant and at one stage temporarily blocked all 26 border crossings between Austria and the Czech Republic. The first reactor was finally commissioned in 2000 and the second in 2002.
France.
In 1971, 15,000 people demonstrated against French plans to locate the first light-water reactor power plant in Bugey. This was the first of a series of mass protests organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France until the massive demonstration at the Superphénix breeder reactor in Creys-Malvillein in 1977 culminated in violence.
In France, between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations.
In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPWR).
On March 17, 2007 simultaneous protests, organised by "Sortir du nucléaire", were staged in five French towns to protest construction of EPR plants; Rennes, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, and Strasbourg.
Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents, around 1,000 people took part in a protest against nuclear power in Paris on March 20. Most of the protests, however, are focused on the closure of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant, where some 3,800 French and Germans demonstrated on April 8 and April 25.
Thousands staged anti-nuclear protests around France, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl and after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, demanding reactors be closed. Protesters' demands were focused on getting France to shut its oldest nuclear power station at Fessenheim, which lies in a densely populated part of France, less than two kilometres from Germany and around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Switzerland.
Around 2,000 people also protested at the Cattenom nuclear plant, France's second most powerful, in the Mosel region to the northwest of Strasbourg. Protesters in southwestern France staged another demonstration in the form of a mass picnic in front of the Blayais nuclear reactor, also in memory of Chernobyl. In France's northwestern region of Brittany, around 800 people staged a good-humoured march in front of the Brennilis experimental heavy-water atomic plant that was built in the 1960s. It was taken offline in 1985 but its dismantling is still not completed after 25 years.
Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear campaigners protested in Paris.
On June 26, 2011, around 5,000 protesters gathered near Fessenheim nuclear power plant, demanding the plant be shut down immediately. Demonstrators from France and Germany came to Fessenheim and formed a human chain along the road. Protesters claim that the plant is vulnerable to flooding and earthquakes. Fessenheim has become a flashpoint in renewed debate over nuclear safety in France after the Fukushima accident. The plant is operated by French power group EDF.
In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks. Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made.
On December 5, 2011, nine Greenpeace activists cut through a fence at the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant. They scaled the roof of the domed reactor building and unfurled a "Safe Nulcear Doesn't Exist" banner before attracting the attention of security guards. Two activists remained at large for four hours. On the same day, two more campaigners breached the perimeter of the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant, escaping detection for more than 14 hours, while posting videos of their sit-in on the internet.
In Aquitaine, the local group TchernoBlaye continue to protest against the continued operation of the Blayais Nuclear Power Plant.
On the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, organisers of French anti-nuclear demonstrations claim 60,000 supporters formed a human chain 230 kilometres long, stretching from Lyon to Avignon.
Germany.
[[File:ANTIAKW.jpg|thumb|right|120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in Bonn, Germany, on October 14, 1979, following the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1971, the town of Wyhl, in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue. In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant. The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites. Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizen action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue.
In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in Bonn.
In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.
The largest anti-nuclear protest was most likely a 1983 nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin which had about 600,000 participants.
In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the arms race. The largest turnout of protesters occurred in West Germany when, on a single day, 400,000 people marched in Bonn, 400,000 in Hamburg, 250,000 in Stuttgart, and 100,000 in West Berlin.
In May 1986, following the Chernobyl disaster, clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police "used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".
During a weekend in October 2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in many years and, according to "Der Spiegel", it signals a revival of the anti-nuclear movement in Germany. In 2009, the coalition of green parties in the European parliament, who are unanimous in their anti-nuclear position, increased their presence in the parliament from 5.5% to 7.1% (52 seats).
A convoy of 350 farm tractors and 50,000 protesters took part in an anti-nuclear rally in Berlin on September 5, 2009. The marchers demanded that Germany close all nuclear plants by 2020 and close the Gorleben radioactive dump. Gorleben is the focus of the anti-nuclear movement in Germany, which has tried to derail train transports of waste and to destroy or block the approach roads to the site. Two above-ground storage units house 3,500 containers of radioactive sludge and thousands of tonnes of spent fuel rods.
Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On March 15, 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization.
In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside of RWE's headquarters in Essen.
Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside of RWE's headquarters in Essen. Other smaller rallies were held elsewhere.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.
In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.
India.
Following the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the former Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A. Gopalakrishnan. The massive Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project is the focus of concern — "931 hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000 people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields" — and it has attracted many protests. Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out.
Environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned six-reactor nuclear power complex on the plains of Jaitapur, 420 km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents. During two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured.
As of October 2011, thousands of protesters and villagers living around the Russian-built Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant in the southern Tamil Nadu province, are blocking highways and staging hunger strikes, preventing further construction work, and demanding its closure as they fear of the disasters like the Environmental impact of nuclear power, Radioactive waste, nuclear accident similar to the releases of radioactivity in March at Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster.
A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court. The PIL specifically asks for the "staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies".
The People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy is an anti-nuclear power group in Tamil Nadu, India. The aim of the group is to close the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant site and to preserve the largely untouched coastal landscape, as well as educate locals about nuclear power. In March 2012, police said they had arrested nearly 200 anti-nuclear activists who were protesting the restart of work at the long-stalled nuclear power plant. Engineers have resumed working on one of two 1,000-megawatt Koodankulam nuclear reactors a day after the local government gave the green light for the resumption of the Russia-backed project.
Italy.
In May 1986, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program, and 50,000 marched in Milan.
Japan.
In March 1982 some 200,000 people participated in a nuclear disarmament rally in Hiroshima. In May 1982, 400,000 people demonstrated in Tokyo. In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.
In 1982, Chugoku Electric Power Company proposed building a nuclear power plant near Iwaishima, but many residents opposed the idea, and the island’s fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders carried out. Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant.
Research results show that some 95 post-war attempts to site and build nuclear power plants resulted in only 54 completions. Many affected communities "fought back in highly publicized battles". Co-ordinated opposition groups, such as the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center and the anti-nuclear newspaper "Hangenpatsu Shinbun" have operated since the early 1980s. Cancelled plant orders included:
In May 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, Stop Rokkasho, was launched by musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Greenpeace has opposed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called "Wings of Peace – No more Hiroshima Nagasaki", since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction to stop the project. Consumers Union of Japan together with 596 organisations and groups participated in a parade on 27 January 2008 in central Tokyo against the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. Over 810,000 signatures were collected and handed in to the government on 28 January 2008. Representatives of the protesters, which include fishery associations, consumer cooperatives and surfer groups, handed the petition to the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Seven consumer organisations have joined in this effort: Consumers Union of Japan, Seikatsu Club Consumer's Co-operative Union, Daichi-o-Mamoru Kai, Green Consumer's Co-operative Union, Consumer's Co-operative Union "Kirari", Consumer's Co-operative Miyagi and Pal-system Co-operative Union. In June 2008, several scientists stated that the Rokkasho plant is sited directly above an active geological fault line that could produce a magnitude 8 earthquake. But Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited have stated that there was no reason to fear an earthquake of more than magnitude 6.5 at the site, and that the plant could withstand a 6.9 quake.
Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, "venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'." Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima I plant have hardened attitudes to nuclear power. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on radiation". The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission – now required by law – to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online. More than 60,000 people in Japan marched in demonstrations in Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Fukushima on June 11, 2011.
In July 2011, Japanese mothers, many new to political activism, have started "taking to the streets to urge the government to protect their children from radiation leaking from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant". Using social networking media, such as Facebook and Twitter, they have "organized antinuclear energy rallies nationwide attended by thousands of protesters".
In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, “took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant”. An estimated 2,500 people marched past TEPCO headquarters, and created a human chain around the building of the Trade Ministry that oversees the power industry. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.
Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting "Sayonara nuclear power" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author Kenzaburo Oe, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and anti-nuclear causes addressed the crowd. Musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, who composed the score to the movie "The Last Emperor" was also among the event's supporters.
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama on the weekend of January 14–15, 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand was for the protection of rights for those affected by the Fukushima accident, including basic human rights such as health care, living standards and safety.
On the anniversary of the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami all over Japan protesters called for the abolishment of nuclear power, and the scrapping of nuclear reactors.
In June 2012, tens of thousands of protesters participated in anti-nuclear power rallies in Tokyo and Osaka, over the government's decision to restart the first idled reactors since the Fukushima disaster, at Oi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture.
New Zealand.
From the early 1960s New Zealand peace groups CND and the Peace Media had been organising nationwide anti nuclear campaigns in protest of atmospheric testing in French Polynesia. These included two large national petitions presented to the New Zealand government which led to a joint New Zealand and Australian Government action to take France to the International Court of Justice (1972). In 1972, Greenpeace and an amalgam of New Zealand peace groups managed to delay nuclear tests by several weeks by trespassing with a ship in the testing zone. During the time, the skipper, David McTaggart, was beaten and severely injured by members of the French military.
In 1973 the New Zealand Peace Media organised an international flotilla of protest yachts including the Fri, Spirit of Peace, Boy Roel, Magic Island and the Tanmure to sail into the test exclusion zone. Also in 1973, New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk as a symbolic act of protest sent two navy frigates, HMNZS Canterbury and HMNZS Otago, to Mururoa.[http://www.mururoavet.com/] They were accompanied by HMAS "Supply", a fleet oiler of the Royal Australian Navy.
In 1985 the Greenpeace ship "Rainbow Warrior" was bombed and sunk by the French DGSE in Auckland, New Zealand, as it prepared for another protest of nuclear testing in French military zones. One crew member, Fernando Pereira of Portugal, photographer, drowned on the sinking ship while attempting to recover his photographic equipment. Two members of DGSE were captured and sentenced, but eventually repatriated to France in a controversial affair.
Philippines.
In the Philippines, a focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, which was built but never operated. The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zone.
South Korea.
In March 2012, environmental conservation groups staged a rally in central Seoul to voice opposition to nuclear power on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. According to organizers, over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the biggest in recent memory for an antinuclear demonstration. The rally adopted a declaration demanding that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy to promote nuclear power.
Spain.
In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects. On July 14, 1977, in Bilbao, Spain, between 150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the Lemoniz Nuclear Power Plant. This has been called the "biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration".
Switzerland.
In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago. Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country’s five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but "would not be replaced at the end of their life span".
Taiwan.
In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to lifespan extensions for three existing nuclear plants.
In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in Taipei City, which had a carnival-like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and waving sunflowers. This was part of a nationwide “No Nuke Action” protest, against construction of a Fourth Nuclear Plant and in favour of a more renewable energy policy.
On World Environment Day in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation’s three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of a fourth plant.
In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island by taking lessons from Japan's disaster on March 11, 2011. They "want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant - the fourth in densely populated Taiwan". Scores of aboriginal protesters "demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their Orchid Island, off south-eastern Taiwan. Authorities have failed to find a substitute storage site amid increased awareness of nuclear danger over the past decade".
In March 2013, 68,000 Taiwanese protested across major cities against the island’s fourth nuclear power plant, which is under construction. Taiwan’s three existing nuclear plants are near the ocean, and prone to geological fractures, under the island.
The Netherlands.
In October 1983, nearly one million people assembled in the Hague to protest nuclear missile deployments and demand an end to the arms race.
United Kingdom.
The first Aldermaston March organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.
One significant anti-nuclear mobilization in the 1980s was the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp. It began in September 1981 after a Welsh group called "Women for Life on Earth" arrived at Greenham to protest against the decision of the Government to allow cruise missiles to be based there. The women's peace camp attracted significant media attention and "prompted the creation of other peace camps at more than a dozen sites in Britain and elsewhere in Europe". In December 1982 some 30,000 women from various peace camps and other peace organisations held a major protest against nuclear weapons on Greenham Common.
On 1 April 1983, about 70,000 people linked arms to form a human chain between three nuclear weapons centres in Berkshire. The anti-nuclear demonstration stretched for 14 miles along the Kennet Valley.
In London, in October 1983, more than 300,000 people assembled in Hyde Park. This was "the largest protest against nuclear weapons in British history", according to the "New York Times".
In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.
In October 2008 in the United Kingdom, more than 30 people were arrested during one of the largest anti-nuclear protests at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston for 10 years. The demonstration marked the start of the UN World Disarmament Week and involved about 400 people.
In October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station site. Members of several anti-nuclear groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors.
In January 2012, three hundred anti-nuclear protestors took to the streets of Llangefnia, against plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa. The march was organised by a number of organisations, including Pobl Atal Wylfa B, Greenpeace and Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which are supporting farmer Richard Jones who is in dispute with Horizon.
On March 10, 2012, the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, hundreds of anti-nuclear campaigners formed a symbolic chain around Hinkley Point to express their determined opposition to new nuclear power plants, and to call on the coalition government to abandon its plan for seven other new nuclear plants across the UK. The human chain continued for 24 hours, with the activists blocking the main Hinkley Point entrance.
In April 2013, thousands of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition wants to see an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies should be used for health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the Faslane Naval Base, where Trident missiles are stored.
United States.
On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest of the 20th century.
On May 2, 1977, 1,414 Clamshell Alliance protesters were arrested at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant.
The protesters who were arrested were charged with criminal trespass and asked to post bail ranging from $100 to $500. They refused and were then held in five national guard armories for 12 days. The Seabrook conflict, and role of New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson, received much national media coverage.
The American public were concerned about the release of radioactive gas from the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and many mass demonstrations took place across the country in the following months. The largest one was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved two hundred thousand people; speeches were given by Jane Fonda and Ralph Nader.
On June 3, 1981, Thomas launched the longest running peace vigil in US history at Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.. He was later joined on the White House Peace Vigil by anti-nuclear activists Concepcion Picciotto and Ellen Benjamin.
On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.
Beginning in 1982, an annual series of Christian peace vigils called the "Lenten Desert Experience" were held over a period of several weeks at a time, at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site in the USA. This led to a faith-based aspect of the nuclear disarmament movement and the formation of the anti-nuclear Nevada Desert Experience group.
The Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice was located in Seneca County, New York, adjacent to the Seneca Army Depot. It took place mainly during the summer of 1983. Thousands of women came to participate and rally against nuclear weapons and the “patriarchal society” that created and used those weapons. The purpose of the Encampment was to stop the scheduled deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles before their suspected shipment from the Seneca Army Depot to Europe that fall. The Encampment continued as an active political presence in the Finger Lakes area for at least 5 more years.
Hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. in 1986 in what is referred to as the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. The march took nine months to traverse , advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.
Other notable anti-nuclear protests in the United States have included:
Anti-nuclear protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other nuclear power plants.
On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades.
In 2008 and 2009, there have been protests about, and criticism of, several new nuclear reactor proposals in the United States. There have also been some objections to license renewals for existing nuclear plants.
In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to a square in front of United Nations headquarters, calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The march occurred ahead of the opening of the review conference on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT).
USSR.
The anti-nuclear organisation "Nevada Semipalatinsk" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former Soviet Union. It attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk, in north-east Kazakhstan, in 1991. The Soviet Union conducted over 400 nuclear weapons tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site between 1949 and 1989. The United Nations believes that one million people were exposed to radiation.

The Last Waltz Ensemble

Overview.
The Last Waltz Ensemble is a musical group that progressively plays the music of Bob Dylan and The Band. The group bolsters a play list of over seventy Bob Dylan, The Band, and related songs, covering music from all eras of the artists’ careers. From The Hawks to the "Basement Tapes" to "The Last Waltz" to later recordings, the group plays traditional and original arrangements in an improvisational jam band format. The group uses vintage equipment and borrowed arrangements, and incorporates guest performances by friends from regional and national acts.
Origin.
In the fall of 2004, the Marietta, Georgia-based original Americana band Houndog decided to hold a one-time concert celebration, a tribute to the music from the Martin Scorsese movie "The Last Waltz". Houndog, made up of Mark Kramer, lead vocals and acoustic guitar; Kris Gloer, vocals and lead guitar; Eric Reed, bass and vocals; and Shawn Stickney, drums, was a regular band on the Atlanta, Georgia, music scene. Houndog regularly played house gigs on Wednesday and Friday nights at Crystal’s bar on the Marietta Square, as well as one night stands all over Atlanta’s hotspots such as The Brandy House, Fuzzy’s Place and Smith’s Olde Bar.
Led into the project by Kris Gloer, the group contacted Brian Cole, talent buyer for the club Fuzzy’s Place, to arrange a venue for the show. In keeping with the spirit of the final concert of The Band, the group chose Thanksgiving weekend, in November 2004. With the dates and venue scheduled, the group decided to have some of their friends from the burgeoning Atlanta, Georgia, music scene perform special guest features, highlighting the guest musicians’ abilities with songs suited for their styles and influences. Guests from that weekend included Tommy Talton, founding member of the band Cowboy and former lead guitarist for The Gregg Allman Band; the late blues musician Sean Costello; and Rev. Jeff Mosier of Blueground Undergrass.
The show sold out, drawing more people than could fit in the more than thirty-year-old establishment. After the weekend was over, Houndog returned to a regular schedule of original music but decided to make the show an annual Thanksgiving weekend event. The following year the show relocated to its current home, Smith’s Olde Bar in midtown Atlanta.
The Thanksgiving 2005 show included guest performances by Kevin Harris, Terence Higgins and Efrem Towns from The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Rick Richards from The Georgia Satellites and Mimi Holland Thomas.
In the spring of 2006 the group, by then called “The Last Waltz Ensemble”, decided to do a test marketing of the show in five cities across the Southeastern United States. Following sold out performances in Charleston, South Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama; and Athens, Georgia, the group was signed by Intrepid Artists International of Charlotte, North Carolina and began touring the United States performing over seventy shows a year. Since the group was signed it has played more than two hundred shows, performing in clubs and theaters, and performed as part of community concerts and festivals.
The group continues to welcome guest performances during concerts. Former guest performers include Susan Tedeschi, Ted Pecchio, Oliver Wood, Colonel Bruce Hampton, Ret., Sean Costello, Rev. Jeff Mosier, Efrem “ET” Towns, Kevin Harris, Mike “Swami” Schumann, Caroline Aiken, Ike Stubblefield, Bobby Houck, Brock Butler, Charlie Starr, Rick Richards, Zach Deputy, CR Gruver, and Justin Brogdon.
The group released its first record, a CD recorded live in Charlotte, North Carolina, entitled "Live at The Visulite Theater" in January 2008. Tracks on the disc include “King Harvest”, “Time To Kill”, “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”, “Like a Rolling Stone”, “It Makes No Difference”, and Dylan’s “You Ain’t Going Nowhere”. The group is currently working with Atlanta, Georgia, musician and producer Oliver Wood on an upcoming studio release.

Peking All-Stars

The Peking All-Stars were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979 by a number of foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital, and was the first rock group in China. The band was formed by Graham Earnshaw, on guitar and vocals, Chris, a Brazilian drummer, and Richard Thwaites, an Australian bass player who doubled as the China correspondent of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It played the first rock concert in China at a university campus hall in Beijing in late summer of 1979, a performance that is commemorated by a photograph in the book "China After Mao" by Liu Heung Shing.
The band dominated the Beijing music scene in the very early 1980s as there were no other bands playing western rock music in the city at all.
Members.
The lineup changed regularly over the years, but members included:
Dissolution.
The band played a number of performances at the Friendship Hotel, the Jianguo Hotel, the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute and at embassies, but restrictions on cultural activities resulting from the so-called Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in 1983-1984 made it difficult for the band to find opportunities to gig.
Earnshaw, who owned the bands gear, eventually passed on the drums and amplifiers to a Madagascan band that was starting up in 1984, while his Fender Telecaster went on long-term loan to the Madagascan guitarist Eddie, who later became the lead guitarist with the so-called godfather of Chinese rock, Cui Jian.

<doc id="20657237" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20657237" title="Fulcrum (Chuck)">
Fulcrum (Chuck)

Fulcrum is the codename of a secret fictional hostile espionage organization on the television series "Chuck". Fulcrum serves as the series' main antagonists up until the end of season two, though their specific goals beyond acquiring the Intersect have not yet been fully revealed.
History.
Very little specific information has been revealed so far about the organization known as Fulcrum, although they have been in existence at least as early as 2003. They are a rogue faction within the US intelligence community, described as a CIA splinter faction but said to have people in every agency. They also have hired on professional mercenaries and have contracted civilians when their skills are required. Fulcrum has been attempting to acquire the Intersect database, and attempted to turn Bryce Larkin and use him to acquire the computer.
Development.
Fulcrum was first introduced in the Season One episode "Chuck Versus the Nemesis." The organization remained a threat for the remainder of the season, most prominently in "Chuck Versus the Marlin." Josh Schwartz revealed in an interview with Sci Fi Magazine that season two would focus more specifically on Fulcrum and the main story arc. However while the organization has played an increasingly larger and more threatening role in the series, little definite information has been revealed on their structure. Chuck has been positively ID'd as the Intersect by at least three different agents but beyond being a person of interest, he has yet to be specifically targeted although Fulcrum operatives are familiar with him as "Agent Carmichael." Fulcrum's parent organization knows something is happening in the Buy More but believe that it is something unrelated to the Intersect, believing it to be a CIA substation.
At the end of "Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon", it is revealed that Chuck has been keeping a complex diagram hidden behind his "Tron" poster detailing connections between the Intersect and several Fulcrum agents. "Chuck Versus the Ring" reveals that Fulcrum is only one part of a broader organization known as "the Ring."
Motives.
Although some of Fulcrum's motives have been revealed, it is unclear what their full agenda is. They are known to be in pursuit of the Intersect and have also attempted to break in to Castle, but neither Jill nor Leader identified Chuck as a person of interest beyond what he could tell them about the facility's computer systems and in actually gaining access to it. While they are shown having international contacts such as the Russian seductress Sasha Banachek, there has been no indication of whether their interests are restricted solely to the United States or if they have international objectives as well. It is known that MI6 is also involved with tracking Fulcrum's activities, as they planted agent Cole Barker in the organization.
In the episode "Chuck Versus the Suburbs", it is revealed that Fulcrum has developed their own Intersect, which they successfully upload into Chuck's brain. Previous episodes show the government attempted to use the original Intersect on government agents as a way to give them information that they could access instantaneously, but according to Fulcrum operatives Sylvia and Brad, the CIA has abandoned the project and Fulcrum wants to restart their own.
Dialog between Chuck and several Fulcrum agents suggest that they may believe they're trying to protect the country, in a case of the ends justifying the means. Specifically, they expressed contempt for the CIA abandoning the Intersect and trying to "slug it out" in the War on Terror using Cold War tactics, and Fulcrum hoped that the Intersect would create more effective agents "ready to fight tomorrow's wars." Later, in "Chuck Versus the First Kill", a Fulcrum recruiting session heavily promotes "strength" and "leadership" and includes the words, "We live a dangerous world, and you want to do something about it." Fulcrum agents in "Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon" stated that they consider themselves patriots.
One part of the Ring.
Fulcrum is one of many smaller organizations making up the Ring. However, the exact nature of the connection between the groups has never been established. It seems that only higher Fulcrum agents may be aware that they are being run by The Ring, as in the series finale a Fulcrum agent possesses a piece of a device that The Ring possesses another part of, and furthermore he believes that Fulcrum is superior to The Ring as a terrorist network. Vincent, the Fulcrum agent assigned to track down Stephen Bartowski, is shown to have direct access to the Council, despite being subordinate to Ted Roark. It is also unclear if Fulcrum's own apparent goal—defending the United States through any means necessary—is independent of the Ring's own objectives, or furthers the Ring's global agenda.
Leadership.
Much like the CIA, Fulcrum appears to assign higher-ranking or more experienced handlers to their assets. Tommy Delgado attempted to recruit Bryce Larkin and commanded the operation attempting to recover the Intersect. Before his execution, Frank Mauser also implied that he was a person of unusual importance within the organization, though the meaning of this was not made clear in the episode. Few other details have been revealed about Fulcrum's command structure.
Tommy Delgado.
Tommy (Anthony Ruivivar), born November 4, 1970 in Honolulu, Hawaii, is the operative who initially attempts to use Bryce Larkin to steal the Intersect, and was part of the failed operation to have him smuggled back into the country by the Demetrios ring. He later deduced that Bryce Larkin was a decoy and that Chuck was the real Intersect. He was later arrested and has not been seen in the show since, however he is still involved with tracking the Intersect from his cell.
It was a "flash" on Tommy that first revealed Fulcrum's existence to Chuck. Until Jill was revealed to be a Fulcrum agent, Tommy was the only Fulcrum agent to have appeared in more than one episode, and a picture of Tommy is seen on Chuck's diagram detailing the connections between the Intersect and several Fulcrum members. He was played by Anthony Ruivivar as cool and ruthless, with no compunctions against killing innocent civilians in pursuit of his mission objectives.
Tommy's birth date and birthplace are the same as the actor who plays him.
Though he appears in only two episodes, Tommy is one of the most important characters in the show's mythology, as his actions set the plot in motion. He could also be seen as the main antagonist of the first season.
Leader.
Leader (played by Patrick Kilpatrick) is the Fulcrum handler of Dr. Jill Roberts. Little is known about him, including his real name.
Leader is a tough, hardened operative. It is currently unknown whether he had any knowledge of Bryce Larkin, the Intersect, or what Fulcrum intended to do with Castle once they took control, however his position overseeing the operation indicates he is ranked somewhere above an ordinary field operative. The incident is the first confirmed instance of two Fulcrum agents working directly in tandem on the same operation. Leader is a talented and in his own words, "devious", strategist and arranged his own capture to gain access to Castle by using Chuck's own feelings for Jill against him.
Frank Mauser.
Lt. Mauser was born on January 14, 1958 in Joliet, IL. A long-time LAPD negotiator, it is believed that he developed extensive ties with Fulcrum during his time as commandant of the LA Police Academy.
When the employees of the Buy More were taken hostage by Ned Rhyerson, Lt. Frank Mauser (Michael Rooker) took control as hostage negotiator.
Mauser orchestrated the entire incident with Ned as his partner—from the high-speed police chase, to the car crashing into the Buy More and the hostage situation—all to identify who Casey and Sarah are assigned to protect.
Mauser's exact position within Fulcrum is unknown, however his claims that Fulcrum would be determined to rescue him indicates he held a fairly high rank within the organization. He was highly intelligent and his plan nearly succeeded in both identifying and capturing the Intersect, making him the closest any of their agents have come to achieving their goal (only Tommy and Lizzie had positively identified Chuck before, though Colt may have been suspicious). He knew both Casey and Sarah were assigned to protect someone within the Buy More, and arranged for Ned to eliminate Casey as a threat by feigning to accidentally shoot him in the foot, enough to disable him but a minor enough wound to keep the following negotiations believable. The operation required a high level of planning only seen before by Leader's operation to access Castle.
In addition to his tactical abilities, Mauser was highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, possibly even superior to Sarah. Though he surrendered, he was executed by Sarah due to the extreme threat he presented to Chuck.
Duncan.
Duncan (Vincent Duvall), born on December 15, 1975 in Chicago, IL, is Dr. Busgang's Fulcrum handler and part of the team developing the Fulcrum Intersect. He was responsible for Cole's capture at the end of "Chuck Versus the Beefcake", and attempted to extract Chuck's identity from him by means of torture. Duncan says that the members of Fulcrum are "patriots" who "do what needs to be done to preserve this nation's rightful place in the world." Duncan executed Busgang before being shot and killed by Sarah.
According to NBC.com, Duncan was once a Marine Corps sniper who was honorably discharged after serving with distinction during Operation Desert Storm. He joined Fulcrum due to growing disillusionment after his discharge.
Vincent Smith.
Vincent (Arnold Vosloo) was born on May 7, 1972 in Denver, CO. He is the head of the Fulcrum team in search of Orion, the Intersect designer, and has been tracking him for three years. He eventually managed to locate him in Hong Kong, narrowly missing a lethal trap set up by Orion. He kidnaps Chuck in hopes of luring Orion into the open to capture him but his plan is foiled by Sarah and Casey, who shoot him before he escapes.
In "Chuck Versus the Dream Job", Vincent was revealed to have survived his wound and escaped capture. He was working with Ted Roark in the efforts to capture Stephen Bartowski. Vincent returned again in "Chuck Versus the Colonel", and was tracking Chuck and Sarah for Roark after they went AWOL at the end of "Chuck Versus the First Kill". He briefly captured Sarah before Chuck ran him over with their car but survived his injuries. He captures the team when they assault Black Rock to rescue Stephen, and was apparently inside the drive-in when the F-16 air strike occurred, dying as a result.
Vincent was a former US Army Ranger (rank of Second Lieutenant) believed to be killed in action in Khowst, Afghanistan. In reality, his death was staged and he went underground working for Fulcrum. He is a native of Louisville, KY and originally enlisted into the U.S. Army Reserve in October 1985 as a combat engineer. He was commissioned from the University of Kentucky ROTC program as a distinguished military graduate in May 1989. He graduated in December 1990 with a bachelor of arts in geography. He entered active duty in February 1991 as a chemical officer. From June 1994 to June 1996, he successfully completed and graduated from the Special Forces Assessment and Selection course at Fort Bragg. He became a member of Fulcrum in June 2000. Vincent's surprise return in "Chuck Versus the Dream Job" makes him the first adversary of Operation Bartowski to have appeared in two non-continuous story arcs (previously, Dr. Jill Roberts and Tommy Delgado appeared in consecutive episodes while Brad White was mentioned and part of his corpse shown in "Chuck Versus the Beefcake" after his death two episodes previously in "Chuck Versus the Suburbs").
Vincent has been compared to "South Park's" Kenny McCormick. In his three appearances so far in the series, Vincent was blown-up, shot, poisoned himself, shot again, smashed in a door by Stephen Bartowski, run over with a Dodge Challenger by Chuck, and knocked unconscious in the Intersect control booth by Sarah right before it was destroyed by an air strike.
Theodore "Ted" Roark.
Ted Roark (Chevy Chase) was born on January 23, 1949 in New York, NY. He is the founder and CEO of Roark Instruments and is the nemesis of Stephen J. Bartowski. He is credited with creating some of today's most successful computer technologies. Early in "Chuck Versus the Dream Job", Stephen tells Chuck that he and Roark were once partners and graduate school classmates, but Roark stole many of his ideas as his own. Despite operating successfully in the United States, his firm has been implicated in several suspect technology transfer deals. He has been under CIA surveillance for at least 18 months. He is in charge of creating the new Intersect for Fulcrum. At the end of "Chuck Versus the Dream Job", he captures Chuck and his father, now revealed as Orion, and forces Stephen to help him finish the Intersect. The episode revealed few other details about the relationship between Roark and Stephen Bartowski, but Roark did not initially know that Chuck was Stephen's son.
Roark reappears in "Chuck Versus the Colonel". He gives Stephen until the next morning to finish the Intersect, threatening to kill his family. Stephen covertly double-crosses him and reprograms the computer to instead remove the Intersect images from Chuck's head when Roark tries to use it to upload the Intersect into a group of Fulcrum agents. Roark discovers the deception when he fails to flash on any of his test data. After Beckman's airstrike begins, Roark flees and is apparently killed when a bomb detonates near him while trying to get to cover, but the end of the episode reveals he survived the attack and plans to disrupt Ellie's wedding.
In "Chuck Versus the Ring", Roark threatens to kill Ellie if Chuck does not turn over the Intersect, however he is thwarted by Chuck, Sarah, Stephen, Bryce Larkin, and a special forces team led by John Casey. Roark is arrested and detained in a cell in Castle. He is later executed by a member of Casey's team who is subsequently revealed to be a member of a mysterious espionage conglomerate known as "the Ring."
Roark is mentioned again in the finale, where it is revealed that a device called The Key was split between the three main Intersect designers. Roark kept his piece of the device for Fulcrum's uses.
It is suggested on the DVD commentary that Roark is the boss of Fulcrum, although he is still only a subordinate to The Ring. He is ultimately the main antagonist of season two.
Bernie Ominsky.
"Uncle Bernie" (Ken Davitian) is a friend of Jill's father. His code name is Carnivore, perhaps because of his past achievement of eating a 96-ounce steak in less than an hour. He is the one who first recruited Jill to Fulcrum. He would screen Jill's boyfriends and if he didn't approve they would disappear. Jill suggested that he was the only one who would know where Chuck's captured father would be held. To draw him away from his Fulcrum protectors, Jill and Chuck pretend to be engaged and throw a party. When Bernie realizes that Chuck is working with the government, he chases them down and tries to kill him, but dies from a heart attack while attempting to beat Chuck with a baseball bat. His death is counted as Chuck's first confirmed kill.
His name is likely a reference to the title character of "Weekend at Bernie's". After his death, Casey, Chuck, Jill, and Sarah took him from the Roberts house, pretending that he was still alive by moving him and speaking for him, an obvious homage to this movie.
Bill Bergey.
Bill (Christopher Cousins) headed up a major Fulcrum base masquerading as a leadership development center. In addition to detention cells for prisoners and hostages, his facility was also used for recruitment. Team Bartowski infiltrated it in an effort to rescue Stephen Bartowski. Bill identified Chuck and Casey, and had Stephen moved. He attempted to kill Chuck but accidentally defenestrated himself. Chuck tried to save his life, but Bill was killed when his suit sleeve ripped and sent him plummeting to the parking lot fifteen stories down.
Bill's sole appearance was in "Chuck Versus the First Kill". Little other information has been provided on the character, but he seemed surprised that Chuck was willing to save his life whether he talked or not. The Bill Bergey name was actually borrowed from the linebacker who played twelve seasons in the National Football League with the Cincinnati Bengals and Philadelphia Eagles.
Operatives.
A number of Fulcrum operatives have been identified by Operation Bartowski over the course of the series. Most of Fulcrum's agents are recruited from within the CIA, and are made up of field operatives and specialists. Fulcrum's recruiting efforts include corporate-style leadership seminars as a front, and Jill Roberts claims that when Fulcrum recruits students, they are given the job of their choice after college as enticement, and this contributes to handlers controlling every aspect of the recruit's life.
Lizzie Shafai.
Lizzie (Noureen DeWulf) was born on July 2, 1981 in Lexington, KY and was given a cover job working as the delivery girl for the Pita Palace restaurant near the Buy More after Tommy's arrest, which she monitored via bugs. Her preferred listening device was the short-range GLG-20, which required a receiver located on-site. Although she took advantage of her looks to deflect attention, Lizzie is a trained killer and quite formidable in hand-to-hand combat. She identified Chuck as the Intersect from her bugs and nearly captured him before being stopped by Sarah.
Juliette.
Juliette (Bianca Chiminello) contracted software magnate Von Hayes to crack a stolen microchip containing an upgrade for the Intersect. She was apprehended after being shot by Casey.
Barry Rommell.
Barry Rommell (Zach Hanks) was a Fulcrum agent assigned to eliminate Guy LaFleur, an expert on pathology and biological engineering who uncovered an attempt to develop a deadly strain of influenza as a biological weapon. Little else is known about Rommell, including whether or not this was his real name or an alias. He was shot and killed by Sarah. At the time of his death, he was carrying CIA credentials, and General Beckman positively identified him as a former CIA agent. His codename while working for Fulcrum was Wolf Den.
Alexander Winterborne.
Alexander Winterborne (Mark Pellegrino) was a Fulcrum agent assigned to follow up on the failed effort to recover a listing of Fulcrum agents from Guy LaFleur. Little else is known about him, other than he was once a member of the CIA Infectious Disease Task Force. After his role in the second season, he makes a cameo appearance in the series finale, "Chuck Versus the Goodbye", when he has a meeting on a plane with Nicholas Quinn.
Jill Roberts.
Dr. Jill Roberts (Jordana Brewster) is a prominent figure in the series mythology, though she did not appear until the middle of the second season. Jill is Chuck's ex-girlfriend from Stanford. She has made the most recurring appearances among Fulcrum agents in the series (with four appearances), surpassing Ted Roark and Vincent, who have each made three appearances.
Nathan Rhyerson.
Nathan Edward (Ned) Rhyerson (aka Needlenose Ned) (Jed Rees) was born on February 2, 1972 in Glendale, CA. He is unmarried and has no criminal record. He leads Burbank police on a 20-mile high speed car chase before crashing his car into the Burbank Buy More as part of a complex Fulcrum plot to determine the whereabouts of Bryce and the Intersect, as well as to determine who Sarah and Casey were protecting at the Buy More. He pretends to be a frightened and confused amateur criminal, though he was later revealed to be much more capable than he initially let on. Rhyerson is neutralized when Morgan, Big Mike, and Captain Awesome use a pneumatic snow flocking machine to disorient and disarm him.
His name is likely an homage to the character Ned Ryerson from "Groundhog Day".
Sylvia Arculin.
Sylvia (Jenny McCarthy) was one of the main Fulcrum agents involved in the project to develop the Fulcrum Intersect. She posed as a flirtatious and unfaithful housewife to one of Chuck and Sarah's neighbors while working undercover in a suburban cul-de-sac investigating possible terrorist activity. She attempted to seduce and capture Chuck to test the Fulcrum Intersect on him, however Chuck managed to escape after inadvertently uploading the test database.
Sylvia's fate at the end of the episode was not conclusively revealed.
She, along with Cliff, Brad, and Vanessa, appear on the chart hidden behind Chuck's "Tron" poster.
Cliff Arculin.
Cliff's (Brian Thompson) real name is Cliff Siljak, and he was born on April 16, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA. He is formerly a top CIA brain scientist. He was shunned by the wider CIA community due to rumors his experiments bordered closer to torture than actual science, which led to his involvement with Fulcrum. He was one of the undercover Fulcrum agents who lived in the Meadow Branch suburban development and was undercover as Sylvia's husband. Cliff apparently survived the activation of the Fulcrum Intersect and is now incarcerated.
Brad White.
Brad White (Andy Richter), born June 21, 1966 in Ann Arbor, MI, was one of several Fulcrum operatives placed in the Meadow Branch suburban development as part of the project to develop the Fulcrum Intersect. As part of his cover, he befriended Chuck and Sarah (who were undercover as a young married couple while investigating the neighborhood under Beckman's orders) intending to use them in the Intersect experiments. He is a former conman.
Brad revealed that Fulcrum chose to build its own Intersect after the government abandoned the project, expressing disgust with their decision to rely on Cold War-era counterintelligence techniques. He was killed when Chuck signaled Casey to activate the Fulcrum Intersect, as his brain could not handle the vast amount of data. Later, his grave is dug up by MI-6 agent Cole Barker to retrieve information on the Fulcrum Intersect.
Vanessa White.
Vanessa (Alison Simpson) was one of the undercover Fulcrum agents who lived in the Meadow Branch suburban development. She acted as Brad's wife, though it is unclear if the two are actually married. Her fate at the end of the episode is unknown.
Alexis White.
Alexis (Katrina Law) was a Fulcrum operative who tried to retrieve the chip taken from Brad White which contained the identity of the Intersect. She commits suicide to avoid capture. Her last words are "Fulcrum wins." During Chuck's flash on her in the Buy More, the files show Alexis performing several bloody interrogations on both men and women, suggesting that torture may be her particular specialty. Alexis was briefly mentioned by General Beckman before a review of the Intersect project by a military panel to counter claims by Daniel Shaw that Chuck was going out of control due to the Intersect. Shaw flashed on Alexis's name, and although Chuck witnessed and recognized that Shaw had flashed, was unable to prove his allegation.
Other.
Fulcrum also has outside contacts. Many of these have been civilians or government workers unaware of the truth of Fulcrum's motives. They are often deceived or coerced into working for Fulcrum.
Bryce Larkin.
Fulcrum attempted to recruit Bryce to steal the Intersect. However, Bryce destroyed the Intersect and sent the only copy to Chuck.
Von Hayes.
Von Hayes (Steve Valentine) was born on August 31, 1968 in London, England. He is a software engineer hired by Fulcrum to decrypt Intersect refresh data stolen from NSA facilities. When Team Bartowski prevents the delivery of Hayes' decrypted information to Fulcrum, he holds the information hostage, demanding immunity from prosecution and a large cash payment in exchange for his cooperation. He is not a spy and has not been trained in espionage or negotiation. His name is an homage to the outfielder who played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, and California Angels.
Guy Lafleur.
Guy Lafleur (William Abadie), born November 28, 1966 in Évreux, France, is a virologist and the head research scientist for Cole-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals, where he is developing a cure for influenza. His research leads to the development of an antiviral agent that rendered useless one of Cole-Macgregor's most powerful bioweapons. When Lafleur attempts to go public with his findings, he is murdered by a Fulcrum assassin. He works closely with Jill Roberts, Chuck's former girlfriend. Along with his work in virology, he also obtains a list of Fulcrum agents, which he hides on an encrypted flash drive in his hotel room in a puzzle box. He is apparently incredibly paranoid with respect to password security. The character's name is borrowed from the Hall of Famer who played seventeen seasons in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques.
Howard Busgang.
Dr. Howard Busgang (Robert Picardo), born March 7, 1960 in Westport, CT, is a Department of Defense scientist who specializes in mapping the human brain's cognitive and spatial function. He is working for Fulcrum during the development of their version of the Intersect, under the code-name "Perseus", believing that he is working for the government. Chuck accidentally shot Busgang in the leg when Chuck attempted to rescue Casey and Sarah, and escaped to a hospital.
Busgang claimed he did not realize a Human Intersect was possible. He was shot and killed by his Fulcrum handler. He was revealed to have been one of the men involved in designing the Intersect computer, which attracted Fulcrum's attention. In the episode he professed that he did not know who he was really working for, and thought he was working legitimately for the government.

John Lenton

John Lenton (before 4 March 1657 – May 1719) was an English composer, violinist, and singer. 
Scholars believe he may have been the John Linton baptized on 4 March 1657 at St Andrew, Holborn. Little is known about his early life. On 2 August 1681 he was appointed to King Charles II's famed troupe of 24 violinists (part of the King's Musick, which comprised the musicians of the royal court) to replace a member who had died; he served as a member of the troupe for the remainder of his life. Lenton played at the coronations of James II, William III, and Mary II. Besides performing, he also contributed to the royal court's repertoire, composing suites to celebrate William III's return to London around 1697 and to celebrate the new year of 1699. He juggled his demands with the King's Musick with duties at the Chapel Royal (where he probably became acquainted with Henry Purcell), of which he was appointed Extraordinary Gentleman on 10 November 1685 and Groom of the Vestry in 1708. Lenton found time outside royal service to compose at least 12 suites for plays produced between 1682 and 1705, mostly for Thomas Betterton's theatre company at Lincoln's Inn Fields.
Lenton's later life mostly consisted of editing, writing, and publishing. In 1692, he collaborated with his fellow court musician Thomas Tollett to publish "A Consort of Musick of Three Parts". Its sequel, "A Three Part Consort of New Musick" (1697), became popular enough to warrant three editions. Lenton also edited the fourth volume of "Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy" (1706) and the second volume of "The Dancing Master" (1710). 
Perhaps Lenton's most notable work is "The Gentleman's Diversion" (1693), which he partially engraved himself. This publication is one of the earliest known extant violin treatises. Scholars had thought that no copies of the work survived, but in 1982, a copy of the first edition was found at the Cardiff public library. At the time, it was proclaimed that Lenton had "the honourable (if perhaps temporary) distinction of having written the earliest extant treatise on violin playing in any language." Written for amateurs and beginners, the treatise spends a considerable amount of text explaining basic music principles and notation before making recommendations on holding the instrument, fingering and bowing. The work also contains 28 "Easie Lessons" as practice pieces, many composed by Lenton's colleagues at the royal court.
Lenton died sometime before 13 May 1719, when his replacement was named to the King's Musick. His widow, Anne, received ownership of his estate on 21 May.

Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen

Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen is a spiritual song. The song is well known and many cover versions of it have been done by artist such as Marian Anderson, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, Paul Robeson, among others. Anderson had her first successful recording with a version of this song on the Victor label in 1925. Horne recorded a version of the song in 1946. Deep River Boys recorded their version in Oslo on August 29, 1958. It was released on the extended play "Negro Spirituals Vol. 1" (HMV 7EGN 27). The song was arranged by Harry Douglas.
Classic variations.
On the late 19th century african-american music begun to appear in classical music art forms, in arrangements made by black composers such as Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Henry Thacker Burleigh and James Rosamond Johnson. Johnson made an arrangement of "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See" for voice and piano in 1917, when he was directing the New York Music School Settlement for Colored People.
American violinist Maud Powell was the first white solo concert artist in perform classical arrangements of spirituals in concerts where she also interpreted classical and contemporary pieces by composers like Dvorak and Sibelius. After Powell's suggestion, J. R. Johnson made an arrangement of "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See" for piano and violin in 1919. Powell got to play this in a fall program she organized and then died that november. Recent interpretations of the classical version of this spiritual has been made by Chicago's violinist Rachel Barton Pine, who has been working over Powell's legacy.
In popular culture.
A line of the song is used in the "Dexter's Laboratory" episode "Dee Dee Be Deep".
Part of the song was sung in the cult movie '"Spaceballs (1987)". 
The song is played on a therimin by Sheldon Cooper in the TV show "The Big Bang Theory"

Auricularia

Auricularia is a genus of jelly fungi in the family Auriculariaceae. There are about eight species described in this genus, which has a widespread distribution. Preliminary phylogenetic studies suggest the Exidiaceae is closely related to Auriculariaceae, the two share many morphological traits. Fruitbody either resupinate or pileate and then either ear-to shell-shaped or forming narrow, imbricate brackets, flabby elastic or tough gelatinous; hymenial surface smooth, wrinkled or veined, often purplish. Basidia cylindrical, with 1-3 transeverse septa. Spores narrowly ellipsoid to allantoid, hyaline, smooth. Most "Auricularia" species are edible and are grown commercially. "Auricularia" species are widely distributed in the Western Ghats, Kerala and recently, "Auricularia auricula-judae", "A. polytricha" and "A. mesenterica" have been reported. 
Classification.
Lowy, in 1951, described a key to the species of "Auricularia" that emphasized the internal structure of the fruit body, while de-emphasizing traditional characteristics such as color, shape and size, which he considered to be too variable and dependent upon such factors as the age of the specimen, exposure to light, or availability of moisture. The characteristics he emphasized were the presence or absence, width and morphology of the medulla (the part composed mainly or entirely of longitudinal hyphae), and the length of the abhymenial hairs, features that are currently used in defining species in this genus.

Early life.
Brewster was born in 1828 in Norwich, Connecticut, to Patrick Brewster (fourth great-grandson of Mayflower Pilgrim William Brewster) and Catharine Fanny Roath. He attended public schools in Norwich and went to work as a clerk in New York City.
Business career.
In 1849 he headed West to join the California Gold Rush, establishing a general mercantile store in San Francisco soon after his arrival. His partner in this enterprise was Oliver Burr Jennings, and together they amassed a considerable fortune.
Brewster returned East in 1874 and settled permanently in New York City. Following his former partner Oliver Burr Jennings, who had married the sister of William Rockefeller's wife, he became involved with John D. Rockefeller in organizing the Standard Oil Company. When the Standard Oil Trust was formed in 1882 he served as a trustee.
Brewster was prominently associated with the building of the Manhattan Elevated Railway and was also a financial leader in many large railroad transactions, particularly the reorganization of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway. He served as vice president of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad and was a director of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad and the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. He was also a director of the International Navigation Company, owner of the American Line of steamers.
Family and death.
On June 9, 1863, Brewster married Elmina Hersey Dows, daughter of James Dows and Elmina Hersey, in San Francisco. They had seven children:
In 1890 Brewster built a summer home in Cazenovia, New York, which he named "Scrooby" after the English manor house where his ancestor William Brewster lived before setting sail on the Mayflower. The building now houses The Brewster Inn.
Benjamin Brewster died at his home in Cazenovia in 1897 at the age of 69. The pallbearers were: John D. Rockefeller, Ransom Reed Cable, Charles S. Fairchild, Roswell P. Flower, Clement Griscom, Walter Jennings, Charles A. Peabody, Henry H. Rogers, Henry W. Curtis, William M. Burr, and Henry H. Porter.

Johann Lesinski

Johann Lesinski (1904--63) was the first and -to date- only bishop of Tingzhou, in the Ecclesiastical province of Fuzhou.
A German, Lesinski belonged to the "Ordo Praedicatorum" (the Dominicans). He was ordained into the priesthood in July 1932, before his 28th birthday anniversary. In May 1947 the Apostolic prefecture of Tingzhou (consisting mostly of the ROC's Changting Prefecture) was promoted to Diocesan standing and Lesiniski was named its bishop (consecrated thus in October of that year).
Struggle with National Catholicism.
Changting in Western Fujian Province was liberated by Communists a little over two years later (now renamed Longyan). Lesinski's Cathedral, in Longyan's Tingzhou town, was not deemed useful to the Sinican Catholic movement and has lain uncelebrated even since reform and opening up under Deng Xiaoping.
Lesinski died in 1963, on April 04, aged 58.

Jordanian cuisine

Jordanian cuisine is a traditional style of food preparation originating from Jordan that has developed from centuries of social and political change with roots starting in Paleolithic period (c. 90,000 BC).
There is wide variety in Jordanian cuisine ranging from baking, sautéeing and grilling to stuffing of vegetables (grape leaves, eggplants, etc.), meat, and poultry. Also common in Jordanian cuisine is roasting, and/or preparing foods with special sauces. 
As one of the largest producers of olives in the world, olive oil is the main cooking oil in Jordan. Herbs, garlic, spices, onion, tomato sauce and lemon are typical flavours found in Jordan. Jordanian food can vary from being extremely hot and spicy to being mild. 
The most common and popular appetiser is hummus, which is a puree of chick peas blended with tahini, lemon, and garlic. Ful Medames is another well-known appetiser. A workers meal, today it has made its way to the tables of the upper class. A successful mezze must of course have koubba maqliya, labaneh, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and pickles. 
The most distinctive Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan, a symbol in Jordanian culture for generosity.
Although simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef a dish made specially for Ramadan.
In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavored with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.
Food culture and traditions.
Within Jordan, mealtimes are not merely a biological function, but also a time of celebration. Food is a very important aspect of Jordanian culture. In villages, meals are a community event with immediate and extended family present. In addition, food is commonly used by Jordanians to express their hospitality and generosity. Jordanians by nature are very hospitable people and, often, food is presented within minutes of a guest arriving at a local house.
Jordanians serve family, friends, and guests with great pride in their homes; no matter how modest their means. A 'Jordanian invitation' means that you are expected to bring nothing and eat everything. And rich Jordanian food coupled with the famous Jordanian hospitality creates an atmosphere of festivities each time a meal is served.
Most of the celebrations in Jordan are exceptionally diverse in nature and quite festive at the same time. Each celebration is marked with dishes from Jordanian cuisine spread out and served to the guests. There are many traditional small gatherings in Jordan too; even in those gatherings a lot of meals are served. Customs such as weddings, birth of a child, funerals, birthdays and specific religious and national ceremonies such as Ramadan and Jordan's independence day all call for splendid food to be served to guests.
Jordanian food.
Mezze.
By far the most dominant style of eating in Jordan, mezze is the small plate, salad, appetizer, community style eating, aided by dipping, dunking and otherwise scooping with bread. Mezze plates are typically rolled out before larger main dishes.
In a typical Jordanian mezze, you might find any combination of the following dishes:
Soups.
In Jordan, meals are usually started with soups. Jordanian soups are usually named after their main ingredient such as:

Chen Xiaowang

Chen Xiaowang (born 20 October 1945) is a Chinese taijiquan teacher, who was born and raised in Chen Family Village (Chenjiagou, 陳家溝), Wen County, Henan province, and is the 19th generation lineage holder of Chen-style taijiquan. His grandfather was the taijiquan grandmaster Chen Fake.
Background.
Chen Xiaowang began his study of Chen-style taijiquan at the age of seven under his father, Chen Zhaoxu, and later with his uncles Chen Zhaopi and Chen Zhaokui. Recognized as one of four "Buddha's Warrior Attendants ("Si Jingang")," the four outstanding exponents of the 19th generation in Chenjiagou, Chen Xiaowang was chairperson of the Henan Province Chen Push Hands Taijiquan Association; deputy head of the Wushu Academy of Henan Province; and technical advisor and official assessor for the standardized competition routines for the Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun styles of taijiquan.
Chen was awarded the Chinese National Wushu Tournament Taijiquan gold medal three consecutive years beginning in 1980. In 1985, he was crowned Taijiquan Champion at the First International Wushu Competition in Xi'an.
Apart from his martial arts prowess, Chen is a carpenter by trade, a calligrapher, an author of three Taijiquan books, and is known to enjoy Mao Jian Cha tea (信阳毛尖茶).
Contributions to Chen-style Taijiquan.
Grandmaster Chen has created two condensed forms of the "laojia" and "xinjia" forms; a 38-posture form and a 19-posture form. He told inside Kung-Fu Magazine in 1991, "I have tried to do away with all the repetitions and simplify the exceedingly difficult moves without destroying the characteristics of Chen Style Taijiquan, with special emphasis to attack/defense and the "chansi" technique."
Chen was also famously depicted in a March 1981 Japanese documentary on Taijiquan. In it, he demonstrates the "laojia" form, "fa jin", and escapes from various qinna holds.

Scenic route

A scenic route, tourist road, tourist route, tourist drive, holiday route, theme route, or scenic byway is a specially designated road or waterway that travels through an area of natural or cultural beauty. The designation is usually determined by a governmental body, such as a Department of Transportation or a Ministry of Transport.
Tourist highway.
A tourist highway or holiday route is a road which is marketed as particularly suited for tourists. Tourist highways may be formed when existing roads are promoted with traffic signs and advertising material. Some tourist highways such as the Blue Ridge Parkway are built especially for tourism purposes. Others may be roadways enjoyed by local citizens in areas of unique or exceptional natural beauty. Still others, such as the Lincoln Highway in Illinois are former main roads, only designated as "scenic" after most traffic bypasses them. In the USA this type of roadway is commonly termed a scenic highway. In Europe and other countries around the world they are often marked with brown tourist signs with the individual route symbol and/or name.
United States.
In the United States, a "scenic route" may also refer to a type of special route of the U.S. highway system that travels through a particularly beautiful area. These special routes, which boast "Scenic" banners are typically longer than the "parent route". There are only two routes in the country that remain with the official scenic designation: U.S. Route 40 Scenic and U.S. Route 412 Scenic.
Within the United States, there is also the National Scenic Byway program which designates portions of existing roads as scenic byways due to some unique characteristics.
Parkways.
The first "parkways" in the United States were developed in the late 19th Century by landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Beatrix Farrand as roads segregated for pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and horse carriages, such as the Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. The terminology "parkway" to define this type of road was coined by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with "pleasure roads." Newer roads such as the Bidwell and Lincoln Parkways in Buffalo, New York were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. Parkways can be the approach to large urban parks, such as the Mystic Valley Parkway to Boston Common in Boston. Some separated express lanes from local lanes, though this was not always the case.
During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include controlled-access highways designed for recreational driving of automobiles with landscaping. These parkways originally provided scenic routes without at grade intersections, very slow vehicles, or pedestrian traffic. Their success led to more development however, expanding a city's boundaries, eventually limiting their recreational driving use. The Arroyo Seco Parkway between Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena, California is an example of lost pastoral aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name parkway.
'New Deal' parkways.
In the 1930s, as part of the New Deal the U.S. federal government constructed national parkways designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower speed limits and are maintained by the National Park Service. An example is the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Virginia. Others are: Skyline Drive in Virginia; the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee; and the Colonial Parkway in eastern Virginia's Historic Triangle area. [http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html]. The George Washington Memorial Parkway and the Clara Barton Parkway, running along the Potomac River near Washington, D.C, were also constructed during this era.
Post-war scenic parkways in the U.S..
In Minneapolis, the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway system has of streets designated as parkways. These are not freeways, having a slow speed limit, pedestrian crossings, and stop signs.
Theme routes.
Theme Routes are special theme-based tours, aimed at providing a visitor or tourist with a better insight on that theme. Being popular in Europe, they can cover anything from an individual city, a wine growing region, Dutch bulb fields, Swiss Mountains, to Norwegian Fjords. Subjects can be architectural, historical, or cultural.

M44 generator cluster

The M44 generator cluster was an American chemical cluster bomb designed to deliver the incapacitating agent BZ. It was first mass-produced in 1962 and all stocks of the weapons were destroyed by 1989.
History.
The United States Army Chemical Corps renewed their chemical warfare (CW) program's focus in the early 1960s. This refocusing led to the pursuit of weapons utilizing agent BZ. In March 1962 the U.S. Army first began mass-production of the M44 generator cluster, along with the M43 BZ cluster bomb. 
Despite reaching mass-production ("standardization" in military jargon) levels, the M44 and the M43 were never truly integrated into the main U.S. chemical arsenal. In total, around 1,500 of the M44s and M43s were produced. All U.S. BZ munitions and agent stockpiles were stored at Pine Bluff Arsenal. The entire U.S. BZ stockpile, including the M44s, were demilitarized and destroyed between 1988 and 1989.
Specifications.
The M44 had a diameter of and a length of . Weighing 175 pounds the M44 generator cluster was a cluster bomb which was designed to deliver the chemical incapacitating agent BZ; to that end the weapon held approximately 39 pounds of BZ. 
The weapon's sub-munitions are a combination of various components. Three M16 BZ smoke generators were held together in an M39 cluster adapter and its M92 wire assembly; the M39 essentially bound and buckled the generators together. Each generator also held its own parachute, complete with harnesses and its own container. Also within the generator was its "generator pail" which contained the M6 canisters, the part of the sub-munition that held the BZ. Each of the M44s three generator pails held 42 M6 canisters, a total of 126. The canisters were arranged in a 14 three-canister tiers and each one held about 5 ounces of agent BZ.
Issues.
The M44s relatively small production numbers were due, like all U.S. BZ munitions, to a number of shortcomings. The M44 dispensed its agent in a cloud of white, particulate smoke. This was especially problematic because the white smoke was easily visible and BZ exposure was simple to prevent; a few layers of cloth over the mouth and nose are sufficient. There were a number of other factors that made BZ weapons unattractive to military planners. BZ had a delayed and variable rate-of-action, as well as a less than ideal "envelope-of-action". In addition, BZ casualties exhibited bizarre behavior, 50 to 80 percent had to be restrained to prevent self-injury during recovery. Others exhibited distinct symptoms of paranoia and mania.

Livek

Livek (; ) is a village in the Municipality of Kobarid in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It is located on the border with Italy, under Mount Matajur and the Kolovrat mountain range, which separates the Italian region of Friuli from the Upper Soča Valley.
The parish church in the center of the village is dedicated to Saint James.
History.
Alpine Slavs, ancestors of the present-day Slovenes, settled the area in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages, the villages belonged to the Lombard Kingdom, the Frankish Empire, and finally to the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Between 1420 and 1797, Livek belonged to the Republic of Venice and was part of the historical region known as Venetian Slovenia.
In 1797, it was acquired by the Habsburg Monarchy. Already in 1805, it was included in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. In 1813 it was regained by the Austrians. Although the vast majority of the region of Venetian Slovenia was included in Austrian Lombardy-Venetia, Livek was placed in the administrative region known as the Kingdom of Illyria. In 1849, it became part of the Austrian Littoral. In 1866, when the Veneto and Friuli regions were acquired by Italy, Livek remained in the Austrian Empire, becoming a border village.
Livek became known during World War I, when it became an important strategic location during the Battle of Caporetto. A unit of the German Army commanded by Erwin Rommel, who later became a German Field Marshal in World War II, seized the village and used it as a base from where they took the strategically crucial Mount Matajur. Rommel's small unit managed to defeat the Italian defense that numbered 150 officers, 9,000 men, and 81 pieces of artillery. He received Prussia's highest medal, the Pour le Mérite, for this act and described it and his route to Matajur via Livek in his 1937 book "Infanterie greift an" (Infantry Attacks).

Synopsis.
Six adventurers arrived on Scorpion Island and were split into two teams, Sting and Claw. Hidden in the deep part of the island was a secret camp called Limbo, where 10 captives are held. The teams would battle it out to rescue team members from Limbo.
Contestants.
There were 16 adventurers on the island, 12 from the UK and 4 from Australia. The Australian adventurers were Ayla, Lachlan, Alex Y and Tara.
Original Teams:
Claw
Sting
Limbo Captives:
Final Teams:
Team Claw (Black Helmets) 6 Members. Camp: Tree Camp. 
Team Sting (Orange Helmets) 10 Members. Camp: Boat Camp.
Power Plays.
The Power Plays are special advantages that are held by Limbo captives. They may only use their power play when they are on Sting or Claw. The captives are supposed to keep their power play a secret, but if they reveal their secret to someone in Claw or Sting before they're released from Limbo, their power play is passed on to someone else.
List of Challenges.
Note: All episodes are based in Australian airing. UK episodes are based on days.
Day 1 (Episodes 1 and 2).
On the first day at Scorpion Island, all six of the original members skydived on Scorpion Island from a height of 4000 metres ready to take part in the challenges that the island has waiting. Meanwhile, ten members were locked up in a crate hanging from a helicopter and landed on the island as well. Unfortunately, all of them are Limbo captives.
In the first challenge, Sting were leading earlier, but one of the logs broke just as they got their team flag and ended up hanging on another log. Claw later had the lead, but not only did one of the stepping logs broke, Tara dropped their team flag just as she was about to put it in her pocket. It was neck and neck as they both descended the challenge. Claw got to the ground first, but had to go to Sting's side to reclaim their flag, but it was too late and Sting won the challenge. Sting chose Boat Camp, leaving Claw with Tree Camp.
At the Stone of Selection, the Limbo captives were selected one at a time to see if they would be playing the next challenge. Four Limbo captives (Ayla, Lachlan, Alex T. and Livvi) were not selected and were told that they were secret Power Players.
Day 2 (Episodes 3 and 4).
In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie went first and only dropped one pole but grabbed another. Anna went next and easily grabbed a pole. When it came to Ollie again, he dropped 22 other poles and lost the challenge for his team since it was impossible for the white team to catch up. As a result, the blue team won the challenge and the white team returned to Limbo.
In the Ultimate Jeopardy, Team Sting dropped a few poles early on, and just as Team Claw was about to win it with their last pole, Sammy dropped five. That mistake cost them victory and Team Sting won Anna.
In the Survival Challenge, despite Alex T struggling with the code and Lachlan and Ollie fighting for leadership, the captives passed the challenge.
Day 3 (Episodes 5 and 6).
In the Limbo Challenge, Alex T kept falling and felt frustrated, while Jack and Ayla worked together to get to the end. Even Jack cheered for Alex T showing how valuable he is as a player. In the end, the Blue Team won and the White Team returned to Limbo. Sting wanted Jack, leaving Claw fighting for Ayla, despite they wanted Jack as well because he was a strong male player for Jake.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Cameron gave a valiant effort while Anna was blindfolded. As for Jake and Sammy, despite they fell once, they took a lot of time making progress. Even though Team Sting was much faster, they kept falling off. In the end, Claw won and not only did they gain Ayla, they also had the Power Play, 'Swap', which was a great advantage for Claw, for if they had chosen Jack, they wouldn't have received a Power Play.
In the Survival Challenge, eventually, Lizzy caught a tiny fish in the river and they did not receive the forfeit. Alex T fell in backwards and got soaked.
Day 4 (Episodes 7 and 8).
In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie struggled again and in the end, Cai, Lachlan and Lizzy won.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Jake wasn't happy for not being selected to take part in the challenge saying that girls alone won't win this challenge. Ayla was climbing and being pulled by Tara while Sammy was the spotter. As a result, Jake was right. Ayla was a good climber being as strong as Olivia, but halfway through she started losing it which gave Olivia a chance to catch up and go ahead. Claw worked very well together but due to some gear and the steep slant on their side of the waterfall, they had some trouble and lost. Sting, with Olivia, Cameron and Alex playing won, and gained Lachlan, including a Power Play, "False Start".
During the survival challenge, the message changed when Amie was distracted by her task, which made everyone else change it more, and the group was tied together in pairs. The pairs were as follows:
However, the group made the situation good by getting to know each other, especially Lachlan and Ollie after leadership complaints during their first survival challenge. The group also did things like tying shoelaces, playing limbo and going around a pole.
Day 5 (Episode 9 and 10).
During the Stone of Selection, Livvi believed that whoever was in the white team would lose because in all the Limbo Challenges, the white team had lost. Also, this was the first time Jack wasn't selected to take part in the Limbo Challenge.
In the Limbo Challenge, despite Ollie had a better performance compared to his previous Limbo Challenges, the Blue team's time of 2:44 wasn't quick enough to beat the White Team's time of 2:29.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Sting made 13 matches and Claw made 10. As a result, Sting won and gained Cai.
In the Survival Challenge, despite a few arguments, the Limbo captives completed the challenge with Livvi safely returning the torch and avoided the forfeit.
Day 6 (Episode 11 and 12).
In the Limbo Challenge, no one crossed the bridge completely but Amie of the blue team covered the most distance by a whisker over Jack of the white team.
Before Ultimate Jeopardy, Anna, who was the captain of Sting, selected Amie. Jake, who was the captain of Claw selected Lizzy as he believed she has done well through the past Limbo Challenges. Interestingly, Jake wanted another guy for their team, but didn't choose Alex T and also missed out on the Freeze Power Play.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Cameron went first in his run while Anna was cheering for him, but Tara covered her mouth to stop her cheering. Cameron reached around halfway through the bridge. Tara went second and she too reached the halfway mark despite getting the accelerator and brake mixed up. Anna went third, she had an amazing sencce for balance but she thought that extending her leg would help her turn the scooter but didn't know that she had to use the handles to turn it. As soon as she fell, Lizzy was hugging Jake from her cage believing she'll be freed from Limbo. Jake went last, he used Cameron's original idea of going very fast to avoid wobbling. He fell only few inches before the end and covered the most distance of the all. In the end, Jake and Tara covered the most distance than Cameron and Anna and won the challenge. As a result, Claw gained Lizzy. At the special River Camp, Lizzy overcame her fear of deep water.
In the Survival Challenge, Amie described all the objects and each one was identified by the other captives.
Day 7 (Episode 13 and 14).
At the Island Fire in the previous night, the teams found out that the team that will lose the next Ultimate Jeopardy would have to sacrifice their participating player to Limbo. Tara who was the team captain of Claw chose Jake to play and Sting's captain Alex Y of Sting chose himself. When they left, Sting thought Alex Y was brave to be offered as their sacrifice, especially Anna who thought she was the weakest link after losing both of her challenges since joining the team. Tara on the other hand felt really bad for choosing anyone in the team and losing them. She was deciding on either Jake or Lizzy to take part in the challenge, but the rest of the team believed that Jake will win the Ultimate Jeopardy and gain a new member for their team.
After Claw won their last challenge and Lizzy, Sting decided to trash Claw's Tree Camp by doing things like turning their furniture upside down and taking bites out of their fruit. When Claw came back, they were not happy that Sting did it to their camp and believed that they were sore losers, since they won four of the six challenges so far. Claw decided to confront Sting about this. Sting denied that they trashed their camp. Claw knew that it was them because Lachlan left a toy snake at their camp. They said that they will get their revenge by winning the next challenge.
In the Survival Challenge, each Limbo captives had to select a target (between an egg, a grapefruit, a melon, a pineapple and a watermelon) and had only two shots to make the target. They all got a practice shot at the melon because it was medium sized. Livvi went for the egg because she hit the melon in the centre, Jack went for the grapefruit, Amie went for the melon, Ollie went for the pineapple and Alex T went for the watermelon for completely missing the melon. Alex T hit the watermelon in his first shot, Ollie missed the pineapple in both attempts, Amie just hit the bottom of the melon in her second attempt and Jack just missed the grapefruit, so Livvi didn't need to go for the egg because the group failed the challenge. As a result, they all had to eat in the dark. Despite having to do the forfeit, the Limbo captives made a bad situation fun by having a food fight in the dark.
In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie completed the course in 2:19 and Alex T, despite not having too much confidence in water, his time of 2:36 was not enough to win the Limbo Challenge. Therefore, Ollie was the prize for the winning team in Ultimate Jeopardy.
In Ultimate Jeopardy both of the players had problems with the challenge. Jake went first and thought it would be faster if he tried to pull the rope from the last hole. The tactic badly misfired and the skull got stuck 3 times losing Jake around 20 seconds to free it. Alex freed the skull from the first pontoon but he lost it, he went back to find it not knowing and seeing that the skull was tied to a rope and that Jake went to next pontoon and pulled it from there. He also made it harder for himself because he had to carry the skull. In the end, Jake's time of 4:11 was better than Alex Y's time of 4:22, meaning Jake won the challenge for Team Claw. As a result, Claw gained Ollie and Sting's Alex had to go to Limbo. If Sting won Ultimate Jeopardy instead, Claw would be down to four members while Sting would have seven members. Instead, Claw now lead with six members to Sting's five members.
Day 8 (Episode 15 and 16).
After Sting's Alex lost the last challenge and went to Limbo, the captives made a welcoming to him by putting face paints on each other representing Limbo. The Stone of Selection didn't select Alex for the next challenge, but he was alright about and decided to use it for a rest day. 
In the Limbo Challenge, Jack and Amie had a good start, although Jack had a much difficult time getting the puzzle pieces compared to Amie. In addition, the pair didn't got along well by not talking to each other. Eventually, they managed to get all the pieces to the puzzle board and quickly completed the puzzle thanks to Amie taking control of solving the puzzle. As for Alex T and Livvi, despite the both of them having a tough time getting the puzzle pieces, both of them worked well together by talking to each other and even held hands, showing great team work, but Livvi fell a couple of times. Unfortunately, their great team work wasn't enough to win the challenge because they were slower to complete the puzzle.
Before the Ultimate Jeopardy, Claw's captain Ayla decided to use her power play, "Swap". Originally, Sting's captain Lachlan selected Cameron and Olivia to take part with him in Ultimate Jeopardy. After Ayla discussed with her team members, Ayla decided to swap Olivia for Anna.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Lizzy from Claw took a huge lead getting the pieces first and started placing them, while Sting struggled getting their pieces. Later, Cameron gained some composure by throwing the pieces to their puzzle board and pulled Claw away from their puzzle board, making Lizzy struggle to get a footing. Unfortunately, with Lizzy who had only one piece to put into place and Cameron taking way too long to complete the puzzle, Lizzy managed to slam the final piece into its position to claim victory for Claw. As a result for winning the Ultimate Jeopardy, Claw gained Amie. Ayla took a big step in leading here as she cheered a lot for her team. When Lizzy was regaining her strength lying on the sand, Sammy and Ayla had to keep their footing. If they hadn't pulled their weight, Claw would have flung back against Sting.
In the Survival Challenge, all the scales were just balanced and the group did not receive the forfeit.
Day 9 (Episode 17 and 18).
On the previous night at the Island Fire, the teams found that the Limbo Challenge will be another 1 on 1. The Winning Team will get the Winner of the Limbo Challenge and the losing team will have to sacrifice either their team captain or the player they had chosen to take part in the challenge to Limbo.
In the Limbo Challenge, Jack carefully drove around the course and only got one time penalty, but Alex, who had experience, drove around much quicker and won the challenge. He even almost broke the buggy's engine.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Jake was driving blindfolded with Ollie guiding him for Claw. Ollie easily managed to guide Jake, really focused and with Jake being really calm, with a minor number of mistakes and only knocking off one skull.
At the Island Fire the previous night, Cai, who was the captain for Sting, chose Lachlan to compete with him because he had a Power Play, False Start, which he decided to use. During Sting's run, Cai ended up getting stuck on the course so they both used the Power Play, False Start. In Sting's second run, Cai went so fast, Lachlan was shouting directions, Olivia and Anna were really nervous yelling to them to slow down, while Alex Y. was shouting directions and things like "What are you doing?", "Stop!" They knocked down five skulls, which made team Claw happy thinking that there is no way they could lose.
Overall, Sting knocked down five skulls giving them a 50 second time penalty to Claw's one, giving them a 10 second penalty. Despite Sting's 50 second time penalty, they finished the course the fastest and gained Alex Y. This also meant that Ollie had to decide whether Jake or himself would be going back to Limbo. Ollie didn't want to send Jake, an original member, so he decided to send himself to Limbo.
In the Survival Challenge, all the captives managed to identify the foods which were onion, lemon and garlic. They didn't like the taste of them and all spat them out. Jack ate the lemon, Alex Y ate the onion and Alex T ate all three with Jack telling him that he is weird.
Day 10 (Episode 19 and 20).
Ollie went back to Limbo after his team lost against Sting. The other captives asked him questions about what Claw was like.
After Claw lost Ollie, Tara wanted revenge on Sting for making nasty comments, saying "In your face" towards them. All the members of Claw went to Sting's camp, unattended and trashed their Boat Camp and left. They Wound up the hammocks, took the furniture out of the camp and Put the table near a log upside down. When Sting returned, they thought it was silly that Claw did the same things Sting did to their camp. They also didn't think it was appropriate.
In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie wasn't close enough to hit the skulls in his first two runs, which made him frustrated. He managed to hit two skulls later on but then, he still couldn't get closer to hitting them. On Jack's turn, he wasn't close enough to the skulls, but managed to hit two skulls on his next run. Later, he managed to hit two more skulls making a total of four. On his last run though, he accidentally hit broken skulls he already had hit, but Jack and Alex T were the winners.
In the Survival Challenge, Jack and Ollie ran with the buckets while Alex T handed them to Livvi who poured the water in the container. They took 4 minutes and 54 seconds to complete the challenge so they avoided the forfeit. 
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Olivia held up Lachlan to throw skulls to Alex Y for Sting, and Lizzy held up Sammy to throw skulls to Amie for Claw. During Claw's turn, Amie missed the first two skulls but then hit another on her third go. Later, the team had worked on a pattern for throwing which made a total of five skulls. In Sting's turn, Alex Y first hit a skull on his second go. On his third go, he jumped too hard and accidentally spined through the air, but he managed to hit another skull directly above Lachlan. Sting's total was six skulls, making them the winner and they gained Jack.
Day 11 (Episode 21 and 22).
After Jack had left Limbo and there were only three captives left, Livvi felt that since Jack had gone, she thought the reasons that she and Alex T had always been in Limbo were because all of the better captives had already been picked. This is not true however, as she and Alex T have been commented by Sting and Claw saying that they had done well in challenges and sometimes had been chosen by them to go on their teams.
At the Stone of Selection, Livvi was originally stung to play the next challenge against Ollie, but her leg injury had not made her feel well enough that she was forced to not do the challenge and Alex T was chosen instead.
In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie built his tower slowly and carefully so it wouldn't fall over, while Alex T was rushing too much, causing some of the crates to not be locked and making him fall. Ollie had stacked 19 crates into two towers to stand on, but as he was going to put his last one, the tower fell. Alex had slightly got into the lead but, some of the crated did not lock in and he fell, but Ollie soon managed to make another one. As Ollie decided to jump for the skull he missed and his tower fell over again. Alex T started to get higher with his tower, and he kept psyching Ollie out. Ollie then managed to make his tower again and decided to reach out to the gold skull. Alex T, despite being lower than Ollie, decided to jump for it as well as Ollie was closer. Alex T. jumped first and missed, then Ollie jumped and caught the skull, which meant that he was escaping from Limbo again, though Claw would need to win Ultimate Jeopardy to win him back.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Claw's Amie built her towers carefully, but when it came jumping off them, she would always misjudge her jump. Sting's Cameron was slower than Amie and kept having falls, but not as much as Claw's tower. When both teams had around nine crates stacked, Cameron decided to jump to the skull for his second go and Amie for her third go. Amie jumped first and missed again, then Cameron jumped carefully and caught the skull thus, Sting had won the challenge and gained Ollie. After the challenge, just as everyone left, a cage fell down on Amie and Lizzy from Claw and they were trapped. Back at Claw's camp, the other members worried what happened to the girls and thought that maybe they went to Sting or Limbo.
In the Survival Challenge, all three captives successfully ate the ants. Alex T ate lots of them as he liked the ants' taste. He even picked up a whole leaf of them and ate ants off it. Livvi only ate one but didn't like it and she felt nausous seeing them. Ollie ate a few and he even had a fight with one of them biting in his mouth, while all of them experienced some ant bites. Alex T hoped they would still be there the next day.
At the Island Fire, JK and Joel told Claw a message from the island. The island had captured Lizzy and Amie as a punishment for losing the challenge, and they were held prisoner in Limbo. The good news was that they could be won back in the next challenge.
Day 12 (Episode 23 and 24).
Amie and Lizzy were gutted that they were in Limbo again, but hoped that they could get back on to Claw soon. The rest of Claw were not acting like normal. Jake decided that he needed to encourage the team more.
At the Stone of Selection, all the captives were selected with Alex T and Livvi on one team and Lizzy and Amie on the other. It was discovered that all of them were going to be leaving Limbo today, with the winners of Ultimate Jeopardy getting the players who won the Limbo Challenge, and the losing team would get the players that lost the Limbo Challenge. Livvi's leg had not been well and if she wasn't able to play, then it would be a 1 vs 1 challenge.
In the Limbo Challenge, since Livvi had a leg injury, Alex T had to do two rounds of Rollin' Thunder. As a result, this meant that only Amie or Lizzy must compete against Alex T for fairness. Amie chose Lizzy to take part in the challenge. Unfortunately, Alex T lasted for 45 seconds long and Lizzy lasted 5 minutes 49 seconds for their first go. Alex T lasted for around one minute, meaning that Lizzy and Amie were clear winners. Lizzy decided to have a second turn, to beat her personal record. She lasted an incredible 8 minutes 56 seconds before calmly getting off. She'd even let go of the spindle at some points to trick them.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Lachlan from Sting lasted 1 second on the spindle and Livvi and Alex started laughing at him. Tara from Claw lasted for 10 seconds. Olivia from Sting however, managed to stay on for 4 minutes and 10 seconds, while Claw had used up all their skulls to throw. She even got a skull hit on her head. Sammy from Claw however, only stayed on for 4 seconds, because of her height not big enough to hold on to the spindle. As a result, Sting won and gained Amie and Lizzy, while Claw not only gained Alex T and Livvi, but also gained two new power plays, "Freeze" and "Head Start".
At the end of the day, there was no one left in Limbo, therefore the camp, the Survival Challenge and the Stone of Selection no longer exist. At the Island Fire, J.K and Joel told the teams that they had two chances to win members of their opposing team.
Day 13 (Episode 25 and 26).
Before the challenge, Livvi decided to use her power play, "Head Start". However, since Livvi sustained a leg injury, Sammy would be the one with the power play, but Livvi had control when to use it, which is why Livvi nominated Sammy to play.
In the first round, Amie went first for Sting. Amie was going well until she got her shirt stuck in the net, slowing her down. Luckily, she was not flatten by the boulder, despite falling over twice. Sammy from Claw went next, who had her Power Play which made her start six seconds before the boulder started to roll. Sammy made a big distance so that the boulder would not be close. It turns out though, that she was slower than Amie at the first six seconds. Next was Anna's turn for Sting. Anna ran very fast, and ploughed her head through the net before finishing. Last was Jake for Claw. Jake went very fast, and even though he got stuck in the net, he didn't run out of breath and finished with a time of 31 seconds. The final results were Amie on 4th place, Sammy and Anna tied 2nd place and Jake in 1st place, meaning that Claw won the round, and had a choice from one of the ten players from Sting to play for.
Claw decided to steal Olivia, who would be their prize if they win Ultimate Jeopardy. The first team to start in Ultimate Jeopardy was Claw with Tara and Ayla. They ran until they got to the scramble net and the boulder hit them. Next was Olivia and Lizzy for Sting. Sting also got to the scramble net and were hit. On Claw's second go, Tara and Ayla were very close to the boulder and at one point, it hit Tara's rear. She and Ayla didn't know this and they ran straight on to the end. In Sting's second run, Olivia had let go of the totem pole at one point leaving Lizzy carrying it by herself until they got to the scramble net, they also made it to the end.
It turned out that Claw was disqualified for not stopping when the boulder hit Tara, and Sting was disqualified when Lizzy and Olivia were both not holding on to the totem pole, which made the results determined by their first run. The winners were Sting, because they were further in the scramble net than Claw, so Sting kept Olivia and the team celebrated back at camp.
Day 14 (Episode 27 and 28).
At the Island Fire the previous night, Alex T from Claw used his Power Play, Freeze for Vertigo.
In the first round, both teams were having trouble getting their ladder upright. Cai was the climber for Sting and Jake was Claw's climber. Jake was the first person to undo a flag, but Cai shortly caught up, while Claw were having problems of their own. Later on, Sting had pulled down their fourth flag, Alex T shouted Freeze, and Sting stopped for twenty seconds, while Claw caught up, though Jake was a little slow from going now the ladder. Soon later, Sting had untied all their flags and were getting ready to hit their skull and Claw were almost about to do the same. Jake and Cai were both swinging everywhere on the top of the ladders while the other team members tried to keep their climber still. Just as Claw was close to hitting their skull, Jake fell off the ladder, and there wasn't enough time for him to get back up as Cai managed to hit the team skull meaning Sting had won the first round, and they had a choice of one of Claw's six members. Meanwhile, the other members of Claw were watching and thought that Jake's last fall looked as if he did it on purpose and they thought he was going up the ladder rather slowly.
At Sting's camp, while the team were packing up their luggage for going back home, Alex Y and Lachlan were both arguing over who owned a piece of rope. Olivia decided to settle this and made them do tug-of-war over the rope. The boys were pulling the rope until Lachlan decided to let go, which made Alex Y fall over and win. Lachlan didn't really care anymore because it was only a piece of rope.
After some members of Claw noticed Jake's movements in the first round of Vertigo thinking he was losing on purpose, Olivia noted that Jake did say to some members of her team that he originally wanted to be in Sting. Jake truthfully denied that he was losing on purpose, and said that the challenge was really hard and he was not good with heights. Both teams did not realise this.
After winning the first round, Sting chose Jake to steal from Claw. Before Ultimate Jeopardy, because Claw had six members and there needed to be four players in the challenge, Ayla, Livvi and Sammy had to take part, and captain Alex T was forced to do the challenge again. Sting's captain Cameron on the other hand chose Alex Y, Amie, Lachlan and Lizzy.
In Ultimate Jeopardy, Alex Y was the climber for Sting while Sammy was the climber for Claw. Neither of the teams ladders fell over and the climbers didn't fall off. Both teams were almost neck and neck, but Sammy was much faster, ripping off the flags as she went, while Alex Y was a little slower. Soon, Sammy had got rid of Claw's flags and was ready to hit the team skull. Alex Y was also ready to hit Sting's skull shortly after. Despite having slight wobbles, Sammy got up to the top of the ladder and hit the team skull, meaning Claw had won the challenge, and successfully defending Jake.
Back at camps, Sting discussed that they needed to have a lot of rest before the final challenge. Claw on the other hand, thought that their team had a slight advantage of escaping Scorpion Island because they would be able to communicate more than Sting with their small number of players, as well as thinking Sting did not work well together.
At the Island Fire, J.K. and Joel told the teams that there were no more chances to steal players, and that the final teams were locked in. The final captains were voted by the teams themselves. Olivia was the captain for Sting and Sammy was the captain for Claw.
Day 15 (Episodes 29 and 30).
Because of her leg injury, Livvi from Claw would not be able to take part in the first round of Torrent of Terror, so one rope was removed from the eight ropes Claw had to move up.
In the first round, both teams were fighting against the water being splashed at them as they pulled their ropes up. Claw had the first rope up to the top, and Sting's Lachlan and Alex Y helped each other bringing Sting's first rope, before a flood came sliding them down. Tara from Claw found an easier way to pull the ropes up, going by the side of the mountain avoiding the floods for her team. Claw was leading but Sting was not far behind. Both teams had massive tumbles sliding down the mountain to pull their next ropes. Soon, some large rocks came rolling towards the teams. One rock smacked straight into Jack's face from Sting. Everyone was very tired but kept moving. When both teams had five ropes up the hill, a massive flood came and pushed some of Sting's members into a huge pile. Claw took the lead again and with their strength, pulled their 7th rope to the top making them win the first round. Sting kept on going, because Claw had got a time advantage the longer Sting took to finish, and used Claw's method of going up the side of the hill. Sting finally got all their eight ropes to the top of the hill, with Claw getting a 59 second advantage from them for the next round.
In the next phase of the challenge, the teams were hauling the ropes to pull their raft equipment up the hill. Both teams were working on a pulling rhythm, but with Sting's larger numbers, they were much faster than Claw and got their raft equipment up first. Sting also managed to decrease the time advantage to 31 seconds.
In the last stage, Claw tried to make the most of the time advantage as they assembled their raft, but there was no communication. Sting were then able to start. They ended up having arguments with each other as captain Olivia was shouting the orders, partially at Lizzy. Claw soon started work on their sail with Sting shortly following. Then, both teams had finished their rafts at the same time, but with wind approaching, they were forced to take down their masts. The teams were almost neck and neck, but with Claw's chanting and paddling, they were slightly ahead, while Sting had no communication, and no one was paddling in time. Claw kept working together, until they got to the pontoon with captain Sammy pushing the detonator claiming victory. Team Claw had escaped from Scorpion Island.
A luxurious boat then came to take Claw home. Sting went back to the beach and watched in disappointment. They said they didn't have good teamwork and were disappointed with themselves. Meanwhile, as the boat was taking Claw home, they were giving the chance to phone their parents.
Winners.
Claw had been the weaker team from the start and had a lot of bad luck. Time and time again they lost consecutive challenges and sacrificed three players: Ollie, Lizzy and Amie. The team were leading at one stage but Sting had a big comeback and led by 4 members. Although it was impossible for Claw to catch up, they tried to steal members from Sting but failed. They even almost fell apart when they were about to lose Jake to Sting because of his thought, 'betrayal' on his team. In spite of all these, they kept it together and proved Sting wrong with the way they handle the last challenges. Claw won the first challenge and made use of their head start for the last leg of the race. They did show teamwork, determination, and they didn't look at their team number but had their eye on the prize - which is ultimately escaping the island. They won and showed Sting what a team is made of. Sting members were also aware of this and could only wish for them to change how they worked and handled everything.

Since 2001 Ueberschall has concentrated on virtual loop libraries, as well as software-based virtual instrument plug-ins based upon the Virtual Studio Technology standards known as VST 2.0 and the more recent VST 3.0. Ueberschall's audio sample libraries are compatible with any system capable of reproducing at least one of the product-supplied sound sample formats, such as WAV, REX, AIF, while their proprietary software-based loop and sample players, using Ueberschall's own proprietary audio format, are compatible with any professional or semi-professional Digital Audio Workstation systems that support the VST 2.0 or 3.0 standard.
Ueberschall and Celemony (the makers of Melodyne) created the Liquid Instrument Series, which uses a proprietary sample file format for audio reproduction, while also allowing those same files to be rendered within the program to convert them to a standard WAV format if desired. Their second player, called Elastik, focuses on loop based libraries and different dance music styles and also uses a proprietary sample file format similar to the Liquid Instrument Series that can be rendered within the program to produce standard WAV files.

Mount Storm Wind Farm

The Mount Storm Wind Farm is located 120 miles west of Washington, D.C. in Grant County, West Virginia. The wind farm includes 132 Gamesa G80 wind turbines each with a two megawatt (MW) capacity along 12 miles of the Allegheny Front. Construction of the wind farm began in 2006 and the project is now fully operational, generating up to 264 MW of electricity for the mid-Atlantic power grid. 
History.
Plans for the farm were first announced in 2001, when U.S. Wind Force filed for a permit with the West Virginia Public Service Commission to build a 166 turbine wind farm, which would have been the largest wind farm east of the Mississippi River. The project's backers hoped that the first turbines would be operational by late 2002 with the rest of the facility coming online in 2003, but opponents quickly raised objections, arguing that the project would threaten birds and diminish home values in the surrounding area.
In May 2002, the Public Service Commission approved U.S. Wind Force's permit application without any significant opposition. The company also reached an agreement with the AFL-CIO to use union labor in the construction of the facility. At the hearings for the permit, speakers in favor of the project included Walt Helmick, a member of the West Virginia Senate, Jeff Barger, the County Commissioner of Grant County, and Steve White a union leader. A study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the project posed little danger to local birds, clearing the way for construction.

<doc id="20657890" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20657890" title="Charles C. Walcutt">
Charles C. Walcutt

Charles Carroll Walcutt (February 12, 1838 – May 2, 1898) was an American surveyor, soldier, and politician. He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, in which he was wounded twice.
After the war, Walcutt was warden of the Ohio State Penitentiary and also was active in civic affairs in Ohio, and his death was attributed to his wounds from the Civil War.
Early life and career.
Charles Carroll Walcutt was born in 1838 in the city of Columbus, located in Franklin County, Ohio. He was a son of John M. Walcutt, a chair maker, and Mariel Broderick, and had three sisters, one of whom was named Virginia. Walcutt's maternal grandmother was also a first cousin of Davy Crockett. Both his father (War of 1812) and grandfather (American Revolution) had served the United States in combat.
Walcutt received his initial education in the Columbus-area schools, and then in 1854 entered the Kentucky Military Institute in Lyndon, Kentucky. He graduated in June 1858, indenting to become a civil engineer, and he was elected Franklin County's surveyor the following year. Walcutt married Phebe Neill in 1860. She was born in Belfast, Ireland, and was a daughter of Hugh Neill, who had served as an officer in the British Army. The couple would have three children together, sons named J. Macy, Sherman, and Charles Carroll Jr., who later would serve in the 8th U.S. Cavalry as regimental quartermaster.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began in 1861, Walcutt chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. On April 15 he organized a company of soldiers in Columbus, was appointed its captain on April 17, and went into camp with them the next day. However, Ohio's quota had already been met and Walcutt's company was rejected for Federal use. That June he was appointed a major in the state forces and served on the staff of Brig. Gen. Charles W. Hill in what is now West Virginia.
That fall Walcutt helped raise and train the 46th Ohio Infantry. He was appointed to the Union Army as a major in that regiment on October 1, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 30, 1862. Walcutt reported to Paducah, Kentucky, for duty that February, and in March he went with the army up the Tennessee River. The 46th Ohio saw its first combat on April 6 during the Battle of Shiloh. In this fight Walcutt was hit in his left shoulder, and the bullet would remain there for the rest of his life.
Walcutt was promoted to colonel on October 16, 1862, and given command of the 46th Ohio. He led his regiment in the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi from December 1862 until July 1863. During the campaign, Walcutt fought in the Union victory at the Battle of Jackson on May 14. He then fought with distinction in the Battle of Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga, Tennessee, on November 23–25. When Brig. Gen. John M. Corse was seriously wounded, command of his brigade fell to Walcutt, who led it and held "against repeated charges by superior numbers." After the fight his overall commander, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, praised Walcutt's efforts in his official report and recommended a promotion. In the report Sherman stated:
The entire brigade re-enlisted on January 5, 1864, an action that highly pleased Walcutt. After leaving Chattanooga, he continued to lead the brigade and fought in the Atlanta Campaign that summer. Walcutt participated in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, and the Battle of Atlanta on July 22. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on July 30. Walcutt's home town newspaper gave this version of his efforts around Atlanta in his obituary:
Walcutt then participated in the March to the Sea in November and December 1864. He again fought with distinction at the Battle of Griswoldville on November 22, and was again wounded. His brigade of about 1,500 men moved to support Union cavalry and held a defensive position at Duncan's Farm against repeated attacks by ill-trained Confederate Georgia Militia. Combined Union losses in the fight were less than 100, including Walcutt, while the Confederates lost about 51 killed, 472 wounded, and around 600 missing or captured. Walcutt was wounded early in the action, and command of the brigade fell to Col. Robert F. Catterson of the 97th Regiment Indiana Infantry. Sherman would again praise him in his report, and Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard said of him "there is not a braver or better officer." He was hit in his right leg by a shell fragment, and would be out of action for months.
On April 4, 1865, Walcutt was recovered enough to command the 1st division of the XIV Corps, leading it in the grand review in Washington, D.C., until June 12. After hostilities ended he led his command to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out of the volunteer service that August. For his actions at Griswoldville he was appointed to the rank of brevet major general. Walcutt served in the western department until he was mustered out of the Union Army on January 15, 1866.
Postbellum career.
After the war Walcutt went home, where he was warden of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus in 1866. On July 28 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, and proceeded to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to report for duty. He resigned on December 1, 1866, "unwilling to endure army life in time of peace." Walcutt returned to Ohio and again worked as a warden until 1869.
Walcutt was also active in politics in Ohio, and was one of Ulysses S. Grant's electors in 1868. In May he was appointed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service collector for the 7th district of Ohio by President Grant, which he held until July 1, 1883. In 1872 Walcutt was elected to the Columbus board of education, with seven years as its president, until April 1, 1894. Also in 1872 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In April 1883 he was elected mayor of Columbus, elected to a second term, and retired in April 1887. His wife Phebe died the following year.
In 1898 Walcutt was in Omaha, Nebraska, heading back to Ohio after visiting Mexico with his sister Virginia "for his health." There his condition worsened, and he stayed in Omaha for about six weeks. Ten days before his death doctors amputated one of his limbs. His body was brought back to Ohio and was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus.

Tiv Ta'am

Tiv Ta'am (, "best taste") is an Israeli supermarket chain. There are 32 Tiv Ta'am supermarkets throughout Israel, in addition, the company is involved in food processing and production, and telecommunications. The chain is notable for being Israel's largest store selling pork and other non-kosher products, and for most branches being open on Shabbat (Saturday), and holidays (except Yom Kippur). In addition, it is Israel's largest producer and supplier of non-kosher meat. 
History.
Tiv Ta'am was founded by Kobi Tribitch and in 1990. Today, the supermarket is a national chain. In addition to the supermarkets throughout Israel, Tiv Ta'am is also involved in food processing and production, which include meat processing, hot dogs, chicken, fish, seafood, dried fruits, cheeses and wine, and telecommunication, which includes the import, market, and distribution of telecommunication switchboards. However, in 2007, Tiv Ta'am sold its holding in Satcom Ltd., a telecommunication satellite company and in September 2008, Tiv Ta'am sold its holdings in Tadiran Telecom.
Potential sale.
In June 2007 a lot of news was made and uproar among certain segments of the Israeli public, when Arcadi Gaydamak, Israeli businessman, made an offer to purchase the company and making a public commitment to turn the supermarket kosher and stop selling pork. He also said that he would make Mizra, the factory which produces pork products for Tiv Ta'am, supply chicken instead of pork.
A few days later, the deal collapsed, when it became apparent that is was unfeasible to turn the supermarket kosher in addition that Kobi Tribitch, refused to knock off $10 million from the purchase price. It was unfeasible to turn it kosher because Mizra had a contract with Tiv Ta'am that allowed it to sell pork, and some analysts believed Gaydamak realized most of Tiv Ta'am's customers shop there because it is not kosher.
Controversy.
Controversy was created in 2006 when Israeli investigative affairs show Kolbotek (similar to the United States program 60 Minutes) alleged that Tiv Ta'am was selling meat after its expiration date. In 2007, Kolbotek showed video of cats roaming one of Tiv Ta'am's storerooms and eating food, prompting Tiv Ta'am to spend $500,000 in an ad campaign to improve its image.
The chain has also been criticized by Ultra-Orthodox Jews for selling non-kosher products such as pork, with many boycotting the chain.

The 2009 Fujitsu V8 Supercars season was the tenth running of the V8 Supercar Development series. It supported the 2009 V8 Supercar Championship Series, beginning on 19 March at the Clipsal 500 and ending on 6 December at the Sydney 500 after seven rounds.
With one race to spare, Jonathon Webb secured the championship, in doing so becoming the first driver from MW Motorsport to win the title after having competed in the very first championship for second-tier V8 Supercars. James Moffat took second place from David Russell at the final race of the season. Ford drivers filled the top seven places with Grant Denyer, Daniel Gaunt, Brad Lowe and Damian Assaillit filling those positions. The first Holden driver was Sam Walter, over 900 points behind Webb.
Webb did not win a race until the fifth round of the series at Queensland Raceway, but from there won every race bar one, where he was second, an irresistible charge for the championship that neither Moffat nor Russell had any answer to after the three drivers had been close for the first half of the season.

Bo Christian Larsson

Bo Christian Larsson (born 1976 in Kristinehamn, Sweden) is a Swedish artist who works mostly with large-sized drawings, installations, performances and objects. 1994-98 he studied at AKI Academy of Visual Arts in Enschede, Holland. 1997 he was an exchange student at Western Australia's College of Fine Arts in Perth, Australia. 2004-2008 he lived and worked in Munich, Germany, and since November 2008 he lives in Hamburg, where he achieved the Philipp Otto Runge Scholarship for one year.
Artistic Practice.
Drawings.
Drawing is for Larsson the start of the whole creative process. The act of drawing as a physical experience plays a big role in his practice. It is almost as if Larssons drawings would suggest a parallel existence, a mystical world of recognizable symbols and elements slightly tilted to create something obviously unknown.
The drawings are works on their own, but Larsson also says that ""the big drawings mostly work as blueprints for the installations and performances. My installations are mostly like my drawings just in 3D and the performances are like the act of drawing just with an audience"."
Performances and Installations.
Almost all of Larsson's installations are the results of a performance or happening. The essential elements and structures in the installations are prepared and specified, and the performance is an act of spontaneous action within this controlled space. A recurring component is a black wig hiding Larsson's face, creating a sort of artificial blindness and darkness guiding the view to the inside, to the essential.
For Larsson everything has its origin in the darkness, where the human spirit develops - and in this case, free from the apparent reality because of the reduced visual perception.
In his performances Larsson shows his point of view on the world's prevailing conditions and his animadversion on them. For the viewer he creates an area for own connotations and projections upon the earthly circumstances.
In Larsson's performances he often uses the following recurring protagonists:
Objects.
The objects result almost every time as a result out of a performance and can be looked upon as debris of, or merchandise for, these actions.
The objects also close the circle of Larsson's creative process.

<doc id="20658150" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20658150" title="Solomon Male">
Solomon Male

Moses Solomon Male (pronounced 'mal-eh') is a pastor in Uganda, and Executive Director of Arising For Christ. He is an outspoken critic of corruption in churches, especially those that promote prosperity theology which he calls "the gospel of extortion".
He also opposes the occult (magic, witchcraft, divination and necromancy) and homosexuality; and cares for victims of paedophilia and sexual abuse. 
Male was born on 17 August 1962, and converted to Christianity on 31 October 1987. In 1988 he became one of the ministers of a church, Holy Church of Christ, "New Chapter" renamed The Synagogue Church of All Nations, whose leaders and members are followers of John Obiri Yeboah, a Ghanain-born former Catholic priest who came to Uganda. Male left that church in 1992, denouncing it as a cult. In 1993 Male was arrested as a result of his accusations against the church, but he was later released and the case was withdrawn. Male then began an evangelistic ministry to help people who had suffered abuse from cults or occult groups. 
In 1999 he founded Arising for Christ (ARCH), an Christian organisation whose leadership wants to restore "the sanctity of Christ and to rid the Church of fake and selfish people who carry themselves as pastors to con the desperate and unsuspecting public." The organisation claimed in January 2008 to have compiled a list of 300 believers who accuse born-again pastors of extortion, fraud, sex slavery and other crimes.
In an interview with the "Financial Times", Male claimed to be following Martin Luther who centuries before had railed against vice, luxury and corruption among his fellow clergy. He compares the manipulation of sick people, into paying for prayers, to the sale of indulgences:
"The man who stood against the evil in the church was Martin Luther, because he was against the selling of worthless objects which were to save you from hell. The moment he started the Protestant movement, it gave hope that when something is wrong, there is the possibility of setting it right."
Campaigns and prominent casework.
Frances Adroa, an HIV / AIDS patient, in July 2005 was coerced to surrender her car to the leaders of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in Kampala in return for promises to heal her of AIDS during the church's Mount Sinai Campaign. She was not cured. During deterioration of her health condition, she demanded back her car. The church leaders, Bishop Gilson Costa and Pastor Gerald Nkayi claimed 2 million Ugandan shillings (over US$1,200), allegedly for its repairs, which she did not have.
On 17 March 2007, she heard Pastor Male on the radio and later called him for an appointment to tell him how she had lost her car. When he confronted the church leaders, they eventually returned it in its damaged condition. 
When Male publicised the car return in newspapers and other media in 2007, the leaders sued him and Adroa for defamation. The libel claim failed in 2010, and both sides were left to bear their own costs. Adroa had counterclaimed for repairs to the car, but this also failed, as the magistrate did not want to create a precedent for donors to ask for their gifts back if prayers were not fulfilled.
Solomon Male campaigns for greater financial accountability in churches. He says that the practice of giving land, cars or household goods to pastors in exchange for blessings, known as "sowing seeds of faith", is widespread in Uganda, and is generally not included in the churches' accounts. He reports that such donations are not even reported to boards or auditors, but are treated as the personal income of the pastors. Following up his report, the newspaper "Sunday Vision" checked the accounts of twelve Pentecostal churches, some of which were known for the practice; none declared any income from "sowing", and despite receiving billions of shillings, only Kampala Pentecostal Church and Redeemed Church had their accounts professionally audited.
Male sought a judicial investigation into the case of Susan Walusimbi, who was encouraged by a former pastor to enter into a relationship with a man whom the church claimed to have cured of AIDS. Walusimbi says the man later died of AIDS; she is now HIV positive herself, and using anti-retroviral drugs to stay healthy.
In 2009 Male was one of a group of pastors who received, counselled and supported young men who accused megachurch pastor Robert Kayanja of sodomizing them. A police investigation cleared Kayanja, but Male insisted that the case was mishandled and urged the President to investigate the matter.
On 22 December 2010, Police arrested Pastor Moses Solomon Male and one of his lawyers, Henry Ddungu to allegedly make additional statements. After failing to secure sanctioning of the charges, they were released. They never made the purported additional statements.
On 3 October 2012, six people were fined sh1m each and ordered to do 100 hours of community service after being convicted of conspiring to destroy Pastor Robert Kayanja's name and profession. All six convictions are currently under appeal.
In 2013, he opposed the divorce and remarriage of Bishop David Kiganda, branding it to be contrary to Biblical teaching.
Responses from others.
Responding to such allegations, Pentecostal pastor Bishop David Kiganda, Kampala district chairman of the National Fellowship of Born Again Churches, says that only a minority of Pentecostal pastors are involved in questionable activities. He and the National Fellowship ran a program called Operation Clean the House to exclude dishonest preachers from the denomination, and declared 15 of their fellow churches to be "cults."
The National Fellowship publicly disowned Male in 2006. He replied with an open letter denouncing their "patriarch" John Obiri Yeboah and other leading figures.
In 2009 a group of pastors from four Pentecostal groups denounced Male as an "accuser of brethren who speaks without authority".

Spud Flogsoss was the main character featured in the cartoon series comic "The Adventures Of Spud", published monthly in (the now defunct) "Hot Metal" magazine between 1992 and 1997 and created by Australian comic strip artist and illustrator James Dunlevie.
Story.
The comic followed Spud, an adolescent metal-head (heavy metal fan) and his group of friends as they made their way through life in a non-descript urban environment. The cartoon featured occasional cameo appearances by heavy metal music personalities and others. The series ran for six years and spawned a similar cartoon, "Rufus, Floyd and Aero", which appeared in the UK heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer.
A fondly remembered edition of 'Spud' featured Australian television 'lifestyle gardener' Don Burke visiting the group's abode and discovering what he believes to be "tomato" plants in the back yard; Burke then receives spikes through his feet from hidden booby-traps guarding a marijuana plantation.

Paskal Mitrevski

Paskal Mitrevski "()" (1912–1978), also known as Paskal Mitrovski or Paschalis Mitropoulos, was a Greek-born partisan from the Greek province of Macedonia (Aegean Macedonian) and former President of the Macedonian National Liberation Front.
Early life.
Mitrevski was born in the Kastorian village of Čuka (Chuka) renamed "Arhangelos".
Involvement with the National Liberation Front.
In 1943 Mitrevski joined the Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front until it was disbanded in 1944. On April 23, 1945 he founded the "Narodno Osloboditelen Front" or National Liberation Front (NOF) along with Mihajlo Keramitčiev, Georgi Urdov, Atanas Korovešov, Pavle Rakovski and Minčo Fotev. He soon became the representative of NOF to the Greek Communist Party (KKE) and Democratic Army of Greece. On September 13, 1946, Mitrevski wrote a letter in which he stated "We did not leave a single issue unresolved or in the dark" in regards to the Macedonian issue and the existence of the National Liberation Front. By this time Mitrevski had entered talks with Markos Vafiadis regarding the complete merger of the Communist Party and the National Liberation Front. This was achieved but the National Liberation Front remained a semi-autonomous entity within the KKE.
Mitrevski was a staunch supporter of the NOF and criticised the regional leadership of the KKE. Eventually a rift occurred between Mitrevski and Mihajlo Keramitčiev and many factions of the National Liberation Front were divided. This was in turn over the dismissal of NOF leaders such as Vangel Ajanovski-Oče and Lambro Colakov from the Executive Council by General Ioannidis. In turn this matter was taken to the Politburo of the party on February 20–21, 1948 where Mitrevski and the leader of the "Anti-Fascist Women's Front" "()", Vera Nikolova, publicly criticised each other. As it was obvious that the party was in serious internal strife, Mitrevski proposed that Stavros Kochopoulos become leader of the party rather than Mihajlo Keramitčiev, who had the support of rival factions. Soon mistrust and suspicion grew about Mitrevski's role in NOF and the Communist Party. Many claimed that he was "motivated solely by his own personal ambitions". He attended the general meeting of the politburo on July 10 which adopted a motion denouncing the NOF and indirectly the Macedonian contribution to the war effort; Mitrevski refuted these claims but to no avail. The fits which had occurred between him and Keramitčiev was seen as potentially fatal to the party and he was removed as leader of NOF on August 8, 1948. Stavros Kochopoulos officially became president while Vangel Kojčev was made secretary. By December, however, it had been decided by Nikos Zachariadis that the membership of the secretariat should be expanded and Mitrevski was reinstated. On the initiative of Zachariadis, Mitrevski was reinstated as President of the National Liberation Front on April 1, 1949.
Minister in the Provisional Government.
Four days after his reinstatement as President of the National Liberation Front on April 5, 1949, Paskal Mitrevski was appointed as the Minister for Food in the Provisional Government along with Krste Kačev who was appointed as the Director of National Minorities in the Ministry of the Interior. By mid 1949 only one of the three major factions in the NOF was in support of Mitrevski. After the collapse of the Democratic Army of Greece, Mitrevski fled to Bureli, Albania. He was arrested on October 3, 1948 on accusations that he was an "agent of Tito".

Fuerte de Lonquén

Fuerte de Lonquén () was a fort built in 1602 by Governor Alonso de Ribera on the south bank of the Lonquén River nine kilometers from the Itata River. It was established to protect the grain fields and cattle of the local estancias that fed Ribera's Spanish army on La Frontera. Years later a town was established at this point called "Nombre de Jesús". By the late 19th century there was only a small village called Lonquén located on the site a few kilometers northwest of the town of Treguaco in the commune of that name in Ñuble Province of the Bío Bío Region of Chile.

Nome (spiritual teacher and author)

Nome (born January 23, 1955) is a spiritual teacher at Society of Abidance in Truth, known by the acronym SAT, which established and maintains a temple for nondual Self-knowledge in California. He expounds the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi and Advaita Vedanta. He, along with Dr. H. Ramamoorthy, translated into English the essential and classic work of Advaita Vedanta, "Ribhu Gita", which was highly recommended by Sri Ramana Maharshi. The English translation has been published by Society of Abidance in Truth and has since then been re-published by Sri Ramanasramam (Tiruvannamalai, India) and translated into Hindi and Italian.
Teachings.
Nome teaches Advaita Vedanta, especially as is contained in the teachings of "Bhagavan" Sri Ramana Maharshi. These teachings are those found in traditional Advaita Vedanta as expounded by Adi Sankaracharya, Ribhu, and the Upanishads and are concerned with Self-Knowledge, or Self-Realization as it is often referred to, and with the spiritual practice of Self-inquiry. 
The teachings are presented in Satsangs and retreats held at the SAT Temple. Nome has also given satsangs at Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning in Bangalore. In March 1995, Nome discoursed at the Ramana Maharshi National Seminar conducted in Bangalore.
At the invitation of Sri. V. S. Ramanan, President of Sri Ramanasramam, Nome spoke at the centennial celebrations of the advent of Sri Ramana Maharshi at Arunachala, on the morning of September 1, 1996 at Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, India. Nome’s discourse actually commenced with silence, which was followed by a brief talk on the direct experience of Self-Knowledge as revealed by Sri Ramana Maharshi.
Writings and translations.
Nome is also a translator and author of Vedanta texts. Very much of the translation work, from Sanskrit and Tamil into English, was performed in close collaboration with the late Dr. H. Ramamoorthy, a foremost Sanskrit scholar and expert in Tamil, from 1989 to 2001. Among his writings and translations are:
Practice.
Nome's inner journey is written in the article "Timeless Presence". It was written at the request of Sri V. S. Ramanan, President of Sri Ramanasramam in 1996 for the book, “Centenary Souvenir Commemorating the Advent of Bhagavan Sri Ramana at Arunachala,” which was released on September 1, 1996. The article has since been re-published by Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning and SAT. The book describes the timeless presence of Sri Ramana Maharshi and Nome's practice of Self-inquiry for his steady abidance in Self-Realization.
Biography.
Though he is generally known in the USA, India, and elsewhere simply by the single name “Nome,” he is also known as I. Nome, I. M. Nome, and somewhat more rarely and primarily in India as Master Nome. Nome is married. His wife, known as Sasvati, is involved in many of the publications mentioned above in the form of writing prefaces and the design and layout work for the books.

Commissaire de police

Commissaire de police is a rank in the French National Police. Every commune with a population of more than 30,000-50,000 has a "commissaire" in charge of its police force and larger communes have more than one (the Prefecture of Police of Paris has well over one hundred). The "commissaire" has both an administrative role and an investigative role, and unlike many junior officers has full police powers.
Most officers join directly at the rank of "commissaire". All are university graduates, usually in law, and have completed a further training course. It is also possible for junior officers to be promoted to the rank (something which was virtually impossible until relatively recently). A "commissaire" may be promoted to "commissaire principal" (abolished in 2006) and "commissaire divisionnaire" (a rank which existed in the Paris Police and the Mobile Brigades from the early 20th century), and thence to the higher ranks of the service.
The police station which serves as the "commissaire's" headquarters and the area for which he is responsible is known as the "commissariat", a term which can also refer to the body of "commissaires" as a whole.
"Commissaire" is often translated into English as commissioner, commissar, or commissary, although the "commissaire" also has judicial powers which the British police officer does not have.. A british "Superintendant" is rather a lower rank officer called in France "Capitaine" or "Commandant" (captain, major, commander).
History.
The "commissaires" originated in Paris as the 48 "commissaires enquêteurs-examinateurs" of the Grand Châtelet.
Long before 1667, they had served as all-purpose agents of the Châtelet in the various quarters of Paris. But by choice and economic compulsion, they had increasingly forsaken their role of watchdogs of public security and had become somewhat discredited fee-grabbers, mainly concerned with such matters as imposing seals on the property of the deceased, taking legal inventories, serving summonses, and imposing a wide variety of
fines on which they collected a lucrative percentage.
The first Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, tried to reform the "commissaires", persuading the king to increase salaries and retirement benefits and restore honors formerly attached to the office in the hopes of weaning them off the corrupting system of fees, but it was "a losing battle. In 1699 the old fee system was
restored in the manner long demanded by the "commissaires"."
Whatever the shortcomings of the forty-eight "commissaires", they remained the backbone of public order in Paris. Several kinds of armed, uniformed patrolmen theoretically circulated around the streets of Paris ... but in time of trouble the "commissaire's" house (practically all seventeenth-century officials did their work from their residences) loomed as large as Gibraltar. Ordinarily, a criminal case began with someone knocking on the door of the nearest "commissaire" and lodging a complaint against a fellow citizen. The "commissaire's" address was well known to residents of his quartier, and he was supposed to be available day and night to hear grievances and settle disputes. ... Each "commissaire" was assigned several "sergents" or "huissiers" to assist him in carrying out his civil duties — the only duties most "commissaires" really cared about, since they carried the most lucrative fees.
In the mid-eighteenth century, the "commissaires" "generally enjoyed the confidence of the people." Each of them was based in a particular area of the city and thus knew and was known to the local citizens; they were generally "well educated, usually with legal training, and their job was not only to keep order but also to protect public health and safety... The commissaires also played an important role as local notables. They convened meetings of inhabitants to elect people to look after the streetlights. They responded to public complaints about antisocial behavior..." They "returned to their owners goods that had been pawned at usurious rates of interest" and witnessed statements and complaints. "All of these matters gave the commissaire a very particular relationship with the public. He was, in a sense, at their service."
The "commissaires de police" became the linchpin of France’s urban police system after the French Revolution. "By the early years of the Restoration of
the monarchy, most towns with more than five thousand inhabitants, as well as smaller municipalities on important trade routes or near frontiers, had at least one CP."
Before the creation of the National Police in 1941, every commune with a population of more than 5,000 had to have a "commissaire" by law, every commune with a population of more than 10,000 had to have two, and for every additional 10,000 people there had to be an additional "commissaire". In a commune with more than one "commissaire", the most senior, who acted as chief of police, was called the "commissaire central".
The Paris Prefecture of Police had one "commissaire" for each "quartier", plus one for each of the larger suburban communes in the Department of the Seine; the smaller suburban communes were grouped together under "commissaires". There were also additional "commissaires" commanding specialist units in the Judicial Police. The Paris "commissaire" began his professional life as a "secrétaire suppléant" (assistant secretary), from which he was promoted, usually after about eighteen months if there was a vacancy, to "secrétaire de police" (secretary of police). Each "commissaire" was assisted by one of each of these officers. A "secrétaire" had to pass an examination for promotion to "commissaire".
The Mobile Brigades of the Sûreté, formed in 1907, also used the rank of "commissaire".

Folk, Blues and Beyond

Folk, Blues and Beyond is the second studio album by British musician Davey Graham, originally released in 1965.
It has been considered Graham's most groundbreaking and consistent work and a defining record of the 20th century. It has also been a primary influence on some of the most popular musicians in Britain ranging from Bert Jansch to Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton. 
His first album, "The Guitar Player", was almost exclusively jazz based. He was also known for his collaborations with folksinger Shirley Collins, which had established his name in the purist folk communities in Britain. 
In his Allmusic review, critic Richie Unterberger stated "This was Graham's most groundbreaking and consistent album. More than his solo debut The Guitar Player (which was pretty jazzy) or his previous collaboration with folk singer Shirley Collins, Folk Roots, New Routes, this established his mixture of folk, jazz, blues, and Middle Eastern music, the use of a bassist and drummer also hinting at (though not quite reaching) folk-rock. "Leavin' Blues," "Skillet (Good'n'Greasy)," and "Moanin'" are all among his very best folk-blues-rock performances, while on "Maajun" he goes full-bore into Middle Eastern music on one of his most haunting and memorable pieces. Covers of traditional folk standards like "Black Is the Colour of My True Love's Hair" and "Seven Gypsies" combine with interpretations of compositions by Bob Dylan ("Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"), Willie Dixon ("My Babe"), Charles Mingus ("Better Git in Your Soul"), and Reverend Gary Davis ("Cocaine") for an eclecticism of repertoire that wasn't matched by many musicians of any sort in the mid-'60s. If there is one aspect of the recording to criticize, it is, as was usually the case with Graham, the thin, colorless vocals. The guitar playing is the main attraction, though; it's so stellar that it makes the less impressive singing easy to overlook. Ten of the 16 songs were included on the compilation Folk Blues and All Points in Between, but Graham fans should get this anyway, as the level of material and musicianship is pretty high throughout most of the disc." 
Most of the tracks on the album are a fusion of traditional western folk/blues and Middle-Eastern music. This synthesis of world sounds was inspired by Grahams frequent traveling across the Asian continent from the early 1950s onward. 
Graham also utilizes jazz progressions to re-innovate and contemporize traditional sounds, especially on the blues tracks of the album. For example, the opening track is a cover of "Leavin' Blues", written by Lead Belly, which is a straightforward blues in C. Graham's version uses the DADGAD guitar tuning, and he speeds up the tempo to give it a more 'rocking' sound. His cover is also infused with an exotic, middle eastern sound, accredited to both the tuning and the exotic musical scales he uses throughout the song. 
In 2002, a remastered CD version of the album was released in the UK.

Chittarikkal

History and Etymology.
Chitarikaal was a small Hamlet connecting the mountain pathways linking the Thejaswini river jetty at Perumbatta to Cherupuzha and Pulingome, thus forming an important link from the coastal town of Nileshwaram to the further reaches of the Western Ghats. The area was surrounded by forests where the primary mode of agriculture was by shift farming known as "Ponamkrishi" and pepper cultivation. The place was used as a stopover while transporting the forest produce such as pepper to the coast. The name "Chitaari" means a storehouse for agricultural products-mainly rice-and "Kal" represents a specific location. So together "Chittarikkal" means "At Chittaari". The region was a part of the Dakhina Kannada District, headquartered at Mangalore under the Madras Presidency.
Post-independence and thereafter with the creation of linguistic states the region became a part of the Kannur district of Kerala and subsequently that of Kasaragod District. Post-independence there was a gradual migration of people from the southern districts of Kerala primarily because of the availability of cheap agricultural land. In the following years the pattern of agriculture shifted towards rubber and was pioneered by the migrants from the earstwhile thiruvithamkoor region. The overall development and economy of the region has witnessed a sea change over the years and now Chitarikaal boasts of reasonably modern facilities in terms of roads, electricity, educational institutions, medical facilities etc.
Chittarikkal attained most of its development after the migration of Christian farmers from Southern Districts like Kottayam and Idukki. This migration which is popularly known as 'Malabar Kudiyetam' happened in the 1950's and 1970's. The first educational institution in Chittarikkal was St:Thomas Lower Primary School which started on 30 June 1949 and became a High School in 4 July 1960. Now Chittarikal is home for two prestigious Schools, St Mary's English Medium High School and St Thomas Higher Secondary School. 'Elavunkal Hospital' takes care of the health need of people. Chittarikkal is home for St Thomas Forane Church and Lord Shiva Temple(Shiva Kshetram). Chittarikkal is a agricultural oriented village and main products are Rubber, Coconuts etc.

They established several Catholic Churches in and around Malom. Majority of them are small farmers and merchants.
Rubber is the main crop. Besides Tapioca, Arecanut, Cashew Pepper, Plantain, Ginger, Turmeric etc. are also produced.Price fluctuations in the markets affects the profitability of farming and the younger generation is generally reluctant to take up farming as their profession for livelihood.
Education.
The Biggest School in the village is Government Higher Secondary School Maloth Kasba.The school is situated in Vallikkadavu. It is one of the biggest schools in Kasaragod district in terms of the number of students.

Valiya Puncha, Venthamala, Konnakkad, Karuvankayam, Chully, Pullady, Padayankallu are the surrounding areas.The farmers and the merchants have to reach Malom to buy provisions and to sell their agricultural products. All these places are connected with rural roads, but in several places it is yet to be paved.Hence in Monsoons it is very difficult for the villagers to reach Malom. Valiya Puncha,pullady, Padayankallu and Venthamala are hilly areas which lies about 500 meters above the sea level. These places share their borders with the Karnataka forest.

Pikku Huopalahti

Pikku Huopalahti () is a neighbourhood of Helsinki between Mannerheimintie (the main entrance road to Helsinki) in the east and Huopalahdentie to its west. One can say roughly speaking that the neighborhood is bordered by the streets of Vihdintie and Läpinmäentie to the north, Mannerheimintie to the east, Huopalahdentie to the west, Kuusitie and Mäntytie on the southeast, and Paciuksenkatu to the immediate south. The neighborhood, which literally means 'Tiny Felt Bay', is named after a small bay that lies at the heart of the neighborhood, surrounded by a large park. This bay extends out to the Gulf of Finland. Most of the housing in Pikku Huopalahti is residential apartment building, primarily built in the 1980s and 1990s. Pikku Huopalahti is home to over 9000 people.
As a neighborhood of Helsinki, Pikku Huopalahti finds itself as a Sui generis. Helsinki's subdivision system uniquely divides Pikku Huopalahti as belonging to 3 separate city districts. The southern part belongs to the Meilahti district and is numbered 1505. The eastern part belongs to the Ruskeasuo district and is numbered 1602 and the rest of Pikku Huopalahti belongs to the Haaga district and is numbered 2916.
The headquarters of McDonald's Finland is located in Pikku Huopalahti on Paciuksenkatu, in a large cylindrical building noted for its austere yet futuristic style. 
The final stop on Helsinki's 10 tram is also located in Pikku Huopalahti. The 4 tram travels on Paciuksenkatu to the south of Pikku Huopalahti on its way to Munkkiniemi but never actually enters the neighborhood. 
The University of Helsinki has its Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine campus in the Pikku Huopalahti section of Ruskeasuo on Mannerheimintie. 
The neighborhood is also known as having a 'Legoland' effect because the buildings, mostly constructed in the past 20 years, all prominently display basic geometric patterns such as circles, squares, and triangles on the residential housing. Also, the use of light pastel colors, mostly white, light blue, and turquoise, make Pikku Huopalahti a very distinct neighborhood compared to the other neighborhoods to the north and west that have more traditional housing stock from the 1940s and 1950s. The architecture and urban layout is said to reflect criticisms of modernism present in the "Oulu school" of architecture often associated with Reima and Raili Pietilä.
City districts partly forming and/or surrounding Pikku-Huopalahti are Meilahti, Munkkiniemi, Munkkivuori, Niemenmäki, Etelä-Haaga and Ruskeasuo.

Apache Click

Apache Click is a modern page and component oriented web application framework for the Java language and is built on top of the Java Servlet API.
It is a free and open-source project distributed under the Apache license and runs on any JDK installation (1.5 or later).
Click graduated into an Apache top-level project in November 2009.
Overview.
The main design goals are simplicity, ease of use, performance and scalability. To achieve these goals Click leverages an intuitive page and component oriented design.
Pages and components provide good encapsulation of web concepts and enables rapid application development.
Click takes a pragmatic approach and expose few abstractions to learn and understand. The Java Servlet API is fully exposed to the developer which eases the upgrade path from an action based framework to a component based one.
Pages and components are developed in Java while templates can be written in Velocity, FreeMarker or JSP. Components know how to draw themselves alleviating developers from maintaining redundant markup.
A major difference between Click and other component oriented web frameworks is that Click is stateless by design, although stateful pages are supported.
Competing frameworks.
There are a number of other component oriented frameworks available for Java such as JSF, Tapestry, WebObjects and Apache Wicket.
Some developers prefer the more traditional action-based web frameworks including Apache Struts, Spring MVC, and Stripes.
Example.
A Hello World Click application, with four files:

Rishi (film)

Rishi is a 2001 Indian Tamil film, written and directed by Sundar C.. The film stars Sarath Kumar, Meena, Prakash Raj and Sanghavi in lead roles, has music scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja and was released on 16 February 2001. This movie did well and was a surprise hit.
Plot.
Rishi (Sarathkumar) is a professional thief working for Satya (Arun Pandiyan). On one of his missions, he happens to watch a minister (Devan) kill a television reporter who is about to expose him. Rishi takes off with a floppy the reporter hands to him before dying and the minister, naturally, wants it back. Things get confusing because of Velu (Sarathkumar), who looks like Rishi and gets into trouble. .Meanwhile, Rishi turns over a new leaf when one of his tasks ends up in a singer Nandhini (Sangavi) being blinded. He starts taking care of her but Sathya is unwilling to let him go. 
Rishi is suave, tough, a killer and the right hand of Sathya (Arun Pandian) the kingpin of the underworld. Velu is simple-minded, takes life easy and works for a moneylender. The 'Seth' lends money for buying cars, and Velu with friend Cheenu (Ramesh Khanna) persuades errant customers to either repay the dues or part with their cars. Complications arise when the paths of the duo cross, for Rishi and Velu are look-alikes.Only Indu (Meena) seems to have some family to speak of. The narration moves smoothly forward, Rishi and Velu leading their own lives. Then their paths cross, one is mistaken for the other,complications arise, the underworld gunning for Velu, while Velu's girlfriend Indu (Meena) seeing Rishi with Nandini (Sanghavi), berates Velu for his duplicity. 
Investigative journalist Hema gets hold of an incriminating floppy that would have sent Minister Devaraj (Devan) to the docks. She is shot dead, but prior to that she had handed the floppy to Rishi who happened to be around on one of his missions. But Rishi, for no convincing reason, neither bothers about the floppy nor about the murder. On another of his missions,nightclub dancer Nandini (Sanghavi) loses her eyesight in the shoot out. Rishi saves her life, finances for her eye operation, and turns her protector, knowing fully well that she could identify him and the rest of the gang. He even parts ways with mentor Sathya on the issue.
Velu meanwhile falls for sales girl Indu (Meena). Velu is puzzled when attacked by a gang who demand the floppy from him. And when Indu accuses him of having an affair with a girl she sees him in the hospital with, Velu visits the hospital and encounters Rishi. The duo strikes a good rapport. The pieces of the puzzle fall in place. Devaraj realizing that his ministerial position is shaky, kidnaps Nandini, and blackmails Rishi to kill the chief minister. But it is Velu who goes in his place. The scene where he tries to warn the security personnel about the assassination attempt, only to find that they too are part of the conspiracy, is taken straight from a Hollywood film. The movie ends rather abruptly, with Velu being shot and the C.M.'s (S.S.Rajendran) life being saved. 
Soundtrack.
The film score and soundtrack were composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, who teamed up with Sundar C. for the second time after "Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga". The soundtrack released in October 2000 and features 6 tracks overall with lyrics penned by Pazhani Bharathi, Pa. Vijay and producer Panju Arunachalam.
Trivia.
Rishi has to be the movie with the most of number of such inspirations packed into a single film. The main story of the hired killer blinding a singer and attempting to reform while falling in love with her is copied from John Woo's Hong Kong movie, which was dubbed into English as The Killer. The execution of the gunfight sequence at the club and the song sequence, where Sarathkumar watches the blind Sangavi sing, are lifted directly from that movie, though without the trademark style of the original. Sarath Kumar even carries a toothpick between his teeth, Chow Yun Fat-style!
Apart from this there are a whole lot of individual sequences that have been copied from Hollywood movies . There is a car crash and a scene where Sarath lights up a car from Payback, a fight aboard a truck followed by a chase from Lethal Weapon 4, an assassination setup from Nick of Time and the famous bullet-dodging scene from The Matrix (here Sarathkumar dodges a wooden plank).

Chadayamangalam

Details of Chadayamangalam.
Chadayamangalam named in remembrance of Nedila Paranthaka Nedumchadayan, who ruled chadayamangalam between 6th and 7th century AD.Paranthaka Nedumchadayan was a king of people, after relegated as out caste or untouchable (2). 
Chadayamangalam" or "Jadayumangalam" is historically an important place. It's a beautiful village lying between Kilimanoor and Kottarakara, 14 km away from Kilimanoor and 21 km from Kottarakara. It is situated on the South East side of Kottarakkara Taluk and this place is enriched with huge Black Rocks which attracts and fascinates everyone who looks upon them. Neighbouring towns are (Kadakkal) & (Ayoor) which is 8km, 3 km from Chadayamangalam Junction. This is one among the large block in the district with an area of 249.03 km2. Paddy, Coconut, Rubber, Tapioca, Pepper, Cashew Nut, Banana, Areca Nuts etc. are the major crops under cultivation in the block. Two industrial estate and five industrial co-operative Institutions are functioning here. Population is of 22,213. Panchayat includes Chithra, Kadakkal, Chadayamangalam, Ittiva, Velinalloor, Elamadu & Nilamel. Jatayu is the son of Aruna and nephew of Garuda who has the form of a vulture. When Ravana was on his way to Lanka on his flying chariot after abducting Sita, he encountered Jatayu. This noble souled bird could not bear to hear poor Sita's cry for help and got into a fight with the mighty Ravana. Ravana cut off Jatayu's wings and he collapsed. Jadayu Para is well known as a tourist destination and a place of pilgrimage. Right on top the rock the building of a huge functional sculpture of the Great Bird Jatayu is under way. An 18 ft high Statue of Lord Shri Rama Chandra is been constructed on the top of jadayupara.
Jatayu tourism.
A huge sculpture of a mythological bird from the Indian epic Ramayana is under construction at the top a Rock. The 200-foot long, 150-foot wide and 50-foot tall 'functional' sculpture of Jatayu will be built on a 1,000-foot tall rock at Chadayamangalam. This will have three storeys inside with other attractions including a museum and mini film theatre.
The form of the Bird would be lying on its back with a broken wing, raising its head. The visitors who enter the sculpture can literally have a Bird?s Eye View as Jatayu?s eyes are planned to be round windows opening out to the world. Once finished, Jatayu sculpture would be the biggest functional sculpture in the Asian continent. It can be termed as the tallest sculpture as well. The rock is ideal for trekking and can find lot of Tourists.
The news of this biggest functional sculpture which is been constructed is slowlyspreading. There are lots of Ayyappa Pilgrims who travel via Trivandrum and Kanyakumari towards Shabarimala. For the spiritual tourists from other states, Jatayu Rock can doubtlessly turn into a great attraction. It would be especially attractive to North Indian Pilgrims who are largely Ram devotees.

Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary

Vedanthankal Bird Sanctuary is a protected area located in the Kancheepuram District of the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The sanctuary is about from Chennai on National Highway 45 (NH45), south of Chengalpattu. More than 40,000 birds (including 26 rare species), from various parts of the world visit the sanctuary during the migratory season every year.
Vedanthangal is home to migratory birds such as pintail, garganey, grey wagtail, blue-winged teal, common sandpiper and the like.
Vedanthangal is the oldest water bird sanctuary in the country. Vedanthangal in Tamil language means 'hamlet of the hunter'. This area was a favourite hunting spot of the local landlords in the early 1700s. The region attracted a variety of birds because it was dotted with small lakes that acted as feeding grounds for the birds. Realising its ornithological importance, the British government undertook steps to develop Vedanthangal into a bird sanctuary as early as 1798. This was established in 1858 by the order of the Collector of Chingleput.
The best time to visit this sanctuary is from November to March. During this time, birds are seen busy building and maintaining their nests.
Villagers near this sanctuary are very concerned about the sanctuary and its winged residents, and they have taken many serious steps to avoid disturbance to the flow of birds.
History.
The Vedanthangal lake bird sanctuary has a tradition of the people actively protecting birds coming to the area since time immemorial. The local people understood the relationship between birds and the productivity of their crops even before the concept of wildlife conservation came into vogue. They knew that the bird droppings in the water created guano which acted as fertilizer. Towards the end of the 18th century local villagers complained to the collector of Chengalpet Lionel Palace, about the British soldiers shooting the birds. They demanded and obtained a 'Cowle' from the collector (Mr Place, Collector of Chingleput 1796-1798) to protect the birds. In 1936 the collector officially recognized the lake as a sanctuary. In 1962 it was given the legal status of reserved forest under the Madras Forest Act.
Several accounts of the sanctuary were published in the mid-19th Century.In 1936, the park was notified as a sanctuary, and in 1962, the Madras Forest Act legally accorded the status of a reserve forest to Vedanthangal. Ten years later, the place was declared as a wildlife sanctuary.
In the government order dated 8 July 1988, the area was declared as 'Vedanthangal Lake Bird Sanctuary', under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
In 1967, a rest house was constructed for the convenience of visiting inspecting officers and tourists.
The area had a compact grove of more than 500 "Barringtonia" trees earlier. An additional 100 trees were planted in 1973 and over 1,000 trees were planted in 1996.
Karikili Bird Sanctuary.
Karikili bird sanctuary is located at a distance of around 9 km from the Vedanthangal bird sanctuary. The best time for bird watching is in the morning.
Bird species.
The Vedanthangal lake bird sanctuary features thousands of birds coming from various countries, some of which can be easily identified. Some easily found bird species include Cormorants, Darter, Grebes, Large Egret, Little Egrets, Moorhen, Night Herons, Paddy Bird, Painted Stork, Pintails, Pond Heron, Sandpiper, Shovellers, Terns, White Ibis and many more. The migratory birds include Garganey Teals Canada, Snake Bird Sri Lanka, Grey Pelican Australia, Grey Heron Bangladesh, Open-billed Stork Bangladesh, Glossy Ibis Sri Lanka, Painted Stork Siberia, Spoonbill Burma and the Spot Bill Duck.
The Lake.
The Vedanthangal lake is situated 122 m above sea level. It supplies water to 250 acres of agricultural land around the area. The west and south sides of the lake are bordered by a long bund, whereas the northern and eastern sides extend to the agricultural lands. Input of water into this lake is through four small canals. Maximum depth of the lake is 5 meters. The area receives an average annual rainfall of 10 mm, mostly from the North-East monsoon.
Flora and fauna.
Flora: Barringtonia acutangula, Acacia nilotica, Alangium salviflorum trees and dry evergreen scrub and thorn forests.
Fauna: Monkeys and other common mammals can be spotted.
Avian-Fauna: Garganey teals, glossy ibis, grey heron, grey pelican, open-billed stork, painted stork,vsnake bird, spoonbill, spot bill duck, cormorants, darter, grebes, large egret, little egrets, moorhen, night herons, paddy bird, painted stork, pintails, pond heron, sandpiper, shovellers, terns, white ibis. They migrate from Europe during November and December to escape the frost that sets in.
Conservation.
Several steps have been taken by the Government of Tamil Nadu to protect the area. Water channels have been built by the Public Works Department to facilitate water supply to the sanctuary from neighbouring lakes.
In 2013, two lakh Barringtonia saplings were planted in the sanctuary to allow birds to nest. The Vedanthangal lake was also desilted and deepened to hold more water.

Balduina

Balduina, population 42,000, is an urban area that belongs to the Municipio XIX of the commune of Rome, and to the fourteenth borough of the city, (Q.XIV, called Trionfale). Situated at 139 metres above sea level on the southern side of Monte Mario, Balduina is the highest part of Rome.
Geography.
The area of Balduina is marked on the southern side by the green “cliffs” of the hill forming a natural entrance just at the corner of Via Antonio Labriola and Via Gualtiero Serafino through Viale delle Medaglie d’Oro in a place known at the beginning of the 20th century as "Dogana della Balduina" (the customs house of Balduina); It is bounded to the west by the FR3 railway that runs from Rome to Cesano and Viterbo, a boundary overtaken by some housing in the Monte Ciocci area, here facing the Valle Aurelia, known as “Valle dell’Inferno” Balduina is bounded to the north by some convents and villas on the Via Trionfale, a historic road that leads north towards Via Cassia. Finally, to east the neighbourhood is framed by the Via Trionfale itself, which runs down from Villa Stuart to Borghetto S. Lazzaro and is the boundary with Prati di Castello.
Until the beginning of the twentieth century “Balduina” and “Monte Mario” were used interchangeably and the neighbourhood was surrounded by open fields with no specific name. Subsequently the name “Monte Mario” slowly “moved” (in an urban sense) towards the areas of S. Onofrio and Case Nostre, marking these areas on the plateau where today stands the railway station of the same name.
Districts.
Balduina is divided into three readily identifiable districts:
History.
Balduina is named after Baldovino del Monte, brother of Pope Julius III del Monte (1550–1555) and owner of those lands on the southern part of Monte Mario.
The modern neighbourhood started around 1909 with some elegant villas built on Viale delle Medaglie d’Oro and Viale Tito Livio. 
A much bigger expansion started just after World War II with the typical Roman "Palazzine", four or five-storey buildings, split in some apartments, nine as a base.
Transport.
"FR3": a regional and urban railway line linked to the major Trastevere and Ostiense train stations and to the Linea A metro with a junction at Valle Aurelia.
Bus lines: 907, 913, 991 and 999.

Kizhakkekallada

East Kallada or popularly known as Kizhakkekallada is a village located about 20 km north-east of Kollam city. East Kallada is bounded by Kallada River in the west and north and Ashtamudi backwater in the south. It is believed that the old port 'Nelkynda' mentioned by Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is Kallada or its nearby place.
Periplus describes:
East Kallada is also a part of Travancore history. In 1730 Unni Keralavarma of Desinganadu invaded East Kallada, that was part of Venad at that time. Marthanda Varma immediately attacked Desinganad and added East Kallada to Venad. Thus He started the expansion of Travancore and later invaded lot of small countries from north.
It is believed that centuries ago this village was a flourishing center of a Buddhist culture. The customs and architecture of old temples in this area support the fact that they could possibly have been buddhist vihars in their initial days. Eduppukuthira ( Huge chariots associated with the festival of Sree durga devi temple ) itself has got strong association with buddhist customs and practices.The strong presence of ezhava community in this area is a strong evidence supporting the existence of buddhism. A Buddha statue which is 3 feet long and made of marble was excavated more by accident in 1978 from near the Siva temple Sinkarapalli(The "palli" suffix, which was common usage in Pali, the language of Theravada Buddhism). Later in 1984 the same statue was placed at Siva temple, Koduvila. But unfortunately it had been stolen.
Places of worship.
Chittumala Sree Durga Devi temple is the most important place of worship in this area among Hindus. The temple situated at Chittumala, a beautiful hill top is devoted to Sree Durga Devi.Chittumala Ultsavam, a festival associated with this temple is famous for its huge chariots which is carried by devotees up to the temple at the hill top.
Other important temples are Sree Mahadevar Temple Koduvila, Sree Krishna temple Marthandapuram, Sree Mahavishnu temple Marthandapuram and Sree Mahavishnu temple Veranoor. The incomplete inscription in the veranoor temple in Tamil and Vatteluttu is identified and mentioned by the Archaeological Survey of India.
The important famous Christian church is St. Mary's Orthodox church, West Kallada (Kallada Valiya pally). Other important church is St. George Orthodox church, East Kallada.

Albania–Serbia relations

Albanian–Serbian relations are foreign relations between Albania and Serbia. Albania has an embassy in Belgrade. Serbia has an embassy in Tirana. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). Serbia in official candidate while Albania is recognized as potential candidate country by the European Union.
History.
Ottoman period.
In the Ottoman period, Serbian diplomat Ilija Garašanin contacted the abbot of Mirdita, Msgr. Gasper Krasniqi, with the goal of acquiring the Albanian Catholic element as the alleged solution to the "Eastern Question". However, their goals were different. While Garašanin considered those contacts as means for the realization of a Serbian exit to the Adriatic Sea, Krasniqi made effort to help Serbia to organize a revolution of the Albanian Catholic community, primarily Mirdita, against the Turks, for the political freedom and independence of Albania.
Balkan Wars.
At the beginning of Balkan Wars, one of the important strategic goals of Serbian politics was to acquire a corridor to the Adriatic Sea through northern Albania. The First Balkan War found the Albanians as a nation fighting for its own national state. Though this 'fighting' is mostly figurative as the Albanian people were not involved in much direct combat instead preferring to allow the other people of the Balkans to fight while petitioning the 'great powers' for the establishment of their state.
World War II.
During World War II, a very close cooperation developed between the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia and the People's Liberation Army of Albania. The Albanian People's Army assumed power in the country in 1944. Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was the first country to recognize the new government of Albania in April 1945.
There were communist plans to create a Balkan federation which would include Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. However, after the resolution of Informbiro 1948, Albania broke relations with the Yugoslav communists, because Enver Hoxha remained loyal to the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.
Yugoslav Wars.
In June 1991, as the Yugoslav wars broke out, Albanian Foreign Minister Mehmet Kapllani visited Croatia. During this time, Ramiz Alia, President of Albania, began discussions with ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo. In July 1991 relations between Albania and Yugoslavia were strained. Yugoslav and Albanian leaders exchanged fire, and Serbian leaders accused Albanians of instigating unrest in Kosovo and not respecting frontier markers. The Yugoslav government released a statement accusing Albania of interfering in Yugoslavia’s internal affairs and warned Albania that Yugoslavia would react "decisively with all available means" to any challenges to its sovereignty.
In a reversal of previous policies at the time, Albania improved relations with the Soviet Union and the United States to stop possible Serbian aggression and to stop the superpowers from exploiting unrest in Albania.
In 1998, as Kosovo Albanian refugees were fleeing across the border into northern Albania, Albania had proved that Yugoslavia had executed a campaign of ethnic cleansing, and called on the international community to intercede. 
In 2008, after Kosovo proclaimed its independence, Albania was one of the first countries to recognize it. Serbia's reaction was that of recalling the Serbian ambassador for consultations in protest from any state recognising Kosovo.
In March 2009, Vladimir Vukčević, Serbia’s war crimes prosecutor, asked Albania to reinvestigate claims that some of the Serbs who disappeared during the Kosovo conflict may have been killed for their organs in Albania.
Minority rights.
In December 2008 Serbian police arrested ten former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), in an Albanian-populated area bordering Kosovo. Serbia's war crimes prosecution office stated that it had evidence that the ten KLA members had killed 51 people and kidnapped 159 civilians in Kosovo between June and October 1999. In January 2009 Albanian President Bamir Topi demanded that Serbia respect the Albanian minority in southern Serbia.

Rylan Reed

Rylan Robert Reed (born November 18, 1981 in Houston, Texas) is a former American football and baseball player. He played minor league baseball as a pitcher in the Chicago White Sox organization from 2001 to 2005. After undergoing treatment for cancer, Reed enrolled at Texas Tech University and played college football from 2005 to 2008. He was selected as a first-team All-American offensive tackle in 2008.
Early years and baseball.
Born in Houston, Texas, Reed attended Crossett High School in Crossett, Arkansas. He was a two-sport star in high school, playing a tight end and defensive end in football and as a pitcher with a 95 mile per hour fastball for the baseball team. He was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 2000 Major League Baseball June Amateur Draft and was also recruited by Houston Nutt to play college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks. The White Sox paid him a $550,000 signing bonus, and Reed opted for baseball.
He spent four years from 2001 to 2004 playing minor league baseball as a pitcher in the White Sox organization. He compiled a 3-0 record and a 2.44 earned run average in 2002. During his minor league career, his fastball was clocked at 98 miles per hour. He was named the White Sox's "organizational pitcher of the year." Brandon McCarthy, who played with Reed in 2002, recalled, "He would intimidate the hell out of you. He had muscles coming out of muscles. That was a sight.
Cancer and recovery.
In 2003, Reed was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent surgery to remove a tumor and three feet of his intestines. After several months of chemotherapy, Reed lost 30 pounds. When he recovered from the cancer treatment, his father was killed in an automobile accident. He returned to the White Sox in 2004, shortly after the death of his father, but his earned run average soared to 14.54 in five games for the Great Falls White Sox.
College football.
After retiring from baseball in 2004, Reed enrolled at Texas Tech University, where he played college football. He began as a tight end as a freshman in 2005, before being moved to offensive tackle. After gaining 60 pounds, he became a starter for Texas Tech in 2007 and 2008. Reed set a Texas Tech record in 2008 with a 625-pound bench press.
In 2008, Reed recalled having pitched to Barry Bonds during spring training in Tucson, Arizona. Bonds hit a fly ball to shallow right field for an out, prompting the "Houston Chronicle" to note: "That itself makes Reed arguably a one-man fraternity — possibly the only offensive lineman in college or pro football history able to claim an out against baseball's home run king."
After the 2008 season, Reed was selected as a first-team All-American by both the Walter Camp Football Foundation and SI.com.

Perinad Rural IT Park / Techno-lodge.
A Techno-lodge is a small Information Technology park established by Government of Kerala in a 
small town or a village in Kerala. Techno-lodges constitute the third tier of the IT infrastructure in Kerala. The Government has set up two such parks in Perinad and Kadakkal Grama Panchayats in Kollam District.
The objective of the Techno-lodges scheme is to encourage IT-enabled Services and Business Process Outsourcing companies to operate from low cost rural centres and thereby to create employment in rural areas. The Techno-Lodge centres are set up in old unused government buildings, buildings belonging to government organizations, panchayaths or other local bodies.
Techno-Lodge.
India's growth in the IT sector, especially in the ITeS and the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) has been largely driven by availability of low cost skilled manpower, huge English speaking population and appropriate infrastructure. With the BPO industry flourishing in India, more and more companies began establishing their opetations in metropolitan cities to capitalize on available human resource talent and physical infrastructure. But the prodigious expansion of BPO companies in select metropolitan cities has caused intense pressure on available human resource in these areas as well as physical infrastructure which has led to shooting up of costs for manpower as well as infrastructure.
Due to these factors some IT, ITeS and BPO companies are now looking at smaller towns and villages. The low cost of operations and lower employee attrition levels are the key benefits that these companies derive from their rural operations. In order to provide an impetus to this advantage, Government have decided to set up Rural IT centres namely Tehno-Lodge Scheme, typically advantageous to IT companies which are looking for reducing operational costs. This scheme of Techno-Lodge envisages developing a small building which has a capacity of seating about 25 employees for IT, ITeS and BPO operations.
The main objective of this scheme is to encourage ITeS and BPO companies to operate from low cost rural centres and thereby to create employment in rural areas. The Techno-Lodge centres will be set up in old unused government buildings, buildings belonging to government organizations, panchayaths or other local bodies. Preference shall be given to panchayaths, who provide their existing buildings/ community halls free of cost for the scheme.
Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL) will be the main implementing agency for this scheme. Proposals have been received for the setting ip of rural IT Parks / Technolodges in small towns and Rural Panchayats wherever unutilized land/ buildings are available with Government / Local bodies. Some IT companies have expressed interest in migrating to rural areas to reduce their operational costs. Technologies can be set up in small towns and rural Panchayats inbuildings with a built up area of about . or land measuring at least . This Scheme will provide employment to rural youth, taking IT to smaller towns and cities and making use of utilized Government / local bodies buildings etc.
Government have examined the matter in detail and are pleased to accord in principle sanction to Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL) for setting up rural IT Park / Techno lodges in small towns and rural panchayats wherever unutilized land / buildings are available with Government / Local bodies at free of cost. These lands / buildings will be jointly identified by Revenue and IT Departments. The value of land / buildings shall be treated as share capital contribution of Government in the equity of the KSITI Limited and the value of land/ building will be fixed by Government in consultation with the District Collector concerned.

Demographics.
The natives believe that word "thevalakara" is derived from "Devalokakara", i.e., "the land of gods". The old name is "Thevelikara". Books written by foreigners quoted "Beckare)". Thevalakkara is very famous in Kerala history connected with Portuguese attack in Thevalakara temples & orthodox church in 1544.
Kollam sea port was founded by Mar Abo with sanction from Udayamarthandavarma the Tamil king from Venad otherwise called Ay kingdom in 825 AD instead of re opening the inland sea port (kore-ke-ni kollam) near Backare (Thevalakara) also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to The Romans and The Greeks and Thondi to the Taamils and is also the foundation of the new city. It is also believed that Mar Abo actually volunteered to the Chera king to create a new sea port town near at Kollam instead of his request for renewing the almost vanishing Tyndis or Nelcynda inland sea port (kore-ke-ni) at Kollam, lying idle without trade for a few centuries because of the Cheras being over run by pallavas in the 6th century AD ending the spice trade from Malabar coast. This allowed Mar Abo to stay for many decades in Chera kingdom and streamline Christian faith in the St. Thomas tradition with Syrian liturgy as reference to the Sanskrit and Vedic prayers thus strengthen the Vaishnavite stream of faith venerating the Virgin Born Human Manifesting of the Trinity in Jesus
Thevalakara had two old temples for Shiva and Devi. it was converted as Shiva temple after Adi shankara"s shivate revival in the early 9th century But was destroyed during a Portuguese attack on Nampoodiri vaishnavite Christians following syrian Liturgy in Worship at Thevalakara by Martim Ahonsa Desousa (1544). Devi temple was an old"kavu" where Kadmattathachan Nambuthiri, the native disciple of Mar Abo tried to control a Yakshi (demon) and found no place to give her a stay around 40 Malayalam Era (865 AD). He came and prayed to the God and was able to control her. (she's still there in the temple compound). and it reconstructed by Aadithya Varmaraja under the supervision of Keralan Kumeran, the native naduvazhi and related tokumerakkanakka pillaiveedu . In 1472, keralan kumeran devoted "valiya balikkallu" to the temple as kanikka.
The old vattezhuthu inscription shown there, proves this.
Thevalakara church history is connected to the same Portuguese attack and Chaliyath Maraikkars attack. St. Francis Xavier and Alexis Menezis visited this Back Water coastline many times (rf. Joseph Mundadan, Richard. e. leche, gouva). Chaliyathu Maraikkar came in Thevalakkara in 1569 and propagated Islam among Low caste Hindus, then he constructed "chaliyathu jumamasjid". Thevalakara is now famous for Mar Abo. He was a holy man and was considered as a spiritual Guru by swami Ayyappan who was a companion to kadamattathu Achan, the native Brahmin disciple of Mar Abo at chirapinchira Gurukulam near Karthikapally where they together studied Martial Arts including Kalari. His tomb is considered sacred. Now, it has announced as pilgrim center of the orthodox church with all religious thronging the shrine in February.Narayan M.G.S.,writes in Cultural Symbiosis that “ By the time of the Tarissa Christian Copper Plates of the 9th century, the Christians of Kerala who were just Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nairs were part and parcel of the local village community.” This means that they did not remain as a separate group but rather they intermarried with the Hindus of Kerala, and accepted the local cultural idioms. “The deity of the Tarsa Church was referred to the tevar. An important offering to the tevar was the sacred oil lamp as in the case of contemporary Brahmanical temples, is an indication to the fact that their conception of religion was shaped by local culture.

Koyash (Tatar: "Кояш" or "Qoyaş", Bashkort: "Ҡояш", Uzbek: "Quyosh", Uyghur: قۇياش, Turkish: "Kuyaş") is the god of sun in Turkic mythology.
Gök Tanrı created the earth with rays of sun light, thus, Koyash took part in the creation of earth. Solar rays are also considered to be "strings" between the sun and the spirits of plants, animals and humans.
Turks who worship Koyash turn towards the sunrise when praying. Koyash is the son of Gok Tengri ""Sky God"" (Tenger means sky in Mongolian) and the Earth Goddess. The power and vital force of the Sun God, making it a priority to bow to him each morning as he rises. Solar rays are strings that link the spirits of plants to heaven, and considered a medium for transmitting Tengri into infants. Koyash is often depicted as a fiery bird or a winged horse. These images are often used to adorn things such as ceramic pots and earrings in ancient times.
The sun god Koyash can make "solar strands" from his hands capable of ensnaring and burning his victims. To the Altai people, the sun represented light, warmth, and growth. This made the sun deity very important, as the sun was seen as the ruler of all that he created. Then he is portrayed as a warrior.
Sun in Turkic culture.
The Sun (also Koyash) was the son of Gök-Tengri (Sky God) and the Toprak Ana (Earth Goddess). The Turkic people and Mongols honoured the power and vital force of the Sun God. Reportedly the Huns, leaving their villages in the morning, welcomed the rising sun and bowed towards him. Altai people would turn towards the sunrise when praying. They worshipped the Sun because Gok-Tengri supervised the creation of the world by the Sun’s rays, which are but strings linking the spirits of plants to the Sun. Likewise solar rays were considered a medium for transmitting the life force sent by Tengri to the infant.
A vivid example is the legend of the birth of An-Lushan by a Shamaness. At his conception it was said that a ray of light penetrated the yurt. Alan-Goa, the mother of the Mongols, conceived from a ray that penetrated the yurt through a smoke hole. The Turkic people associated the Sun’s path in the sky with the flight of a fire-bird or a winged horse. Flying (winged) horses as symbols of the Sun were widely used in the cosmological myths of Turkic peoples. And other animals (rams, deer, bulls) were also connected with the Sun.

The Thrikkadavoor Mahadeva Temple is the most famous Siva Temple in Kollam District. It is situated in the Thrikkadavoor Panchayath and on the banks of the Ashtamudi lake.Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result he was given the choice of either a gifted son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life. Mrikandu rishi chose the former, and was blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of 12.
Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva. Yama then came in person to take away Markandeya's life, and sprung his noose around the young sage's neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, and out of it, Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression. After defeating Yama in battle to the point of death, Shiva then revived him, under the condition that the devout youth would live forever. For this act, Shiva was thereafter known also as Kalantaka ("Ender of Death"). This was said to have happened in Thirukkadavoor also call Thrikkadavoor.
Thus Maha Mrityunjaya Stotra is also attributed to Markandeya, and this legend of Shiva conquering death is inscribed in metal and worshipped at Thirukkadavoor mahadeva temple.
The annual Srattu festival attracts thousands of people, including foreigners. The festival falls in the month of Kumbham (February/March). The eight artificial horses, which represent the eight areas (karas) around the temple, is a special attraction for tourists.

Arkle Novice Chase

The Arkle Novice Chase is a Grade 1 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Leopardstown over a distance of about 2 miles and 1 furlong (3,420 metres), and during its running there are eleven fences to be jumped. The race is for novice chasers, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late January.
The earliest version of the event was established in 1956, and it was originally contested over 2 miles (3,219 metres). Its current title pays tribute to Arkle, a winner of this race in 1963. At the time of Arkle's victory the event was known as the Milltown Novice Chase. The distance was extended by 2 furlongs in 1980, and by another furlong in 1992. It was cut to its present length in 1995.
The race is sometimes referred to as the "Irish Arkle", as there is a different event, similar in both name and format, which takes place in Great Britain in March. Several winners of the Irish version have subsequently achieved victory in its British counterpart, the Arkle Challenge Trophy. The most recent of these is Klairon Davis in 1995.

In addition to taking part in excesises with the Army, it flew patrols along the border with Éire. In September 1941 conversion to Curtiss Tomahawks began, but a flight of Lysanders was retained until July 1943. In March 1943 the squadron moved to Yorkshire but left a detachment in Ulster until July, and in April North American Mustangs began to arrive. By the time No. 231 joined No. 128 Airfield of Second TAF on 22 July 1943, it was fully equipped with Mustangs, this type having flown the squadron's first offensive operations on 4 July. Shipping and weather reconnaissance missions, defensive patrols and ground attack sorties over northern France were flown until the squadron disbanded on 15 January 1944.

It also administrated trans-Atlantic passenger and freight services and No. 231's Coronado flying boats opererated between North America, West Africa and the UK, using Largs as its British terminal. Other flights were flown with landplanes, using several of the types available to No. 45 Group as required. In September 1945 the squadron moved to Bermuda, where it disbanded on 15 January 1946. 
On 1 December 1945, a flight was formed to train Avro Lancastrian crews at RAF Full Sutton but its task was taken over by the station when No. 231 disbanded, the Lancastrian Flight becoming the Lancastrian Training Unit/No 1699 HCU.

John C. Jacob

John C Jacob (1936 – October 11, 2008) was one of the pioneers of the environmental movement in Kerala, India. Jacob was born at Nattakam in Kottayam. 
He earned a degree in zoology from Madras Christian College, after which he joined the faculty at St. Joseph's College, Devagiri in Kozhikode. Eventually he headed up the Zoology Department at Payyanur College, where he worked until he retired in 1992. 
At Payyanur, in 1972 he started a zoology club that would form the genesis of campus-based nature conservation activities. The club also became involved in protesting threats to the environment. Jacobs also started a few "green" magazines stressing the need to preserve nature. He also set up the Society for Environment Education, Kerala (SEEK), which published an environment-focused magazine "Soochimukhi". Additionally, Jacob led the movement against the Silent Valley project in South Kerala. 
He is the author of several books, including "Prakrithi: Nireekshanavum Vyakhyanavum" and "Urangunnavarude Thazhvaraka'. 
In recognition of his contributions to the environment, he was awarded the Kerala Biodiversity Board's Haritham Award and the state government's Vana Mithra Award.
The name of the plant Impatiens johnsiana is dedicated Prof. John C.

Mangaloreans

Mangaloreans (Tulu: "Kudladakulu"; Konkani: "Kodialghar"; ; Beary: "Maikaaltanga") are generally considered to be a collection of ethnic groups that hail from the areas comprising Tulu Nadu (historical South Canara district) on the south western coast of India. It can also refer to residents of Mangalore.
History.
Historically, Tulu Nadu included the two separate lands of "Haiva" and "Tuluva". The Ballal Kings of Sullia had ruled this area around 1100 years back. The Bunt, Brahmin migration to Tulu Nadu might have happened during the lifetime of the Kadamba king Mayuravarma at 345 AD. During the 13th century, the Hindu philosopher Madhvacharya built the eight "Mathas" (monasteries) in modern Udupi district.
During the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty, Tulu Nadu was administered in two parts—"Mangaluru Rajya" and "Barakuru Rajya". Tulu Nadu was the original homeland of the Tuluva Dynasty, the third dynasty of the Vijayanagara monarchy. Tulu Nadu was governed by feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire until the 17th century. The longest reigning dynasty of Tulu Nadu was the Alupas. They were the feudatories of the prominent dynasties of Karnataka. The Kadamba dynasty of Banavasi was the earliest, under which the Alupas flourished. Later the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Badami, Chalukyas of Kalyani, Hoysalas of Durasamudra and "rayas" (kings) of Vijayanagara were the overlords. The Alupas, however, were independent and their subordination was nominal at best. They ruled during the Vijaynagara domination of Tulu Nadu from 14th to the 17th centuries. The region became extremely prosperous during Vijayanagara period with Barkur and Mangalore gaining importance. After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, much of Tulu Nadu came under the control of the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri.
Over the following many centuries, more ethnic groups migrated to the area. Various Konkani peoples arrived by sea, as Mangalore was a major port that served not only the Portuguese but also the Arabs for maritime trades. Jains were already a prominent group and even today are uniquely preserved in Tulu Nadu. Though small in number, the Jains left behind indelible reminders of their glory with temples ("bastis") in Moodabidri, and monolithic statues of Bahubali and the Gomateshwara in Karkala, Venoor and Dharmasthala. In the 16th century, there was a large influx of Goan Catholics to this region from Goa. They built prominent educational institutions and contributed to the development of education in the region. The Muslim community of Tulu Nadu are basically descended from Arab traders who married local women and settled there. They speak Beary bashe, which is a mix of Tulu and Malayalam.
Demographics.
Majority of Mangaloreans belong to the Tuluva ethnic group. The Tuluvas have historically been concentrated in the coastal areas. The next largest group are the Konkanis, in particular the Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivadnya Brahmins as well as the Mangalorean Catholics whose ancestors migrated here from Goa, due to persecution by the Portuguese. Other groups who historically settled in Tulu Nadu, include the Kannadigas and Bearys.
Culture.
Cuisine.
Mangalorean cuisine is largely influenced by the South Indian cuisine, with several cuisines being unique to the diverse communities of the city. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean Curry, as are ginger, garlic and chili. Mangalorean Fish Curry is popular dish in Canara. The Tulu community's well-known dishes include "Kori Rotti" (dry rice flakes dipped in gravy), "Bangude Pulimunchi" (silver-grey mackerels), "Beeja-Manoli Upkari", "Neer dosa" (lacy rice-crêpes), "Boothai Gasi", "Kadabu", and "Patrode". The Konkani community's specialities include "Daali thoy", "beebe-upkari" (cashew based), "val val", "avnas ambe sasam", "Kadgi chakko", "paagila podi", and "chana gashi". Vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known and liked throughout the state and region. Since Mangalore is a coastal town, fish forms the staple diet of most people. Mangalorean Catholics' "Sanna-Dukra Maas" ("Sanna" –idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; "Dukra Maas" –Pork), "Pork Bafat", "Sorpotel" and the Mutton Biryani are well-known dishes. Pickles such as "happala", "sandige" and "puli munchi" are unique to Mangalore. "Shendi" (toddy), a country liquor prepared from coconut flower sap, is popular.
Traditions.
Many classical dance forms and folk art are practised among Mangaloreans. The "Yakshagana", a night-long dance and drama performance, is held in Mangalore, while "Hulivesha" (literally, "tiger dance"), a folk dance unique to the city, is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami. "Karadi Vesha" (bear dance) is another well known dance performed during "Dasara". "Paddanas" (Ballad-like epics passed on through generations by word of mouth) are sung by a community of impersonators in Tulu and are usually accompanied by the rhythmic drum beats. The Bearys' unique traditions are reflected in such folk songs as "kolkai" (sung during kolata, a valour folk-dance during which sticks used as props), "unjal pat" (traditional lullaby), "moilanji pat", and "oppune pat" (sung at weddings). The "Evkaristik Purshanv" (Konkani: Eucharistic procession) is an annual Catholic religious procession led on the first Sunday of each New Year.
World record.
On 26–27 January 2008, a Konkani cultural event, Konkani Nirantari, held in Mangalore by a Mangalorean organization, Mandd Sobhann, entered the Guinness Book of World Records for non-stop singing of Konkani hymns. Mandd Sobhann members sang for 40 hours, surpassing the old record of 36 hours held by a Brazilian musical troupe.

Coin catalog

A coin catalog (or coin catalogue) is a listing of coin types. Information may include pictures of the obverse and reverse (front and back), date and place of minting, translation of inscriptions, description of images, metal type, mintage, edge description,orientation of the coin, Weight, Diameter, thickness, Design credentials, shape and prices for various grades. Defects may be described.
The quality, detail and completeness of the information available about a particular coin varies according to popularity, commonality, and available scholarly research.
Because of the huge number of coins in world history, there are no comprehensive catalogs. Professional collectors typically keep many books for identification and assessment.
Most commonly, coin catalogs come in one of two forms. Reference works such as A Guide Book of United States Coins, published by Whitman Publishing and more popularly known as the "Red Book", and the Standard Catalog of World Coins, published by Krause Publications, give descriptions and approximate prices of coins at many different levels of preservation, or grades. The other form is the auction catalog, where only those specific coins available in the auction are described, with photo plates available for some of the more prominent coins.
Coin catalogs are essential when dealing with ancient or foreign coins, where the inscriptions may be obscure and unrecognizably stylized, even for a native speaker. 
Coin catalogs today are supplemented by Internet sites, some of which have the advantage of being attached to user forums, so that issues such as counterfeiting may be discussed. With the rise of online auctions, it is now possible for collectors to research their coins at commercial sites such as EBay, Heritage Auctions, or Teletrade, as well as myriad collector-created sites containing research into diverse collecting specialties.

Alfred Farag

Alfred Farag (14 June 1929 in Zagazig, Egypt  – 4 December 2005 ) was one of the eminent
Egyptian playwrights of the post-1952 Revolution period. He obtained his BA in English Literature from the Faculty of Arts, Alexandria University in 1949. He took up a teaching career till 1955, when he abandoned it for a post in the press as a literary critic. He worked at several press institutions, for instance, “Rose El Youssef”, “El Tahrir” and “Al Gomhouriyya”.
Farag took a part in the establishment of the public management for the “mass culture” project and in the foundation of artistic groups in Egypt. He also had an important role in the introduction of theatre in Egypt’s provinces. He, with many great writers like Noaman Ashour, Saad Eddin Wahba, Michael Roman, Rashad Roushdy and Yousef Edrees, contributed in the “nothing like” renaissance of theatre in the sixties.
Alfred Farag wrote his first play “Fall of Pharaoh” (1957) at the age of 26, then he proceeded his career as a writer. He wrote about 52 plays such as “The Barber of Baghdad” (1964), “Sulayman Al-Halabi” (1965), “Al-Zayr Salim” (1967) and “Atwa with the Jack-Knife” (1993), in addition to some one-act plays such as “Voice of Egypt” (1956) and “The Trap” (1965). In his plays, he discusses serious issues like the problem of national independence in the “The Epistles of the Judge of Seville” (1987), and the Palestinian issue in “Fire and Olives” (1970). Some of his works were translated into German and English such as “Ali Janah Al - Tabrizi and his Servant Quffa” (1969) or into English only such as “Marriage on a Divorce Notification” (1973). In addition to being a playwright, he also wrote novels such as “The Story of the Lost Time” (1977) and “The Days and Nights of Sindbad” (1988), and short stories. 
In his writings, he eloquently mixed the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic with the Standard Arabic which made his works unique and easy for people to understand. Critics became interested in Farag's dramatic language as it was vivid and far from the formal style used by his predecessors. He believed that the language should contribute in giving a “visual” illustration of the text What made him different from others is that he revived the old heritage on stage as if it was real, and that he used heritage without getting superficial.
Farag was granted several international, Arab and Egyptian awards and medals. The best known award was “Jerusalem” given by the General Union for Arab Writers as he was the first Egyptian intellectual to receive such an award. He also received the National Award for Play writing in 1965, and the Science and Arts Medal of the first order in 1967.
Farag died on 4 December 2005 at the age of 76 in the St Mary's Hospital, London after a long term of illness. He was buried in Alexandria.

Yer Tanrı

Yer Tanrı (or feminine form in Turkish: Yer Tanrıça), is the goddess of earth in Turkic mythology. Also known as Yer Ana.
With her husband, Gök Tanrı, she was the parent of Ay Tanrı, Umay, Ülgen, Koyash, and Erlik. As a fertility goddess, she was recognized as the giver of crops and abundance. In the spring and in the autumn — before the beginning of the agricultural season and after the harvest — she was worshiped with sacrifices of food.
Yer Tanry (Yer Tanrıça, "The Earth Goddess") was considered to be both a mother and wife to Gok-Tengri. She appeared as a force of nature. In ancient Turkic mythology there was a theory that mortals were the product of the union of Tengri and Yer (Earth). In the Orkhon Stone it says: “In the beginning there was a blue sky above, a dark land below, and human sons in-between." ("Üze kök tengri asra yagiz yir kilindukda ikin ara kişi oğlı kılınmış.") The Turkic people revered the Earth Goddess (Yer Ana) as a giver of crops and abundance. In the spring, before the beginning of the agricultural season and in the autumn, after the harvest, as a sign of gratitude for the abundance of food and happiness, the ancient Turkish community and Mongols made a sacrifice to the Earth Goddess. Milk, kumys and tea were offered and pleas made for a fertile land and a rich yield.

Geography.
Arikkulam is located at . It has an average elevation of .
Demography.
Arikkulam had a population of 17143 with 8305 males and 8838 females.
The name derives from ari, which means foe and kulam in the vernacular means pool.
hence, arikkulam is a pool of enemies. As the name indicates, this place might have been drenched with human blood either in an internecine or religious feud.
Arikkulath Nambi, a vassal of Zamorin of calicut is said to have held sway over this area.
Its history is shrouded in mystery. though attempts have been made to write the history of Arikkulam, nothing fruitful emerged from them. In this connection, a seminar was held at the
Arikkulam panchayat office a year ago in which noted academics like Pavithran master and Dinesan of Naderi participated. Will Arikkulam give us a savant who will unravel its past?
There is also a derived fable that the village of Arikkulam was initially called as "Harikulam", "Hari" meaning Lord Vishnu and "kulam" meaning pool together meaning "Lord Vishnu's pool". This may be the reason why the village has a temple devoted the formerly mentioned lord "Areekkunnath Vishnu Temple". Another local temple of this area is the "Oravingal Bhagavathi temple".
The village is also a wonderful location for ornithologists with the location of several Kavu around it.
Economy.
Economy of Arikkulam revolves around fishing, local businesses and remittance from Gulf.

In second place, it is the transcript of the principal and most direct testimony of that friendship: the ninety-seven, mostly unpublished letters, that were exchanged over several decades.

Dr Alexander "Sasha" Tsinker (, born 2 January 1953) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Yisrael BaAliyah and the Democratic Choice between 1999 and 2003.
Biography.
Born in the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union, Tsinker gained an MA at the Polytechnic Institute in Armenia in 1975 and a PhD from the Moscow Scientific Center for Management in 1988. He worked as a systems analyst and made aliyah to Israel in 1990.
For the 1999 elections he was placed sixth on the Yisrael BaAliyah list, and entered the Knesset as the party won six seats. On 20 July 1999, just over a month after the elections, Tsinker and Roman Bronfman left the party to establish a new Knesset faction; six days later it was renamed "Mahar" (a Hebrew acronym for Party for Society and Reforms), and in October adopted the name "Democratic Choice".
Prior to the 2003 elections Tzinker left the Democratic Choice (which was to be allied to Meretz) and established a new party, Citizen and State, which he headed. However, the party won only 1,566 votes (0.05%), well below the 1.5% election threshold, and Tzinker lost his seat.
In the run-up to the 2006 elections, Citizen and State was taken over by former Shinui MKs, led by Avraham Poraz, and renamed Hetz.

Spyros Spyromilios

Spyros Spyromilios (, 1864–1930) was a Greek Gendarmerie officer who took part in the Greek struggle for Macedonia and the Balkan Wars. He was born in Himara, Ottoman Empire, modern southern Albania, or known as Northern Epirus among Greeks. In 1914 proclaimed the Autonomy of his home town and joined the autonomist struggle of Northern Epirus against annexation to the newly established Albanian principality.
Life.
In May 1905 he led one of the first armed groups to be assembled for the developing Macedonian Struggle. Adopting the "nom de guerre" ""Athalis Bouas"" or ""Kapetan Bouas"", he led his own group of 35 men in the region of Vermio in Ottoman-held Macedonia. He was however wounded in his leg within days, in an exchange of fire with pro-Bulgarian "komitadjis", and was forced to go to Thessaloniki to be treated. By 1909 he had risen to the rank of Captain, and took part in the Goudi military coup d'état.
At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, he was positioned at the Ionian island of Corfu. There, he assembled a small corps of volunteers from his home region, augmented by 200 Cretan volunteers. On 5 November, Himara rose in revolt and his force landed and occupied this coastal region, without facing initially resistance. Spyromylios then suggested to the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos that the Greek Army should immediately capture the city of Vlorë, north of Himara. However, on November 28, the Albanians declared their independence in Vlorë and formed a provisional government. The Greek headquarters expected full scale attack in the area and ordered him to retreat. He rejected the order and remained in the region organizing the local defense.
When the Second Balkan War ended, a series of peace treaties and protocols awarded the area to the newly formed Albanian state and the Greek forces were ordered to evacuate the area. At 9 February 1914 Spyromilios refused to withdraw and declared the region’s autonomy and himself as "captain" of Himara. Himara became part of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, proclaimed at February 28 in Gjirokastër. 
Spyromilios became member of the Greek Parliament for the Argyrokastron Prefecture at the following elections. At September 1916, when the Italian army entered the region he escaped to Athens. In the next years he was involved in the Northern Epirus issue. At 1926 he was honorary discharged with the rank of Colonel.
Legacy.
It is noteworthy that Spyromilios kept correspondence with Albanian personalities, discussing the region’s political future. A distinguished Albanian, Eqerem Bej of Vlorë, noted that Spyromilios and his family were known for their loyalty towards their
friends, bravery and persistence.
Spyromilios’ family mansion in Himara, is one of the town’s main attractions, although abandoned today.
