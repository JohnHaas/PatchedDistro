A Tunis cake is a Madeira cake topped with a thick layer of chocolate and decorated with marzipan fruits. It is traditionally eaten at Christmas.
The origins of the cake are Edwardian. Scottish bakery Macfarlane Langs produced commercial Tunis Cakes in the 1930s, and when they merged with McVitie & Price in 1948 to form a company called United Biscuits (which still owns the McVitie’s brand) the recipe passed to the new company. McVitie's produced a Tunis cake until the mid 1980s. It is now sold seasonally by Tesco, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. An early recipe does not include the chocolate and marzipan topping.

The Composers' Desktop Project(CDP) is an international cooperative network based in the United Kingdom that has been developing software for working with sound materials since 1986. Working on a cooperative basis and motivated by user-specific compositional needs, the project has focused on the development of precise, detailed and multifaceted DSP-based sound transformation tools. Currently, CDP provides sound transformation software (named after the project itself) for Windows and Mac OS X that has been evolving for over 20 years.
Originally, after a study to determine if it was possible and/or feasible to port CMusic from UNIX mainframe systems, the project released the CDP software along with corresponding "SoundSTreamer" hardware for the Atari ST and later ported the software to DOS. The software tool-set is designed specifically to transform sound samples mostly via offline processing (non-real time); the software is considered complementary to real-time processing and audio sequencers.

Julius von Röhr

Julius Philipp Benjamin von Rohr (1737–1793) was a Prussian-born botanist and plant collector, naturalist, medical doctor and watercolourist, in Danish service who sent many plants to Europe from South America and the West Indies. He collected male "Myristica fragrans" flowers on the Isle de Cayenne in about 1784.
Career.
He created the genus "Melanthera" which is closely related to "Bidens" in 1792, and is commemorated by the monotypic genus "Rohria" Schreb., native to French Guiana This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation J.P.Rohr when citing a botanical name.
Von Rohr was an immigrant to Denmark, and in 1757 was appointed as municipal buildings inspector and government land surveyor of the Danish West Indies, now known as the United States Virgin Islands. The Danish crown also commissioned a study of the natural history of the islands. Von Rohr started a botanic garden in Christiansted on the island of St. Croix, corresponding with noted natural history scientists back in Denmark and in Europe. In the 1780s he studied cotton cultivation in the Antilles, exploring as far as Cayenne and Cartagena. By now he had been given the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
In the 1790s Denmark considered abolishing the Atlantic slave trade, a measure expected to bring down the flourishing sugarcane plantations of the Danish West Indies. Von Rohr, who by this time had acquired considerable administrative experience of the colony, was asked to investigate the feasibility of establishing plantation agriculture in the vicinity of the old Danish slaving forts of Guinea on the West African coast.
Von Rohr packed and sent ahead to Fort Christiansborg his surveying instruments and library, a catalogue of titles reflecting his colonial involvement. His library included books and periodicals sent to him from England by Joseph Banks. He traveled via the United States, where he was entertained by prominent public figures and natural historians in Philadelphia and New York. Von Rohr's mission ended abruptly when the ship on which he was travelling to Africa from New York disappeared somewhere in the Atlantic. Other sources, though, show that he did make the voyage safely, but died of fever shortly after:
""...my friend the late Mr. Julius von Rohr, a gentleman whose death is a real loss to natural science, and perhaps an irreparable loss to the interests of an injured and oppressed part of mankind: I mean the Blacks. In the summer of 1793, I took my last adieu of this learned botanist, and most amiable man. He sailed, from New York, for the coast of Africa, where he contemplated the establishment of a colony of Blacks. A few days after he had landed on the African continent, he died of a malignant fever. With him, I fear, has perished, for a long time at least, one of the best concerted schemes for the safe and happy emancipation of the swarthy children of Africa. Von Rohr was another Howard. In benevolence and good sense, he was, at least, equal to the great English philanthropist. In science certainly, and perhaps in the simplicity of his conduct, and the unambitious fervour of his zeal, he was the superior"".

He also played Australian rules football during the 1940s with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). 
Lambert was a footballer originally and in just his second game of VFL football kicked a six goal haul, against Hawthorn at Victoria Park. Recruited from Abbotsford, he bagged another four the following weekend and finished the 1941 season with 19 goals from seven games. After managing only five appearances over the next four years, the forward played 11 games in 1946. He had a good finals campaign, kicking three goals in Collingwood's drawn Semi Final with Essendon and two in the Preliminary Final loss to Melbourne. Lambert ended his career in 1947 with 27 games and 48 goals for Collingwood.
After a couple of first-class fixtures against Tasmania in December 1946, Lambert made his Sheffield Shield debut in the 1947/48 competition. The following season he took 17 wickets at 22.88 with his left-arm fast-medium bowling which earned him a spot in the Commonwealth XI squad to tour India, Pakistan and Ceylon. He bowled well in India, taking 25 wickets at 32.24, eight of them in four matches against the national team.
Lambert spent the 1949 English summer playing as a Professional with the Ramsbottom Cricket Club in the Lancashire League.
In 1953/54, his last season, Lambert took career best figures of 6 for 55 against New South Wales, including the scalps of Jim Burke and Keith Miller. He also batted well in that match after being promoted to the top order, scoring 29 and 43. His batting had improved over the years and in his final first-class match, against New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Lambert opened the batting and scored 50. The only other half century of his career came was an innings of 59 in 1950, when he was batting in the lower order for the Commonwealth XI against Bombay.

Wahiba Sands

The Wahiba Sands, or Ramlat al-Wahiba (also called Sharqiya Sands), is a region of desert in Oman. The region is named for the Wahiba tribe. The area is defined by a boundary of north to south and east to west, with an area of . The desert has been of scientific interest since a 1986 expedition by the Royal Geographical Society documented the diversity of the terrain, the flora and fauna, noting 16,000 invertebrates as well as 200 species of other wildlife, including avifauna. They also documented 150 species of native flora.
Geology.
The desert was formed during the Quaternary period as a result of the forces of south-west blowing monsoon and the northern shamal trade wind, coming in from the east. Based on the types of dunes found in the area, it is divided into the high, or upper, Wahiba and low Wahiba. The upper area contains mega-ridge sand systems on a north-south line that are believed to have been formed by monsoon. The dunes of the north, formed at some point after the last regional glaciation, measure up to high, with peaks accumulating in the areas just beyond the strongest wind speeds, where declining velocity wind deposited sand. The north and west boundaries of the desert are delineated by the fluvial systems Wadi Batha and Wadi Andam. Beneath the surface sands are an older layer of cemented carbonate sand. Alluvium deposits believed to have originated from the Wadi Batha during the Paleolithic era have been disclosed in the central desert beneath the interdune surface. Wind erosion is believed to have contributed to the existence of a nearly level plain in the southwest.
Inhabitants.
The area is occupied by Bedouins who congregate at Al Huyawah, an oasis near the border of the desert, between June and September to gather dates. Tribes present in the area at the time of the Royal Geographical Society expedition included, predominately, the al-Wahiba (or Yal Wahiba) for whom the region is named, the al-Amr, the al-Bu-Isa, the Hikman, Hishm and Janaba.

BL 6 inch Mk XII naval gun

The BL 6 inch Gun Mark XII was a British 45 calibres naval gun which was mounted as primary armament on light cruisers and secondary armament on dreadnought battleships commissioned in the period 1914 - 1926, and remained in service on many warships until the end of World War II.
Design.
This was a high-velocity naval gun consisting of inner "A" tube, "A" tube, wound with successive layers of steel wire, with a jacket over the wire.
Naval service.
It superseded the 45-calibres Mk VII gun and the longer 50-calibres Mk XI gun which had proved unwieldy in light cruisers due to its length, and was Britain's most modern 6-inch naval gun when World War I began.
Guns were mounted in the following ships :
Coast defence gun.
During WWII some Mk XII guns were used in emergency coast defense batteries.
Ammunition.
This gun generated a higher pressure in the chamber on firing compared to preceding 6-inch guns such as Mk VII and Mk XI. This necessitated use of special shells capable of withstanding a pressure of 20 tons per square inch on firing, which had "Q" suffixed to the name. World War I shells were marked "A.Q." denoting special 4 C.R.H. shells for this gun.

Gonfaloniere

The Gonfaloniere was a highly prestigious communal post in medieval and Renaissance Italy, notably in Florence and the Papal States. The name derives from "gonfalone", the term used for the banners of such communes.
In Florence the post was known as Gonfaloniere of Justice, being held by one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government, or Signoria. In the papal states it was known as Gonfaloniere of the Church or Papal Gonfaloniere. Other central and northern Italian communes, from Spoleto to Piemonte, elected or appointed "gonfalonieri." The Bentivoglio family of Bologna aspired to this office during the sixteenth century. A century later, however, when Artemisia Gentileschi painted a portrait of Pietro Gentile as a gonfaloniere of Bologna in 1622, with the "gonfalone" in the background, the office had merely symbolic value.

Gonfaloniere of Justice

Gonfaloniere of Justice ("Gonfaloniere di Giustizia") was a post in the government of medieval and early Renaissance Florence. Like Florence's Priori, it was introduced in 1293 when Giano Della Bella's Ordinamenti di Giustizia came into force.
He was one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government, or Signoria. As "Gonfaloniere di Giustizia" he was the temporary standard-bearer of the Republic of Florence and custodian of the city's banner, which was displayed from the yardarm of a portable cross. Along with the voting rights of the other Priori, he was also in charge of the internal security forces and the maintenance of public order. To distinguish him from his other eight colleagues, his crimson coat, lined with ermine, was further embroidered with golden stars. Each of Florence's neighborhoods, or "rioni", had its own "priore" who might be selected to serve on the council, and its own "gonfaloniere di compagnia" selected from the first families of each quarter.
History.
Prelude.
13th century Italy was a 'land of cities' and Florence was one of the richest and most politically restless among them. The most obvious signs of this prosperity and economic power were its striking of 3.5 gram gold florins and the presence of the city's large mercantile and financier companies right across Europe and Africa. These companies' leaders demanded increasing involvement in the city's political life, claiming equal or greater dignity than the old noble families who held now unproductive rural land outside the town. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Arti Maggiori would be key to the city's economic ascent and the middle class's revenge on the feudal nobility. This state of affairs would last until at least 1347, when the English monarchy's bankruptcy due to its high military expenditure in the Hundred Years' War dragged even the Bardi and Peruzzi businesses (the latter alone owed around 600,000 guilders) into ruin.
After the Ordinances.
The post of Gonfaloniere survived practically until the abolition of the Republican constitution by the Medici on their return to the city in 1530. Indeed, in the 15th century the post was given to many members of the Medici family and their neighboring and allied families, giving them a kind of recognized power within the republican framework and "de facto" (though never "de iure") allowing them to take over the powers of the other old magistracies.
After the expulsion of Piero the Unfortunate in 1494 and during the brief rule of Girolamo Savonarola (executed in 1498), the Florentine families tried to reorganise the city government on the model of the old communal magistracies. Pier Soderini was in 1502 appointed gonfaloniere for life, but only held it until the end of 1512, when the Medici returned and Piero decided to abandon the city. During his tenure, Soderini held more direct political responsibility than either Cosimo de' Medici or Lorenzo de' Medici. Machiavelli served as his secretary. Although many of the "Ottimati" or aristocrats had supported Soderini's candidacy for Gonfaloniere a Vita, believing he would support their interests, they turned against him when his popular leanings became clear. In 1512, after fierce resistance to imperial troops under Charles V and pope Julius II, it was finally forced to surrender. This marked the end of the republican dream and its offices, with the start of the ascent of the grand-ducal Medici dynasty.

Dangerous driving

In United Kingdom law, dangerous driving is a statutory offence. It is also a term of art used in the definition of the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. It replaces the former offence of reckless driving.
England and Wales and Scotland.
Statute.
This offence is created by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991): 
"Dangerously".
A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously for the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 if 
In this context, "dangerous" refers to danger either of injury to any person or of serious damage to property; and in determining what would be expected of, or obvious to, a competent and careful driver in a particular case, regard shall be had not only to the circumstances of which he could be expected to be aware but also to any circumstances shown to have been within the knowledge of the accused. 
In "Attorney General's Reference (No 4 of 2000)" (2001) 2 Cr. App. R. 417 Woolf CJ said at p 422:
Thus, whereas the underlying test of dangerousness is objective, a test based on the concept of "obviousness" considers the extent of knowledge as to causation. This test is hybrid, drawing both on the actual subjective knowledge that the accused had in his or her mind at the time the "actus reus" of driving occurred, and on the knowledge that would have been in the mind of a reasonable person (see "mens rea" and criminal negligence for discussion on the nature of these tests and the scope of the reasonable person).
The Court of Appeal held in the case of R v Banister that police drivers get no special treatment. "...the special skill (or indeed lack of skill) of a driver is an irrelevant circumstance when considering whether the driving is dangerous."
Sentence.
In England and Wales and Scotland, a person guilty of dangerous driving is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years, or to a fine, or to both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.
Any conviction for dangerous driving for a driver holding a licence issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland) or Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (for licences issued in England, Wales or Scotland) will result in a mandatory disqualification if the offence took place in the United Kingdom proper, Isle of Man or Republic of Ireland (see also Traffic violations reciprocity). The driver must return to being a learner driver, even if the offence did not result in death or grievous bodily harm, and an extended practical driving test, about 70 minutes long and about 30 minutes longer than the regular driving test, must be taken by the driver to regain his or her full driving licence.
History.
The offence of causing death by reckless driving was created by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 and then by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. It was abolished, and replaced with the offence of causing death by dangerous driving by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991.
After it was substituted by section 50(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 read as follows:
A person guilty of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. Guidance as to sentencing was given in R v Boswell 79 Cr App R 277, 1 WLR 1047, [1984 3 All ER 353, 6 Cr App R (S) 257, RTR 315, [1984 Crim LR 502, CA.
The offence of dangerous driving was created by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972. It was abolished by section 50 of the Criminal Law Act 1977.
The expression "motor vehicle" was defined by section 190(1), and the expressions "drive" and "road" were defined by section 196(1).
"Recklessly"
The mens rea of this offence was considered in R v Lawrence AC 510, [1981 2 WLR 524, 73 Cr App R 1, 1 All ER 974, [1981 RTR 217, Crim LR 409, HL, reversing 71 Cr App R 291.
Northern Ireland.
Statute.
This offence is created by article 10 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/2994 (N.I.)).
Sentence.
A person guilty of dangerous driving is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both. 
Causing death or grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving.
This offence is created by article 9 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/2994 (N.I.)).
It carries a mandatory disqualification of at least 24 months.
Prevention.
Research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. A key article by Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.

Marange diamond fields

The Marange diamond fields are an area of widespread small-scale diamond production in Chiadzwa, Mutare West, Zimbabwe. 'Although estimates of the reserves contained in this area vary wildly, some have suggested that it could be home to one of the world's richest diamond deposits'. The hugely prolific fields are regarded by some experts as the world's biggest diamond find in more than a century. Production from Marange is controversial due to ongoing legal wrangles and government crackdowns on illegal miners and allegations of forced labour. In terms of carats produced, the Marange field is the largest diamond producing project in the world, estimated to have produce 16.9 million carats in 2013, or 13% of global rough diamond supply. Marange is estimated to have produced 12.0 million carats in 2012, 8.7 million carats in 2011, and 8.2 million carats in 2010. 
Ownership.
From the early 1980s, De Beers held an Exclusive Prospecting Order (EPO) over Marange via their subsidiary Kimberlitic Searches Ltd. Their EPO expired in 2006 and exploration rights were taken up by British-registered African Consolidated Resources. Production from Marange is controversial due to ongoing legal wrangles and government crackdowns on illegal miners. In December 2006, the company was readying trial mining operations when the Government of Zimbabwe took over the rights via the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, despite African Consolidated Resources winning a court case allowing them to continue mining.
In April 2010 the High Court of Zimbabwe ruled that the government could sell diamonds from Marange as it dismissed an application from British-based African Consolidated Resources to stop diamond sales from the disputed fields.
In September 2010, the Zimbabwe High Court formally revoked a ruling from a year earlier that restored mining rights to British-based, African Consolidated Resources Plc.
As of February 2014, the diamond fields are operated by 7 private entities all of which are partnered with the Zimbabwe government under the affiliate Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC). All 7 of the private companies are allegedly affiliated with Zimbabwe ex-military or political officials. The 7 companies currently operating are: Marange Resources, Anjin Investments Ltd., Diamond Mining Company, Gyn Nyame Resources, Jinan Mining Ltd., Kusena Diamonds, and Mbada Diamonds. 
Mineral rush.
A mineral rush began in September 2006, but accelerated following the government take-over. By mid-December 2006, around 10,000 illegal artisanal miners were working very small plots at Marange, and an immediate water, sanitation and housing crisis developed. The miners initially sold their diamonds to the government, but a black market rapidly developed, offering better prices.
Involvement of Zimbabwe government officials.
Although the official plan was for the government to mine at Marange, in practice mining has been carried out to the benefit of senior government and Zanu-PF officials and those close to them, with little income returned to the government. Speaking anonymously, a Harare-based diplomat said
Government crackdowns.
The government launched police crackdowns against illegal miners and smugglers several times since December 2006. In response to a call by the World Diamond Council for a clampdown on smuggling, in November 2008 the Air Force of Zimbabwe was sent, after some police officers began refusing orders to shoot the illegal miners. Up to 150 of the estimated 30,000 illegal miners were shot from helicopter gunships. In 2008 some Zimbabwean lawyers and opposition politicians from Mutare claimed that Shiri was the prime mover behind the military assaults on illegal diggers in the diamond mines in the east of Zimbabwe. Estimates of the death toll by mid-December range from 83 reported by the Mutare City Council, based on a request for burial ground, to 140 estimated by the (then) opposition Movement for Democratic Change - Tsvangirai party. The military operation, known as "Operation No Return", also involved searching travellers into and out of the Mutare West area, with people found in possession of foreign currency or diamonds being detained and being forced to fill in holes on the diamond fields.
On 28 January 2009, the government announced plans to resettle some 4,700 villagers from Chiadzwa to the 12,000 ha Transau Farm, on the Odzi River. Although Manicaland Provincial Governor Christopher Mushohwe said that the move had the full support of the local traditional leaders, Chiadzwa villagers protested the resettlement.
Torture.
The BBC, the British state broadcaster, claims Zimbabwe's security forces have a torture camp in the Marange diamond fields; methods include severe beatings, sexual assault and dog mauling according to alleged victims.
International response.
Zimbabwe is a participant in the Kimberley Process (KP), that regulates trade in diamonds, although by June 2007 the KP annual plenary stated that it
The World Diamond Council has called for a clampdown on smuggling of diamonds from Zimbabwe. In December 2008, the Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition, representing non-governmental organisations which participate in KP, called for Zimbabwe's suspension. In a statement issued by Global Witness, the coalition said
On November 5, 2009, however, the Kimberley Process conducted its annual meeting in Namibia and decided against the suspension of Zimbabwe. Instead, it recommended and then implemented with the compliance of the Zimbabwean government a 12-month working plan to monitor diamonds mined from the Marange field. The plan is aimed towards preventing exports curbing illegal digging, stopping smuggling of diamonds from Marange, better securing the area, improving the accounting and auditing of Marange diamonds, and supervising exports from the mine.
Many NGO’s came out in support of the plan, while others protested it as shielding Zimbabwe’s alleged grave human rights abuses. The Rapaport Group, chaired by Martin Rapaport, went so far as to ban traders on its internet diamond trading network from trading any diamonds from the Marange fields.
Towards the end of 2009, it was claimed that Marange diamonds were being smuggled out of Zimbabwe through Mozambique.
On May 6, 2010, the KP Chair reminded all participants that they should maintain vigilance to ensure that Marange diamonds comply with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The five-page notice also included photographs and descriptions of rough diamonds from the Marange fields: "On first sight, strong 'gravel' impression resembling rounded pebbles in a riverbed. Look like tumbled and abraded coarse chips of broken beer bottles with colours ranging from dark brown to black to darkish green. Most surfaces are matt (sic) and dulled with rounded corners and edges. Broken surfaces display 'metallic-like' lustre." The report also contains photographs showing Marange diamonds in various stages of processing, so they can be recognized if they are mixed in with a legitimate diamond export.
In July 2010 the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme agreed that diamonds from Marange could be sold on the international market after a report from the Scheme's monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as conflict-free.
Sale of Marange Diamonds.
In 2010 Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the government could sell Marange diamonds. International pressure group Global Witness warned Zimbabwe against selling diamonds until the government complied with plans agreed with diamond monitors, the Kimberley Process to reform mining at Marange. In June 2010 the Kimberley Process monitor appointed to review procedures and conditions at Marange reported that, "Based on evidence provided by the government of Zimbabwe and private investors, and on...first-hand assessment of the situation, Zimbabwe has satisfied the minimum requirements of the KPCS for trade in rough diamonds".
In September 2010, the Zimbabwe High Court formally revoked a ruling from a year earlier that restored mining rights to British-based, African Consolidated Resources Plc.
In August 2010 Zimbabwe resumed the sale of diamonds from the Marange fields. On August 11, buyers flew into the country's capital, Harare, from all over the world, including Israel, India, Lebanon and Russia to capitalise on the sale of over US$1.5 billion worth of diamonds. Press Reports describe the Marange find as, 'the biggest in southern Africa since diamonds were discovered in South Africa a century ago'.
In September 2013, Belgian and diamond industry officials successfully lobbied the European Union to lift sanctions on ZMDC diamonds. In December 2013, the first European Union Marange auction took place in Antwerp and fetched $10 million for 300,000 carats, working out to a price of just over $30 per-carat on average. A second auction is scheduled for February 12-21, 2014 where another 300,000 carats will be sold. 
Global Witness Quits Group on ‘Blood Diamonds’.
The New York Times reported on Monday, December 5, 2011 Global Witness, withdrew from the Kimberley Process coalition, saying that it felt the effort no longer effectively ensured that conflict diamonds did not make their way onto retail markets. The organization is the first advocacy group to leave the program. While the organization had expressed concerns over the operation of the Kimberley Process for some time, the final straw leading to its withdrawal was the decision to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds from the Marange fields, where there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses by government security forces. “It’s the most egregious situation that we’ve seen since the Kimberley Process was launched, where diamonds have been fueling violence and human rights violations, and the Kimberley has really failed to deal with that effectively,” said Annie Dunnebacke, the senior campaigner for Global Witness. The diamond industry was “hiding behind the Kimberley Process,” Ms. Dunnebacke said, adding that many traders and dealers did not perform due diligence in checking the actual source of the diamonds they were dealing. “They’ve just been saying, ‘We have the Kimberley Process for diamonds, so that’s that. We’ve solved the problem of blood diamonds.’” Farai Maguwu, the director of the Zimbabwe-based Centre for Research and Development, which is also a member of the Kimberley Process, said he believed Global Witness’s withdrawal was not enough to bring down the entire Kimberley Process. But, he said, “it’s a very big blow. The Kimberley Process will never be the same without the Global Witness,” Mr. Maguwu said. “A very influential member of the Kimberley Process has cast a vote of no confidence in the Kimberley Process, which will affect the way the whole world views the Kimberley Process going forward.”
Water Poisoning.
A 2012 study commissioned by the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association (ZELA) and conducted by the University of Zimbabwe found that operations at the diamond fields are releasing dangerous chemicals into the Save River. This is having dire consequences on the communities that live downstream from the river and there was panic in October 2012 when residents of these communities learned of the findings of the report and the potential medical effects this could have. Three diamond mining companies were found to be at fault; Anjin, Diamond Mining Corporation and Marange Resources.
Rigged Elections.
In 2013, US-based investigative platform 100 Reporters, published Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) documents revealing how $1 billion diamond revenues and support from companies including Mbada, Anjin and China Sonangol, would be invested in security and intelligence measures designed to rig the elections. The article identified the Chinese role (including an official from the Chinese Communist Party),and alleged kickbacks to leaders in the SADC, dated May 2013, with the intent of having Mugabe become chair. Soon after the elections, this came to pass. The CIO listed specific steps taken to numerically rig the polls: "Registering less than ten real voters on “any given day with direct command from Nikuv” and the Party; Populating the voters’ roll before, and during, elections to counter unfavorable voting outcomes; Parallel registration and mobilization for “statistical maneuvering, depopulation and population of hostile constituencies,” in coordination with the Registrar’s Office and an official of the Chinese Communist Party identified in the documents as Chung Huwao; Obstructing registration in the 18-35 age brackets, and over-registering voters in the 35-90 age brackets; Using housing schemes to “re-orient beneficiaries” and log them on the voting roll; Deliberately congesting the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission registration by “security personnel and trusted lieutenants to delay the process as advised by Nikuv.”

John Ake

John Leckie Ake (August 29, 1861 – May 11, 1887) was an American Major League Baseball player who played mainly as a third baseman for the 1884 Baltimore Orioles of the American Association (AA). Before and after his Major league career, he played for many professional minor league baseball teams from 1881 until his death in 1887. Described as a good and popular player, he died when the boat he was travelling in capsized, and not knowing how to swim, he drowned.
Career.
He began his professional baseball career in 1882 when he joined a club located in his hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania, having played for a local non-professional team the year before. He played for this professional club through the 1883 season, before signing a "Major League" contract with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association.
In the short time he was with the Orioles, he played in 13 games, playing mostly at third base, but also played three games in the outfield, and one game at shortstop. He batted .192 in 52 at bats, collected ten hits, one triple, and scored one run.
When Baltimore released him mid-season, he finished the year playing for a team in Fort Smith, Ohio. The following season, he played for a team in Youngstown, Ohio, followed by a team Meriden, Connecticut for the 1886 season. Later in 1886, he transferred to the Boston Blues when they bought out the Meriden team. After the season, he signed with a St. Louis, Missouri team, which was later moved to Indianapolis. He secured his release from the club shortly thereafter so he could sign with the Duluth, Minnesota club.
Death.
He playing for the Duluth club when he was riding in a boat on the Mississippi River near La Crosse, Wisconsin with teammates Bill Barnes and Billy Earle, when it was capsized by a passing by steamboat. Barnes and Earle quickly swam to shore, but Ake, who did not know how to swim, hoisted himself on the overturned boat. Barnes and Earle looked on as Ake decided to jump from the boat and attempt to swim ashore, but after a couple strokes, shouted for help and went under, drowning. Barnes later recalled the way Earle looked at Ake the entire time. Earle, sometimes described as a "wierdo", "creepy", and as having an "evil eye", had an expression that Barnes never forgot. His body was never recovered from the river.

Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia

On 5 December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a British watchdog group, blacklisted content on the English version of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia related to Scorpions' 1976 studio album "Virgin Killer", due to the presence of its controversial cover artwork, depicting a young girl posing nude, with a faux glass shatter obscuring her genitalia. The image was deemed to be "potentially illegal content" under English law which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children. The IWF's blacklist are used in web filtering systems such as Cleanfeed.
The URL to the image's , which depicts the cover art, was also blacklisted; however thumbnails and the image itself remained accessible. The album cover had been deemed controversial at the time of its release, and was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members. The IWF described the image as "a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18". state that it does not censor content "that some readers consider objectionable or offensive, even exceedingly so," and as such only remove inappropriate content that is irrelevant, clearly vandalism, or illegal under the laws of the US State of Florida, where the site's servers were located. 
As well as the direct consequence of censoring the article and image for UK based readers of the English Wikipedia through the affected ISPs (a censoring that could be circumvented), and that the album cover was being made available unfiltered on other major sites including Amazon.co.uk (from which it was later removed), and available for sale in the UK, the action also had some indirect effects on Wikipedia, namely temporarily preventing all editors using said ISPs in the UK from contributing to any page of the encyclopaedia, and preventing anonymous edits from these ISPs while the URL remained on the blacklist. This was described by the IWF as unintended "collateral damage". This was due to the proxies used to access Wikipedia, as Wikipedia implements a blocking policy whereby contributors can be blocked if they vandalise the encyclopaedia. Therefore all vandalism coming from one ISP would be directed through one proxy—hence one IP—and all of the ISP's customers using that proxy would be barred from editing.
After invoking its appeals procedure and reviewing the situation, the IWF reversed their blacklisting of the page on 9 December 2008, and announced that they would not blacklist other copies of the image hosted outside the UK.
Background.
The album art of the Scorpions' album "Virgin Killer" was deemed controversial at the time of its release, featuring a young girl fully nude with a "smashed glass" effect covering her genitalia. The cover was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members. RCA refused to sell the controversial album cover in the United States. The cover was not the only Scorpions' cover which caused controversy however, as the covers for "Taken by Force" and "Lovedrive" have also caused controversy with their content.
In the United Kingdom, access to illegal content (such as child pornography) was strictly self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses data obtained from the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content to be added to their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.
Addition to IWF blacklist.
On 5 December 2008 the Internet Watch Foundation added the Wikipedia URLs for the "Virgin Killer" article and the description page of the image to its blacklist. After the blacklisting, users of major UK ISPs, including BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media/Tesco.net, Be/O2, EasyNet/UK Online/Sky Broadband, Orange, Demon, and TalkTalk (Opal Telecom), were unable to access the content.
Sarah Robertson, director of communications for the IWF, said that the image was rated "1 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least offensive". She described the picture as "erotic posing with no sexual activity". While the image itself has not been flagged as "illegal", IWF determined it to be a "potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18."
The IWF said they were first notified of the Wikipedia URL on Thursday, 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by US-based social conservative site "WorldNetDaily" to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia." "EContent" magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the "Virgin Killer" cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases". However, according to "The Guardian" because "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on." Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win," before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly "given that you can go into HMV and buy a copy on the high street". On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages on the basis of the "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".
Effects on Wikipedia.
The blacklisting of "Virgin Killer" also caused other inadvertent issues for Wikipedia users in the United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites. However, as a result of ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of proxy servers. This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users". This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without , who contribute merely under an IP address and not a user name.
The MediaWiki software that Wikipedia runs on can interpret X-Forwarded-For (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia to identify a user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy server IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to the actions of a single user). However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass X-Forwarded-For information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia. IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors. Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine.
Due to erroneous use of BGP and other routing technology to redirect the connections to the filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of Pakistan's accidental blocking of YouTube for much of the world instead of only their own citizens.
Responses.
On 7 December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation which supports Wikipedia, issued a press release about the blacklisting of their sites by the IWF stating that they had "no reason to believe the article, or the image contained in the article, has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world", and noting that not just the image but the article itself had been blocked.
On 9 December 2008, Jimmy Wales, who holds the board-appointed "community founder" seat on the Wikimedia Board of Trustees, told the UK's Channel 4 News that he had briefly considered legal action. After the block had been removed, Mike Godwin, general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation, stated "there is still plenty to be troubled by in the operations of the Internet Watch Foundation and its blacklist".
On 9 December 2008, the IWF rescinded the block, issuing the following statement:
Aftermath.
The incident was commented in some countries implementing or considering to implement Internet filtering or censorship plans. In Australia, Electronic Frontiers Australia vice-chairman Colin Jacobs said that " incident in Britain, in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country's Internet Watch Foundation had blacklisted a single image on the site, illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering". "The Sydney Morning Herald" has commented that "Ironically, the banning of the image has only made it visible to more people as news sites publicise the issue and the image spreads across sites other than Wikipedia." an example of the Streisand effect.
At the time of the incident Amazon US were also displaying the image on their site and the IWF stated that it "might yet add Amazon US to its list of 'blocked' sites for hosting the picture"; however, Amazon subsequently took the decision to remove the image from their site.
In an impact study preparing a bill dealing with cybercrime, the Government of France listed the Virgin Killer block as an example of indiscriminate filtering.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticised the IWF's reasoning:
The IWF continues to assert that the image is indeed child porn, and asserts that the image would be blocked if it were on a British server.

Nai (pan flute)

The nai (archaic: muscal) is a Romanian and also Moldavian diatonic pan flute used since the 17th century and used in "lăutari" bands.
Structure.
The nai has usually at least 20 pipes made of bamboo or reed. They are arranged in a curved array, allowing a greater speed of play. Generally the longer, lower pipes are on the right. The pitch of each pipe is adjusted with beeswax; usually nais are tuned in G for Romanian folk music, or in C for classical. Traditional Romanian pan flutes have tubes with varying diameters which go from wide to narrow as you go up the scale, to maintain the volume/length ratio of the tube and therefore produce the best consistent tone quality.

Loma Linda, California

Loma Linda (Spanish for Beautiful Hill) is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States, that was incorporated in 1970. The population was 23,261 at the 2010 census, up from 18,681 at the 2000 census. The central area of the city was originally known as Mound City and its eastern half was known as Bryn Mawr..
Geography.
Loma Linda is located in the San Bernardino Valley and is part of the Inland Empire. It is bordered on the north by San Bernardino, on the east by Redlands, on the west by Colton, and on the south by Riverside County. A small area of unincorporated territory separates Loma Linda from the city of Moreno Valley to the south.
The remnants of Bryn Mawr were annexed by the City in 2006.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 99.99% of it land.
Water contamination and air pollution.
Ground water near Loma Linda is contaminated by a plume of the chemical perchlorate which was used in the manufacture of solid rocket fuel. Also, this chemical was formerly (decades ago and in very small amounts) prescribed by physicians to control the overactive thyroid glands of certain patients. Attempts to quantify the effects of low-level exposure to perchlorate have met with resistance from environmental (and other) activists. A nearby plant operated by Lockheed Aerospace has been implicated in the improper disposal of the rocket fuel ingredient, which leached into the ground water northeast of Loma Linda. Loma Linda's municipal water supply, nevertheless, has been unaffected by the plume, primarily because Lockheed Martin installed a $19 million treatment plant in 2010 to remove both perchlorate and trichloroethylene from water after pumping it from the aquifer. The San Bernardino Valley has some of the worst breathing-air quality in the United States, because of the prevailing westerly winds that blow large amounts of pollutants from Los Angeles County into this area of San Bernardino County.
Demographics.

Education.
The city of Loma Linda is part of the Redlands Unified School District, with Bryn Mawr Elementary School being situated within Loma Linda city limits. However, the western edge of the city is served by the Colton Unified School District. Also located in the city are Loma Linda Academy, a K-12 institution, and Loma Linda University, both of which are run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
Notable features.
Loma Linda is a center of activity for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and is home to Loma Linda University, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian health sciences institution of higher learning with a world-renowned medical center. Notable firsts at the Loma Linda University Medical Center include baboon-to-human heart transplant and the first split-brain surgery. Animal Planet television show Venom ER was filmed at the medical center, as well.
Loma Linda was featured by National Geographic Magazine as one of the three places in the world with the highest longevity. Dan Buettner considers this community to be a Blue Zone.
Since a popular practice of Seventh-day Adventists is vegetarianism, most restaurants in Loma Linda feature a vegetarian menu in addition to regular menu items. The Loma Linda Baker's Drive-Thru was the first in that fast-food chain to feature the "Loma Linda Kitchen" vegetarian menu. The chain has since dropped the Loma Linda name for the menu and expanded its vegetarian choices.
Due to the large number of Loma Linda residents who are Seventh-day Adventists, the city was one of the few which had weekend mail delivery service on Sunday instead of Saturday. However, this distinction ended on April 23, 2011, when Saturday delivery resumed as part of a Post Office cost-cutting effort.
Sister cities.
Loma Linda is currently twinned with Manipal, India as its sister city.

Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) is a teaching hospital on the campus of Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California, United States. The medical center serves as a level I trauma center for San Bernardino County and the rest of the Inland Empire. The hospital has two helipads for use by an air ambulance or other helicopter medical transport. 
The main tower of the center was built in 1967 and is 11-stories high. It is one of the tallest buildings in the Inland Empire. Because of its height and white coloration, it is possible to view the main hospital building from various locations around the San Bernardino valley and mountains. The hospital is currently undergoing a seismic upgrade project.
Loma Linda University Medical Center made international news on October 26, 1984, when Dr. Leonard L Bailey transplanted a baboon heart into Baby Fae, an infant born with a severe heart defect known as left hypoplastic heart. Unfortunately, Baby Fae died a few weeks later. However, this effort led to the successful infant heart transplant program, with transplantation of human-to-human infant transplants. LLUMC is home to the Venom E.R., which specializes in snake bites.
Loma Linda University Children's Hospital.
Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital is the sole children’s hospital for almost 1.3 million of California’s youth (San Bernardino, Riverside, Inyo,and Mono Counties) . 
With over 275 beds just for chidlren, the American Board of Surgeons has designated the Children’s Hospital as a Level 1 Trauma Center, providing the highest level of trauma care within the Inland Empire four-county area. Each year, more than 15,000 children stay at the hospital and over 130,000 children visit the hospital for ambulatory care. The only medical facility in the Inland Empire specializing in the care of children, Children’s Hospital transports over 1,100 critically ill or injured children each year from surrounding hospitals.
Loma Linda University.
LLUMC is affiliated with Loma Linda University, which includes schools of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, allied health, religion, public health, and science and technology.
The James M. Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center.
The James M. Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) offers proton therapy treatments for prostate, lung, brain and other types of cancers. This center is the nation's first hospital-based proton treatment center. Since its opening in 1990 over 14,500 patients have been treated. Through a multidisciplinary approach, teams of experts including radiation oncologists, nurses, technicians and staff treat patients with care to ensure they experience fewer side effects and better outcomes with the power and precision of proton therapy.
Proton radiation treatment differs from standard radiation therapy. If given in sufficient doses, conventional radiation therapy techniques will control many cancers. Because of the physician's inability to adequately conform the (conventional) irradiation pattern to the cancer, healthy tissues may be damaged with radiation. Consequently, a less-than-desired dose frequently is used to reduce damage to healthy tissues and avoid subsequent unacceptable side effects. The characteristics of proton beam therapy enable the physician to deliver full or higher doses while sparing surrounding healthy tissues and organs. Proton treatment is notably valuable for treating localized, isolated, solid tumors before they spread to other tissues and to the rest of the body.
Using high-energy protons for medical treatment was first proposed in 1946. Protons were first used to treat patients with certain cancers less than 10 years later. Research and laboratory applications increased rapidly in the next three decades. It was not until the opening of the James M. Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center at Loma Linda University Medical Center in 1990, however, that the full benefits of proton treatment could be offered to patients with a wide variety of cancers.
The synchrotron was invented in the 1950s to produce higher-energy particles for studying subnuclear matter. Much of that work was done at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Fermilab physicists and engineers built the proton accelerator that exists at Loma Linda University Medical Center today. LLUMC's accelerator is the world's smallest variable-energy proton synchrotron. It is designed to deliver a beam of energy sufficient to reach the deepest tumors in patients.
Heart & Surgical Hospital.
In May 2008, it was announced that LLUMC had been in talks since December and had finalized a buyout of the 28-bed California Heart and Surgical Center (CHSC) located approximately two miles east of the main campus on the border of Loma Linda and Redlands, CA. This was a marked departure of their previous position of opposition to the facility when it was first proposed in 2005. The CHSC would have been a for-profit facility while the LLUMC is a non-profit facility and it was feared by area hospitals, including Loma Linda, that the CHSC would take all the paying patients. However, Loma Linda finalized the construction and furnishing of the center and in January 2009, they received state approval to open and begin operations at the Heart & Surgical Hospital. The daVinci Robot that was operated at the Medical Center to perform minimally invasive robotic surgeries was moved to the Surgical Hospital. There are also plans to install a second.
Medicare Fraud.
Loma Linda University Medical Center and subsidiary entities have been involved in several Medicare fraud lawsuits from the federal government.
Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center paid 2.2 million dollars to settle a federal lawsuit that the organization had fraudulently over-billed federal health insurance programs. The lawsuit alleged that the center had worked with its billing service to prepare two different cost reports, one for internal use and an inflated one to bill Medicare.
A group of 20 physician corporations paid 2.2 million dollars to settle a federal lawsuit over fraudulent Medicare billings reviewed under the Physicians at Teaching Hospitals (PaTH) initiative. The lawsuit alleged that the hospital had been billing Medicare for procedures done by residents and interns as if they had been done by the attending physicians.
Seismic Upgrade Project.
The main hospital building is currently undergoing a seismic upgrade project. It is being headed by Turner Construction Company of New York, NY. The project includes reinforcing the main building to bring it up to more modern standards.

Televisionary

The concept of a ‘Televisionary’ is being used to describe television and communications network operators who are developing services that provide consumers with more control over when, where and how they consume video and other multimedia content. The services provided by a Televisionary are the basis for a new consumer experience that has been described as the Individual Television Experience. The concepts of Televisionary, Individual Television Experience and Personalized TV Experience are closely linked. 
The Televisionary concept is closely linked to multi-platform service capabilities for television and communications network operators who deliver video content to multiple screens (TV, PC and mobile phone) seamlessly including high-definition video. A Televisionary service provider is one that enables consumers to achieve interactivity between the TV, PC and mobile devices, which should be able to talk to each other and have instant, real-time access to the Internet regardless of their location, supporting services such as user-generated content, voice services, SMS, MMS and Instant Messaging. 
The goal of enabling seamless, multi-screen services is considered the ultimate ambition for telecoms and broadband companies offering television services (IPTV) but is something that is still at the proof of concept stage. It will require a complicated technology and service ecosystem but there are realistic expectations that this will evolve from technologies that are available today. 
A Televisionary service provider will help transform the TV set from something that is considered a dumb terminal today to the controlling apex of consumer homes and mobile communications and entertainment. A Televisionary service provider enables time-shift television services such as Start-Over TV functionality and the ability to transfer recorded content from one device to another, such as television recordings taken from home and watched on a PC in the work environment.

Plot.
Five young people decide that life is not worth living anymore for various reasons.
Anand Babu, the son of a judge is an idealist and never suspects that the many gifts that are showered upon him by his father were things received as bribes. One day he shoots a video song about corruption in the society dressed as a robot. Seeing this, his friend remarks that his own father is very corrupt. The angered Anand Babu beats up his friend and challenges him that if that were true, he would commit suicide out of shame. Back at home, he sees his father taking a large amount of money as bribe for a lawsuit. The shocked Anand Babu argues with his father over his corrupt practices. His mother budges in and starts justifying corruption which has brought the family luxuries like the bungalow, car and Anand's Yamaha bike. Besides, a large amount of money is needed for the marriage dowry of their two daughters (Anand's sisters). Anand is unable to bear this and immediately sets fire to his new Yamaha bike. He leaves home.
Babloo is the only son of a rich business man (Cochin Haneefa). He is motherless. He is in love with the computer operator, Suguna (Vishali Kannadasan) working in his father's office. He is a happy-go-lucky guy. One day his father comes to know of their love and despises it as he has big plans to marry his son to the daughter of a rich, potential business partner. He threatens Babloo to not marrying Suguna. But the much pampered Babloo is adamant in marrying her. Meanwhile, Y. Vijaya, the widowed mother of Suguna also objects to their love, fearing for problems arising due to the difference in their social status. Cochin Haneefa comes up with a plan to stop the couple from marrying. He convinces Y. Vijaya in re-marrying him thereby making Babloo and Suguna as step-siblings. The couple is heartbroken. Babloo wants to commit suicide but Suguna wants to continue to live as the new step-daughter of the rich business man. She soon shows her own brand of revenge by heavy partying and boozing and having one night stands. Whenever arrested she proudly proclaims being the rich man's daughter.
Madhoo was forced into marriage with a very old but rich man and Ramya is a gang-rape victim. The other is a poor unemployed youth of high caste who does not get employment because of his forward caste status.
They all meet at suicide point and decide to live a happy life for 100 days and then end it all. In those 100 days, they have all sorts of fun. They also sing mourning songs for their own death. But one of them, the unemployed, secretly tries to change his friends' minds away from suicide. But they tell that their mind is made up and he can leave if he chooses to. But he prepones his suicide and informs them that he did so make them realise that death is no joke and if his friends changed their minds, his death would not be in vain. They soon start getting doubts about going ahead with their suicides.
Meanwhile, they find a baby at their doorstep and have no choice but to take care of the child. They get emotionally close to the child. Finally the dead friend's dad comes and meets them having tracked his son's letters with great difficulty. When informed of his son's death he mourns and accuses the remaining youths of being the cause of his death. The four decide to die immediately on hearing this. As they go to the suicide point, they meet their dead friend there. He says that he had faked his own death as well as arranged for the child and his father to dissuade them. His father takes the child to an orphanage and they meet people with various physical deformities trying to live a fruitful and cheerful life. After gaining inspiration from many of the disabled persons who had achieved things and also from the advice they give them, the four youths decide to life a long and brave life.

Gonfalone of the Church

The Banner of the Holy Roman Church (Latin: "Vexillum"; Italian: "Gonfalone di Santa Romana Chiesa", occasionally "Vessilio di San Pietro", "Standard of St. Peter") was the battle standard of the Papal States during the Renaissance and a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church. The office of the Gonfalonier of the Church was originally intended to function as its bearer.
Description.
The insignia was made of red cloth decorated, initially, with the image of St. Peter and occasionally later with St. Paul as well. Pope Innocent III (1198–1216) replaced these with the emblem of crossed keys surmounted by a white cross. Pope Boniface VIII (1294–1303) established the final form: a cloth of crimson silk, covered with numerous six-pointed stars embroidered in gold, bearing the image of the crossed keys surmounted by a canopy or veil bearing a gold tassel at either end. The banner was attached to a long golden rod and followed the pope in his travels, including solemn religious and civil processions (such as Corpus Christi).
History.
The Vexillum of Saint Peter came into use under Pope Alexander II during a critical period in the Investiture Controversy. Though the Holy Roman Emperor refused to recognise papal authority at the time, Alexander sought to strengthen his image via symbolic acts, such as granting the banner of St. Peter and a blessing to kings who in return offered themselves as his vassals, such as William the Conqueror before the Norman invasion. The banner was used for the highest-level investiture ceremonies, implying the Papacy's authority over temporal lords. Such banners were also present in the Crusades and at the battle of Lepanto.
Custody of the Vexillum of the Holy Roman Church was entrusted to a high-ranking figure, who assumed the title of "Gonfaloniere" or "Vessillifero di Santa Romana Chiesa" (Gonfalonier of the Holy Roman Church). It was the highest role the pope could grant to a layman, as demonstrated by several of its holders having been kings. Kingly holders included James II of Aragon (1267-1327, king of Sardinia and Corsica, from Pope Boniface VIII) and Ladislaus of Naples (1376–1414, king of Naples, Sicily and Hungary, by Pope Innocent VII). It was also granted to 
Pope Innocent XI (1676–1689) made the post hereditary and conferred it on marquess Giovanni Battista Naro. When the Naro family died out, it then passed to the patrician Montoros. To confirm the office's importance Pope Clement XI (1700–1721) ordered that its holder had to be escorted, in solemn procession, by the captains of the "Cavalleggeri" (Papal light cavalry). In 1801, Pope Pius VII, after the "Cavalleggeri" were dissolved, replaced them by instituting a new body, the Noble Pontifical Guard, with the standard-bearer acting as its captain with the rank of Tenente Generale. Finally, Pope Pius IX ordered that the office-holder was to be accorded a distinctive special collar showing the word "Vexillifer" and that the holder was always a member of the Papal court.

1990 Australian Touring Car season

The 1990 Australian Touring Car season was the 31st year of touring car racing in Australia since the first runnings of the Australian Touring Car Championship and the fore-runner of the present day Bathurst 1000, the Armstrong 500.
There were 12 touring car race meetings held during 1990; an eight round series, the 1990 Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC); a support programme event at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix and a three round series of long distance races, nicknamed 'enduros', which counted towards both the 1990 Australian Endurance Championship and the 1990 Australian Manufacturers' Championship.
Season review.
After two years domination by Dick Johnson Racings Ford Sierras, 1990 was to prove much of an upset year with race victories spread across seven teams with Nissan and Holden teams taking wins off the massed privateer Ford teams. The arrival of the Nissan Skyline GT-R towards the end of the Australian Touring Car Championship was enough for Jim Richards to take Nissan's first title in a four driver showdown again Ford Sierra threesome, Dick Johnson, Peter Brock and Colin Bond. Glenn Seton took his first race wins as a team owner beginning with the Sandown 500, while the Holden Racing Team took a memorable Bathurst win for Win Percy and Allan Grice outlasting the pack of Sierras on a day of attrition. Larry Perkins underlined Holden's return to form by winning Eastern Creek Raceways first major touring car race at the end of the season.

Y sólo tú

"Y sólo tú" (, "") was the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981, performed in Spanish by Bacchelli.
The song is a moderately up-tempo number in which Baccelli sings about his loved one, saying that he is happy only when both are together; ""Nada es igual si tú no estás"" (translated: ""Nothing is the same if you're not here"").
The song was performed tenth on the night, following France's Jean Gabilou with "Humanahum" and preceding the Netherlands' Linda Williams with "Het is een wonder"). At the close of voting, it had received 38 points, placing 14th in a field of 20.

Wood Quail

The Wood Quails are birds in the genus Odontophorus of the New World quail family, which are residents in forests in the Americas. The core range of the genus is centred in the lowlands and foothills of the northern Andes of Colombia and the mountain ranges of Central America; however, some species occur elsewhere in tropical and subtropical South America.
These are shy species, and as a consequence are amongst the most difficult Galliform birds to study or even observe. The best chance of seeing wood-quail is at dawn or dusk, when they may feed at the side of a road or on a forest track in family groups of up to 12 birds. Nevertheless, when protected they can become surprisingly tame, as has been shown at Paz de las Aves near Mindo, Ecuador, with the Dark-backed Wood-quail.
Wood Quails are 22–30 cm long, dumpy, short-tailed, stout-billed partridge-like birds with a bushy crest. The upperparts are dark brown, and the underparts are black, grey, brown or rufous. Some species have a striking black and white throat or facial markings. The sexes are similar, but in some species the female has a duller-coloured crest, and in others the underparts are more rufous or grey than in the male. The advertising calls are loud and distinctive duets consisting of repeated phrases, and are often the only indication that wood-quail are present.
For most wood quail, information has mainly come from specimens, and breeding behaviour and habits are little known. The majority of species, including the relatively widespread Spotted Wood Quail have never had the nest described. 
Those species for which the feeding habits are known forage on the ground, scratching at the soil for seeds, fallen fruit and insects. Wood quail are typically shy and wary; they will normally make good their escape on foot, but if startled will explode into a short fast flight into dense cover.
All woodquail species have been adversely affected by hunting and, in particular, rampant deforestation. Several species with restricted ranges are now considered threatened.

Hallvarðr Háreksblesi

Hallvarðr Háreksblesi was one of the skalds of Canute the Great. Nothing is known about his life or family but eight fragments of his poetry on Canute have been preserved. While Hallvarðr's poetry resembles that of Canute's other poets in many respects it is unusual in its heavy use of pagan imagery.
Extant fragments.
Six fragments of poetry by Hallvarðr are quoted in the Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda. One additional fragment is quoted in Knýtlinga saga and one in Heimskringla and kings' sagas derived from it. In Finnur Jónsson's complete edition of skaldic poetry the fragments are conjectured to be all from the same poem, a "Knútsdrápa" ("Lay of Canute"), and arranged in a suggested order. The first complete English translation was published by Roberta Frank in 1994.
The extant fragments are mainly about Canute's expedition to England and his becoming king there in 1015-1016. Apart from what little can be conjectured from this, nothing is known about the poet's life or origin. Finnur Jónsson believed he became one of Canute's court poets after the king's conquest of Norway in 1028.
Hallvarðr and other poets.
The refrain of Hallvarðr's "Knútsdrápa" compares Knútr's role on earth to that of the Christian God in Heaven.
Hallvarðr's refrain is very similar to that composed by his fellow poet, Þórarinn loftunga, who also compared the roles of Canute and God in his "Höfuðlausn". It is also reminiscent of the refrain of Gunnlaugr Wormtongue's poem about king Ethelred and, to a lesser extent, to those in Þórarinn loftunga's "Tøgdrápa" and Sighvatr Þórðarson's "Knútsdrápa", both about King Canute. 
Like Canute's other skalds, Hallvarðr emphasizes Canute's Danish ancestry and how his rule benefits Danish interests. He, however, differs somewhat from the other poets in describing Canute with imagery derived from Norse mythology, including references to valkyries, giants, the Midgard Serpent and the World Tree. In his kennings, he even refers to Canute with the names of pagan gods.
Critical reception.
Finnur Jónsson described Hallvarðr's poetic expressions as strong but not very original and the surviving verses as formally quite good but not very individual in character. Despite this, he noted that one of Hallvarðr's poems has an apparently new kenning for the breast (as seat of emotion and thought), based on the new religion; "the ship of prayer". Roberta Frank is more positive, describing Hallvarðr's poetry as "skaldic verse at its richest and most allusive, a startling blend of Christian and pagan imagery like that carved on the Gosforth cross."

Yr Arddu

Yr Arddu is a 389m high mountain peak in Snowdonia, Wales. It lies approximately 2.5 km south east of the village of Beddgelert and just over 1 km from the rather more famous mountain Cnicht. It is a rugged hill with widespread rock outcrops and cliffs. A small lake, Llyn yr Arddu, is located on the flanks of the mountain. 
The craggy nature of the summit is due to the presence of lavas and tuffs (volcanic ash deposits) dating from the Ordovician period when Snowdonia was characterised by numerous volcanic eruptions; Yr Arddu is a particularly good location to see the record of Ordovician volcanism. The Yr Arddu Tuffs may be the earliest eruptive phase of the Lower Rhyolitic Tuff Formation.
The whole mountain is a site of special scientific interest designated by the Countryside Council for Wales.
Yr Arddu is commonly approached by a footpath leaving the minor road that links Nantmor to Nant Gwynant but the final 0.5 km has no marked paths.

"Grown Men Don't Cry" is a song written by Tom Douglas and Steve Seskin, and performed by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in April 2001 as the first single from McGraw's "Set This Circus Down" album. The song reached Number-One on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart and peaked at number 25 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.
Background and writing.
One of the songwriters, Tom Douglas told The Boot the story behind the song. "I had gone to the grocery store one day, had parked my car and was walking into the store when I saw this woman talking on a pay phone. She had mascara tears running down her face, and her little boy was weaving in and out of her legs while she was talking on the phone and she looked like an ice cream cone, melting. I went in the store, got my groceries, came back out, and wondered what happened to them. And then I passed by a car, and they were in it. And in the back of the car were newspapers and Chef Boyardee cans. And I thought, what should I do? And I did nothing except get back in my car and go home. And I was haunted by my paralysis and inability to do anything about that. And that feeling started this song when I sat down to write with Steve. I had that first verse, and actually the second vignette was more Steve's life than it was mine ... about putting the rose on the grave and talking to the wind. And then the third verse was kind of a combination of both of our lives, but being tied together by singing, 'I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.'" 
Critical reception.
Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying that the positive review is due to the "combination of the vivid imagery and McGraw’s plaintive vocal performance." He goes on to say that the second verse "is so well-crafted, and McGraw delivers it so masterfully that it always surprises me, no matter how many times I hear it."
Chart performance.
"Grown Men Don't Cry" debuted at number 30 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the chart week of March 24, 2001.

Cavalleggeri

Cavalleggeri were an inferior category of cavalry during the classic period of feudal cavalry. This included knife-armed cavalry, lancers' pages and mounted crossbowmen. Later, "cavalleggeri" became a subsidiary arm of the gendarmerie.
In 1498, Louis XII of France gave this name to his mounted companies, forming a sort of mounted infantry, and this special body continued until 1570. In this era Henry IV of France formed a company of "cavalleggeri", well-educated and called ordinannce since it was used as the king's guard.
Other Italian states and communal militias created "cavalleggeri" units. In the Florentine Republic it was established that 500 mounted crossbowmen would be regularly enlisted, with the option of arming 10% of them with lances. These were also known as drappelli and were formed into bands, each of which was made up of 50 "cavalleggeri" and commanded by a "condotiere".
After 1600 this specialist cavalry was more and more streamlined and made more practical in the age of gunpowder. Such units were split up to increase numbers in heavy cavalry units, or turned into such units themselves. The "cavalleggeri" of this era were armed with carbines or pistols. In 1799, new "cavalleggeri" units were created, and under Napoleon these were once again armed with lances.

Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably calling it one of the best ballads of the year. She also says that McGraw's voice "oozes hurt and disillusionment." Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A- grade, saying that the song beings "with the sound of hushed acoustic strumming, the arrangement picks up force as the song progresses, but the focus of attention remains the story of a marriage gradually unraveling. He goes on to say that the song "all comes through in McGraw’s evocative performance, showcasing the layers of subtlety his voice had picked up in the years since his 'Indian Outlaw' days, while wife Faith Hill’s plaintive background vocals add a further layer of pathos."

Potentially hazardous object

A potentially hazardous object (PHO) is a near-Earth asteroid or comet with an orbit such that it has the potential to make close approaches to the Earth and is of a size large enough to cause significant regional damage in the event of impact. A potentially hazardous object with a reasonably well determined orbit can be known not to be a threat to Earth for the next 100 years or more.
Overview.
An object is considered a PHO if its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with respect to Earth is less than (approximately 19.5 lunar distances) and its diameter is at least 100 to 150 meters (330-500 ft). This is big enough to cause regional devastation to human settlements unprecedented in human history in the case of a land impact, or a major tsunami in the case of an ocean impact. Such impact events occur on average around once per 10,000 years. NEOWISE data estimates that there are 4,700 ± 1,500 potentially hazardous asteroids with a diameter greater than 100 meters. As of 2012, an estimated 20 to 30 percent of these objects have been found. Asteroids larger than 35 meters across can pose a threat to a town or city.
The diameter of most small asteroids is not well known and can only be estimated based on their brightness and distance. For this reason NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory use the more practical measure of absolute magnitude (H). Any asteroid with an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter is assumed to be of the required size, although only a coarse estimation of size can be found from the object's magnitude because an assumption must be made for its albedo which is also not usually known for certain. The NASA near-Earth object program uses an assumed albedo of 0.13 for this purpose.
By January 2009, NASA had listed 1006 potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) and 85 near-Earth comets (NECs). there are 1458 known PHAs and only 196 have an observation arc less than 30 days. There are 1230 know apollo-class PHAs and only 141 known Aten-class PHAs. Projects such as Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research and Catalina Sky Survey continue to search for more PHOs. Each one found is studied by various means, including optical, radar, and infrared to determine its characteristics, such as size, composition, rotation state, and to more accurately determine its orbit. Both professional and amateur astronomers participate in such monitoring.
During an asteroid's close approaches to planets or moons it will be subject to gravitational perturbation, modifying its orbit, and potentially changing a previously non-threatening asteroid into a PHA or vice versa. This is a reflection of the dynamic character of the Solar System.
The two main scales used to categorize the impact hazards of asteroids are the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale and the Torino Scale.

Belt Woods

Belt Woods is a nature reserve in Prince George's County, Maryland, containing the “South Woods”, a woodland which constitutes one of the last stands of virgin hardwood forest on the Atlantic coastal plain. It is a mere east of Washington, D.C. Many of its white oaks and tulip poplars are more than three feet in diameter and soar more than before branching. The “South Woods” were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. 
Belt Woods has been owned and protected by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources since the 1980s. Some at the site are designated a Natural Environment Area (NEA) and another are designated a Heritage Conservation Fund (HCF) site. Thus are protected in total. Within this area, the Maryland General Assembly has designated — within the NEA and within the HCF — as a special Maryland Wildland.
History.
Belt Woods is part of the former farm of semi-reclusive banker and gentleman farmer, Seton Belt (1870–1959). A bird breeding census first surveyed the tract in 1947; the density of Forest Interior Dwelling Species (FIDS) was then found to be 300 pairs/100 acres (1300 m² per pair). The oaks of the “North Woods”, an old-growth similar to the now-preserved “South Woods” tract, were all cut in 1981, despite the fact that Belt had stipulated in his will that the stand was never to be logged. Tom Horton, in his book "Bay Country" (1987), tells how this happened:The bank entrusted with administering Seton Belt’s estate, and the church to which he left his goods, found that the forest earned the highest accolades not just from naturalists and woodland songbirds. “Veneer quality”, eager buyers from the world’s leading timber concerns adjudged the massive, knot-free, straight trunks of the oaks. Debarked, steamed until soft, then sliced and peeled on huge machines into sheets just 1/4-inch thick, just a few of the Beltwoods giants would decorate acres of executive conference-room walls in warm wood tones. The church said it needed the money over and above the $10 million that old Belt had left it to build an urban home for the elderly. With the bank, it broke the will in court, and half the mighty Beltwoods fell to the chainsaw….The forester hired by the bank explained to me his satisfaction when the veneer deal went through. From the standpoint of annual, new cellulose production, he said, the old oaks were well into the area of diminishing returns, even though they might live another century or two. “The only thing left for that particular stand of trees to do was to die and fall over”, he said
This event served as a wakeup call to conservationists and an 18 year legal battle ensued between them and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. In 1984, the state of Maryland, with partners, purchased including the “South Woods”, designating them the Belt Woods Natural Environmental Area. Impending residential development necessitated the state’s purchase of an additional in 1997 — known as the Belt Woods Heritage Conservation Fund site. The HCF site, which consists of the former “North” and “Central Woods” (now young forest and fields), buffers the old growth forest and forestalls further development. In all, some are protected at the site, of which most (610 acres) were designated by the Maryland General Assembly in October 1997 as the Belt Woods Wildland. Access to Belt Woods is limited to scientific study.
Ecology.
Songbirds.
Belt Woods lies within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. It consists of a mosaic of small fields and woodlands and is a critical nesting area for neotropical songbirds. The density of birds breeding there is among the highest observed on the east coast. Unusually high densities of FIDS birds prevail. In 1989, the breeding bird census, which uses a territory mapping method, measured a density of more than 200 pairs/100 acres (40 ha) of FIDS, attributable largely to high densities of wood thrush and red-eyed vireo. Nine other species of FIDS birds regularly breed there, including the Kentucky warbler.
Flora.
The canopy of the mesic upland hardwood forest at Belt Woods is dominated by tulip poplar and white oak. Old-growth characteristics include 200-year old trees of over 140 feet (45 m) in height. Forty-two species of trees were measured in the “South Woods” in 2001. Prominent understory trees include flowering dogwood, spicebush, sweet haw and ironwood. The herbaceous layer, which is exceptionally dense in springtime, includes "Collinsonia", "Dioscorea", and broad beechfern. The narrowleaf glade fern and Wister’s coralroot — both Maryland state threatened species — grow here.

Lauritz Hartz

Lauritz Hartz (1903–1987) was a Danish artist, considered to be one of the country's finest colourists. 
Hartz studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen under Sigurd Wandel and Aksel Jørgensen where he quickly gained a reputation as a talented artist.
Suffering from schizophrenia, his health deteriorated from about 1935, requiring him to be hospitalised more and more frequently. Yet even after permanent hospitalisation Nykøbing Sjælland in 1942, he continued to paint, participating in the exhibitions of the Corner group of which he had been a founder member in 1932.
Hartz' earlier painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes were characterised by thick layers of paint. With time, the human form disappeared as his style became more sketchy. The once vivid colours were increasingly thinned down. Ultimately he reverted just to drawings and watercolours. 
The Holstebro Museum of Art in north-west Jutland holds the largest collection of Lauritz Hartz’ paintings.

Snow patches in Scotland

Long-lying snow patches in Scotland have been noted from at least the 18th century, with snow patches on Ben Nevis being observed well into summer and autumn. Indeed, the summit observatory, which operated from 1883 to 1904, reported that snow survived on the north-east cliffs through more years than it vanished.
More recently, additional and methodical field study on the subject has been carried out by others, most notably by ecologist Dr Adam Watson. Most of this work concentrated on the mountains of north-east Scotland (in particular, the Cairngorms), but more recent observations by him and others has shed light on various locations throughout Scotland where long-lying snow persists. The available information systematically gathered by observers over the last 50 years or so, and greatly increased since the 1990s, has built up a level of knowledge that points to Scotland’s snow patches being now amongst the best documented in the world.
General locations.
There are many locations on the Scottish mountains where snow lies regularly into July, August and even September, but the two main areas where snow virtually always lies longer than anywhere else are the Cairngorms and the Lochaber mountains. These areas contain all of Scotland's mountains in excess of , including Ben Nevis.
Other locations where snow has been known to survive: 
The Cairngorms.
As well as containing five of Scotland's highest mountains, the Cairngorms are the range where snow persists longest, and in more locations, than anywhere else in the UK. Ben Macdui, Cairn Gorm and Braeriach all contain long-lying patches that have been observed for many years. 
On Ben Macdui, snow has been known to persist at a few locations from one winter to the next, but the location where more survivals have been noted than any other is , close to the Garbh Uisge Beag, which drains into Loch Avon. This patch sits at an altitude of .
Lying at the north-eastern shoulder of Cairn Gorm is Ciste Mhairead. This hollow contains a patch which, hitherto, was known to persist through many years, but has not done so since 2000. Observations in 2007 and 2008 revealed that September was the month when final melting occurred for this patch. It sits at an altitude of and is located at approximately .
Braeriach's Garbh Choire Mòr is the place which contains Britain's most persistent snow beds. Snow has been absent from this corrie just 5 times in the last century: 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003 and 2006. Sitting at an altitude of about , these patches are located around ; the two most long-lasting patches are known as "the Pinnacles" and "the Sphinx" after the rock climbs lying above them.
In 1994, the Cairngorms and surrounding mountains of north-east Scotland had 55 surviving patches, an exceptional number.
Ben Nevis range.
As well as containing Scotland's highest mountain (Ben Nevis), Aonach Mòr, Aonach Beag and Càrn Mòr Dearg make up the other three mountains in excess of in this area. 
As mentioned above, Ben Nevis has long been known to hold snow late into the year. However, historical reports from the 19th century and early 20th century of snow being ever present on the mountain are virtually impossible to substantiate, so must remain speculative. Nevertheless, what is certainly true is that snow often persists from one winter to the next. Analysis of Ben Nevis's snow is not as comprehensive as that of the Cairngorms, but recent observations show that the last time Ben Nevis was snow-free was late 2006, snow having survived into the winters of 2007–08 and 2008–09. The largest patch, at Observatory Gully, sits at an altitude of around . The slightly lower patch at Point 5 gully has also been known to survive from one winter to the next.
Aonach Mòr has a corrie known to hold snow from one year to the next: Coire an Lochain. One of these patches, sitting behind a protalus rampart, sometimes survives longer than the patch slightly higher up against the tall cliffs. 
Below the cliffs of the north-east ridge on Aonach Beag there is a relatively little known snow-patch which, despite its low altitude (approximately ), has been Scotland's largest at the time of the arrival of the lasting new winter snows of 2007 and 2008. This patch does not appear in known literature on the subject and this suggests that it is very much under-recorded, which may be because it cannot readily be seen, even from the top of Aonach Mòr or Aonach Beag.

Five Star Jubilee

Five Star Jubilee is an American country music variety show carried by NBC-TV from March 17–September 22, 1961. The live program, a spin-off of ABC-TV's "Jubilee USA", was the first network color television series to originate outside New York City or Hollywood.
From March 17 to May 5, the weekly show aired on Fridays from 8–8:30 p.m. Eastern Time, but moved to 8:30–9 p.m. from May 12 to September 22. The series featured five rotating hosts: Snooky Lanson (first show March 17), Tex Ritter (March 24), Rex Allen (March 31), Jimmy Wakely (April 7) and Carl Smith (April 14). All five appeared on the May 12 show, which was the first in color. 
Produced from the Landers Theatre in Springfield, Missouri, the program was similar to "Jubilee USA" and featured some of the same cast, including Bobby Lord, Cecil Brower, Speedy Haworth and Slim Wilson's Jubilee Band. Barbara Mandrell (who had toured with Red Foley and a "Jubilee USA" personal appearance unit) made her network debut on the program at age 12. The final program was hosted by Foley, who also appeared on the July 7 show. In April he had been acquitted of tax evasion charges, which were believed to have originally kept him out of consideration as a host. The sponsor was Massey Ferguson.
Production.
"Five Star Jubilee" debuted March 17, 1961 in black-and-white, but switched to color on May 12. The first two color programs (May 12 and 19) were videotaped beginning at 1:30 a.m. local time Friday (for playback that evening) after nearby KTTS-AM signed off at 1:00 a.m., because of unforeseen RF interference from its transmitter with the color TV picture. Despite the hour, both shows had audiences at the theater. NBC resolved the problem for the May 26 program, which was the first live color show. The series was aired by 150 NBC affiliates, although not by WNBC-TV in New York.
The program was produced from the Landers Theatre with KYTV-TV's assistance using two new NBC color mobile units (built for World Series coverage) and three RCA TK-41 cameras. Because it was the first color TV series outside New York City or Hollywood, scenic designer Andy Miller created the first color scenic stage sets for television outside those two cities after receiving brief training at NBC in New York. The director was Fred Rains (floor director for "Jubilee USA") and the consulting producer was the "Jubilee"'s Bryan Bisney. Scriptwriters were Don Richardson and Bob Tubert.

Healy family

The Healy family of Georgia became notable in U.S. history because of the siblings' high achievements in the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly within the Catholic Church. They were born in Jones County, Georgia, to Mary Eliza Smith, a mulatto slave, and her common-law husband, Michael Morris Healy, an Irish Catholic immigrant from County Roscommon, who became a wealthy cotton planter. As they were born into slavery, the mixed-race children were prohibited from being educated in Georgia. They were majority European in ancestry, and Healy was determined to provide them with educations. He sent them to the North, as did many planters with mixed-race children. The sons attended a combination of Quaker and later Catholic schools in New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. James, Patrick and Sherwood all did further studies at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris, France, and the latter two earned doctorates there. The three daughters were educated at long-established Catholic convent schools in Montreal, Canada.
Of the nine children who lived to adulthood, three of the sons became ordained Catholic priests and educators, while all three daughters became nuns. (One later left the order, married an Irish immigrant and had a son). James Augustine Healy became the first American bishop of African descent, and Eliza Healy attained the rank of Mother Superior, the first person of African-American descent to reach this position. Michael Healy, the youngest boy, joined the United States Revenue Cutter Service, a predecessor of the U.S. Coast Guard. Today he is noted as the first person of African-American descent to command a federal ship. Three of the Healy children have been individually honored by the naming of various buildings, awards and a ship for them. The former site of the Healy family's plantation near Macon, Georgia is now called Healy Point. It includes the Healy Point Country Club.
Born into slavery, the children were considered mulatto in the South, a census classification that recognized the range of degrees of mixed race. With three-quarter European ancestry, the children varied in features and complexions. All were baptized Catholic in the North and were accepted as white Irish Americans. Their stories have intrigued historians and sociologists because of the Healys' high achievements. They gained higher educations and most became prominent in the Catholic Church, they negotiated racial issues, and they created alliances with Catholic Church officials and its institutions. The Catholic Church representatives who mentored the young Healy men and women have also attracted interest. James M. O'Toole's "Passing for White: Race, Religion, and the Healy Family, 1820-1920" (2003) explores many of those issues. A. D. Powell's "Passing for Who You Really Are" (2005) takes issue with what she calls the distortion of the past by 20th-century activists, as she says they practice their own kind of "one-drop rule." She thinks it is inappropriate to claim as African American individuals such as the Healys, who historically identified and were accepted as Irish American, although they acknowledged their multi-racial heritage. Since the late 20th century, several of the Healys have been noted and celebrated as the "first African Americans" to achieve certain positions.
Family history.
The immigrant ancestor, Michael Morris Healy, was born on September 20, 1796, in the village of Athlone in County Roscommon. He emigrated to the United States, possibly by way of Canada, arriving in 1818. Through good fortune in a Georgia land lottery and later acquisitions, he eventually acquired of good "bottomland" near the Ocmulgee River in Jones County, across from the market town of Macon. He became one of the more prominent and successful planters in an area known for cotton, and owned 49 slaves for his labor-intensive enterprise.
Among these was a 16-year-old girl named Mary Eliza (whose surname has been recorded both as Smith and Clark), whom he took as his common-law wife in 1829, when he was age 33. His wife, Mary Eliza Smith/Clark, has been described in various accounts as "slave" and "former slave", and as mulatto and African American (which includes mixed-race). In the South, persons of visible or known African racial heritage were considered to be "black," because of the association with slavery as a racial caste. By that criterion, Mary Eliza and all the Healy children were black, although the children were three-quarters European or more in ancestry. The term "mulatto" was also in use, which recognized mixed race. In Louisiana, free people of color formed a third class, whose descendants are called Louisiana creoles. These free mixed-race people gained education and property, sometimes as a result of settlements on women and children in the system of "plaçage".
The union of Michael Morris and Mary Eliza Healy was unusual for being relatively formalized, although unions were common between white men and mixed-race or black women. He was not the only wealthy white man to take an African-American wife and to provide for the education of their children. For example, shortly before the start of the American Civil War, nearly all the 200 young men at Wilberforce College in southern Ohio, established by white and black Ohio Methodist leaders for the education of blacks, were mixed-race sons of wealthy white planters from the South.
At the time, Georgia law (and that of most other states) prohibited interracial marriage. The couple lived together as man and wife from 1829 until their deaths a few months apart in 1850. During that time they had ten children, nine of whom survived to adulthood.
Education.
Under the laws, if their mother had been a slave at their births, the children of the Healys would also have been considered slaves, according to the principle of "partus" by which children were assigned the status of their mother. Various accounts of her status conflict. The laws in Georgia prohibited the education of the children because they were considered black, whether slave or free. Such anti-literacy laws had been instituted in southern states following Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831.
To overcome obstacles for the children, Healy sent them to northern states for their education as soon as each was old enough. (He sent the girls to a French-Canadian convent school in Montreal.) The oldest son James, born in 1830, was sent to Flushing, New York in 1837 where he attended a Quaker school. He later transferred to another Quaker school in Burlington, New Jersey. Several of James' younger brothers followed him in this path. The Quaker schools presented different issues for the boys. They faced criticism because their father owned slaves, which was in conflict with Quaker principles of equality of men, and some discrimination as sons of an Irish Catholic immigrant at a time of greatly increased immigration during the Great Famine.
Around 1844, the senior Michael Healy met John Bernard Fitzpatrick, the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Boston. He learned of the new College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, which was then accepting children of grammar school age. In 1844, Healy sent his sons James 14, Hugh 12, Patrick 10, and Sherwood 8, to be enrolled at Holy Cross. Michael, then only 6 years old, followed a few years later, enrolling in 1849 at Holy Cross.
The Healy parents intended to sell their plantation and move to the North with their three youngest children. When the parents each died unexpectedly in 1850, Hugh Healy risked his safety to return to Georgia to take his three youngest siblings to the North, while executors of his parents' estate liquidated the plantation and other assets. Safe in New York, Hugh arranged for the three youngest children to be baptized as Catholics in the Church of St. Francis Xavier on June 13, 1851. After graduating from Holy Cross, Hugh had gone to New York. He was building a hardware business in the city, but died at age 21 as a result of an infection contracted after a boating accident in the Hudson River.
James Augustine Healy.
James Augustine Healy (1830–1900) graduated valedictorian of the Holy Cross's first graduating class in 1849. In 1962, Holy Cross christened its newest dormitory Healy Hall in honor of him. He was the first American with African ancestry to become a Roman Catholic Bishop in the United States, ordained as Bishop of Portland, Maine on June 2, 1875. During his time in Maine, at a period of growth in rapid Catholic immigration, Healy oversaw the establishment of 60 new churches, 68 missions, 18 convents and 18 schools.
Patrick Francis Healy.
Patrick Francis Healy (1834–1910) became a Jesuit, and was the first American with African ancestry to earn a PhD, at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. He was named a dean at Georgetown University in 1866. At the age of 39, on July 31, 1874, he assumed the presidency of what was then the largest Catholic college in the United States.
Patrick Healy's influence on Georgetown University was so far-reaching that he is often referred to as the school's "second founder," following Archbishop John Carroll. Healy helped transform the small nineteenth-century college into a major university for the twentieth century. He modernized the curriculum by requiring courses in the sciences, particularly chemistry and physics. He expanded and upgraded the schools of law and medicine. In the antebellum years, the college had drawn most of its students from the South; four-fifths of the alumni fought as Confederates. In the later nineteenth century, it began to draw more students from the Northeast, which had a higher rate of Catholic immigration. During Healy's tenure, the college adopted the colors of blue and grey as a symbol of reconciliation for the nation.
Michael Augustine Healy.
Michael Augustine Healy (1838–1904) was younger than brothers James, Hugh, Patrick, and Sherwood. Unhappy and rebellious at Holy Cross, he was sent at the age of 15 to a seminary in France. He preferred a more adventurous life, and fled the school the following year. In England, he signed aboard the American East Indian Clipper "Jumna" as a cabin boy in 1854. He quickly became an expert seaman. Soon he rose to the rank of officer on merchant vessels.
In 1864, Michael Healy returned to his family, by then based in Boston. He applied for a commission in the Revenue Cutter Service and was accepted as a Third Lieutenant, with a commission signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Michael served with the US Revenue Service along the coastline of the new territory following the Alaska Purchase of 1867. In 1880, he became the first American of African descent to be assigned command of a US government ship. During the last two decades of the 19th century, Captain Healy was essentially the federal government’s law enforcement presence in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as: judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. Commissioned in 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard research icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) is named in his honor.
Eliza Healy.
Eliza Healy (1846–1918), educated at St. Johns, Quebec, joined her family in Boston for several years. She felt a calling to the religious life and returned to Montreal, where she entered the novitiate in the Congregation of Notre Dame in 1874 and took her vows in 1876. They were the teaching order of her school and had been established in 1653 by a French nun. After teaching in schools in Quebec and Ontario, Sister Mary Magdalen was first named as superior of a convent in 1895 in Huntington, Quebec, where she served until 1897. In 1903 Healy was appointed school administrator and Mother Superior at a Catholic convent, at Villa Barlow, St. Albans, Vermont, the first woman of African-American descent to achieve the position. In her 15 years there, Sister Mary Magdalen restored the complex's facilities and finances. In her last year, she served as Mother Superior for the Congregation of Notre Dame at the Academy of Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament on Staten Island, New York, where she restored their finances.
Other Healy children.
All three of the Healy girls: Martha, Josephine, and Eliza, were educated beginning as children at the convent school of the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal. They chose to become nuns, following the women and the institution that had been influential in their lives. 
Descendants.
Because of their mother's mixed ancestry, the Healy children were more than half European as well as partially African in ancestry. Much evidence exists that, with the social capital of their education and father's wealth, all of the Healy children were accepted into northern U.S. and Canadian society as "white" Irish Americans. 
Martha and Michael, who married and had children, each chose European-American partners of Irish Catholic descent. Their religion had been integral to their lives and they wanted to ensure that future generations of their family would continue to be part of white Catholic society.
In 1865, Michael Healy married Mary Jane Roach, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants. They had one surviving child, a son named Frederick Aloysius (1870–1912). According to James M. O'Toole, the historian who wrote about the family and the conundrum of race, Michael Healy
"...repeatedly referred to white settlers Alaska as "our people," and was able to pass this racial identity on to a subsequent generation. His teenage son Fred, who accompanied his father on a voyage in 1883, scratched his name into a rock on a remote island above the Arctic Circle, proudly telling his diary that he was the first "white boy" to do so."
Frederick Healy worked as a newspaperman in San Francisco before becoming a partner in a business firm. On April 12, 1906, he married Edith Rutland Hemming of Colorado Springs, Colorado; they had three sons. Edith Hemming was a daughter of banker Charles C. Hemming, from Jacksonville, Florida. A former Confederate soldier, in 1898 Hemming commissioned and installed a 62-foot (19 m) tall Confederate monument installed at the Jacksonville park in downtown. The next year, the city named the park for him, now known as Hemming Plaza.
Frederick Healy died of typhoid fever at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He was buried with his parents in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

Bert Davie

Bert Joseph James Davie (2 May 1899 – 3 June 1979) was an Australian sportsman who represented Tasmania and Victoria at first-class cricket and played Australian rules football with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Davie was recruited locally to Geelong and played 14 games during the 1917 VFL season, which had been depleted due to the war, and a further 12 games in 1918. He made the seniors just once in 1919 and in what was his last game he kicked the only goal of his career.
An opening batsman, Davie made his first-class debut in the 1921/22 summer, for Tasmania against Victoria at Launceston. He scored 56 in both innings and also claimed the wicket of Clarrie Grimmett. Victoria's wicket-keeper in that match, Jim Atkinson, played in the VFL and had also been Davie's opponent when he made his league debut. Davie played another first-class match a year later and then did not make another appearance until 1927, this time a Sheffield Shield fixture for Victoria. It was his final match and he finished his cricket career with 179 runs at 35.80 and just the one wicket at a total cost of 167 runs.

Citizens Charter in Local Governments in Kerala

Citizens charter in local governments in the Indian state of Kerala refers to a statement of paid and unpaid services, that a local government renders to a citizen residing in the local government area, for improving their living conditions and it includes the granting of financial assistance and the issue of permit, licence or certificate for any purpose. The charter enlists the name of services, the conditions for obtaining that service and the time limit within which the services are made available to the citizen.
Process of Preparation.
Immediately after the constitution of the local government, following a general Election, the local government shall, as soon as possible but not later than a period of six months therefrom, meet, discuss and decide as to whatever services the local government can make available to the Citizens, the conditions a Citizen shall have to fulfill for getting such a service and the time limit to make available the service.
Before taking a decision to publish the Citizens charter, the local government should seek the views of the Secretary of the local body, other Officers concerned and consider the factors like availability of Officials, sufficiency of fund etc. to provide time bound services as offered in the citizens charter. The local governments should, simultaneously, determine, the procedure of providing service, the quality and the fee leviable for the service if it is a paid one. It should be examined whether the service so offered to be rendered time bound shall be one that come within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the local government. The services offered by various institutions under the control of the local government shouldl also be included in the citizens charter. The Charter should be prepared and published in the prescribed. The application form for obtaining the services should be made available to the people cost free or by collecting the actual cost.
Publication of the Charter.
The Citizens Charter prepared by the local governments in Kerala shall be published by
affixing it on the notice board at the Office of the local government and on other notice boards fixed at public places in the local government area. As well, the citizens charter shall be printed in booklet form and distributed free of cost among the public. The local government shall give necessary publicity to the Citizens Charter and shall take steps to make available copies of the Citizens Charter to those who demand. The gist of the Citizens Charter published by the Panchayat shall be written in paint on a board and exhibited in the local government office so as to enable the public to view it easily. The Citizens Charter, thus published, shall also be read out in the next meetings of the Grama Sabha for wider publicity.
Duration of the Charter.
A Citizens Charter prepared and published by a local government shall remain in force till the expiry of the term of the said local government council and thereafter till a Citizens Charter is prepared and published by the newly constituted council of elected functionaries.
Procedure for Obtaining Services.
A person, in need of service enlisted in the Charter, shall apply in the form prescribed, to the local government Secretary or to the Officer concerned. The local government should have an enquiry counter for distributing the application forms, for receiving application and for giving reply to the enquiries in the respective office. A serial number shall be assigned to every application for service, received by the Secretary or the Officer concerned and the details such as the name of the applicant, the date of receipt of the application, the request in the application etc. shall be recorded in a register. Immediately on receipt of an application, an acknowledgement receipt shall be issued to the applicant recording therein the probable date on which the service may be rendered, the name of the Officer whom the applicant may approach in this regard and other necessary details.
Obligation to Render Services.
The local government, the secretary and the officers concerned in the local government have obligation to render a service referred in the "Citizen's Charter" to an eligible applicant within the respective time limit. The failure in providing the service will be treated as delinquency. If a service cannot be rendered within the stipulated time limit, the concerned Officer shall intimate the reason to the applicant within the said time limit. Simultaneously, if possible, the revised time limit shall also be intimated to the applicant. If an applicant feels that an Officer of the local body fails to render a service or cause delay, he may bring the complaint to the notice of the chairperson of the local government, which he shall personally examine and dispose of.
If a Chairperson or a Member of the local government or an Officer of the local government has deliberately committed default or delay in making available a service enlisted in the charter to a citizen, he may file a complaint before the Ombudsman for Local Governments in Kerala, alleging that the local government or the member of the local government or the Officer of the local government is guilty of committing ‘maladministration’ which is punishable by the Ombudsman.
Revision and Evaluation.
The local government shall, once in every year, revise and update the Citizens Charter prepared and published after discussion. The purpose of revision of the Citizens Charter every year is for bringing in suitable changes based on the experience during the previous year and for including more services in it and for reducing the time limit in rendering the services. The revised citizens charter shall also be published in the notice boards of the local government and the copies shall be printed and distributed among the people. The local government shall often evaluate the progress in rendering services mentioned in the Citizens Charter and shall issue necessary guidelines to the Officers concerned.
A best practice.
Cheruvannur-Nallalam Grama Panchayat has set a good example in implementing the Citizen’s
charter in the right spirit. The panchayat has put up a wall-sized "Citizen's charter" outside its office. The charter enlists 55 services, categorized under different heads, offered to its citizens numbering around 60,000 in total. The applications for the services are accepted in a counter. A receipt, denoting the possible date on which the service can be made available, will be issued on the spot.
The panchayat has as well, put up another large boardat its entrance that provides the details of the section from where a particular service is offered and the officer in charge of the section and his presence so as to enable the citizens to obtain the services without hassles.
Simultaneously, the panchayat had experimented a front office counter where the applicant can submit the application and obtain the serives, without going to the concerned section. Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) has included the front office counter system as a best practice in its training programmes.
The panchayat has organized a well-kept record room which would help the panchayat in providing information under the right to information act. "The report on good Governance at the grassroots level" prepared by the Centre for Good Governance cites Nallalam-Cheruvannur as a good example from Kerala.
The benefits or Outcome.
The Charter makes it very clear that the services are their right and not a favour from the local government functionaries. The increasing demand for time bound services by the public may lead to qualitative improvement in services. The Charter will help the local body to evaluate the delivery of services annually and make necessary improvements in service delivery. The creation of The Charter will bring professionalism in to local government services and will help the services reach the less privileged class of people increasingly. The State of Kerala is showing a way to improve the service delivery in local government through creation of citizens charter.

Downtown (Nevada gaming area)

"Downtown Las Vegas Area" is the name assigned by the Nevada Gaming Control Board NGCB which includes the Downtown Las Vegas area casinos and the Stratosphere Tower which is located from Fremont Street. The city of Las Vegas uses the term Downtown Gaming for the casinos near the Fremont Street Experience. The land is part of the that were auctioned on May 15, 1905 when the city was founded.
Downtown competition.
Currently downtown Las Vegas is the only place in Las Vegas where the casinos are clustered around an outdoor pedestrian zone. Caesars Entertainment has announced plans to build a similar venue with an observation wheel similar to the London Eye near the Flamingo.
In fiscal year 1988 the ratio of revenue for the Strip compared to downtown was less than 3:1. In FY2008 the ratio is over 10:1. However, downtown rode the massive increase in tourist spending from 2004 through 2007 that swelled the non-gaming revenue of the area. Non gaming revenue and income hit an all-time high in FY2006.
The population of the city of Las Vegas has increased from 249,000 in 1990 to over 600,000 in 2010. In the interim three major hotels have been constructed inside the city limits (Stratosphere, Suncoast and Rampart). The downtown casino district with over 1100 employees has remained important to the city. Since the majority of the casinos remain outside the city limit many people have been promoting the idea of a Consolidated city–county government as a more equitable way to share revenue.
Casinos in City of Las Vegas.
This table includes large casinos inside the city limits. The table, game, and slot count is valid on December 31, 2008. The category of over $1 million and under $12 million are re-evaluated every fiscal year. FSE means Fremont Street Experience. "Games" refers to table games. License numbers are issued by city of Las Vegas.
Monthly executive summary.
A monthly report of gaming revenue is released about five weeks after the end of the month. These statistics are posted in several locations on the Internet. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) posts an executive summary for forty one categories. The number that gets the most attention is the percentage change of gaming revenue from the same month the previous year.
Historical data is released in various formats. The LVCVA maintains "year to date" and "year end" tables with on their site back to calendar year 2002. Data presented in graphic form covering several years is easier to visualize.
Nevada Gaming Control Board publications.
The NGCB maintains a list of publications. Cumulative data is reported in fiscal years (FY) (July 1 to June 30) instead of calendar years.
Downtown Las Vegas currently has 16 nonrestricted gaming locations that earn more than $1 million per year in gaming revenue. Since fiscal year 1990 when the Mirage opened on the Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue downtown has been flat. Non-gaming revenue has increased, but income also remains relatively flat. Some of the smaller casinos have since closed, and one major casinos hotel, (The Stratosphere) has opened. On average, the casinos that have less than $12 million per year in gaming revenue have a negative income.
9–11 crash and recovery.
For Downtown Las Vegas, the "total revenue" dropped after September 11 attacks in 2001 as it did in most resort areas including the Strip. "Total revenue" includes all sources of revenue for the property (food, drinks, attractions, etc.). Unlike the strip, income remained slightly positive, but revenue did not recover for three years. Profitability was restored during this period solely through cost-cutting measures. An analysis of the data could reveal how much of the cost cutting was payroll, cost of goods (food and beverage), and number of employees.
Beginning with December 2001, all of the properties changed ownership, at least once, with the exception of the 3 properties in the Boyd Gaming "downtown division". Most ownership changes are accompanied by attempts to upgrade the properties with new restaurants, clubs, renovations, and games.
Tom Breitling and Tim Poster were the highest profile successful entrepreneurs who profited in the downtown market during the last crisis. As recounted in Tom Breitling's book, "Double or Nothing", the partners agreed to buy the Golden Nugget and had an agreement to sell the property after operating it for only one year. The partners made $113 million in profit called the highest rate of return in such a short time in the gaming industry.
By FY2006 "total revenue" for downtown exceeded that of FY2004 by $106 million. Margins (income over revenue), income, and revenue all reach record highs for downtown. Margins even surpass the Strip according to NGCB Data. Although the sale of the Golden Nugget is completed after six months needed to earn gaming license, no casino purchases are negotiated this fiscal year. Heartened by the improving economic conditions, the Lady Luck is closed for complete renovations.
On February 21, 2008 corporate raider Carl Icahn sold his four Southern Nevada casinos, comprising American Casino & Entertainment Properties anchored by the Stratosphere Las Vegas and realized a gain of $1 billion after a decade of investing in the market. The price for the properties was agreed on the previous April, and was based on an appraised value of $718.443 million for the land. Although revenue drop has been comparatively benign in the recession, the interest on the long term notes for this land speculation has made the company unprofitable.
Revenue since July 1, 2006.
Fiscal year 2006 (July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006) set all time records for downtown Las Vegas in terms of "total revenue" gaming and non-gaming. Revenue in FY2007 and FY2008 dropped. But like the rest of Nevada FY2009 was the most severe fiscal year since downtown gaming peaked in the early 1990s.
Future prospects.
The Lou Ruvo Brain Institute is currently finished construction. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts will be completed in the year 2012.
At the abandoned site of the former Holy Cow! casino and brewery which closed on May 2002 (across the street from the Stratosphere and The Sahara) a developer received preliminary approval to build a -tall video screen and a new casino. Aspen Highlands Holdings hope that the eye-catching attraction at the entrance to the city of Las Vegas will attract gamblers to the casino without an attached hotel.
Profitability had the potential to increase after March 28, 2010 when the ACE bus rapid transit project comes on line. The ACE rapid transit system will have the appearance and feel of a light rail transit network. Traffic lights will be controlled by a system similar to the one that emergency vehicles use. This modern transit system made travel from Fremont Street to the Convention Center virtually the same as the Las Vegas Monorail transit time from in front of the MGM Grand.
However, the revenue decreases are greater than all recent cost cutting or payroll reduction efforts. Some downtown casinos may come on the market in the near future, as an investor will be eager to try to repeat the success of Breitling, Poster and Icahn. In an article by journalist Ben Spillman, he describes a report that looks at historical costs and provides accurate estimates of revenues of the individual downtown casinos.

Albertus Henricus Wiese

Albertus Henricus Wiese (1761–1810) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1805 to 1808, during which time the United Provinces became, during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, first of all the Batavian Republic and then the (Napoleonic) Kingdom of Holland. Dutch possessions in the Indies were under pressure from other European powers, particularly Great Britain, while local kings and princes took the opportunity of troubled times to try to reassert themselves. Weakness of control from the homeland led to a growth of corruption, nepotism and even lawlessness in the Dutch East Indies. It was a difficult time for any Governor-General. 
Albert Wiese was born in Bremen (in present-day Germany) in 1761. He served as Governor-General during the last years of the Batavian Republic and the early years of the Kingdom of Holland. During his time in office the British invaded Java. To reassert control, the government sent the revolutionary General Daendels, who promptly took over from Wiese and tried to drive out the British. A (much) later Governor-General, and Minister for the Colonies, Johannes van den Bosch, was adjutant-general under Governor-General Wiese.

Convoy SC 26

SC 26 was a North Atlantic convoy of the SC series which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
Prelude.
SC 26 was an east-bound convoy of 23 ships which sailed from Halifax on 20 March 1941 bound for Liverpool. It carried war materials and was led by Commodore GTC Swabey in SS "Magician".
SC 26 comprised 23 ships and was escorted only by the Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC) "Worcestershire" (Cdr J Cresswell). At this stage of the campaign escorts against U-boat attack could only be provided in the Western Approaches; the Ocean escort, usually an AMC, was provided to give some protection against surface raiders.
SC 26 was opposed by a patrol line of 9 U-boats, positioned at the limit of endurance to intercept east-bound convoys before the Western Approaches escort had joined.
These were "U-46", "U-69", , "U-74", "U-97", "U-98" and "U-101". Two other boats, "U-94" and "U-76", were moving west to join the line.
This patrol line was unnamed; at this stage of the campaign patrol lines did not carry identifying names, as they did later, though if a wolfpack formed it was referred to by the name of the sighting captain.
On 1 April 1941 an outbound U-boat, "U-76" (Hippel) on her way to join the newly formed patrol line south of Iceland sighted a west-bound convoy in the North-West Approaches. This was OB 305, of 51 ships. Hippel reported this, but U-boat Command (BdU) was reluctant to engage so close to Britain and within range of Coastal Command aircraft; he ordered Hippel to shadow OB 305 westwards and moved the patrol line to intercept. U-76 followed the convoy during the day, but lost contact when she was forced to dive by approaching trawlers. Hippel was ordered to follow west to try and regain contact.
As they did so, one of the boats on the patrol line, "U-74" (Kentrat), made contact with an east-bound convoy, SC 26, which BdU determined to attack. After sending a sighting report, Kentrat commenced shadowing, and was joined throughout the day by 3 other U-boats that were nearby.
Action.
After first sighting on 2 April 1941 "U-74" commenced shadowing, while the other boats in the area were drawn in for the attack. By evening of 2 April BdU had gathered a pack of 4 U-boats, ("U-46", "U-69", "U-74" and "U-76") who commenced a devastating attack.
The first assault, during the night of 2/3 April, was made by "U-46" (Endrass) just after midnight; She fired on "British Reliance", which sank; "Alderpool", which was damaged, to be sunk later by the newly arrived "U-73"; and "Thirlby", which had stopped to pick up survivors, but escaped harm.
Just after 4am the pack attacked again; "Leonidas Z Cambanis" was hit by "U-74" and sank, followed a few minutes later by and "Indier", both hit by "U-73" (Rosenbaum).
With the loss of 5 ships already, nearly a quarter of the convoy, Swabey determined the ships would be less vulnerable if they were dispersed, and at 4.21 am the decision was made to scatter the convoy.
As the convoy started to scatter, a 6th ship, the tanker "British Viscount", was hit by "U-73" and burst into flames, illuminating the scene. Shortly after, "Worcestershire" was hit by "U-74"; she was sustained severe damage, but remained afloat.
At dawn on 3 October saw ships and U boats scattered across a wide area; ships were heading east, pursued by U-boats seeking to regain contact, while the warships detailed to escort SC 26 hurried west.
During the morning Swabey in "Magician" met a number of ships which he gathered together, to reform the convoy; these eight ships were met later in the day by destroyers "Wolverine" (LtCdr J Rowlands, as Senior Officer Escort), and "Veteran".
"Worcestershire", moving under her own steam, was met by the destroyer "Hurricane", which escorted her back to Liverpool.
Two other destroyers, "Havelock" and "Hesperus", arrived at the battle site and searched for survivors.
Six other ships remained scattered; just before midday "U-98", newly arrived, found "Helle", which she stalked and sank. In midafternoon "U-98" found and sank "Welcombe", also travelling alone.
Also on 3rd "U-76", still moving west, encountered "Daphne", a Finnish freighter sailing independently, and sank her.
At dusk on the evening of 3/4 April "U-94", also newly arrived, found the main body again. She attacked, sinking "Harbledown", but all further attacks were driven off.
During 4 April there were no further attacks on Swabeys group, and SC 26 was joined by 3 more destroyers ("Verity", "Vivien" and "Chelsea") and a corvette ("Convolvulus")
During the night of 4/5 April another ship from SC 26, "Athenic", was travelling alone ahead of the main body. She was intercepted by "U-76" and sunk. All of her crew were saved, including survivors from the "Liguria", whom "Athenic" had rescued some days before.
Another SC 26 ship, "Thirlby", also sailing alone, was found and fired on by "U-69". She was damaged, but not sunk, and was able to reach port.
In the main body, "Eelbeck" was damaged, but there were no other casualties.
At dawn on 5 April "U-76" was running on the surface when she was sighted by "Wolverine". As Rowlands approached "U-76" dived, and "Wolverine" attacked, assisted by "Scarborough" and "Arbutus". "Wolverine" dropped 2 depth-charges, followed almost immediately by a full pattern of 8 from "Scarborough". "U-76" was forced to the surface, and the crew abandoned her. "Arbutus" rushed in to attempt to secure and capture the boat and its prized cypher equipment, but the boat was filled with chlorine gas from the batteries, and she quickly sank. All "U-76" crew but one were rescued.
The pack made no further attacks on the ships of SC 26, who made their way to port. Swabey’s group of 8 ships arrived in Liverpool on 8 April 1941; "Worcester" and "Hurricane" arrived in port the same day.
"Thirlby", which was damaged, in company with "Loch Ewe", docked three days later on the 11th.
"Tennessee", carrying survivors from "British Reliance", put into port in Ireland, while "Tenax" and "Ethel R" docked in Britain.
Nearly half of SC 26 had been lost; 10 ships sunk, for 51,969 tons, with 2 ships and the ocean escort damaged.
Nearly 100 sailors lost their lives.
Against this one U-boat was destroyed; most of its crew were picked up./rescued.
Conclusion.
The U boat arm had scored another victory, and by managing to shift its point of interception further west, beyond the range of the anti-submarine escorts, ensured a series of successes until Western Approaches Command could adjust.
"Arbutus" had been unable to capture "U-76" and her prized Enigma machine, but this breakthrough was just 4 weeks away with the seizure of "U-110" in May, with a profound effect on the course of the Atlantic campaign.

National Esperanto Library and Archive

The Esperanto National Library and Archive is the biggest Esperanto library in Italy, and one of the richest in the world; it is located in Massa, in northern Tuscany.
Founded in 1972 as the official library of the Italian Esperanto Federation, it is now a public collection, hosted by the State Archive in Massa and part of the provincial network of libraries (Rete Provinciale delle Biblioteche di Massa, or REPROBI).
The inauguration of its new see in the building of the State Archive was celebrated on 25 October 2008 by means of a public conference, called ""Dall'Esperanto storico al multimediale"" ("From historical to multimedial Esperanto"), hosted in the Sala della Resistenza, in the Ducal Palace of Massa.
History.
The concept of a national library which could host all the literary works in Esperanto was first imagined by professor Mario Dazzini (Pietrasanta, 1910 – Massa, 1985) and his sister, Catina Dazzini, already since the 1950s.
The first such collection began in 1972, when Dazzini received a rare Esperanto book (the first grammar of Esperanto ever published in Italy, written by Daniele Marignoni). The book was donated by the Italian linguist Bruno Migliorini and his brother Elio Migliorini, a geographer.
The core of the library consisted not only of books provided by the Migliorinis, but also of works donated by Mr. Boscarino from Ragusa, by Corrado Grazzini, by Luigi Minnaja and by other Italian Esperantists.
The library was first hosted in the Malaspina Castle, on the hills surrounding Massa, and was then moved to the building of the State Archive in Massa.
In March 1994 the library and its archive were donated to the State and to the archive administration of the Italian Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali.
The local Esperanto group in Massa began in January 2007 to catalogue the books and works hosted by the library, being helped and financed by the province of Massa-Carrara, together with the regional government of Tuscany and the Massa State Archive.
Collection.
The library hosts books written in or related to Esperanto; the books mainly deal with linguistics, literature, theology and politics. Overall, the library hosts around eight thousand books, of which the majority was donated by family Dazzini, and later by other Italian Esperantists.
The collection also includes 176 magazines, not yet catalogued, as well as other documents such as travel diaries, correspondence, photographic images and music recordings.
About half of the collection consists of translations in Esperanto of works of prose and poetry from every part of the world.

Ministry of Human Rights (Pakistan)

The Ministry of Human Rights is a federal government agency in Pakistan. The ministry is headed by the Minister for Human Rights, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani. The historically contentious issue of human rights in Pakistan received an added emphasis from the highest leadership of Pakistan when the ministry was chipped out of the Ministry of Law and Justice on November 3, 2008. 
There are also regional ministers. The Minister of Human Rights for Punjab is Kamran Michael.
Recreation of ministry set up originally in 1995.
Originally the ministry was created by Benazir Bhutto in 1995/96, but with the dissolution of her government the ministry was downsized. At that time the ministry was set up as a department within the justice ministry. It had then 125 employees and four regional offices. Then, with a limited budget, the ministry worked on a case-by-case basis only seeking help from donor agencies to expand its activity. A prison reform program was instituted in 2000 and also a "fund for women in distress and detention" and a "relief and revolving fund" for victims of human rights violations were set up. According to an assessment by the United States Department of State the ministry was however not perceived as effective by human rights observers which noted specifically that the Pakistani government had failed to take follow-up action on the 1997 report of the Commission of Inquiry for Women.
2008 Ministry led by Mumtaz Alam Gillani.
The government has approved the draft bill for the establishment an independent National Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (not to be confounded with the already existing NGO Human Rights Commission of Pakistan). Shortly after his appointment minister Alam Gillani also announced that a task force consisting of journalists, civil society activists and social workers would be formed on district and divisional levels to address human rights violations cases and also that separate courts for human rights would also be established at district levels. Furthermore the ministry has announced that it is preparing a new law which will form the basis for work to shed light in the fate of potentially thousands of citizens who have gone missing, and according to human rights activists, may have been taken away by security and intelligence services during Pakistan's seven-year War on Terror.

Initially known best for his street-violence survival books, MacYoung later went on to write personal safety / self-defense books and make instructional videos. According to the IMDB, he is considered to be one of the pioneers of reality-based self-defense. Marc has studied numerous martial arts since the age of ten, including Wing Chun, Eskrima, Silat, Karate, and Baguazhang. He administers several self-defense programs for the general public and has taught law at law-enforcement agencies and military sites around the world.
Biography.
Marc was born in Los Angeles, California, and spent a majority of his childhood in the Los Angeles area. By his own account, he spent his youth in situational poverty and ethnic diversity. He gained his knowledge of crime and violence on the streets of Los Angeles. He was first shot when he was fourteen. He later worked as the warden of a correctional institute, bodyguard, bouncer, security, all of which put his life into danger. He wrote his first book "Cheap Shots Ambushes and other Lessons", published by Paladin Press, in 1989.

<doc id="20663223" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20663223" title="Acne conglobata">
Acne conglobata

Acne conglobata is a highly inflammatory disease presenting with comedones, nodules, abscesses, and draining sinus tracts.
This condition generally begins between the ages of 18 and 30. It usually persists for a very long time, and often until the patient is around 40 years old. Although it often occurs where there is already an active acne problem, it can also happen to people whose acne has subsided. Although the cause of this type of acne is unknown, it is associated with testosterone and thus appears mainly in men. It can be caused by anabolic steroid abuse and sometimes appears in men after stopping testosterone therapy. It can also happen to someone who has a tumour that is releasing large amounts of androgens, or to people in remission from autoimmune diseases, such as leukemia. In certain persons, the condition may be triggered by exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons or ingestion of halogens.
Appearance.
This condition presents with blackheads appearing around the face, neck, chest, upper arms and buttocks in groups of two or three. The pimples form around the blackheads. They are large and engorged with fluid, and may be sensitive to touch. They remain for a while and continue to grow and fill with pus until they finally rupture. After the lesion has drained, it fills up again. After they rupture, several nodules can fuse together to form larger shapes. The lesions remain for a long time. They form a scab in the centre but they continue to spread outwards. When the lesions do eventually heal, they leave scars that can be the usual type of acne scar (atrophic) or can be the raised bump normally left behind by a burn or a cut (keloidal).
Treatment.
The most common treatment is the acne medication isotretinoin. It may be combined with prednisone. Dapsone, which is normally used to treat leprosy, is a riskier medication but is sometimes prescribed in cases where the normal therapy is ineffectual. Antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin may also be prescribed. An alternative option is to treat with carbon dioxide laser therapy, followed by topical tretinoin therapy.
Surgery may be necessary to remove large nodules. Alternatively, nodules can be injected with triamcinolone.

<doc id="20663238" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20663238" title="Heaven's Gate (religious group)">
Heaven's Gate (religious group)

Heaven's Gate was an American UFO religious Millenarian group based in San Diego, California, founded in the early 1970s and led by Marshall Applewhite (1931–1997) and Bonnie Nettles (1927–1985). On March 26, 1997, police discovered the bodies of 39 members of the group who had committed mass suicide in order to reach what they believed was an alien space craft following the Comet Hale–Bopp, which was then at its brightest.
History.
According to Jacques Vallée in his 1979 book "Messengers of Deception", the group began in the early 1970s when Marshall Applewhite was recovering from a heart attack during which he claimed to have had a near-death experience. He came to believe that he and his nurse, Bonnie Nettles, were "the Two", that is, the two witnesses spoken of in the Book of Revelation 11:3 in the Bible. After a brief and unsuccessful attempt to run an inspirational bookstore, they began traveling around the United States of America giving talks about their belief system. As with some other New Age faiths they combined Christian doctrine (particularly the ideas of salvation and apocalypse) with the concept of evolutionary advancement and elements of science fiction, particularly travel to other worlds and dimensions. 
Applewhite and Nettles used a variety of aliases over the years, notably "Bo and Peep" and "Do and Ti" (pronounced "doe" and "tea"). The group also had a variety of names—prior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vallée studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM). The group re-invented and renamed itself several times and had a variety of recruitment methods. Marshall believed that he was directly related to Jesus, meaning he was an "Evolutionary Kingdom Level Above Human".
Belief system.
Heaven's Gate members believed that the planet Earth was about to be "recycled" (wiped clean, renewed, refurbished and rejuvenated), and that the only chance to survive was to leave it immediately. While the group was formally against suicide, they defined "suicide" in their own context to mean "to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered," and believed that their "human" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person's body, they routinely used the word "vehicle"; when shown a picture of his son in an interview, Rio DiAngelo commented, "Look, there's the little vehicle."
The group believed in several paths for a person to leave the Earth and survive before the "recycling," one of which was intentioning love to this world strongly enough: "It is also possible that part of our test of faith is our loving of this world, even our flesh body, to the extent to be willing to leave it without any proof of the Next Level's existence."
The members of the group added to the first names they adopted in lieu of their original given names, which defines "children of the Next Level." This is mentioned in Applewhite's final video, "Do's Final Exit," that was filmed on March 19–20, 1997, just days prior to the suicides.
They believed "to be eligible for membership in the Next Level, humans would have to shed every attachment to the planet." This meant that all members had to give up all human-like characteristics, such as their family, friends, sexuality, individuality, jobs, money and possessions.
These basic beliefs of the cult stayed generally consistent over the years; however, "the details of their ideology were flexible enough to undergo modification over time." There are many examples of the cult adding or slightly changing their beliefs over the years. This includes modifying the way one can enter the Next Level, changing the way they describe themselves, placing more importance on the idea of Satan, and adding several other New Age concepts. One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial walk-ins. When the cult began, "Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk-ins." The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as "an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul." An extraterrestrial walk-in, which is what Heaven's Gate came to believe, is "a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet."
The concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from clean slates. They no longer were the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to "erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles." 
Another New Age belief that Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the ancient astronaut hypothesis. The term "ancient astronauts" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that ufonauts visited our planet in the distant past. Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that "aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritual evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this transhuman state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world." Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering.
Structure.
Group members gave up their material possessions and lived a highly ascetic life devoid of many indulgences. The group was tightly knit and everything was shared communally. Seven of the male members of the group, including Applewhite, voluntarily underwent castration in Mexico as an extreme means of maintaining the ascetic lifestyle.
The group earned revenues by offering professional website development for paying clients under the name "Higher Source".
The cultural theorist Paul Virilio has described the group as a cybersect, due to its heavy reliance on computer mediated communication as a mode of communication prior to the group's collective suicide.
Mass suicide and aftermath.
On March 19–20, 1997, Marshall Applewhite taped himself speaking of mass suicide and asserted "it was the only way to evacuate this Earth." After claiming that a spacecraft was trailing the comet Hale–Bopp, Applewhite convinced 38 followers to commit suicide so that their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that after their deaths, a UFO would take their souls to another "level of existence above human", which he described as being both physical and spiritual. This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of UFO religion. In October 1996, the group purchased alien abduction insurance to cover up to 50 members at a cost of $10,000.
The cult rented a 9,200-sq.-ft. mansion, located at 18241 Colina Norte (later changed to Paseo Victoria) in a gated community of upscale homes in the San Diego–area community of Rancho Santa Fe, from Sam Koutchesfahani, paying $7,000 per month in cash. Thirty-eight Heaven's Gate members, plus group leader Applewhite, were found dead in the home on March 26, 1997. In the heat of the California spring, many of the bodies had begun to decompose by the time they were discovered. Autopsies were carried out on the corpses, and medical examiners found the people had taken cyanide and arsenic. The bodies were later cremated.
The members took phenobarbital mixed with pineapple, washed down with vodka. Additionally, they secured plastic bags around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce asphyxiation. Authorities found the dead lying neatly in their own bunk beds, faces and torsos covered by a square, purple cloth. Each member carried a five-dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets-- said to be for interplanetary toll. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white Nike Decades athletic shoes, and armband patches reading "Heaven's Gate Away Team" (one of many instances of the group's use of the "Star Trek" fictional universe's nomenclature). The adherents, between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's deaths. Fifteen members died on March 24, fifteen more on March 25, and nine on March 26. Leader Applewhite was the third to last member to die; two women remained after him and were the only ones found without bags over their heads. Among the dead was Thomas Nichols, brother of the actress Nichelle Nichols, who is best known for her role as Uhura in the original "" television series.
Only one of the group's members, Rio DiAngelo/Richard Ford, did not kill himself: weeks before the suicides, in December 1996, DiAngelo agreed with Applewhite to leave the group so he could ensure future dissemination of Heaven's Gate videos and literature. He videotaped the mansion in Rancho Santa Fe; however, the tape was not shown to police until 2002, five years after the event.
The mass death of the Heaven's Gate group was widely publicized in the media as an example of cult suicide. 
Two former members of Heaven's Gate, Wayne Cooke and Charlie Humphreys, later committed suicide in a similar manner. Humphreys survived a suicide pact with Cooke in May 1997, but ultimately killed himself in February 1998.
Media coverage prior to suicide.
Known to the mainstream media (though largely ignored through the 1980s and 1990s), Heaven's Gate was better known in UFO circles as well as a series of academic studies by sociologist Robert Balch. They also received coverage in Jacques Vallée's "Messengers of Deception", in which Vallée described an unusual public meeting organized by the group. Vallée frequently expressed concerns within the book about contactee groups' authoritarian political and religious outlooks, and Heaven's Gate did not escape criticism.
In January 1994, the "LA Weekly" ran an article on the group, then known as The Total Overcomers. Through this article Rio DiAngelo, a surviving member of the group, discovered the group and eventually joined them. DiAngelo was the subject of "LA Weekly"'s 2007 cover story on the group.
Louis Theroux contacted the Heaven's Gate group while making a program for his BBC Two documentary series, "Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends", in early March 1997. In response to his e-mail, Theroux was told that Heaven's Gate could not take part in the documentary as "at the present time a project like this would be an interference with what we must focus on."
The 1982 film, "The Mysterious Two", was loosely based on reports of the cult's activities during the 1970s, which had received extensive media coverage at the time. Applewhite and his co-founder would go on to occasionally use the name "The Mysterious Two" in their web site's materials.

Bangladeshis in Australia

Bangladeshis in Australia are one of the smallest immigrant communities living in Australia. There are around 20,000 Bangladeshis in Australia, according to the census in 2006. The largest Bangladeshi communities are mainly present in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, with large concentrations in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne.
History.
During the British partition of Bengal in 1947, East Bengal became East Pakistan, part of the newly formed nation of Pakistan. East Pakistan was governed by West Pakistan, which was situated about 1500 kilometers to the west, separated by India. Differences between the two led to an outbreak of Bengali nationalism. After liberation war, the independent state of Bangladesh - meaning “Bengali nation” - was proclaimed on 26 March 1971. The new country became a parliamentary democracy under a 1972 constitution. The Bangladesh-born are relatively new migrants to Australia. Since 1970, migration from Bangladesh has steadily increased with the majority arriving under the Skilled Migration Program. Most Bangladesh-born have settled in the urban areas of New South Wales while smaller numbers settled in other states and territories.
Geographic Distribution.
The latest Census in 2011 recorded 27,809 Bangladesh-born people in Australia, an increase of 72.8 per cent from the 2006 Census. The 2011 distribution by state and territory showed New South Wales had the largest number with 17 007 followed by Victoria (5114), Queensland (1672) and Western Australia (1496).

Karl Bovin

Karl (Kalle) Bovin (1907–1985) was a Danish painter who specialized in landscapes of his native Odsherred in the north west of Zealand.
He was interested in art from an early age. In the 1920s, he cycled to the artists paradise Skagen in the north of Jutland to show Anna and Michael Ancher some of his early work. As a result of their encouragement, he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen. Here he came together with a group of constructivists who relied largely on intuition and observation but was not happy with their approach.
Early Career.
He therefore joined fellow artist Kaj Ejstrup in Odsherred where there were excellent opportunities to concentrate on nature and landscape painting. Slowly other artists followed, forming the so-called "Odsherredsmalerne" (Odsherred painters) within the Corner painters association. In 1932, Bovin was successful in having one of his landscapes bought by Statens Museum for Kunst, the Danish national gallery, reinforcing his reputation. 
His earlier paintings are characterised by dull tones, no doubt influenced by the woes of the times. However, by the end of the 1930s, his paintings became livelier. After travelling to Bahrain in the 1950s, his paintings immediately benefitted from more colour and brighter light. Indeed, he found he could better represent these effects in watercolours than in oils. 
Style.
Though closely involved with the impressionists, he continued to develop his own style and motifs with the result that he became one of the best landscape painters of the 20th century, painting his natural surroundings in winter, summer and spring. 
Bovin continued to paint until the 1970s, when poor health prevented him from continuing further.
Much of his work can be seen at Odsherreds Museum of Art.

Trentino Autonomists

Trentino Autonomists (, AT), whose complete name was Trentino Autonomists – Gentians ("Autonomisti Trentini – Genziane") was a regionalist centrist Italian political party based in Trentino.
History.
The party was formed in 2000 by the merger of Integral Autonomy (led by Sergio Casagranda and Caterina Dominici), the provincial section of Italian Renewal (led by Sergio Muraro, a former member of Lega Nord Trentino) and splinters from the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (Dario Pallaoro).
In the 2003 provincial election the party ran in list with the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT). The PATT-"Genziane" list won 9.0% of the vote and three provincial deputies, including Pallaoro for the "Genziane". However, during the term of the Council, also Muraro and Dominici entered the Council in place of Franco Panizza, provincial minister since 2003, and Giacomo Bezzi, member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies since 2006.
In 2007 the Trentino Autonomists finally merged into the PATT.

Linear syntax

Linear syntax is a computer-programming term for an expression that can be parsed from left to right. Linear syntax implies the ability to write code without the use of line-feed or carriage-return characters. Although the use of such characters is recommended for code readability, they are optional, as compilers do not rely on them to parse and compile the code. HTML, C, and SQL code are examples of languages that employ linear syntax; they all rely on commas, semicolons, and parentheses to separate code blocks.

Walid Soliman (footballer)

Walid Soliman ( ; born 1 December 1984 in Minya) is commonly known as Walid. The Egyptian footballer is nicked named as "the Egyptian Messi" due to his magical skills. Soliman is a left-footed attacking midfielder and playmaker for the Egyptian Premier League side Al-Ahly and the Egypt National Team.
Club career.
Early career.
Soliman, who was born in Minya, played for his home town youth team; Beni Mazar FC. In 2004, he moved to Haras El-Hodoud and played for its U-20 youth team. However, he managed to appear for the club's first team in few matches under the coaching of Helmi Tolan. He was also among the Haras El-Hodoud squad that finished third in the 2004-05 Egyptian Premier League.
Gouna FC.
In 2005 and under the coaching of Kamal Etman, Soliman moved to Gouna FC, which at that time was competing in the Egyptian Second Division. Although, he helped the team to finish top of its group, it failed to achieve promotion to Egyptian Premier League in the play-offs. Gouna FC finished third in the play-offs group which included Beni Suef telephones, Sohag Nile and Asyut Petroleum in addition to Gouna. It was Asyut Petroleum that eventually won promotion that season.
PetroJet.
Mokhtar Mokhtar, PetroJet manager, was convinced by Soliman skills. The newly promoted team signed him in the summer transfer window in preparation for the 2006-07 Egyptian Premier League. Soliman began a new life of shining as he scored his first goal in PetroJet's first Premier League match leading the team to beat Geish 3-2. Soliman firmly established himself in the Egyptian League and as a result earned his first call-up by the Egypt national football team manager Hassan Shehata. Egypt was preparing for the 2007 Pan Arab Games.
Ahli Jeddah.
In January 2009, Soliman preferred to move abroad. He agreed to a six-months loan deal from the Saudi side Ahli Jeddah as PertoJet accepted the Saudi $500,000 offer to complete the deal. Soliman was able to leave a good imprint as he scored the first goal for his team 3-2 win against Al-Raed. He helped the team finish third place in the 2008-09 Saudi Professional League. However, Soliman's performance did not live up to the expectations with Saudi club that decided not to enter talks with Soliman to extend his contract. Soliman declared that playing out of position was the reason for his less shiny performances.
Soliman returned to PetroJet at the end of the 2008-09 season. He would only play one more season with the team before transferreing to Enppi. He scored a total of 19 goals for PetroJet; 17 goals in the Egyptian Premier League, one goal in the 2010 CAF Confederation Cup, and another one in the Egypt Cup.
ENPPI.
In June 2010, Soliman eventually accepted to join ENPPI, which also belongs to the Egyptian petroleum companies sector as well as PetroJet. Although Egyptian giant Al Ahly had expressed interest in acquiring his services for several times and in return Soliman repeatedly declared his acceptance, Petrojet was reluctant to allow the transfer to materialize. Soliman later explained the reason behind eventually favoring ENPPI instead as he said, "I preferred ENPPI because I felt that Ahli were not serious in their interest, the same goes for Zamalek".
Al-Ahly.
In August 2011, Soliman eventually accepted to join Al-Ahly
He played well and all and he scored two goals in the 2012 CAF Champions league group stage against Berekum Chelsea and came back and scored a goal in the final against Esperance ST to make Al Ahly win the cup.
Walid played in the FIFA Club World Cup while being injured so he wasn't in form, the injury took 3 months which meant walid will miss the first part of the league, but after he returned against telephonat Beni Sweif for 15 minutes, but the next match he was in the starting lineup against Haras El Hodoud and he managed a goal from a penalty, the next match he was also in the starting lineup against Enppi he also scored from a penalty. The next match he was also in the starting lineup against Ghazl el mahala he scored a goal from a shot in from outside the box.
Walid in the CAF Champions League 2013 played all Al Ahly 4 games so far with 3 goals and 2 assists but yet he was the main cause of Al Ahly losing against Orlando Pirates because he missed a penalty but he fixed his mistake in the match after when he scored an away goal against AC Leopards, and in the match in Egypt he managed to get a goal and an assist, Scored his first goal in Cairo Derby in 15 September as Al Ahly beaten Zamalek by four goals to two.
International career.
As of August 2013, Soliman played with Egypt only 19 caps. He appeared for the first time in the Pan Arab Games 2007, he played two matches from Egypt's four matches in the tournament. He helped "the Pharaohs" to win both Sudan and Saudi Arabia in the two matches that he played. Egypt eventually won the championship.

1984 Boston College Eagles football team

The 1984 Boston College Eagles football team represented the Boston College Eagles in the 1984 NCAA Division I-A football season. 
Schedule.
The Eagles finished the season with a 9-2-0 record. Doug Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he quarterbacked the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a Hail Mary pass that was caught in the end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47-45 win. Although many people think that play clinched the Heisman Trophy for Flutie, the voting was already complete before that game.
Flutie left school as the NCAA’s all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a consensus All-America as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club.

Dumfries Academy

Dumfries Academy is one of four secondary schools in the town of Dumfries in south west Scotland.
History.
Dumfries Academy has existed in its present form, though not in the buildings it currently occupies, since 1804. Its history dates back to the 14th century, making it the earliest school in the Dumfries area.
Early records show that John of Greyfriars, a monk, was appointed rector of a new school in Dumfries in 1330. Being a church school it concentrated on the study of religious texts, but in the centuries which followed other schools built in the town which taught subjects such as brewing, mathematics, English, baking, and needlework became integrated into the Academy building.
The Academy operated as a grammar school for those in Dumfries deemed academically gifted as based on exam results until July 1983. The most gifted students from three surrounding secondary schools transferred to the Academy after second year. As a result, Dumfries Academy had the highest rate of university entrance of any state school for many years.
Uniform.
The current uniform of Dumfries Academy consists of a white shirt, black/grey trousers or skirt, a plain black or maroon jumper/cardigan and a maroon and white striped tie. During the 2006-2007 academic year, a senior tie consisting of a black background with white and maroon stripes, and including the school crest was introduced.
Dumfries Academy today.
The Academy has been a six-year comprehensive school since July 1985 serving part of the Burgh of Dumfries and surrounding rural communities, with an average roll of over 600 pupils and around 50 teaching staff. Students are placed into one of three houses in their first year; Barrie, Haining and Laurie.
Awards.
In 2005, William McGair, History teacher at the Academy, was awarded the "Scottish Daily Record Gold Award for Inspirational Teacher".

Francesco Bonifacio

Francesco Giovanni Bonifacio ( – ) was an Italian Catholic priest, killed by the Yugoslav communists in Grisignana (then Italy now Croatia); he was beatified in Trieste on .
Early life.
Francesco (Checco) Bonifacio was born in Pirano, Istria which was then part of Austria Hungary, later Italy, now is part of Slovenia. He was the son of Giovanni Bonifacio, a sailor in a Trieste and Istria sailing company, and of Luigia Busdon, a housewife. He was the second of seven children of a poor family. His father was away much of the time, and therefore the education of the family laid almost entirely his mother’s shoulders. Due to their poor income she was forced to take up a job as a cleaning lady, into the wealthiest family houses. However the family lived in poverty with high dignity. Later, when he had already became a priest would write in a letter to his mother: "What the Lord gives us, must be taken without questioning, because it was meant for our benefit."
He learned the fundamentals at the local elementary school of Pirano and, received Christian learning at the local parish of San Francesco where he had served as an altar boy. Like the rest of his family he was a devoted Catholic but not a fanatic.
Seminary in Capodistria.
Francesco heard the call of the faith very early and by 1924, at the age of 12, he was already in Capodistria's seminary. He accepted the hard life of the seminary with great joy and submission to authority, and although there were some flaws in basic education, he managed to shine among his fellow seminaries for his high human qualities. This earned him the nickname of "El Santin" the Saint. On Christmas Eve of 1931, his father Giovanni died. This sad event was taken by the young Francesco with Christian devotion, believing that it was God's will. Later in his diary he wrote, "Today my father died. He went to a better place. May the Lord grant him the rest he deserves, for all the sacrifices he has done for me." His mother was now even more willing to help her Francesco become a priest, and made every possible sacrifice, because as she later declared, "Checco, has been called by the Lord, and must be a priest."
Theological Seminary in Gorizia.
He ended his study at the Seminary of Capodistria in 1932, then entered the Central Theological Seminary of Gorizia. These were turbulent years for Italy: Fascism had already consolidated its political power and wanted to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church in Italy. However the young Francesco was uninterested in politics. When in 1934, a big press campaign was mounted by the fascists, against the local Church, due to a particularly hot speech made by Bishop Luigi Fogar, he sought for advice from his seniors on what answers he should give to the High Prelate sent from Rome to investigate the matter, since his involvement in politics was basically nil.
Priesthood.
On , Don Francesco Bonofacio was ordained as a deacon in Trieste by Archbishop Carlo Margotti of Gorizia; on , he was eventually ordained as a priest in the Trieste Cathedral of San Giusto. He celebrated his first service in his native Pirano church San Giorgio Dom on . A few months later he was assigned as vicar at Cittanova d'Istria, where he created the local section of the Azione Cattolica (Catholic Action).
Minister in Villa Gardossi.
On he was appointed as the minister of Villa Gardossi or Crassizza (now Krasica), a small borough located in the Buiese area positioned on the road between Buie and Grisignana, by the Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin. The community was made up of a few small villages, (Baredine, Punta, Lozzari, Buzzai, Gardossi, Monte Cini, Musolini, Stazia Loy, Costellaz, Braichi and Radani), and at the time had a population of 1300 people, most of them peasants. The young priest lived this office with his usual obedience and determination. He encouraged his family, having following him there, that it was normal for him to be there, because God had his reasons for having put him there. They all lived into the two stories house with very little conveniences. The house were no running water or electricity; food was sober and scarce, but even in this condition, Don Francesco shared his little food with the poorest parishioners whenever they needed it. Don Francesco, as he was now addressed performed his sacerdotal duty toward every component of his parish with a special attention to its youth, children, elders, and sick. He quickly organized the Azione Cattolica movement and a choir in the parish. He taught religion at the local school and began a little library at the same time. He made almost daily visit to the villages of his parish, using a bicycle or even going on foot. He was good to everyone, said later Mrs. Bianca Ridossi, then chairman of the local Azione Cattolica. He preached the gospel in a simple way and his style liked by the people.
World War II.
War broke out in June 1940, but had very little effect in Istria. The war escalated, right after the Italian debacle of September 8, 1943. The both components of the Communist Party, Italian and Yugoslav, quickly organized to take power in the area. German troops arrived around mid-September occupying the key positions of Istria. The local population was now consisted of German soldiers and their Fascist allied, and Communist Partisans. Life, already not easy, was made even harder. Moreover; the Villa Gardossi area with its forests and isolated houses, was an ideal land for the Partisan guerrilla. Don Francesco did not change his mind and continued his service on behalf of his community, but faced this new situation with great energy and extreme courage. During a German Army cordon and Army search operation, he risked his life to recover and bury the bodies of fallen partisans. He prevented the Germans for setting a house on fire, because they believed to be a partisan shelter. He prevented protested at the Fascist HQ of Buie regarding the murder of a peasant, and saved a man from a Partisan firing squad, because the Partisans believed him to be a German informer. He sheltered in his canonic house, youths who didn’t want to be drafted into the new Italian Fascist Army or wanted to avoid been induced into the Partisan forces. To his parishioners he delivered his simple attitude, regarding the present situation,” God, is not the author of the present evil; the authors are men soaked with the sin”.
After the war.
In May 1945 German and Italian forces were driven out of the entire Istria region by the victorious Partisan Army. The region, almost entirely was almost entirely annexed to the new Tito’s Communist Yugoslavia. Life radically changed; the new regime looked for proselytes among the youth, and of course, saw the Catholic Church, and ministers as potential enemies. The new government discouraged people from approaching the Church; new holidays were introduced to replace the old religious occurrences, people attending regular services were noted by Communist agents standing outside the churches, and their names went on a blacklist. Anyone could exploit this new order and take personal advantage of being a party member, and turning himself into a communist agent. Although Don Francesco’s faith was as firm as a rock, he noted that things were changing for worse. He was informed by some loyal parishioner that some members of his congregation had already embraced the new standards, and therefore he was warned not to trust them anymore. However, due to his strong faith in God and in his mission, he chose to keep on trusting them. As history has subsequently proven, people soon realized what it meant to be under a communist regime, and Don Francesco Bonifacio did too. He wrote in his diary,” I can’t believe that those who claim to be our liberators are stealing so much from us.” Due to his sense of duty and his total attachment to the Christian doctrine, he was seen as a mentor for his community. This was a threat to the new masters’ programs and Don Francesco went on the blacklist, alongside of many other priests. At this time Yugoslav communism was modeled on Soviet style, and alongside with the usual violence, they were also trained to use other tricks to accomplish their goals. Misinformation, propaganda and false accuses were just part of that plan. Don Francesco was therefore accused of being a “Subversive and an anti-communist”. He answered these false accusations by holding Action’s meeting into the Church, with the doors wide open, so that everyone could listen to what he was saying to his attendance.
Death.
A Few days before his end, Don Francesco, had been warned by some loyal parishioners that his life was in danger. He knew that he was on the Communist BlackList, and made a confidence to a fellow Priest, Don Guido Bertuzzo, the Sicciole's Chaplian, telling him that even talking on the streets had become very dangerous for him, since he was under strict surveillance, and that Istria was now living under terror. He recommended to an activist parishioner to make "marks his arms" since he knew that the "Druses" (communists) were now cutting heads of their victims. Father (Don) Francesco Bonifacio was likely killed on , the same day he disappeared and his body was never recovered. He was seen alive for the last time around 4 p.m., by Don Giuseppe Rocco, his confessor and Chaplain of Peroi. A later reconstruction stated that he was stopped on his way back home by four "Popular Guards", beaten to death and his body thrown into a foiba. Other unconfirmed versions stated that he was also reputedly physically abused, stoned and eventually stabbed twice. When his brother went to ask for information to the local "Popular Militia" (Communist Police) he was arrested on accusation of spreading false and anticommunist propaganda. Shortly afterwards his family moved to Italy. The fate of Father (Don) Francesco Bonifacio was not the only violence committed against the Catholic Church of the former Italian territories ceded to Yugoslavia on 1945. In June 1946, Trieste bishop Mons. Santin was stopped and beaten by communist activists while going to Koper/Capodistria, then part of his diocese, attending the Ceremony of Confirmations; his delegate Mons Giacomo Ukmar was also beaten on August 23, 1947, the same day as another priest Don Miro Bulesic had his throat slit. On November 11, 1951 another Trieste bishop delegate Mons. Giorgio Bruni, was beaten when attending Confirmations in Carcaseon the bishop's behalf.
Beatification.
The then Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin, born in Rovigno now Rovinj in Croatia, first submitted the proposal for the beatification of Don Francesco Bonifacio back in 1957. Santin had good and bad positions concerning the Church's credibility in Istria before and during the Second World War, and the biggest minus in his biography were the words of praise from Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who he officially accompanied during his visit in Trieste in 1938.
Mons. Eugenio Ravignani, current Bishop of Trieste himself born in Pola now Pula (Croatia), wrote a report on the priest’s murder on . He wrote that the Don Francesco Bonifacio murdered on , in the evening at the age of 34 years and that for many years they knew nothing, until witnesses confirmed and shed light on what happened that night. All testimonies said that they beat him and threw him into a pit, the Bishop wrote, while some mentioned him being stoned, injured with a knife and shot. Then he described that the priest's life end in a foiba, just like the Catholic newspaper “Avvenire” and other media wrote. However not one name of the witnesses who testified, has been given out forty, fifty or sixty years later–it seems that these are "top secret" data and this raises suspicion when talking about the victims of the foibe.
Controversy.
The peace treaty of Paris signed on 1947, when Istria almost entirely was ceded to Yugoslavia, is still an issue that mark the relations between Italy and the new states of the former Federation of Yugoslavia. The solution is not easy. The two sides have a lot to say and everyone has its own versions. As for Don Francesco Bonifacio issue there are some fact, that it’s valuable to mention here, and that will help to see his personal story with equity. Right wing media, like Ragione Politica.it, have “pumped up” the public with statements that the communist partisans murdered 120 Italian priests, and Don Francesco Bonifacio is mentioned as one of them. On July 11, 2006, Vincenzo Merlo’s portal wrote that Don Bonifacio wrote in his diary in 1946: “How do days go by? Between disappointment and fear.”It describes the priest’s death almost in the same way as other media, but it adds that he was thrown in the foiba Martinezi (180 meters deep), or Dupci, as Croats from Bujstina call it. This author accused Marshal Tito’s Slav communists who threw thousands “Istrians and Triestines, Italian and Slavs, fascists and antifascists” into pits…
However, on February 7, 2006, the “Avvenire” wrote that Don Luigi Rocco, who received a visit from Don Bonifacio in 1946 in Groznjan, stated that the priest was thrown into the pit Martinesi in Groznjan, and this information was also spread by other media. Pope Ratzinger’s internet blog features articles from many news papers and agencies which mention the foiba Martinezi near Buje.
Above all, many historians and publicists in Italy do not mention the foiba Martinesi and the victims in their books and publications, not even one of the greatest counterfeiters of historic events of Istria, Luigi Papo, war commander of the Fascist garrison in the Istrian town of Motovun. In his book “Albo d’oro” (Trieste 1995) Luigi Papo from Montona now Motovun, wrote about the death of Don Bonifacio, saying that Tito’s partisans arrested him and murdered him the next day, on .
Famous Istrian priest Mons. Bozo Milanovic, author of many books on Istrian history and crimes committed against priests, wrote a book “Istra u dvadesetom stoljecu” (“Istria in the twentieth century”, Pazin 1996). In this book he described the work of the “college of priests St. Pavao for Istria”, 1946. He wrote that they discussed a “secretly missing Italian minister in Bujstina (…)” while Ivan Grah, minister in the Istrian villages of Sisan and Liznjan, in his book “Istarska crkva u ratnom vrihoru” (1943–1945) (Istrian Church in war winds), published in Pazin in 1992, described the crimes against Istrian priests but never mentioned Don Bonifacio.
However, in the feuilleton "Istarski Svecenici - Ratne i Poratne Zrtve" (Istrian priests–war and post-war victims), published in the monthly “Ladonja” in August 2005, Ivan Grah wrote about Francesco Bonifacio. Since 1939 till his suffered death, he was at the head of the parish of Krasica in Bujstina. After the end of the war, the Yugo-Communist authorities could not bear him because he interfered too much with their ideological work. On September 10, 1946, came the news that in Bujstina they–the communists- had a list of younger priests who had to be “liquidated” by the Popular Guard. Don Bonifacio was first on the list, but he decided to carry on with his duties as a priest. The following day, September 11, in the evening, the Popular Guard was waiting for him as he returned home on foot from Groznjan and, after a crabbed discussion, he was coercively taken away. Since then, all traces of him have disappeared and the place of his death remaines unknown (…)”.
The Communist writer, publicist and journalist Giacomo Scotti, an Italian Communist expatriate from Naples, in his book “Cry from the foiba” (Rijeka 2008) does not mention the murder of Don Bonifacio or his body being thrown into a foiba. Giacomo Scotti a great expert on this topic in Croatia and Italy wrote:
“As soon as I started writing about the beatification of Don Bonifacio being held in Trieste and about the murder, I stated that this priest is not present on the list of foibe victims. The League of Anti-fascist Fighters told me that Don Bonifacio went missing in September 1946, and that there is no information on his murder or on his death in a pit. The murder of Don Bonifacio, said Tomo Ravnic for Javno.com, president of the SAB of the Istria County, throws shame on antifascist fighters. Now the question is: why does the Vatican keep quiet over the lies of Italian media and politicians about Tito’s partisans murdering Don Francesco Bonifacio and throwing him into a foiba? And why has the Archbishop Angelo Amato, Chief of Congregation for the Causes of Saints, accepted the proposal for the beatification which reads that the priest Bonifacio was thrown into a foiba if this has not been confirmed.”
The beatification ceremony was held in the Trieste Cathedral of Saint Giusto on 4 October 2008 by Trieste Bishop’s Eugenio Ravignani; The Archbishop Angelo Amato, represented the Pontiff.
In 2005 a Trieste square was named after Francesco Bonifacio.
Notes.
Zona A, under the administration of the Allied Military Government (AMG): Great Britain and US;
Zona B, under Yugoslav administration.
In 1954 the A zone was returned to Italy and the B zone was included in Yugoslavia, but until the Osimo Treaty of 1975 was ratified both zones were still nominally under the Italian state Jurisdiction; the treaty of 1975 marked the definite cession to the then Yugoslavia of the B zone, and sealed the peace treaty of Paris of 1947.

Lawrence Kudlow

Lawrence Alan "Larry" Kudlow (born August 20, 1947) is an American economist, television personality, and newspaper columnist. He is the host of CNBC's "The Kudlow Report". As a syndicated columnist, his articles appear in numerous U.S. newspapers and web sites, including his own blog, "Kudlow's Money Politic$".
Early life.
Kudlow was born and raised in New Jersey, the son of Ruth (née Grodnick) and Irving Howard Kudlow. His family was Jewish. Kudlow attended the private Elisabeth Morrow School in Englewood, New Jersey until 6th grade. He then attended the private Dwight-Englewood School from the second half of middle school to high school.
Kudlow graduated from University of Rochester in Rochester, New York with a degree in history in 1969. Known as "Kuddles" to friends, he was a star on the tennis team and a member of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society at Rochester. In 1970, Kudlow joined Joseph Duffey's "New Politics" senatorial campaign in Connecticut. Duffey was a leading anti-war politician during the Vietnam war era. Kudlow, working with Yale University student Bill Clinton as well as many other rising young Democratic students, was known as a "brilliant" district coordinator.
In 1971, Kudlow attended Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where he studied politics and economics.
Government and political career.
Kudlow began his career as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He worked in a division of that bank that handled open market operations, which involve buying and selling bonds to help control inflation and interest rates. In 1970--still a Democrat--Kudlow worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of Joseph Duffey, along with Bill Clinton, John Podesta, and Michael Medved, another future conservative, and in 1976 he worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, along with Tim Russert, against Conservative Party incumbent James L. Buckley, brother of William F. Buckley, Jr.
During the first term of the Reagan administration (1981–1985), Kudlow was associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a part of the Executive Office of the President. While he worked at the OMB, Kudlow was also an advisory committee member of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac. In April 2005, New York governor George Pataki included Kudlow in a six-member state tax commission.
In February 2009, rumors surfaced that Kudlow was considering a run for U.S. Senate in the 2010 Connecticut Senate election against Christopher Dodd. However, on March 24, 2009, he announced on his program that he was not running for the Senate.
In January 2010, after the upset win of Scott Brown for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts, a movement began in Buffalo, NY, to draft Kudlow for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Charles Schumer. On January 29, 2010, Kudlow said that he was considering entering the race, saying, "I do believe that retiring Sen. Schumer would be a noble cause." Kudlow never made any mention of the race again, allowing Gary Berntsen and Jay Townsend to pursue the seat instead.
Private economist.
In 1987 Kudlow was rehired by Bear Stearns as its chief economist and senior managing director. He was fired in 1994 after abuse of cocaine caused him to skip an important client presentation. Kudlow later admitted to a $10,000 a month cocaine habit. Kudlow also served as an economic counsel to A. B. Laffer & Associates, the San Diego, California, company owned by Arthur Laffer, a major supply-side economist and creator of the Laffer curve, an economic theory tying lower taxation levels to increased government revenues, at least at some taxation rates.
He was a member of the board of directors of Empower America, a supply-side economics organization founded in 1993 and merged in 2004 with the Citizens for a Sound Economy to form FreedomWorks. Kudlow is also consulting chief economist for American Skandia Life Assurance, Inc., in Connecticut, a subsidiary of insurance giant Prudential Financial.
Journalistic career.
Kudlow's book "American Abundance: The New Economic and Moral Prosperity" (ISBN 0-8281-1117-0) was published by HarperCollins on December 1, 1997.
Kudlow became Economics Editor at "National Review Online" (NRO) in May 2001.
Kudlow served as one of a rotating set of hosts on the CNBC show "America Now", which began airing in November 2001. In May 2002, that show was renamed "Kudlow & Cramer", and Kudlow and Jim Cramer became the permanent hosts. In January 2005, Cramer left to host his own show, "Mad Money", and the program's name was changed the next month to "Kudlow & Company". The program went on hiatus in October 2008, and returned in January 2009 as "The Kudlow Report". Kudlow added co-anchor of CNBC's "The Call" to his responsibilities in late 2008. Kudlow's style is direct and his line of argument is always based on optimism about the economy, the stock market, and the dollar.
Kudlow is also a regular guest on "Squawk Box". He has contributed to CNBC.com on MSN. He also appears on "The John Batchelor Show" as a co-host on Tuesdays and as a substitute. In March 2006, Kudlow started to host a talk radio show on politics and economics on WABC (AM) as "The Larry Kudlow Show" aired on Saturday mornings from 10am to 1pm ET and via nationwide syndication starting 5 June 2010. He started a blog named "Kudlow's Money Politic$" in October 2004.
He has also contributed to the "Wall Street Journal," the "Washington Times," the "Cato Journal" of the Cato Institute, and the "City Journal" of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, as well as the television shows "The McLaughlin Group", and has appeared as a guest on "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" and on "Wall Street Week."
Economic and political views.
A self-described, "Reagan supply-sider", Kudlow opposes estate taxes, as well as taxes on dividends and capital gains. He also advocates that employees be compelled to make greater contributions to their pension and medical costs, suggesting that these expenses are an undue burden on businesses and defends high executive compensation as a manifestation of market forces and opposes most forms of government regulation. In general, he describes himself as a supply-side economist, arguing that reducing tax rates will encourage economic growth and ultimately increase tax revenue. He has often argued that economic growth will clear deficits, while acknowledging the limits of growth. He has also advocated wide ownership of stocks and frequently speaks of a broad "investor class" that includes most Americans. He is a harsh critic of corporate corruption that has characterized the Enron and Worldcom scandals.
During interviews on his CNBC show, Kudlow has taken to using "the Bernank" as a phrase facetiously naming Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke. The moniker was coined in a cartoon clip written by noted video pundit, Omid Malekan The animation op-ed first appeared on YouTube in November 2010 and skewingly satirized quantitative easing. His continued use of "the Bernank" indicates Kudlow's endorsement of the cartoon and his negative opinion of the Fed's recent monetary policies. 
On June 26, 2002, in a commentary in NRO titled "Taking Back the Market — By Force", Kudlow called for the United States to attack Iraq because "a lack of decisive follow-through in the global war on terrorism is the single biggest problem facing the stock market and the nation today." Kudlow was one of 250 economic experts to sign an open letter dated February 12, 2003 endorsing George W. Bush's policies on economic growth and jobs. 
Kudlow firmly denied that the United States would enter a recession in 2007, or that it was in the midst of a recession in early to mid 2008. In December 2007, he wrote: "The recession debate is over. It's not gonna happen. Time to move on. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). The Bush boom is alive and well. It's finishing up its sixth splendid year with many more years to come". In May 2008 he wrote: "President George W. Bush may turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country" in his "R" is for "Right". He said that "I don't believe we're heading into a recession" in regards to the large Wall Street drop of August 4, 2011 and recent signs of weaknesses in the United States' GDP.
Memberships and recognition.
Kudlow is "distinguished scholar" at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University. He is also a member of the Catholic Advisory Board of the Ave Maria Mutual Funds. He serves as a member of the Fordham University Board of Trustees and is on the advisory committee of the Kemp Institute at the Pepperdine University School of Public Policy.
Personal life.
Kudlow has been married three times: In 1974, he married Nancy Ellen Gerstein, an editor in The New Yorker magazine's fiction department. The marriage lasted about a year. In 1981, he married Susan (Cullman) Sicher, whose grandfather was businessman Joseph Cullman and whose great-grandfather was businessman Lyman G. Bloomingdale. The Washington wedding was presided over by Federal judge John Sirica. In 1986, he married Judith "Judy" Pond, a painter and former Montana native.
In the mid-1990s, Kudlow entered a twelve-step program in order to deal with his addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He subsequently converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Father C. John McCloskey III.

Bicycle mail

Bicycle Mail - The topic of Bicycle Mail can cover two separate and distinctive areas. It can be used to describe the "Thematic" (Topical) collecting and or study of stamps bearing the image of bicycles, or more commonly used to describe a specific category of Special Delivery, where mail was delivered by bicycle and is identified by stamp and or postal mark used.
History.
Prior to the advent of Bicycle Mail, the most common forms of mail delivery was on foot, horse (local routes), and train for longer distances. In some countries Bicycle Mail became more prevalent during periods of railroad strikes to keep local mail routes active. It was also used as an alternative to horse and foot delivered mail in rural areas. By the 1930s most countries had greatly diminished the use of Bicycles for the delivery of mail in favor of the automobile for local delivery.
Some Bicycle Mail was used for local routes in an unofficial capacity. One example of this took place in 1896 in Western Australia. In the United States during the 1890s, a specific example of Bicycle Mail being used in place of rail delivery occurred during a strike on the established mail route between Fresno and San Francisco, California.

Ancient Carthage

Ancient Carthage (from Phoenician "") was a Semitic civilization centered on the Phoenician city-state of Carthage, located in North Africa on the Gulf of Tunis, outside what is now Tunis, Tunisia. It was founded in 814 BC. Originally a dependency of the Phoenician state of Tyre, Carthage gained independence around 650 BC and established a hegemony over other Phoenician settlements throughout the Mediterranean, North Africa and what is now Spain which lasted until the end of the 3rd century BC. At the height of the city's prominence, it was a major hub of trade with political influence extending over most of the western Mediterranean.
For much of its history, Carthage was in a constant state of struggle with the Greeks on Sicily and the Roman Republic, which led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Greek-Punic Wars and Punic Wars. The city also had to deal with the potentially hostile Berbers, the indigenous inhabitants of the entire area where Carthage was built. In 146 BC, after the third and final Punic War, Carthage was destroyed and then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the other Phoenician city-states and former Carthaginian dependencies fell into Roman hands from then on.
History.
Extent of Phoenician settlement.
The Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean in order to provide safe harbors for their merchant fleets, to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resources, and to conduct trade free of outside interference. They were also motivated to found these cities to satisfy the demand for trade goods or to escape the necessity of paying tribute to the succession of empires that ruled Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos, and by fear of complete Greek colonization of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce. The Phoenicians lacked the population or necessity to establish large self-sustaining cities abroad, and most of their colonial cities had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, but Carthage and a few others developed larger populations.
Carthaginian Control.
Although Strabo's claim that the Tyrians founded three hundred colonies along the west African coast is clearly exaggerated, colonies were established in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Iberia, and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of Libya. The Phoenicians were active in Cyprus, Sardinia, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Crete and Sicily, as well as on the European mainland at present-day Genoa in Italy and Marseille in present-day France. The settlements at Crete and Sicily were in perpetual conflict with the Greeks, but the Phoenicians managed to control all of Sicily for a limited time. The entire area later came under the leadership and protection of Carthage, which in turn dispatched its own colonists to found new cities or to reinforce those that declined with the loss of primacy of Tyre and Sidon.
The first colonies were settled on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth — along the North African coast and on Sicily, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. The centre of the Phoenician world was Tyre, which served as its economic and political hub. The power of this city waned following numerous sieges by Babylonia, and then its later voluntary submission to the Persian king Cambyses and incorporation within the Persian empire. Supremacy passed to Sidon, and then to Carthage, before Tyre's eventual destruction by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither had actual control of the colonies. This changed with the rise of Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the Punic Wars.
Treaty with Rome.
In 509 BC, a treaty was signed between Carthage and Rome indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over Sicily and Sardinia.
5th century.
By the beginning of the 5th century BC, Carthage had become the commercial center of the West Mediterranean region,
a position it retained until overthrown by the Roman Republic. The city had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies (including Hadrumetum, Utica, and Kerkouane), subjugated the Libyan tribes (with the Numidian and Mauretanian kingdoms remaining more or less independent), and taken control of the entire North African coast from modern Morocco to the borders of Egypt (not including the Cyrenaica, which was eventually incorporated into Hellenistic Egypt). Its influence had also extended into the Mediterranean, taking control over Sardinia, Malta, the Balearic Islands, and the western half of Sicily, where coastal fortresses such as Motya or Lilybaeum secured its possessions. Important colonies had also been established on the Iberian Peninsula. Their cultural influence in the Iberian Peninsula is documented, but the degree of their political influence before the conquest by Hamilcar Barca is disputed.
The Sicilian Wars.
First Sicilian war.
Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the Greeks of Syracuse, the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean.
The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coast; battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries.
By 480 BC, Gelo, the tyrant leader of Greek Syracuse, backed in part by support from other Greek city-states, was attempting to unite the island under his rule. This imminent threat could not be ignored, and Carthage — possibly as part of an alliance with Persia, then engaged military force under the leadership of the general Hamilcar. Traditional accounts, including those of Herodotus and Diodorus, give Hamilcar's army a strength of three hundred thousand men; though these are certainly exaggerated, it must nonetheless have been of formidable strength.
En route to Sicily, however, Hamilcar suffered losses (possibly severe) due to poor weather. Landing at Panormus (modern-day Palermo), Hamilcar spent 3 days reorganizing his forces and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, and made camp before engaging in the Battle of Himera. Hamilcar was either killed during the battle or committed suicide in shame. As a result the nobility negotiated peace and replaced the old monarchy with a republic.
Second Sicilian War.
By 410 BC, Carthage had recovered after serious defeats. It had conquered much of modern day Tunisia, strengthened and founded new colonies in North Africa; Hanno the Navigator had made his journey down the African coast, and Himilco the Navigator had explored the European Atlantic coast. Expeditions were also led into Morocco and Senegal, as well as into the Atlantic. In the same year, the Iberian colonies seceded, cutting off Carthage's major supply of silver and copper, while Hannibal Mago, the grandson of Hamilcar, began preparations to reclaim Sicily.
In 409 BC, Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with his force. He captured the smaller cities of Selinus (modern Selinunte) and Himera before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and, in 405 BC, Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the entire island. This time, however, he met with fierce resistance and ill-fortune. During the siege of Agrigentum, the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. Although his successor, Himilco, successfully extended the campaign by breaking a Greek siege, capturing the city of Gela and repeatedly defeating the army of Dionysius, the new tyrant of Syracuse, he, too, was weakened by the plague and forced to sue for peace before returning to Carthage.
In 398 BC, Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of Motya. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured Messina. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself. The siege was close to a success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague again ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed.
The fighting in Sicily swung in favor of Carthage in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle off the coast of Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down thousands of them. Dionysius then launched a counterattack by land and sea, and the Syracusans surprised the enemy fleet while most of the crews were ashore, destroying all the Carthaginian ships. At the same time, Dionysius' ground forces stormed the besiegers' lines and routed the Carthaginians. Himilco and his chief officers abandoned their army and fled Sicily. Himilco returned to Carthage in disgrace and was very badly received; he eventually committed suicide by starving himself.
Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next fifty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes. By 340 BC, Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island, and an uneasy peace reigned over the island.
Third Sicilian War.
In 315 BC, Agathocles, the tyrant (administrating governor) of Syracuse, seized the city of Messene (present-day Messina). In 311 BC he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to Akragas.
Hamilcar, grandson of Hanno the Navigator, led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By 310 BC, he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles' army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.
Pyrrhic War.
Between 280 and 275 BC, Pyrrhus of Epirus waged two major campaigns in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the Roman Republic in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.
Pyrrhus sent an advance guard to Tarentium under the command of Cineaus with 3,000 infantry. Pyrrhus marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and engaged in battles with the Thessalians and the Athenian army. After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentium to rejoin with his advance guard.
In the midst of Pyrrhus's Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of Agrigentum, Syracuse, and Leontini, asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.
Pyrrhus agreed, and fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and 20 war elephants, supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus' Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of Eryx, even though he was not able to capture Lilybaeum.
Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.
Pyrrhus's campaigns in Italy were inconclusive, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of "Magna Graecia" meant that Rome absorbed them into its "sphere of influence", bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the Punic Wars.
The Punic Wars.
When Agathocles died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves Mamertines (or "sons of Mars"), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.
The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, Hiero II, former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the Roman Senate debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero; alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.
Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the Strait of Messina, and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.
As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.
The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the Punic Wars. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by Hannibal Barca, which nearly prevented the rise of the Roman Empire.
In 256-255 BC the Romans, under the command of Marcus Atilius Regulus, landed in Africa and after suffering some initial defeats the Carthaginian forces eventually repelled the Roman invasion.
Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major mercenary revolt which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the Barcid family to prominence), and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized Sardinia and Corsica.
The Second Punic War lasted from 218 to 202 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean, with the participation of the Berbers on Carthage's side. The war is marked by Hannibal's surprising overland journey and his costly crossing of the Alps, followed by his reinforcement by Gaulish allies and crushing victories over Roman armies in the battle of the Trebia and the giant ambush at Trasimene. Against his skill on the battlefield the Romans deployed the Fabian strategy. But because of the increasing unpopularity of this approach, the Romans resorted to a further major field battle. The result was the crushing Roman defeat at Cannae.
In consequence many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade, during which more Roman armies were destroyed on the battlefield. Despite these setbacks, the Roman forces were more capable in siegecraft than the Carthaginians and recaptured all the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeating a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the battle of the Metaurus. In the meantime in Iberia, which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major took New Carthage by assault and ended Carthaginian rule over Iberia in the battle of Ilipa. The final showdown was the battle of Zama in Africa between Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, resulting in the latter's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage, which ceased to be a major power and became a Roman client-state.
The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and primarily consisted of a single main action, the Battle of Carthage, but resulted in the complete destruction of the city of Carthage, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of thousands of Carthaginians. The Third Punic War ended Carthage's independent existence.
Culture.
Language.
Carthaginians spoke Punic, a variety of Phoenician, which was a Semitic language originating in the Carthaginians' original homeland of Phoenicia (modern Lebanon).
Economy.
Carthaginian commerce extended by sea throughout the Mediterranean and perhaps into the Atlantic as far as the Canary Islands, and by land across the Sahara desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians and others had treaties of commerce to regulate their exports and imports.
The empire of Carthage depended heavily on its trade with Tartessos and with other cities of the Iberian peninsula, from which it obtained vast quantities of silver, lead, copper and – even more importantly – tin ore, which was essential for the manufacture of bronze objects by the civilizations of antiquity. Carthaginian trade-relations with the Iberians, and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on this trade and that with tin-rich Britain, made it the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze in its day. Maintaining this monopoly was one of the major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage; Carthaginian merchants strove to keep the location of the tin mines secret. In addition to its role as the sole significant distributor of tin, Carthage's central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern peoples' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and on the North African coast; after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 talents) of silver a day.
Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, Tyre. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the trade in the extremely valuable dye Tyrian purple. No evidence of purple dye manufacture has been found at Carthage, but mounds of shells of the murex marine snails from which it derived have been found in excavations of the Punic town which archaeologists call Kerkouane, at Dar Essafi on Cap Bon. Similar mounds of murex have also been found at Djerba on the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia. Strabo mentions the purple dye-works of Djerba as well as those of the ancient city of Zouchis. The purple dye became one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. In Roman society, where adult males wore the toga as a national garment, the use of the "toga praetexta", decorated with a stripe of Tyrian purple about two to three inches in width along its border, was reserved for magistrates and high priests. Broad purple stripes ("latus clavus") were reserved for the togas of the senatorial class, while the equestrian class had the right to wear narrow stripes ("angustus clavus").
Carthage produced finely embroidered silks, dyed textiles of cotton, linen, and wool, artistic and functional pottery, faience, incense, and perfumes. Its artisans worked expertly with ivory, glassware, and wood, as well as with alabaster, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, furniture and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows, jewelry, arms, implements, and household items. It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce (garum), 
and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products of almost every Mediterranean people.
In addition to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, and crop rotation. After the Second Punic War, Hannibal promoted agriculture to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver), and he was largely successful. When Rome conquered and destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, the Roman Senate decreed that Mago's famous treatise on agriculture be translated into Latin.
Circumstantial evidence suggests that Carthage developed viticulture and wine production before the 4th century BC, and even exported its wines widely, as indicated by distinctive cigar-shaped Carthaginian amphorae found at archaeological sites around the western Mediterranean, although the contents of these vessels have not been conclusively analysed. Carthage also shipped quantities of raisin wine, the "passum" of antiquity. Fruits including figs, pears, and pomegranates, as well as nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown in the extensive hinterland, while olive oil was processed and exported all over the Mediterranean. Carthage also raised fine horses, the ancestor of today's Barb horses.
Carthage's merchant ships, which surpassed in number even those of the cities of the Levant, visited every major port of the Mediterranean, as well as Britain and the Atlantic coast of Africa. These ships were able to carry over 100 tons of goods.
Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and Persia. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as Malta and the Balearic Islands produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered white warriors into Northern African slavery).
Herodotus wrote an account about 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The Punic explorer and suffete of Carthage called Hanno the Navigator led an expedition to recolonise the Atlantic coast of Morocco that may have ventured as far down the coast of Africa as Senegal and perhaps even beyond. The Greek version of the Periplus of Hanno describes his voyage. Although it is not known just how far his fleet sailed on the African coastline, this short report, dating probably from the 5th or 6th century BC, identifies distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with hairy hominids.
Archaeological finds show evidence of all kinds of exchanges, from the vast quantities of tin needed for a bronze-based metals civilization to all manner of textiles, ceramics and fine metalwork. Before and in between the wars, Carthaginian merchants were in every port in the Mediterranean, trading in harbours with warehouses or from ships beached on the coast.
The Etruscan language is imperfectly deciphered, but bilingual inscriptions found in archaeological excavations at the sites of Etruscan cities indicate the Phoenicians had trading relations with the Etruscans for centuries. The discovery in 1964 at Pyrgi in Italy of a shrine to Astarte, a popular Phoenician deity, containing three gold tablets with inscriptions in Etruscan and Phoenician, gives tangible proof of the Phoenician presence in Italy at the end of the 6th century BC, long before the rise of Rome. These inscriptions imply a political and commercial alliance between Carthage and the Etruscan ruler of Caere that would corroborate Aristotle's statement that the Etruscans and Carthaginians were so close as to form almost one people. The Etruscan city-states were, at times, both commercial partners of Carthage and military allies.
Government.
The government of Carthage changed dramatically after the total rout of the Carthaginian forces at the battle of Himera on Sicily in 483 BC. The Magonid clan was compelled to compromise and allow representative and even some democratic institutions. Carthage remained to a great extent an oligarchal republic, which relied on a system of checks and balances and ensured a form of public accountability. At the head of the Carthaginian state were now two annually elected, not hereditary, Suffets (thus rendered in Latin by Livy 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SPΘM , meaning "judges" and obviously related to the Biblical Hebrew ruler title "Judge"),
similar to modern day executive presidents. Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as "kings". SPΘ might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre. A list of the hereditary suffetes/"kings" can be found here.
In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to Roman consuls (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the plutocratic oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities. A range of more junior officials and special commissioners oversaw different aspects of governmental business such as public works, tax-collecting, and the administration of the state treasury.
The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian "Senate", and Greek ones of a "council of Elders" or a gerousia), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military, as generals were chosen by the administration. The final supervision of the Treasury and Foreign Affairs seems to have come under the Council of Elders.
There was a body known as the Tribunal of the Hundred and Four, which Aristotle compared to the Spartan ephors These were judges who acted as a kind of higher constitutional court and oversaw the actions of generals, who could sometimes be sentenced to crucifixion, as well as other officials. Panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, were appointed from the Tribunal of One Hundred and Four: they appear to have dealt with a variety of affairs of state.
Although the city's administration was firmly controlled by oligarchs , democratic elements were to be found as well: Carthage had elected legislators, trade unions and town meetings in the form of a Popular Assembly. Aristotle reported in his "Politics" that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote - unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as Sparta and Crete. Polybius, in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline). This may have been due to the influence of the Barcid faction.
Eratosthenes, head of the Library of Alexandria, noted that the Greeks had been wrong to describe all non-Greeks as barbarians, since the Carthaginians as well as the Romans had a constitution. Aristotle also knew and discussed the Carthaginian constitution in his "Politics" (Book II, Chapter 11). During the period between the end of the First Punic War and the end of the Second Punic War, members of the Barcid family dominated in Carthaginian politics. They were given control of the Carthaginian military and all the Carthaginian territories outside of Africa.
Religion.
Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion (derived from the faiths of the Levant), a form of polytheism. Many of the gods the Carthaginians worshiped were localized and are now known only under their local names. Carthage also had Jewish communities (which still exist; see Tunisian Jews and Algerian Jews).
Pantheon.
The supreme divine couple was that of Tanit and Ba'al Hammon. The goddess Astarte seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of Greece, Egypt and the Etruscan city-states. A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.
Caste of priests and acolytes.
Surviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices. Priests were clean shaven, unlike most of the population. In the first centuries of the city ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.
Punic stelae.
Cippi and stelae of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute striking relics of Punic civilization.
Child sacrifice question.
Carthage under the Phoenicians was accused by its adversaries of child sacrifice. Plutarch (20:14,4–6) alleges the practice, as do Tertullian (Apolog.9:2–3), Orosius, Philo and Diodorus Siculus. However, Herodotos and Polybius do not. Skeptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians. The Hebrew Bible also mentions child sacrifice practiced by the Canaanites, ancestors of the Carthaginians. The Greek and Roman critics, according to Charles Picard, objected not to the killing of children but to the religious nature of it. As in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient children were commonly killed by exposure to the elements. However, the Greeks and Romans engaged in the practice ostensibly out of economic necessity rather than for religious reasons.
Modern archaeology in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice called the Tophet by archaeologists. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for stillborn infants or children who died very early. Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted by some archeologists as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice. An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC, in the tophet discovered in the Salammbô neighbourhood of present-day Carthage with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and two-year-olds. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention (via child sacrifice); however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials (via cremation).
Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in the
tophet. The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage's priests demanded the youth in times of crisis or calamity like war, drought or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.
Skeptics maintain that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead".
The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.

Bhojpuri cinema

Bhojpuri cinema refers to films produced in the the Bhojpuri language in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Bihar and Terai in southern Nepal. The first Bhojpuri talkie film, Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo was released in 1961 by Vishwanath Shahabadi. The 80's showered the Bhojpuri people with many notable as well as run of the mill film like "Bitia Bhail Sayan", "Chandwa ke take Chakor", "Hamar Bhauji", "Ganga Kinare Mora Gaon" and "Sampoorna Tirth Yatra". The Bhojpuri cinema has grown in recent years. Bhojpuri movies works across various parts of Europe and Asia where second and third generation migrants still speak the language; and has one of the biggest concentrations of Bhojpuri-speaking people in its Surinamese minority. The industry is based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
Overview.
Bhojpuri, often considered a dialect of Hindi, originates in western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh in northern India. Speakers of it and its creoles are found in many parts of the world, including Brazil, Fiji, Guyana, Mauritius, South Africa, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, many colonizers faced labor shortages due to the abolition of slavery; thus, they imported many Indians, many from Bhojpuri-speaking regions, as indentured servants to labor on plantations. Today, some 200 million people in the West Indies, Oceania, and South America speak Bhojpuri as a native or second language.
History.
In 1960s, The first president of India, Rajendra Prasad, who hailed from Bihar, met Bollywood Actor Nazir Hussain and asked him to make a movie in Bhojpuri, which eventually led to first Bhojpuri film's release in 1963. Bhojpuri cinema history begins with the well-received film "Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo" ("Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari"), which was produced by Biswanath Prasad Shahabadi under the banner of Nirmal Pictures and directed by Kundan Kumar. Throughout the following decades, films were produced in fits and starts. "Bidesiya" ("Foreigner", 1963, directed by S. N. Tripathi) and "Ganga" ("Ganges", 1965, directed by Kundan Kumar) were profitable and popular, but in general Bhojpuri films were not commonly produced in the 1960s and 1970s.
In the 1980s, enough Bhojpuri films were produced to tentatively make up an industry. Films such as "Mai" ("Mom", 1989, directed by Rajkumar Sharma) and "Hamar Bhauji" ("My Brother's Wife", 1983, directed by Kalpataru) continued to have at least sporadic success at the box office. "Nadiya Ke Paar" is a 1982 Hindi-Bhojpuri blockbuster directed by Govind Moonis and starring Sachin, Sadhana Singh, Inder Thakur, Mitali, Savita Bajaj, Sheela David, Leela Mishra and Soni Rathod. However, this trend faded out by the end of the decade. By 1990, the nascent industry seemed to be completely finished.
The industry took off again in 2001 with the Silver Jubilee hit "Saiyyan Hamar" ("My Sweetheart", directed by Mohan Prasad), which shot its hero, Ravi Kissan, to superstardom. This was quickly followed by several other remarkably successful films, including "Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi" ("Priest, tell me when I will marry", 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad) and "Sasura Bada Paisa Wala" ("My father-in-law, the rich guy", 2005). In a measure of the Bhojpuri film industry's rise, both of these did much better business in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh than mainstream Bollywood hits at the time. Both films, made on extremely tight budgets, earned back more than ten times their production costs. "Sasura Bada Paisa Wala" introduced Manoj Tiwari, formerly a well-loved folk singer, to the wider audiences of Bhojpuri cinema. In 2008, he and Ravi Kissan were the leading actors of Bhojpuri films, and their fees increase with their fame. The extremely rapid success of their films has led to dramatic increases in Bhojpuri cinema's visibility, and the industry now supports an awards show and a trade magazine, "Bhojpuri City", which chronicles the production and release of what are now over 100 films per year.
Many of the major stars of mainstream Bollywood cinema, including Amitabh Bachchan, have recently worked in Bhojpuri films. Mithun Chakraborty's Bhojpuri debut "Bhole Shankar", released in 2008, is considered the biggest Bhojpuri hit of all time. Also in 2008, a 21-minute diploma Bhojpuri film by Siddharth Sinha, "Udedh Bun" (Unravel) was selected for world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. Later it won the National Film Award for Best Short fiction Film.
Bhojpuri poet Manoj Bhawuk has written a history of Bhojpuri cinema.
In February 2011, a three-day film and cultural festival in Patna marking 50 years of Bhojpuri cinema, opened "Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo" the first Bhojpuri film.

Lost in the Barrens

Lost in the Barrens is a children's novel by Farley Mowat, first published in 1956. Some editions used the title Two Against the North.
It won a Governor General's Award in 1956 and the Canada Library Association Book of the Year for Children Award in 1958.
Plot introduction.
This is a childrens' or adults' adventure story that takes place in Canada's low arctic just north of the tree line in 1935. It tells a coming of age tale of two boys in their late teens; one, a white boy who has recently lost his parents, the other a Cree Indian from a tribe living nearby. The boys embark on a mission to relieve the starvation of a neighbouring Indian village, the Chipeweyans, but due to a series of unfortunate events become trapped above the tree line in Canada's northern Barren Lands during winter. The characters emerge again in Mowat's "The Curse of the Viking Grave".
Plot summary.
The parents of Jamie died in a car crash, thus he was under the care of his trapper uncle, Angus. Angus had supported Jamie's boarding-school fees for a long time, until the fur trade had declined. Angus could no longer support Jamie's school. Thus, Jamie left the boarding school to live with his uncle. Jamie made friends with the Cree Tribe's Chief's son, Awasin. Then the Chief thought a trader was cheating him, so he asked Angus and Jamie to go with him. Then, it was decided that Jamie would stay with Awasin for Angus' canoe could not hold three people and other things. Fortunately Jamie was fine with this and he even said that he would have more fun in the wilderness. Shortly after, Chipeweyans come to the Crees for help. The Chipeweyans were starving because the deer did not come at the usual season in the year. Awasin's mother was suspicious that the Chipeweyans may just be looking for a free handout, and so the boys agreed to go with them back to the Chipeweyan's camp to prove they needed the supplies. Jamie decides he wants to go too, so the two and the Chipeweyans who came (including Denikazi, their leader), canoes back to the Chipeweyan camp. There, Denikazi misunderstood for he thought Jamie and Awasin were going with them on the hunt for the deer. This is how Jamie and Awasin start their journey for the deer hunt out in the barrens. Soon, they go up to the North farther, but they do not find any 'deer' (in the book, deer means barrenland caribou). So, Denikazi orders Jamie and Awasin to stay with two young Chipeweyans at a certain point until they come back. He includes that they should run, and forget about the camp should they encounter Eskimos. 
In this book, the Chipeweyans and the Crees are deathly afraid of the Eskimos. The Chipeweyan Chief Denikazi described it this way: his people went and hunted as far north as they wanted to for deer, for they had guns and the Eskimos did not. Then, the Eskimos got guns and fought back. (Nowadays Eskimos are called 'Inuit' or 'Thule', but this was not the case when Mowat wrote his novel, or for decades afterward). Anyway, while staying with the two young Chipewyan hunters, Jamie decides he wants to take the chance and explore. He convinces Awasin to do it, and later Awasin gives in. They go up to see the 'stone house' that one of the two Chipeweyans had told them about. There, they try to find it but unexpectedly meet a whirlpool and barely survive. Gathering what they can salvage from the water and their broken canoe, they have barely enough to survive. They cannot use the canoe anymore, they are stranded in the barrens. When the two young Chipeweyans found out that Awasin and Jamie were gone they went on searching for them. Their search is abruptly stopped when they catch a glance of an Eskimo kayak. As for Jamie and Awasin, they decide to go the way that Denikazi and the other hunters went, so they can join with them on the journey back. A problem occurs, for one of Denikazi's men sees what he believes is an Eskimo and they all flee quietly back. They unknowingly pass by Jamie and Awasin's camp during the night. 
Jamie and Awasin are then forced to overcome a series of obstacles including finding shelter and food, to wait until the summer when they can make the trek back to their home camp with the best chance of survival. They engage in a massive caribou hunt, and able to build a log cabin and make a comfortable home for themselves. On their attempted return trip, they both become afflicted by snow blindness and are forced to build an igloo to survive. They are discovered by an Eskimo boy named Peetyuk who offers to help and takes them to his camp, where they learn that the Eskimo do not hate the cree, and are only hostile because they are as afraid of the Cree as the Cree are of them. The boys are able to return home with the help of their new friends, and they make plans to return to their cabin the next summer with Jamie's uncle Angus.
Themes.
Man vs. Nature: The true antagonist of this novel is Nature itself. The boys struggle to survive in a very harsh, difficult environment. The boys demonstrate true courage in hunting and even surviving an encounter with a grizzly bear. They also show great ingenuity in doing so. Awasin already has skill in hunting and fishing and also learns how to make warm clothes. He is very clever as proven by how he is able to make a fire in chapter 9. Meanwhile, Jamie is a very creative person. He is the one who designs and builds first their stone igloo and later their wood cabin. He is a 'think-outside-of-the-box problem solver. Working together they are successful. This brings us to the next big theme:
Intercultural Friendships: How do you overcome fear, ignorance and distrust between people from different cultures and backgrounds? You work together and learn to trust one another. That's how it is for Jamie and Awasin and then later between the two boys and Peetyuk. Jamie is a white English speaking city boy from Toronto. Awasin is from the Cree camp in the wilderness. He learns English while at boarding school. The two very different boys become excellent friends. Jamie helps Awasin to trust Peetyuk, even though the Cree have always been suspicious, fearful of them.
Coming of age: The novel is also a 'Coming of Age' story. The two boys journey in the barrenlands is also their journey from boyhood towards manhood. They are becoming men through their adventures and experiences, they are growing up. For example, risk-taker Jamie learns some lessons about survival in the north through it all. Also, Peetyuk, a secondary character, has reached an age where it is time to learn about his father's people after being raised by his mother and grandparents.
Adaptations.
There is a 1990 television movie version of this novel. It was made for a family/general audience so the hunting scenes are tame. There are also quite a few differences between the movie and the novel. Some of them are:
It was shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds

Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) are by-products of various industrial processes, and are commonly regarded as highly toxic compounds that are environmental pollutants and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). They include:
Because dioxins refer to such a broad class of compounds that vary widely in toxicity, the concept of toxic equivalence (TEQ) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. Toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) exist for seven congeners of dioxins, ten furans and twelve PCBs. The reference congener is the most toxic dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin (TCDD) which per definition has a TEF of one.
In reference to their importance as environmental toxicants the term dioxins is used almost exclusively to refer to the sum of compounds (as TEQ) from the above groups which demonstrate the same specific toxic mode of action associated with TCDD. These include 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 PCBs. Incidents of contamination with PCBs are also often reported as dioxin contamination incidents since it is this toxic characteristic which is of most public and regulatory concern.
Toxicity.
Mechanism of toxicity.
The toxic effects of dioxins are measured in fractional equivalencies of TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin), the most toxic and best studied member of its class (see TCDD for more detailed description of the mechanism). The toxicity is mediated through the interaction with a specific intracellular protein, the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor, a transcriptional enhancer, affecting a number of other regulatory proteins. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of many genes. TCDD binding to the AH receptor induces the cytochrome P450 1A class of enzymes which function to break down toxic compounds, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo"(a)"pyrene.
While the affinity of dioxins and related industrial toxicants to this receptor may not fully explain all their toxic effects including immunotoxicity, endocrine effects and tumor promotion, toxic responses appear to be typically dose-dependent within certain concentration ranges. A multiphasic dose-response relationship has also been reported, leading to uncertainty and debate about the true role of dioxins in cancer rates.
The endocrine disrupting activity of dioxins is thought to occur as a down-stream function of AH receptor activation, with thyroid status in particular being a sensitive marker of exposure. It is important to note that TCDD, along with the other PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like coplanar PCBs are not direct agonists or antagonists of hormones, and are not active in assays which directly screen for these activities such as ER-CALUX and AR-CALUX. These compounds have also not been shown to have any direct mutagenic or genotoxic activity. Their main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion. A mixture of PCBs such as Aroclor may contain PCB compounds which are known estrogen agonists, but on the other hand are not classified as dioxin-like in terms of toxicity. Mutagenic effects have been established for some lower chlorinated chemicals such as 3-chlorodibenzofuran, which is neither persistent nor an AH receptor agonist.
Toxicity in animals.
The symptoms reported to be associated with dioxin toxicity in animal studies are incredibly wide ranging, both in the scope of the biological systems affected and in the range of dosage needed to bring these about. Acute effects of single high dose dioxin exposure include wasting syndrome, and typically a delayed death of the animal in 1 to 6 weeks. By far most toxicity studies have been performed using 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin.
The of TCDD varies wildly between species and even strains of the same species, with the most notable disparity being between the seemingly similar species of hamster and guinea pig. The oral for guinea pigs is as low as 0.5 to 2 μg/Kg body weight, whereas the oral for hamsters can be as high as 1 to 5 mg/Kg body weight. Even between different mouse or rat strains there may be tenfold to thousandfold differences in acute toxicity. Many pathological findings are seen in the liver, thymus and other organs.
Some chronic and sub-chronic exposures can be harmful at much lower levels, especially at particular developmental stages including foetal, neonatal and pubescent stages. Well established developmental effects are cleft palate, hydronephrosis, disturbances in tooth development and sexual development as well as endocrine effects.
Human toxicity.
Dioxins have been considered highly toxic and able to cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer.
This is based on animal studies. The best proven is chloracne. Even in poisonings with huge doses of TCDD, the only persistent effects after the initial malaise have been chloracne and amenorrhea. In occupational settings many symptoms have been seen, but exposures have always been to a multitude of chemicals including chlorophenols, chlorophenoxy acid herbicides, and solvents. Therefore proof of dioxins as causative factors has been difficult. The suspected effects in adults are liver damage, and alterations in heme metabolism, serum lipid levels, thyroid functions, as well as diabetes and immunological effects.
In line with animal studies, developmental effects may be much more important than effects in adults. These include disturbances of tooth development, and of sexual development. An example of the variation in responses is clearly seen in a study following the Seveso disaster indicating that sperm count and motility were affected in different ways in exposed males, depending on whether they were exposed before, during or after puberty.
Intrauterine exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds as an environmental toxin in pregnancy has subtle effects on the child later in life that include changes in liver function, thyroid hormone levels, white blood cell levels, and decreased performance in tests of learning and intelligence.
Carcinogenicity.
Dioxins are well established carcinogens in animal studies, although the precise mechanistic role is not clear. Dioxins are not mutagenic or genotoxic. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has categorised dioxin, and the mixture of substances associated with sources of dioxin toxicity as a "likely human carcinogen". The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified TCDD as a human carcinogen (class 1) on the basis of clear animal carcinogenicity and limited human data, but was not able to classify other dioxins. It is thought that the presence of dioxin can accelerate the formation of tumours and adversely affect the normal mechanisms for inhibiting tumour growth, without actually instigating the carcinogenic event.
As with all toxic endpoints of dioxin, a clear dose-response relationship is very difficult to establish. After accidental or high occupational exposures there is evidence on human carcinogenicity. There is much controversy especially on cancer risk at low population levels of dioxins. Among fishermen with high dioxin concentrations in their bodies, cancer deaths were decreased rather than increased. Some researchers have also proposed that dioxin induces cancer progression through a very different mitochondrial pathway.
Risk assessment.
The uncertainty and variability in the dose-response relationship of dioxins in terms of their toxicity, as well as the ability of dioxins to bioaccumulate mean that the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of dioxin has been set very low, 1-4 pg/Kg body weight per day, i.e. 0.000 000 000 07 to 0.000 000 000 28 g per 70-kg person per day, to allow for this uncertainty and ensure public safety in all instances. Specifically, the TDI has been assessed based on the safety of children born to mothers exposed all their lifetime prior to pregnancy to such a daily intake of dioxins. It is likely that the TDI for other population groups could be somewhat higher. The most important cause for differences in different assessments is carcinogenicity. If the dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer is linear, it might be a true risk. If the dose-response is of a threshold-type or J-shape, there is little or no risk at the present concentrations. Understanding the mechanisms of toxicity better is hoped to increase the reliability of risk assessment.
Controversy.
Greenpeace and some other environmental groups have called for the chlorine industry to be phased out. However, chlorine industry supporters say that "banning chlorine would mean that millions of people in the third world would die from want of disinfected water".
One of the key players in the dioxin controversy has been the Dow Chemical Company. Dow is a large manufacturer of chlorine, producing an estimated 40 million tons of chlorine each year, much of which is used to make plastics, solvents, pesticides and other chemicals. In 1965 "a Dow researcher warned in an internal company document that dioxin 'is extremely toxic' but Dow has always publicly claimed it is not".
Sharon Beder and others have argued that the dioxin controversy has been very political and that large companies have tried to play down the seriousness of the problems of dioxin. The companies involved have often said that the campaign against dioxin is based on "fear and emotion" and not on science.
Human intake and levels.
Most intake of dioxin-like chemicals is from food of animal origin: meat, dairy products or fish predominate depending on the country. The daily intake of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs as TEQ is of the order of 100 pg/day, i.e. 1-2 pg/kg/day. In many countries both the absolute and relative significance of dairy products and meat have decreased due to strict emission controls, and brought about the decrease of total intake. E.g. in the United Kingdom the total intake of PCDD/F in 1982 was 239 pg/day and in 2001 only 21 pg/day (WHO-TEQ). Since the half-lives are very long (for e.g. TCDD 7–8 years), the body burden will increase almost over the whole lifetime. Therefore the concentrations may increase five- to tenfold from age 20 to age 60. For the same reason, short term higher intake such as after food contamination incidents, is not crucial unless it is extremely high or lasts for several months or years.
The highest body burdens were found in Western Europe in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the trends have been similar in the U.S. The most useful measure of time trends is concentration in breast milk measured over decades. In many countries the concentrations have decreased to about one tenth of those in 1970s, and the total TEQ concentrations are now of the order of 10-30 pg/g fat (please note the units, pg/g is the same as ng/kg, or the non-standard expression ppt used sometimes in America). The decrease is due to strict emission controls and also to the control of concentrations in food. In the U.S. young adult female population (age group 20-39), the concentration was 9.7 pg/g lipid in 2001-2002 (geometric mean).
Certain professions such as subsistence fishermen in some areas are exposed to exceptionally high amounts of dioxins and related substances. This along with high industrial exposures may be the most valuable source of information on the health risks of dioxins.
Uses.
Dioxins have no common uses. They are manufactured on a small scale for chemical and toxicological research, but mostly exist as by-products of industrial processes such as bleaching paper pulp, pesticide manufacture, and combustion processes such as waste incineration. The defoliant Agent Orange contained dioxins. The production and use of dioxins was banned by the Stockholm Convention in 2001.
Sources.
Environmental sources.
PCB-compounds, always containing low concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs and PCDFs, were synthesized for various technical purposes (see Polychlorinated biphenyls). They have entered the environment through accidents such as fires or leaks from transformers or heat exchangers, or from PCB-containing products in landfills or during incineration. Because PCBs are somewhat volatile, they have also been transported long distances by air leading to global distribution including the Arctic.
PCDD/F-compounds were never synthesized for any purpose, except for small quantities for scientific research. Small amounts of PCDD/Fs are formed whenever carbon, oxygen and chlorine are available at suitable temperatures. This is augmented by metal catalysts such as copper. The optimal temperature range is 400°C to 700°C. This means that formation is highest when organic material is burned in less-than-optimal conditions such as open fires, building fires, domestic fireplaces, and poorly-operated and/or designed solid waste incinerators. Historically, municipal and medical waste incineration was the most important source of PCDD/Fs.
Other sources of PCDD/F include:
In waste incineration
Improvements and changes have been made to nearly all industrial sources to reduce PCDD/F production. In waste incineration, large amounts of publicity and concern surrounded dioxin-like compounds during the 1980s-1990s and continues to pervade the public consciousness, especially when new incineration and waste-to-energy facilities are proposed. As a result of these concerns, incineration processes have been improved with increased combustion temperatures (over 1000 °C), better furnace control, and sufficient residence time allotted to ensure complete oxidation of organic compounds. Ideally, an incineration process oxidizes all carbon to CO2 and converts all chlorine to HCl or inorganic chlorides prior to the gases passing through the temperature window of 700-400°C where PCDD/F formation is possible. These substances cannot easily form organic compounds, and HCl is easily and safely neutralized in the scrubber while CO2 is vented to the atmosphere. Inorganic chlorides are incorporated into the ash.
Scrubber and particulate removal systems manage to capture most of the PCDD/F which forms even in sophisticated incineration plants. These PCDD/Fs are generally not destroyed but moved into the fly ash. Catalytic systems have been designed which destroy vapor-phase PCDD/Fs at relatively low temperatures. This technology is often combined with the baghouse or SCR system at the tail end of an incineration plant.
European Union limits for concentration of dioxin-like compounds in the discharged flue gas is 0.1 ng/Nm³ TEQ.
Both in Europe and in U.S.A., the emissions have decreased dramatically since the 1980s, by even 90%. This has also led to decreases in human body burdens, which is neatly demonstrated by the decrease of dioxin concentrations in breast milk.
Open burning of waste (backyard barrel burning) has not decreased effectively, and in the U.S. it is now the most important source of dioxins. Total U.S. annual emissions decreased from 14 kg in 1987 to 1.4 kg in 2000. However, backyard barrel burning decreased only modestly from 0.6 kg to 0.5 kg, resulting in over one third of all dioxins in the year 2000 from backyard burning alone.
Low concentrations of dioxins have been found in some soils without any anthropogenic contamination. A puzzling case of milk contamination was detected in Germany. The source was found to be kaolin added to animal feed. Dioxins have been repeatedly detected in clays from Europe and USA since 1996, with contamination of clay assumed to be the result of ancient forest fires or similar natural events with concentration of the PCDD/F during clay sedimentation.
Environmental persistence and bioaccumulation.
All groups of dioxin-like compounds are persistent in the environment. Neither soil microbes nor animals are able to break down effectively the PCDD/Fs with lateral chlorines (positions 2,3,7, and 8). This causes very slow elimination. Ultraviolet light is able to slowly break down these compounds. Lipophilicity (tendency to seek for fat-like environments) and very poor water solubility make these compounds move from water environment to living organisms having lipid cell structures. This is called bioaccumulation. Increase in chlorination increases both stability and lipophilicity. The compounds with the very highest chlorine numbers (e.g. octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) are, however, so poorly soluble that this hinders their bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation is followed by biomagnification. Lipid soluble compounds are first accumulated to microscopic organisms such as phytoplankton (plankton of plant character, e.g. algae). Phytoplankton is consumed by animal plankton, this by invertebrates such as insects, these by small fish, and further by large fish and seals. At every stage or trophic level, the concentration is higher, because the persistent chemicals are not "burned off" when the higher organism uses the fat of the prey organism to produce energy.
Due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification, the species at the top of the trophic pyramid are most vulnerable to dioxin-like compounds. In Europe, the white-tailed eagle and some species of seals have been close to extinct due to poisoning of persistent organic pollutants. Likewise, in America, the populations of bald eagle declined because of POPs causing thinning of eggs and other reproductive problems. Usually, the failure has been attributed mostly to DDT, but dioxins are also a possible cause of reproductive effects. Both in America and in Europe, many waterfowl have high concentrations of dioxins, but usually not high enough to disturb their reproductive success. Due to supplementary winter feeding and other measures also, the white-tailed eagle is recovering (see White-tailed eagle). Also, ringed seals in the Baltic Sea are recovering.
Humans are also at the top of the trophic pyramid, but due to a multitude of food sources as compared with seals and eagles feeding almost exclusively on fish, human concentrations are much less, 10-100 pg/g, compared with 9000 to 340,000 pg/g (TEQ in lipid) in eagles.
Because of different physicochemical properties, not all congeners of dioxin-like compounds find their routes to human beings equally well. Measured as TEQs, the dominant congeners in human tissues are 2,3,7,8-TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF. This is very different from most sources where hepta- and octa-congeners may predominate. The WHO panel re-evaluating the TEF values in 2005 expressed their concern that emissions should not be uncritically measured as TEQs, because all congeners are not equally important. They stated that "when a human risk assessment is to be done from abiotic matrices, factors such as fate, transport, and bioavailability from each matrix be specifically considered".
All POPs are poorly water soluble, especially dioxins. Therefore, ground water contamination has not been a problem, even in cases of severe contamination due to the main chemicals such as chlorophenols. In surface waters, dioxins are bound to organic and inorganic particles.
Fate of dioxins in human body.
The same features causing persistence of dioxins in the environment, also cause very slow elimination in humans and animals. Because of low water solubility, kidneys are not able to secrete them in urine as such. They should be metabolised to more water-soluble metabolites, but also metabolism especially in humans is extremely slow. This results in biological half-lives of several years for all dioxins. That of TCDD is estimated to be 7 to 8 years, and for other PCDD/Fs from 1.4 to 13 years, PCDFs on average slightly shorter than PCDDs.
Dioxins are absorbed well from the digestive tract, if they are dissolved in fats or oils (e.g. in fish or meat). On the other hand, dioxins tend to adsorb tightly to soil particles, and absorption may be quite low: 13.8% of the given dose of TEQs in contaminated soil was absorbed.
In mammalian organisms, dioxins are found mostly in fat. Concentrations in fat seem to be relatively similar, be it serum fat, adipose tissue fat, or milk fat. This permits measuring dioxin burden by analysing breast milk. Initially, however, at least in laboratory animals, after a single dose, high concentrations are found in the liver, but in a few days, adipose tissue will predominate. In rat liver, however, high doses cause induction of CYP1A2 enzyme, and this binds dioxins. Thus, depending on the dose, the ratio of fat and liver tissue concentrations may vary considerably in rodents.
Sources of human exposure.
The most important source of human exposure is fatty food of animal origin (see Human intake, above). There is quite a lot of variation between different countries as to the most important items. In U.S. and Central Europe, milk and dairy products and meat have been by far the most important sources. In some countries, notably in Finland and to some extent in Sweden, fish is important due to contaminated Baltic fish and very low intake from any other sources. In most countries, a significant decrease of dioxin intake has occurred due to stricter controls during the last 20 years.
Historically occupational exposure to dioxins has been a major problem. Dioxins are formed as important toxic side products in the production of PCBs, chlorophenols, chlorophenoxy acid herbicides, and other chlorinated organic chemicals. This caused very high exposures to workers in poorly controlled hygienic conditions. Many workers had chloracne. In a NIOSH study in the U.S., the average concentration of TCDD in exposed persons was 233 ng/kg (in serum lipid) while it was 7 ng/kg in unexposed workers, even though the exposure had been 15–37 years earlier. This indicates a huge previous exposure, in fact the exact back-calculation is debated, and the concentrations may have been even several times higher than originally estimated.
Handling and spraying of chlorophenoxy acid herbicides may also cause quite high exposures, as clearly demonstrated by the users of Agent Orange in the Malayan Emergency and in the Vietnam War. The highest concentrations were detected in nonflying enlisted personnel (e.g. filling the tanks of planes), although the variation was huge, 0 to 618 ng/kg TCDD (mean 23.6 ng/kg). Other occupational exposures (working at paper and pulp mills, steel mills and incinerators) have been remarkably lower.
Accidental exposures have been huge in some cases. The highest concentrations in people after the Seveso accident were 56,000 ng/kg, and the highest exposure ever recorded was found in Austria in 1998, 144,000 ng/kg (see TCDD). This is equivalent to a dose of 20 to 30 μg/kg TCDD, a dose that would be lethal to guinea pigs and some rat strains.
Exposure from contaminated soil is possible when children eat dirt or if dioxins are blown up in dust. This was clearly demonstrated in Missouri, when waste oils were used as dust suppressant in horse arenas. Many horses and other animals were killed due to poisoning. Dioxins are neither volatile nor water soluble, and therefore exposure of human beings depends on direct eating of soil or production of dust which carries the chemical. Contamination of ground water or breathing vapour of the chemical are not likely to cause a significant exposure. Currently, in the United States, there are 126 Superfund sites (with a completed exposure pathway) contaminated with dioxins.
TEF values.
All dioxin-like compounds share a common mechanism of action via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), but their potencies are very different. This means that similar effects are caused by all of them, but much larger doses of some of them are needed than of TCDD. Binding to the AHR as well as persistence in the environment and in the organism depends on the presence of so-called "lateral chlorines", in case of dioxins and furans, chlorine substitutes in positions 2,3,7, and 8. Each additional non-lateral chlorine decreases the potency, but qualitatively the effects remain similar. Therefore a simple sum of different dioxin congeners is not a meaningful measure of toxicity. To compare the toxicities of various congeners and to render it possible to make a toxicologically meaningful sum of a mixture, a toxicity equivalency (TEQ) concept was created.
Each congener has been given a toxicity equivalence factor (TEF). This indicates its relative toxicity as compared with TCDD. Most TEFs have been extracted from "in vivo" toxicity data on animals, but if these are missing (e.g. in case of some PCBs), less reliable "in vitro" data have been used. After multiplying the actual amount or concentration of a congener by its TEF, the product is the virtual amount or concentration of TCDD having effects of the same magnitude as the compound in question. This multiplication is done for all compounds in a mixture, and these "equivalents of TCDD" can then simply be added, resulting in TEQ, the amount or concentration of TCDD toxicologically equivalent to the mixture.
The TEQ conversion makes it possible to use all studies on the best studied TCDD to assess the toxicity of a mixture. This resembles the common measure of all alcoholic drinks: beer, wine and whiskey can be added together as absolute alcohol, and this sum gives the toxicologically meaningful measure of the total impact.
The TEQ only applies to dioxin-like effects mediated by the AHR. Some toxic effects (especially of PCBs) may be independent of the AHR, and those are not taken into account by using TEQs.
TEFs are also approximations with certain amount of scientific judgement rather than scientific facts. Therefore they may be re-evaluated from time to time. There have been several TEF versions since the 1980s. The most recent re-assessment was by an expert group of the World Health organization in 2005.

Plot.
Poovalli Induchoodan (Mohanlal) is sentenced for six years prison life for murdering his classmate. Induchoodan, the only son of Justice Maranchery Karunakara Menon (Thilakan) was framed in the case by Manapally Madhavan Nambiar (Narayanan Nair) and his crony DYSP Sankaranarayanan (Bheeman Raghu) to take revenge on idealist judge Menon who had earlier given jail sentence to Manapally in a corruption case. Induchoodan, who had achieved top rank in Indian Civil Service loses the post and Manapally Sudheeran (Sai Kumar) enters the list of civil service trainees. We learn in flashback that it was Ramakrishnan (E A Rajendran) the son of Moopil Nair (Narendra Prasad), who had actually killed his classmate. Six years passes by and Manapally Madhavan Nambiar, now a former state minister, is dead and Induchoodan, who is all rage at the gross injustice meted out to him - thus destroying his promising life, is released from prison. Induchoodan thwarts Manapally Pavithran (N F Varghese) from performing the funeral rituals of Nambiar at Bharathapuzha. Many confrontations between Induchoodan and Manapally's henchmen follow.
Justice Menon and his wife returns to Kerala to stay with Induchoodan. There is an appearance of a girl named Indulekha (Kanaka), who claims to be the daughter of Justice Menon. Menon flatly refuses the claim and banishes her. Forced by circumstances and at the instigation and help of Manapally Pavithran, she reluctantly come out open with the claim. Induchoodan at first thrashes the protesters. But upon knowing the truth from Chandrabhanu(Jagathi Sreekumar) his uncle, he accepts the task of her protection in the capacity as elder brother. Induchoodan decides to marry off Indulekha to his good friend Jayakrishnan (Vijayakumar).

Shovel ready

The term shovel ready is a political neologism used to describe a construction project (usually larger-scale infrastructure) where project planning, engineering and funding have advanced to the stage where laborers may immediately be employed to begin work.
History.
Writing for the Washington Post, writer Manuel Roig-Franzia sardonically suggested that the phrase did not exist and had never been used before President Barack Obama used it during an interview with Meet the Press on 6 December 2008. Obama used the phrase to describe infrastructure projects that were ready to immediately receive stimulus funding. 
Later, other commentators suggested the phrase denoted projects which were able to begin construction within a specific time-frame of ""three or four months"" on a "use it or lose it" basis.
In the US.
Having originated in the United States, the term is now used generally in reference to projects which are candidates for economic stimulus spending: money put into a shovel ready project will have a more immediate impact on the economy than money spent on a project on which a great deal of time must elapse for architecture, zoning, legal considerations or other such factors before labor can be deployed on it.
In Iowa, the "Seven County Corridor Alliance" (Benton County, Cedar County, Iowa County, Johnson County, Jones County, Linn County and Washington County) established a "Shovel Ready Certification Program" to certify projects as "shovel ready" which will be ""added to a local, regional and statewide inventory of sites with similar qualifications and will be strongly marketed"".
The Georgia Department of Transportation has established specific criteria projects must meet to be considered "shovel ready" including National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) clearances and relevant property acquisition requirements.
In Australia.
In Australia, the term is also used in relation to stimulus funding; specifically funding programs like the "Building the Education Revolution" (BER) program. In 2009, the term "shovel-ready" won the Macquarie Dictionary "Word of the Year" award.
In Scotland.
In Scotland, the phrase is used in a similar context. For example, Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment, Alex Neil, used the term in March 2012 to describe the status of 36 infrastructure projects on a list handed to the Government of the United Kingdom for potential funding.
In Great Britain.
In Great Britain, the phrase has been used on a number of occasions by Vincent De Rivaz, the Chief Executive of EDF Energy, in the context of a proposed new nuclear power station in Somerset.

River Gwili

The River Gwili () in Carmarthenshire, is a tributary of the River Towy, the longest river entirely in Wales. Its headwater is found east of Llanllawddog, in the Brechfa Forest. It runs west, through Llanpumsaint, to its confluence with the River Duad, just south of Cynwyl Elfed village. Here its course turns to the southeast, running through Bronwydd before joining the River Towy at Abergwili.
The River Gwili gives its name to a number of settlements, as well as the West Wales General Hospital which is commonly known as Glangwili Hospital. The Carmarthen Aberystwyth Line once followed the course of the river between Abergwili and Llanpumsaint and the dismantled railway line can still be seen right along the valley. In 1978 a section of the line was reopened in Bronwydd for tourists and was given the name Gwili Railway.
The River Gwili is popular with both anglers and canoeists.

Daniel Hoevels

Daniel Hoevels (born 10 March 1978) is a Swedish-born German theater actor. "Hamburger Abendblatt" has described his work as helping critics rediscover Hamburg's theater. On 6 December 2008, Hoevels accidentally slit his neck while playing "Mortimer" in "Mary Stuart", written by Friedrich Schiller, which led to near fatal injury.
Early life and acting career.
Hoevels was born in Sweden. He attended the staatlichen Theaterakademie in Hamburg, Germany, where he lives. After three years studying politics in Berlin, he found that he was born to work on stage.
He trained as an actor at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater (music and theater academy) in Hamburg between 2001 and 2004, and acted in some films and theater productions in Hamburg and Weimar during that time. His role at the Nationaltheater Weimar in 2004 was the first of several Shakespeare parts: he played Malvolio in a performance of "Twelfth Night". He joined the Thalia Theater (Hamburg) in 2004, where his first roles were Huck in "Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn", Haimon in Christine Eders's "Antigone", and King Lear in Andreas Kriegenburg's production of the eponymous Shakespeare play. His subsequent Shakespearean roles have been Lysander in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Romeo Montague in "Romeo and Juliet". He is noted for bringing a touch of comedy to rather serious roles, such as in "King Lear" and "Mein Kampf". The "Hamburger Abendblatt" newspaper has described Hoevels's work as helping critics rediscover Hamburg's theater.
Accidental stabbing.
On 6 December 2008, Hoevels slit his neck while playing "Mortimer" in "Mary Stuart", written by Friedrich Schiller. His character's suicide scene was to feature a dull knife, though it was damaged and was replaced by a sharp one. Thalia - the theatre company - requested that the sharp one be dulled too, though this was "carelessly" disregarded. The near-fatal knife was bought at a local store and reportedly still contained a price tag.
Austrian police forces are currently investigating who failed to blunt the knife. They have not ruled out the possibility of a conspiracy, and some rumors claim that the knife was replaced by a rival of Hoevels. They reportedly questioned the cast and crew and performed DNA tests.
When Hoevels collapsed on the Burgtheater's stage, the audience reportedly began to clap. They thought that the blood spilling from Hoevels's neck was some sort of special effect. No one realised he was injured until he did not take a bow after the show.
The actor was taken to a hospital, where he was given stitches. He survived the incident because the blade barely missed his carotid artery. Hoevels returned to acting at the Burgtheater the next day.
A spokeswoman for the Burgtheater later said that reports were exaggerated, and that the audience did not applaud. Police denied that an investigation had been launched or that DNA tests of cast and crew were done.
Later performance.
Hoevels returned to Hamburg on 8 December. He was to play the title character in "The Sorrows of Young Werther" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Coincidentally, Werther was also to commit suicide in the play, albeit by a gun.

Duquesne Country and Athletic Club

The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club was a professional football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1895 until 1900. The team was considered one of the best, if not the best, professional football teams in the country from 1898 until 1900. However the team is most famous for being the first football franchise to be owned by an individual, William Chase Temple.
Origin.
The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, started playing in 1895 and at first intended to use only amateur players. However after four games, before playing the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, they began hiring stars and soon became the most professional team in the city.
1898.
Duquesne fielded the best team in Pittsburgh since 1895. In 1898 the Duquesnes decided to build an even better team. After the 1897 season, the club had signed a number of good players to contracts for the next year. However at this time, many of the players went into the army in the spring to fight in the Spanish-American War. This led the Duquesnes to sign replacements for those players in the army. While this at first looked to be a bad sign for Duquesne for the 1898 season, it later became a blessing in disguise. Many of replacement player that were signed proved to perform better than the originals. Then when the war ended in just a few short months and the original players returned home, the Duquesnes suddenly found themselves with a load of expensive stars. In fact it became apparent that the bench-warmers for the Duquesnes would actually be star players on lesser teams. Those players; tight end Tommy Randolph, offensive tackle Otto Wagonhurst, offensive guard John Wienstein, and running back Don McNeil would have been regulars for the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club.
All-star game.
At the end of the 1898 season, Dave Berry, the manager of the Latrobe Athletic Association came up with the idea fielding a team composed of best players, drawn from all of the other area teams. That team would then play the Duquesnes in an all-star game. Berry was able to get many of the players that he wanted for his all-star team, but not all of them. In Greensburg, local leaders urged players from the Greensburg Athletic Association not to play in the game. Also many other players had baseball to prepare for and did not bother with the game. However the game was a go and was arranged for Saturday, December 3 at Exposition Park. The Duquesnes would go on to win the game 16-0.
First individual owner.
When it became apparent around this time that the Duquesnes could not survive financially while paying its players, William C. Temple, its chairman, took over the team payments becoming the first known individual club owner. However in early days of professional football, the public wrongly viewed everyone who was playing for an athletic club, as an amateur. So the date of Temple becoming the first owner is still in question, but it is estimated by historians to be between 1898 and 1901. Several histories have tabbed the 1898 season, when the team was suddenly confronted with more players under contract than they'd expected. While others argue for 1899, when several new stars were hired to keep the team on top. The NFL's official chronology states that in 1900 Temple took over the D.C. & A.C. payments. Temple, a local steel magnate, was also a part owner and president of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Move to Homestead.
The Duquesnes had become the best pro team in Pennsylvania and, almost certainly, in the country. In 1900, A.C. Dinkey stole most of the Duquesne players, as well as Temple, for his Homestead Library & Athletic Club, an organization that had existed since 1894 in the Pittsburgh suburb of Homestead, Pennsylvania, offering them higher salaries. Like the Duquesnes, that team became a national powerhouse in football for the next two years. Meanwhile Duquesne in 1900 found itself posting a financial loss, resulting in the club to fold its professional football team immediately.

Ala Paredes

Angela "Ala" Paredes is an Australia-based Filipino environmental activist, commercial model and writer, who at various times in her career was also a TV host, vj, advice columnist, and vocalist for Filipino alternative band Hiraya. Since moving to Australia, she has become one of the correspondents covering Australia for the Philippines' ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.
Education and early career.
Paredes graduated from high school in 2000 at the School of the Holy Spirit (SHSQC), a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school in Quezon City. She then moved on to the Ateneo de Manila University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Communication in 2004.
She first ventured into modeling in her junior year in college, doing a commercial for a facial wash, and soon endorsing a clothing line. Initially Ala was perceived to have the advantage of a familiar family name: she is the second daughter of singer Jim Paredes of the Apo Hiking Society. But she soon became popular in her own right, taking up social causes just as her father, well known for his advocacies, did before her.
"Unconventional Beauty".
In her first forays as a television personality, doing television ads, she quickly became a recognizable figure, distinguished by her morena (malay brown) complexion and curly hair, a sharp contrast to the traditional look of models at the time. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism took note of her unusual success and said:
At around the same time, Paredes began blogging regularly, with her blog soon becoming popular and earning her a reputation as a celebrity blogger – a role she would later use to promote environmental issues.
Media work in the Philippines.
Paredes' modeling career soon burgeoned into a television career. She continued modelling occasionally but became a regular VJ for ABS-CBN's music channel MYX, and then later the host of IslaMusik, a television show on ABC 5 featuring a musicians from all over the Philippines. She also often served as a presentor at numerous events. As a writer, she also became an advice columnist for Pink magazine.
Hiraya vocalist.
In 2005, Paredes became the frontwoman of a Pinoy rock band Hiraya when the original vocalist left. Guitarist Mark Verzo, bassist Marco Cuneta on bass, and drummer Paulo Tomas recruited her to become the replacement vocalist. The band had already released an EP, with their previous vocalist, when Ala took over. She stayed with the band until a short time before she moved to Australia with her family in 2006.
Move to Australia.
In 2006, the Paredes family decided to migrate to Australia – a decision which Jim Paredes explained was related to a desire for greater personal development. The move generated some controversy when a copyeditor for a prominent Philippine newspaper wrote a headline that said Mr. Paredes, known for his activism, was "giving up on the Philippines." Both Jim and Ala Paredes protested that this was a miscategorization of their family's motives for moving. The paper eventually apologized to the Paredes family for the original, inaccurate headline of the article. Mr Paredes later said that he ""felt bad not so much that people misread me as a person (that's hurtful, yes) but more so that they may slip deeper into despair by such a false story. That's the last thing we need,"" and Ala expressed similar sentiments.
Media work and studies.
Even after migrating to a new country, however, Ala Paredes continued to be deeply involved in things Filipino – this time, specifically the Filipino community in Australia. In the same year that the Paredeses moved to Australia, she was recruited by ABS-CBN Global, the international multi-platform media company of Filipino media giant ABS-CBN, to be a correspondent for Balitang Australia, a weekly news and feature program catering specifically to Filipino Australians.
Paredes later decided to take up an illustration course from the Sydney Design Institute, graduating in December 2009.
Ampatuan trial sketch artist.
Paredes had barely graduated three weeks when she was given the high-profile job as the official courtroom sketch artist at the trial of Andal Ampatuan, Jr., the prime suspect in the Maguindanao massacre. Paredes had gone on vacation in the Philippines to spend the holidays with relatives, when a friend of hers who worked at the Supreme Court of the Philippines called about an open position for a courtroom sketch artist at the Ampatuan trial. Courtroom sketches were needed because media coverage at the trial was restricted.
Describing the moment, she said that she "“immediately called my friend back 10 seconds after receiving her message and accepted the offer. We did not talk about the (pay).”" Noting the importance of the case, she said that "“At a time when the nation is still grieving, I feel like this is my way of getting involved,”" and "“I thought this is my own way of giving public service, especially when media can’t be there.”"

Pierre-Célestin Rwigema

Pierre-Célestin Rwigema (born 27 July 1953) is a Hutu Rwandan politician previously associated with the moderate faction of the MDR party. He was Prime Minister of Rwanda from 1995–2000 and Education Minister from 1994-1995. When he was sworn in as Prime Minister he pledged to reunite his then ethnically torn country. 
In 2001, he was accused of alleged involvement in the Rwandan Genocide and had an arrest warrant issued for him by the Rwandan government. These charges were brought against him after his resignation as Prime Minister, when he fled to the United States to seek political asylum. At the time of the accusation, he was studying towards a Master's degree in Business Administration at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, United States. The political climate in Rwanda was volatile at the time. The speaker of the house, Joseph Sabarenzi, resigned and fled. There was allegations of a royalist faction working to undermine the RPF government, and restore the Tutsi monarchy. It has been reported that these charges against him may have been politically motivated. According to Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi and former speaker of the national assembly from 1997 to 2000, in his newly published memoir "God Sleeps in Rwanda", he says that Rwigema was innocent. As quoted in Sebarenzi's memoir: "Regularly I would hear from friends or on the radio that someone else in Rwanda was being targeted. There was Pierre Celestin Rwigema, the prime minister. He was forced to resign. While I was speaker, we had investigated him for mismanagement and embezzlement. The RPF wanted him out and hoped we would censure him. But our investigation could not prove that he had done anything wrong, so we cleared him. I knew that the RPF would not let that stand. So when I heard that Rwigema had resigned, I was not surprised. He eventually fled to the United States. The government of Rwanda told the U.S. government that he was involved in the genocide and asked that he be arrested. But an immigration judge cleared him". He was eventually proven innocent and granted political asylum by the United States immigration court in Detroit.
In October 2011, Rwanda's prosecutor general, Martin Ngoga reported to the media that the judicial process in Rwanda also found no evidence indicting Rwigema in involvement with genocide and therefore his case was suspended. 
Mr Rwigema returned to Rwanda after 11 years in exile, stating that he was returning freely, and soon held a press conference where he revealed that his primary motivation to return home was to participate in the ongoing development of the country.
In early May 2012, Mr Rwigema was one of 8 candidates elected by the Rwandan parliament among 18 candidates to represent Rwanda in the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA).

Pistoia Cathedral

Pistoia Cathedral ( or "Cattedrale di San Zeno") is the main religious building of Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy, located in the "Piazza del Duomo" in the centre of the city. It is the seat of the Bishop of Pistoia and is dedicated to Saint Zeno of Verona.
Most probably built in the 10th century, it has a façade in Romanesque style, inspired by other churches in Pistoia (San Bartolomeo and San Jacopo). The interior has a nave and two side-aisles, with a presbytery and crypt. A restoration in 1952-1999 returned the church to its original lines.
History.
It has been speculated that a smaller cathedral may have existed in Pistoia as early as the 5th century AD, as it had already a bishop at that time. The location of such a building is however unknown: possible sites are those of the current cathedral, of the Pieve di Sant'Andrea or of San Pier Maggiore. 
The first mention of a cathedral dates to 923. In 998 a diploma of Emperor Otto III refers to a Palaeo-Christian building located between the "cathedral square" ("Piazza del Duomo") and the city's watch tower. In 1108 the cathedral was damaged by a fire, and was probably rebuilt over the next few decades, as in 1145 an altar was dedicated in it to Saint James the Great by Bishop Saint Atto. In 1202 another fire damaged the cathedral again. In 1274-1275 the aisles were covered with vaults, while in 1298 there was further damage caused by an earthquake. In 1336 a statue of Saint Zeno was placed in the west front, sculpted by Jacopo di Mazzeo.
Between 1379 and 1440 the façade was reconstructed with the addition of three tiers of loggias and a portico. In 1504 Andrea della Robbia was commissioned to undertake the decoration of the archivolt (for which he created a festoon with plant themes and, in the middle, the crest of the Opera di San Jacopo), of the portico as well as of the lunette with bas-reliefs over the central portal, depicting the "Madonna with Child and Angels". He finished the works in 1505.
In 1598-1614 the medieval choir was demolished, the side chapels were modified and the original apse was replaced by a Baroque tribune surmounted by a dome designed by Jacopo Lafri, while the main aisle was covered by new cross vaults. The decoration of the tribune ceilng was also undertaken, and paintings in the same area and in the main chapel were added. In 1721 a statue of Saint James the Great, by Andrea Vaccà, was added to the façade. The medieval mullioned windows, replaced by Baroque windows, were restored between 1952 and 1966, and the vaults over the aisle were removed. 
Interior.
The presbytery pavement is raised, housing the crypt underneath, while the nave and the aisles, separated by columns, have vaults and wooden truss covers respectively. The right aisle was once occupied by the Chapel of St. James ("San Jacopo"), built by bishop Atto in the mid-12th century to house the relics of Saint James brought from Santiago de Compostela. The silver altar of the saint can be seen today in the Crucifix Chapel.
Chapel of the Holy Sacrament.
The Chapel of the Holy Sacrament ("Capello del Santissimo Sacramento"), which houses the tabernacle, is also known as the Chapel of San Donato from a painting portraying the "Madonna Enthroned between St. John the Baptist and St. Donatus" (c. 1475-1486), on the right hand wall. The painting had been commissioned from Andrea del Verrocchio by the heirs of Donato de' Medici and was started by him but, left unfinished, was completed by Lorenzo di Credi. The bishop next to the Madonna has been identified as Saint Zeno. In the middle is the "Assumption of the Virgin" by Giovan Battista Paggi (1590-1600), while next to the entrance is the tomb of Donato de' Medici (1475), attributed to Antonio Rossellino.
Crucifix Chapel.
This chapel contains the altar of Saint James, in embossed silver sheet, which was moved here in 1953. It was begun in 1287, when Andrea di Jacopo d'Ognabene was commissioned to make representations of the "Madonna and Child" for the rear of the altar, and, for the front section, of "Stories of the New Testament", "Christ in Majesty between Mary and St. James" and "Three Stories of St. James", which he finished in 1316. Giglio Pisano executed the large silver statue depicting "St. James Enthroned" (1349-1353), commissioned as thanksgiving after the end of the Black Death in 1348.
The two side antependia were executed by Leonardo di Ser Giovanni and Francesco Niccolai, with "Stories of the Old Testament" and "Stories of St. James", between 1361 and 1371. Other works include the "Apostles, St. Eulalia, Bishop Atto, St. John the Baptist and Salome" by Piero d'Arrigo Tedesco (1380-1390), another "Christ in Majesty with St. Anthony Abbot, St. Stephen" and the cusp by Nofri di Buto and Atto di Piero Braccini (1394-1398).
Filippo Brunelleschi decorated the front part with two busts of prophets (1401). The other sides were decorated by Piero d'Antonio da Pisa and Domenico da Imola.
Aisles.
Works in the south aisle include:
Works in the north aisle include:
Presbytery.
The vault of the presbytery is decorated by frescoes by Domencio Cresti, depicting the "Father in Glory", "Fall of the Rebel Angels", "Fall of Adam" and the "Annunciation" (1602). The organ is from 1793.
In the apse is a painting by Cristofano Allori portraying the Resurrection (1606-1610), beside which are two clay statues of Saint Zeno and Saint James (1609), attributed to the school of Giambologna. To the right of the high altar is a "Pentecost" by Gregorio Pagani (1602), while on the left is an "Ascension" by Benedetto Veli" (1606).
Salerno di Coppo executed the fresco of the Madonna and Child on the pilaster in the nave (1475). On the right is a bronze candelabrum by Maso di Bartolomeo (1442), while in the left aisle is the cenotaph of bishop Gherardo Gherardi (1703) and, in the right one, the tomb of bishop Alessandro Del Caccia (1650), and the funerary monument of bishop Leone Strozzi (1695), both by unknown sculptors.
The pulpit was designed by Giorgio Vasari (1560). Next to the right entrance is a sculpted stoup attributed to Nicola Pisano's workshop.
Others.
The Chapel of the Last Judgement houses fragments of a fresco by Giovanni da Ponte, dating to 1420-1425. The lateral wall fragments have recently been identified as a depiction of Dante's Inferno. 
The crypt is that of the Romanesque building, and was originally divided into a central and side spaces by columns, and had three apses. After the construction of the Baroque tribune, the central room was destroyed and the side ones buried. After the 1960s restoration, here were found two capitals, fragments of columns, fragments of 12th-century frescoes, and two marble slabs from the late 12th century.
The counter-façade houses the Arch of St. Atto, with three marble bas-reliefs from 1337. The baptismal font, to a design by Benedetto da Maiano (1497), can be seen on the left of the main entrance. In the tympanum over the latter is also a 13th-century fresco by an unknown 13th-century master, while next to the right entrance are frescoes of the "Virtues" by Bonaccorso di Cino (1347) and, near the left entrance, the tomb of Bishop Baronto Ricciardi (14th century).

Latin Quarter (nightclub)

Latin Quarter (also known as LQ) is a nightclub in New York City.
The Club which originally opened in 1942 featured big name acts. In recent years it has been a focus of hip hop, reggaeton, and salsa music.
Its history is similar to that of its competitor the Copacabana.
Times Square location.
Lou Walters, father of Barbara Walters opened the club in 1942 at 1580 Broadway at 47th Street in a landmark three-story wedge shaped building that marked the north end of Times Square and was famed for the signs on the building's south side where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross. Its most famous sign was the neon Coca-Cola sign.
Prior to Walters, the building was home to the Palais Royale with the Moulin Rouge in the basement in the 1920s. Norman Bel Geddes had designed the interior. Following this it was occupied by the Cotton Club after it left Harlem from 1936 to 1940.
Walters opened branches of the nightclub in other cities and was to sell the Boston club to Michael Redstone, father of Sumner Redstone.
During Walters tenure the Club featured big name acts like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Patti Page, The Carter Family, Sophie Tucker, Mae West, Diahann Carroll, Milton Berle, The Andrews Sisters, Frankie Laine, and Ted Lewis along with chorus girls and concluded with a can can dance.
Walters left the business in the 1950s. Earl Wilson described the club under its new management in 1964 as "more expensive" than the Copacabana - "but then the show's a bit bigger, nakeder and longer." 
In 1969, during a strike by the chorus girls, the club was padlocked for not paying rent.
Cine Lido.
From 1969 to 1978 the upstairs room was a 575 seat Cine Lido that initially started showing upscale soft pornography opening with the film "Camille 2000" (1969). On July 25, 1973, Cine Lido along with 10 other New York "art houses" were raided and a copy of "The Newcomers" was confiscated. Cine Lido closed in May 1978 and it was replaced by the 22 Steps disco (named for the number of steps to the theatre).
Broadway theatre.
In 1979 it opened as a Broadway theater called 22 Steps with performances of "Coquelico", "My Old Friends", "The Madwoman of Central Park West", and "Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth".
From 1980 to 1984 it was renamed the Princess Theater with performances of "Censored Scenes from King Kong", "Fearless Frank", "The Beautiful Mariposa", "Sort of an Adventure", "Louie and the Elephant", "This Was Burlesque", "Pump Boys and Dinettes", and "The Babe".
From 1984 to 1985 it was renamed Latin Quarter with performances of André DeShield's "Harlem Nocturne" and "Mayor".
Nightclub again.
After 1985 it opened again as a nightclub of the same name and focused on hip hop music. Boogie Down Productions referenced the club in their 1987 song "Super Ho". Ice-T also referenced the club in his songs 6 in the Mornin' (1987) and "Heartbeat" (1988). In 1987, three patrons were shot as they left the club after a performance by Roxanne Shante.
Later, the club was renamed the Penguin Club and became infamous for stabbings and fights.
The building was eventually torn down in 1989 and replaced by a 22-story Ramada Renaissance Hotel. 48th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue is now named "Lou Walters Way." The club opened again in the Upper West Side, at 2551 Broadway at 96th Street ().
In 2003, Producer Ralph Mercado (who had founded RMM Records & Video) reopened the club at 511 Lexington at 48th Street in the Radisson Lexington Hotel on the East Side. Although still known as the Latin Quarter, signage at the club referred to it as "LQ." In December 2004, a fight at the club during a Ja Rule holiday party, spilled onto the street where one man was fatally shot and another wounded in a dispute that reportedly involved associates of The Inc. Records
On November 29, 2008, former New York Giants & Pittsburgh Steelers football player Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the right leg while he was standing in an elevator vestibule, between the VIP room and the coat check. Burress pled guilty to charges and received a 2 year prison sentence. These recent events led to a Manhattan Community Board 6 recommending that the club's liquor license not be renewed.
Guests.
Ann and Woodford Flowers are known to have had their first date together at the club in 1944.

Grbac posted his second (a school record that he would later extend) and the school's fifth 4-touchdown performance against Florida State on August 28. His season total of 25 touchdown passes surpassed his own school record of 21 set the prior year. His junior year total of 54 touchdown passes set a new school record, eclipsing Rick Leach's total of 48 set in 1978. He also tied Jim Harbaugh's 1986 single-season completion percentage record of 65.0, which was surpassed the following year by Todd Collins. On September 14, his 20–22 performance against Notre Dame established the current single-game completion percentage, ecplising his own September 16, 1989 17–21 performance against Notre Dame. On September 7, Howard became the third Michigan receiver to post a 3-touchdown reception performance and on October 19, he became the first two do so twice (a feat later matched by David Terrell and Braylon Edwards). The following season Derrick Alexander would become the only Wolverine to post a 4-touchdown reception performance.

Jules Danbé

Jules Danbé (16 November 1840 – 30 October 1905) was a French violinist, composer and conductor, mainly of opera. 
Biography.
Danbé was born in Caen, Calvados. Trained as a violinist, he was a pupil of Narcisse Girard and Marie Gabriel Augustin Savard, in 1859 winning a first prize for violin. He gained much experience playing in the orchestras of the Vaudeville, Théâtre Lyrique and with the Concerts Pasdeloup, and in 1871 founded the Concerts Danbé at the Grand-Hôtel in Paris, as well mounting concerts at the Salle Herz in 1874 and the Salle Ventadour in 1875. 
Danbé was principal conductor at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in 1876, conducting "Dimitri", "Les Erynnies" and "Paul et Virginie" (whose premiere at the Opéra-Comique he also conducted). Appointed conductor at the Opéra-Comique on 2 June 1877, he took up his duties on 1 September that year, remaining until April 1898. His tenure, assisted by Henri Vaillard and Giannini, was considered to have improved the quality of the orchestral playing; in 1889, a performance of the Verdi Requiem drew the comment that the orchestra was probably the best in Paris.
As well as conducting the central repertoire at the Opéra-Comique he conducted the premieres of the following operas:
He also conducted an early revival by the Opéra-Comique of "Les Troyens à Carthage" (in the same theatre as its premiere) in June 1892 which witnessed a triumphant début for the 17 year-old Marie Delna.
Danbé was Director of Music of the Foundation Beaulieu (1888-1905). A member of the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, Danbé resigned in May 1884 but re-joined on 3 June 1884 and took the Second chair, First Violins, on 14 October 1884, joining Jules Garcin, concertmaster, becoming 2nd chef (and concertmaster) on 2 June 1885, replacing Garcin, and retiring from the Société on 3 June 1892. He was a mentor and teacher for Pierre Monteux, whom he presented for entry at the Conservatoire.
After leaving the Opéra-Comique, in 1899 he moved to the Théâtre Lyrique de la Renaissance, where he conducted a rare production of "Iphigénie en Tauride" in December of that year, and also conducted classical concerts at the casinos of Néris-les-Bains and Vichy.
He composed works for violin and was author of a violin method. He received the Légion d'Honneur in 1885.

Sustainable Table

Sustainable Table was created in 2003 by the nonprofit organization GRACE to help consumers understand the problems with our food supply and offer viable solutions and alternatives from sustainable agriculture. Rather than be overwhelmed by the problems created by our industrial agricultural system, Sustainable Table celebrates the joy of food and eating from sustainable food systems.
Today’s dominant form of agriculture relies on synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides, large amounts of water, major transportation systems and factory-style practices for raising livestock and crops. Artificial hormones in milk, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, mad cow disease, and large-scale outbreaks of potentially deadly E. coli are all associated with this industrial form of food production.
Sustainable agriculture involves food production methods that are healthy, do not harm the environment, respect workers, are humane to animals, provide fair wages to farmers, and support farming communities. But rather than focus on the problems, Sustainable Table promotes the positive shift toward local, small-scale sustainable farming.
The program is home to the Eat Well Guide, an online directory of sustainable products in the U.S. and Canada, and the critically acclaimed, award-winning Meatrix movies - The Meatrix, The Meatrix II: Revolting and The Meatrix II½. Sustainable Table celebrates local sustainable food, educates consumers on food-related issues and works to build community through food.

Peter Clewes

Peter Clewes is a Canadian architect and the principal of the Toronto-based firm architectsAlliance. He has been one of the leading architects in the condo boom that has reshaped Toronto in the first decade of the 21st century. His projects include SP!RE, Casa Condominio Residenza, Murano, Burano, X Condominium, 20 Niagara, and MoZo. He most often works for Howard Cohen of Context Developments. 
Clewes designed buildings can be described as neomodern. He is notable for creating unadorned towers with large expanses of glass and well thought out interior layouts. He is a critic of neo-historical and postmodern structures, arguing there is no reason to force tiny windows and aged styles when modern technology can create expansive floor to ceiling windows. He has argued forcefully against contextualism, and has not employed it for projects such as his Distillery District designs. He told the "Globe and Mail" "We need to create buildings of our time. Architecture is a record of where a city and a culture was at a particular time." His designs have been well received by customers and critics. Christopher Hume is one of his strongest advocates. Hume, the architecture critic for the "Toronto Star", has given rare A ratings to several of Clewes' designs and has called him "the leading condo designer of his generation"
Originally from Montreal, Clewes studied at the University of Waterloo. From university he gained a co-op placement with the renowned Arthur Erickson. He then joined Erickson's firm in Toronto. With Erickson he participated in a number of major projects, including the Canadian Embassy in Washington. In 1986, he left to help form a separate practice, Wallman Clewes Bergman. Wallman Clewes Bergman merged with Van Nostrand DiCastri Architects in 1999 to form architectsAlliance. Clewes has taught at the University of Toronto and is a currently a member of the Toronto Waterfront Design Review Panel.

Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge

Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) is a biometric project.
Background.
Over the last decade, numerous government and industry organizations have moved or are moving toward deploying automated biometric technologies to provide increased security for their systems and facilities. Six U.S. Government organizations recently sponsored the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC), Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) 2006 and the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) 2006. Results from the FRGC and FRVT 2006 documented two orders of magnitude improvement in the performance of face recognition under full-frontal, controlled conditions over the last 14 years. For the first time, ICE 2006 provided an independent assessment of multiple iris recognition algorithms on the same data set. However, further advances in these technologies are needed to meet the full range of operational requirements. Many of these requirements focus on biometric samples taken under less than ideal conditions, for example:
Building on the challenge problem and evaluation paradigm of FRGC, FRVT 2006, ICE 2005 and ICE 2006, the Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) will address these problem areas.
Overview.
The primary goal of the MBGC is to investigate, test and improve performance of face and iris recognition technology on both still and video imagery through a series of challenge problems and evaluation. The MBGC seeks to reach this goal through several technology development areas:
The MBGC will consist of a set of challenge problems designed to advance the current state of technology and conclude with a planned independent evaluation. Challenge problems will focus on three major areas:
These challenge problems will allow for fusion of face and iris at both the score level and the image level.
Challenge Problem Structure Overview.
The Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge is based on previous challenges directed by Dr. P. Jonathon Phillips. Specifically the Facial Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) and the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE 2005). The programmatic process of a Challenge Problem is as follows. The Challenge Team designs the protocols, challenge problems, prepares challenge infrastructure, and composes the necessary data sets. Organizations then sign licenses to receive the data and begin to develop technology (mostly computer algorithms) in an attempt to solve the various challenges laid out by the Challenge Team. To advance and inform the various participants and interested parties the Team hosts workshops. The first workshop gives an overview of the challenge and introduces the first set of challenge problems (typically referred to as Version 1). The data sets are then released to participating organizations who develop their algorithms and submit self reported results back to the Challenge Team in the form of similarity matrices. The Team analyzes these results and then hosts another workshop. At the 2nd Workshop the Challenge Team reports the results from Challenge Version 1 and releases the Challenge Version 2. The cycle is repeated, finishing with a final workshop. At this stage the Participants are requested to submit not their self reported results, but the actual executables (or SDKs) to their algorithms. The Challenge Team then runs these algorithms through a battery of tests on large sequestered datasets. This phase ultimately determines the performance levels of the participant’s algorithms. A final report is issued by the Team which is used by Industries and Governments to determine the actual state of the art in a given field and to provide participating organizations a basis for showing their performance within that field.
MBGC Challenge Version 1.
The Multiple Biometric Challenge Version 1 was released in April 2008. This initial set of challenge problems had the following goals.
The Version 1 series was separated into three distinct areas with various experiments under those areas.
Version 1 results were submitted in November 2008, and reported at the MBGC 2nd Workshop in December 2008.
MBGC Challenge Version 2.
Will be released in January 2009. Submitted results will be reported at the MBGC 3rd Workshop in Spring 2009.
Multiple Biometric Evaluation (MBE).
The Multiple Biometric Evaluation (MBE) will begin in Summer 2009. The purpose of the MBE is to conduct an independent evaluation of the MBGC submissions on large sequestered data sets.

Androcydes (Pythagorean)

Androcydes (also transliterated as Androkydes) was a Pythagorean whose work "On Pythagorean Symbols" survives only in scattered fragments. The dating of his life is uncertain; he lived before the 1st century BC but possibly as early as the 4th. The frequency with which Androcydes is mentioned in other works indicates that he was a major source for the later Pythagorean tradition, and he is also of interest in studying the historical development of the literary and philosophical symbol.
The Pythagorean symbols.
Walter Burkert featured Androcydes in his stemma of Pythagorean "symbola", consisting of gnomic utterances or maxims. Androcydes was regarded as one of the most important sources on the "akousmata", or the quasi-monastic rule governing the Pythagorean way of life. His view that wine and meat harm the mind conforms to Pythagorean dietary practice.
Paraphrases of his work in later writers demonstrate his method of interpreting these behavioral strictures. For instance, “Do not step over a yoke” should be understood as meaning “Do not transgress justice.” These interpretations indicate that the prohibitions held arcane significance for those willing to ponder them and learn, that the "symbola" are also "enigmata" (αἰνίγματα).
The 1st-century BC grammarian Tryphon refers to Androcydes’ work in a section on literary "enigmata", which he defines as darkened or obscured allegories. Tryphon implies that Androcydes made no strong distinction between poetic and philosophical modes of discourse, in that he cited passages from Hesiod in interpreting the Pythagorean symbols.
The symbols and magic.
Androcydes treated the "Ephesia grammata", or ritualized “magic words” used for incantations or amuletic inscriptions, as allegorical language containing theological insights, a “cryptic form of natural theology.” Androcydes interprets the words through perceived lexical and phonic similarities to Greek. His commentary on perhaps the best-known string of such syllables — "askion kataskion lix tetrax damnameneus aision" — is paraphrased by Clement of Alexandria:
The physician?
Some attempts have been made to identify this Androcydes with the Androcydes who was physician to Alexander the Great. Pythagorean dietary discipline regarding wine (bad) and cabbage (good) may be reflected in the physician’s advice to the notoriously wine-drinking conqueror.

<doc id="20664484" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20664484" title="Hey Ricky">
Hey Ricky

Hey Ricky is the title of the tenth album release by Melissa Manchester issued on Arista Records in April 1982.
During the interim between the release of "Hey Ricky" and that of the precedent "For the Working Girl" in September 1980 Manchester had attempted to extricate herself from her recording contract, filing suit in May 1981 for contractual release from Arista. However it was announced that October that the singer and label had reached terms and the track "Race to the End" - a vocal version of the "Chariots of Fire" theme - was recorded for single release. The producer was Arif Mardin who had previously collaborated with Manchester in 1979 on "Theme from Ice Castles". 
Mardin proceeded to collaborate with Manchester on the tracks which would comprise the album "Hey Ricky" released in April 1982. The lead single "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" radically reinvented Manchester as a synthpop dance artist and was heavily promoted by the singer who displayed a new image complementing the track; "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" accrued gradual interest entering the Top 40 of the "Billboard" Hot 100 in July 1982 proceeding to the Top Ten that August with a career best peak for Manchester at #5. The single's popularity was reflected in that of its parent album which "Billboard" ranked with a #19 peak. 
The other cuts on "Hey Ricky" included the 1981 "Race to the End" single, a duet with David Gates: "Wish We Were Heroes"; a new version of "Come in From the Rain" introduced by Manchester on her 1976 "Better Days and Happy Endings" album; and "Your Place or Mine" from the soundtrack of the feature film "A Little Sex". The album's title cut - written with Bernie Taupin - was issued as the followup to "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" but failed to chart. After a 1983 "Greatest Hits" album release Manchester would part company with Arista, retaining the dance artist focus of her "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" hit for two albums with MCA after which she seemingly retired as a career recording artist, with four subsequent album releases between 1989 and 2004.
Track listing.
There was only 1 MCA release in 1985 called Mathematics. After Greatest Hits on Arista in 1983, Emergency was released with two singles No One Can Love You More Than Me which charted the Hot 100 #78 and AC charts #34 & I Don't Care What The People Say. City Nights was also released as a 12" dance track and received a lot of airplay in clubs. She also performed it on Fame.

Russell Military Academy

The New Haven Collegiate and Commercial Institute (later to be known as the Russell Military Academy) was founded by Stiles French in 1833 and is a defunct military academy. The school was located at Wooster Square in New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
The school was taken over in September 1836 by William Huntington Russell, who later became a well-known citizen of Connecticut as a graduate of the Yale Medical School and as a representative of New Haven in the Legislature of Connecticut. 
Although the school was founded as a family school for boys, under the leadership of General Russell it gradually assumed the character of a military school. The school eventually became known familiarly as the Russell Military Academy. 
In about 1840, Russell introduced a very thorough military drill and discipline into his school. He foresaw the American Civil War in the future and wanted to make sure his boys were prepared to fight for the Union. During the American Civil War, the school of 130 to 160 pupils furnished more than one hundred officers for the Union Army, as well as many drill masters and volunteers. 
By the time of Russell's death in 1885, the school had become well known and had graduated around 4,000 boys. Since General Russell was the first educater in the United States to introduce physical training in a school and to start a gymnasium, these features attracted many boys from every part of the country.
On May 30, 1879, Society Kappa Psi, which later became Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity, was started on the campus of Russell Military Academy by F. Harvey Smith.

Out of Control (TV film)

Out of Control (2002) is a BBC television film written and directed by Dominic Savage. It stars Tamzin Outhwaite as Shelley Richards, an impoverished single mother whose son, Dean (Danny Young), is involved in a string of crimes that lead to his incarceration in a young offenders institute (YOI). David Morrissey plays prison warden Mike, who tries to keep Dean out of trouble but has difficultly watching him all the time. After continuous bullying at the YOI, Dean is no longer able to cope and makes a fatal decision. It is the third in a loose trilogy of films by Savage about social deprivation, following "Nice Girl" (2000) and "When I Was Twelve" (2001).
The single drama was greenlit in April 2002 by BBC controller of drama commissioning Jane Tranter, under the working title of "The Young Offenders". Savage carried out months of research into the crimes of the young boys and into the lifestyles of YOI inmates. David Morrissey shadowed prison officers at Lancaster Farms YOI for several weeks. It was filmed on location at Lancaster Farms. Savage storyboarded the scripts but left it to the actors to improvise their dialogue, so that it did not "sound too articulate".
"Out of Control" was broadcast on BBC One on 15 September 2002 as one of the lynchpins of the BBC's "Cracking Crime" day. It received only 4.1 million viewers (21.9% audience share), a result of being scheduled opposite a new episode of ITV's "Midsomer Murders". Critical reaction was positive, particularly about Tamzin Outhwaite. Outhwaite previously starred in the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", which made her "tabloid fodder". She was pleased with the enthusiastic reception that "Out of Control" got.

Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog

The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog or Sierra Nevada Mountain yellow-legged frog, Rana sierrae, is a true frog endemic to the Sierra Nevada mountains (in California and Nevada).
Physical description.
This species is very similar in appearance to the southern mountain yellow-legged frog.
Conservation status.
Shallow lakes that dry in summer endanger this high-elevation frog. Predation by non-native trout also plays a large role in limiting breeding and tadpole development. Many factors endangering the southern mountain yellow-legged frog also affect this species.

Bearcat Murray

Jim "Bearcat" Murray (born 1933) is a former athletic trainer for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers Society and the Society of Professional Hockey Equipment Managers.
Early life.
Murray was born in Vulcan, Alberta, Canada to Allan and Isabelle Murray, and moved to nearby Okotoks in 1937, where he and his family have remained integral members of the community since. The Murray Arena in Okotoks is named in honour of the family's impact on the local sports scene, as Bearcat's father was a senior ice hockey player with the High River Flyers, and his mother a leader with the local curling club. Murray earned the nickname "Bearcat" from his father, who shared the same moniker.
Self-taught, Murray served first as the trainer of the Western Hockey League's Calgary Centennials and Wranglers, and later the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys. He also spent some time as assistant trainer for the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders.
Calgary Flames.
Murray joined the Flames as their head athletic trainer in 1980 when the team arrived after relocating from Atlanta, Georgia, and held the position until his retirement in 1996. He was a part of the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship season.
Murray was famously on the ice, tending to fallen goaltender Mike Vernon while play was still ongoing, as the Flames scored a goal during their 1989 playoff series against the Los Angeles Kings. Vernon explained later that he was not hurt on the play, but went down attempting to draw a penalty after being punched by a Kings player: "I'm lying there wondering when might be a good time to sit up, and all of a sudden there's Bearcat kneeling overtop of me ... We'd just scored a goal with him on the ice and (Wayne) Gretzky was going ballistic. I think Bear thought I'd better be hurt or he might lose his job."
During a game against the Edmonton Oilers in Edmonton, Murray once went up into the stands to rescue his son Al, also a trainer for the Flames, tearing ligaments in his leg in the process. Al had been in the stands attempting to retrieve Gary Suter's stick, which had been knocked into the crowd and was being hidden by Oiler fans. Fearing things were going to escalate, Bearcat jumped into the fray himself. While being wheeled into an ambulance, Murray blew kisses for the cameras. The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston, who formed the "Bearcat Murray Fan Club", and began showing up at the Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray's looks when the Flames played there. Between 1987-89, a Montréal chapter of the Bearcat Murray Fan Club made regular appearances at the Montréal Forum when the Flames were in town.
Since retiring as the Flames's trainer in 1996, Murray has remained with the club as a community ambassador. He is the first person in PHATS history to be unanimously voted into the Hall of Fame.

Hennessy Gold Cup (Ireland)

The Hennessy Gold Cup is a Grade 1 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Leopardstown over a distance of about 3 miles (4,828 metres), and during its running there are seventeen fences to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year in February.
The event was first run in 1987, and it was originally titled the Vincent O'Brien Irish Gold Cup. It was named after Vincent O'Brien (1917–2009), who was a successful racehorse trainer. The present title was introduced in 1991, when Hennessy began sponsoring the race. It is often now referred to as the "Irish Hennessy", as there is also a long-established chase in Great Britain called the Hennessy Gold Cup.
Throughout its history the race has served as a leading trial for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Two horses have won both events in the same year – Jodami (1993) and Imperial Call (1996).

Baicalein

Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavone, a type of flavonoid, originally isolated from the roots of "Scutellaria baicalensis". It is also reported in "Oroxylum indicum" or Indian trumpetflower. It is the aglycone of baicalin.
The flavonoid has been shown to inhibit certain types of lipoxygenases and act as an anti-inflammatory agent.It has antiproliferative effects on ET-1-induced proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of TRPC1 channel expression. Possible antidepressant effects have also been attributed to baicalein in animal research.
Baicalein is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, an enzyme of the cytochrome P450 system that metabolizes drugs in the body.
A derivative of baicalin is a known prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor.
It is one of the active ingredients of Sho-Saiko-To, a Japanese herbal supplement believed to enhance liver health.

Bonnie (orangutan)

Bonnie (born about 1978) is a female orangutan living at the National Zoo in Washington D.C.
She began spontaneously whistling, mimicking an animal caretaker making the sound. The importance is that whistling is a sound that is in a human’s—but not an orangutan’s—repertoire. While some "lower primates" have been shown to make non-standard sounds for their species, it has always been the result of intense training, whereas Bonnie just picked up the new sound mechanism. Another interesting aspect is that she seems to whistle just because she likes the sound as opposed to producing this behavior in response to a potential food reward. Bonnie's whistling was documented in "Primates" by Dr. Serge Wich et al.

For the Working Girl

For the Working Girl is the title of the ninth album release by singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester released by Arista Records. 
Recorded at Northstar Studios in Boulder, Colorado in the summer of 1980, "For the Working Girl" reteamed Manchester with Steve Buckingham producer of the singer's 1979 self-titled album release; as with the "Melissa Manchester" album, the tracklisting of "For the Working Girl" balanced Manchester originals (totaling five) with outside material (totaling six).
Released in September 1980, "For the Working Girl" received heavy promotion emphasizing Manchester's new streamlined image, the album's cover photograph being taken by glamor shot specialist George Hurrell. Also stressed in the album promotion was the album's title cut, Manchester's collaboration with Bernie Taupin famed as regular lyricist for Elton John during the first phase of the latter's career, "For the Working Girl" being touted as a feminist anthem in the tradition of Helen Reddy's "I Am Woman". It was announced in November 1980 that Pistol Productions, owned by Taupin and Michael Lippman, would produce a feature film entitled "Working Girl" based on the title cut of Manchester's current album with the singer in a starring role. However Manchester's acting career would prove to be occasional with her only starring roles onstage, her onscreen feature film credit being a small role in "For the Boys" (1991) as a backup singer to the lead character played by Bette Midler (Manchester had begun her performing career as a member of Midler's Harlettes backing group).
Despite the promo emphasis on the album's title cut, the choice for lead single fell to "If This Is Love" an easy listening ballad which charted on "Billboard"'s A/C chart (#19) but failed to reach the Hot 100 stalling at #102. The album's second single release - in February 1981 - was "Lovers After All", a duet with Peabo Bryson; the first A-side release written by Manchester since the non-charting "Be Somebody" in early 1977. Written with Leon Ware, "Lovers After All" reached three "Billboard" charts - the Hot 100 (at #54), R&B chart (#35) and A/C (#25) without sufficient impact to be considered a comeback for Manchester. A third single: a remake of the 1972 #1 hit by Nilsson: "Without You", failed to chart. 
Without the impetus of a major hit single, "For the Working Girl" maintained Manchester as a moderate presence on the "Billboard" album chart peaking at #68.
The personnel on "For the Working Girl" includes the singer's father David Manchester on bassoon.

Dirk Graswinckel

Theodorus Johannes "Dirk" Graswinckel (1 October 1600 (or 1601) -12 October 1666) was a Dutch jurist, a significant writer on the freedom of the seas. He was a controversialist, who also rose to a high legal position (Fiscal of Holland) where he advised Descartes. He was a cousin and pupil of Grotius. He was also a poet and translator of Thomas à Kempis.
Life.
He was born in Delft, and studied at the University of Leiden. He joined Grotius in Paris in 1624, and later defended him against Johannes a Felden (John De Felde).
"Libertas Veneta" (1634) replied to the anonymous anti-Venetian pamphlet "Squitinio della liberti veneta" (1612). It is in effect also an answer to a work on maritime law by William Welwod.
"Maris liberi vindiciae" attacked Burgus (Pietro Battista Borgo) writing for Genoese pretensions in the Ligurian Sea, but also took on John Selden on the British claim to territorial waters. Selden’s Mare Clausum had been published in an English translation in 1652, and he replied the following year with "Ioannis Seldeni vindiciae secundum integritatem existimationis suae". In fact Graswinckel had sent Selden a detailed critique in manuscript in 1635.
In 1651 he published a work "Placcaten, ordonnantien ende reglementen" on the economics of regulation of the grain trade. This came down largely on the side of free trade and the price mechanism. Joseph Schumpeter argued that this was the first clear-cut statement that speculators had a role in the stability of commodity markets.
He died in Mechelen.

The Story of Alexander Graham Bell

The Story of Alexander Graham Bell is a somewhat fictionalized 1939 biographical film of the famous inventor. It was filmed in black-and-white and released by Twentieth Century-Fox. The film stars Don Ameche as Bell and Loretta Young as Mabel, his wife, who contracted scarlet fever at an early age and became deaf. The first half of the film concentrates on the hero's romantic, financial, and scientific struggles, starting in 1873. Most scenes are set in Boston and vicinity; a few late scenes are in London.
Henry Fonda is notable in a supporting role as the “Mr. Watson” who hears the first words ever spoken over the telephone. In a pivotal scene, Bell, while working on the telephone, accidentally spills acid onto his lap and shouts in pain, “Mr. Watson, come here!  I want you!”. Watson, barely able to contain his own excitement, rushes into the room and stammers out the news that he heard Bell calling out to him over the telephone receiver.  Bell has Watson repeat his own words to him to confirm it, and the two men begin hopping around the room, with Watson yelling out a Native American war whoop.
That scene of jubilation was likely based on fact.  In real life the Six Nations Mohawk Reserve near Bell's home in Brantford, Ontario awarded him the title of "Honorary Chief", about 1870, for his work in translating the unwritten Mohawk language into Visible Speech symbols.  Bell was thrilled at his recognition by the Six Nations Reserve and throughout his life would launch into a Mohawk war dance when he was excited.
The last part depicts the legal struggle against Western Union over patent priority in the invention of the telephone, as a battle of the small and plucky against lies promoted by a mighty corporation, ending with a dramatic courtroom revelation and victory. Earlier attempts of Western Union to buy out Bell, and the many other patent infringement lawsuits, are not mentioned. The final scene has the hero contemplating manned flight, under his wife's adoring gaze.

Wulff construction

The Wulff construction is a method for determining the equilibrium shape of a droplet or crystal of fixed volume inside a separate phase (usually its saturated solution or vapor). Energy minimization arguments are used to show that certain crystal planes are preferred over others, giving the crystal its shape.
Theory.
In 1878 Josiah Willard Gibbs proposed that a droplet or crystal will arrange itself such that its surface Gibbs free energy is minimized by assuming a shape of low surface energy. He defined the quantity 
where formula_2 represents the surface energy per unit area of the formula_3th crystal face and formula_4 is the area of said face. formula_5 represents the difference in energy between a real crystal composed of i molecules with a surface, and a similar configuration of i molecules located inside an infinitely large crystal. This quantity is therefore the energy associated with the surface. The equilibrium shape of the crystal will then be that which minimizes the value of formula_5
In 1901 Georg Wulff stated (without proof) that the length of a vector drawn normal to a crystal face formula_7 will be proportional to its surface energy formula_8: formula_9. The vector formula_7 is the "height" of the formula_3th face, drawn from the center of the crystal to the face; for a spherical crystal this is simply the radius. This is known as the Gibbs-Wulff theorem.
In 1953 Conyers Herring gave a proof of the theorem and a method for determining the equilibrium shape of a crystal, consisting of two main exercises. To begin, a polar plot of surface energy as a function of orientation is made. This is known as the gamma plot and is usually denoted as formula_12 where formula_13 denotes the surface normal, e.g., a particular crystal face. The second part is the Wulff construction itself in which the gamma plot is used to determine graphically which crystal faces will be present. It can be determined graphically by drawing lines from the origin to every point on the gamma plot. A plane perpendicular to the normal formula_13 is drawn at each point where it intersects the gamma plot. The inner envelope of these planes forms the equilibrium shape of the crystal.
Proof.
Various proofs of the theorem have been given by Hilton, Liebman, von Laue, Herring, and a rather extensive treatment by Cerf. The following is after the method of R. F. Strickland-Constable.
We begin with the surface energy for a crystal
which is the product of the surface energy per unit area times the area of each face, summed over all faces, which is minimized for a given volume when
We then consider a small change in shape for a constant volume
which can be written as
the second term of which must be zero, as it represents the change in volume does not make sense, as before the whole expression was supposed to be the change in volume, and we wish only to find the lowest surface energy at a constant volume (i.e. without adding or removing material.) We are then given from above
and
which can be combined by a constant of proportionality as
The change in shape formula_22 must be allowed to be arbitrary, which then requires that formula_9 which then proves Gibbs-Wulff Theorem.
