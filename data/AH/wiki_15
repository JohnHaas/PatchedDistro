Gwyneth Walker

Gwyneth Walker (b. 1947; New York City, New York) is an American composer.
Personal.
Walker grew up in New Canaan, Connecticut and is a graduate of Brown University and the Hartt School of Music and holds B.A., M.M., and D.M.A. degrees in music composition. During her high school (Abbot Academy-Phillips Academy/Andover) and college years, she performed in vocal octets for which she created all of the choral arrangements. During her twenties, Gwyneth Walker was married to fellow composer David Burton (1945-1975).
Upon completing her academic training, she joined the faculty of the Oberlin College Conservatory. She left academia in 1982 in order to pursue a career as a full-time composer. For almost 30 years, she lived on a dairy farm in Braintree, Vermont and now lives primarily in New Canaan, Connecticut, her childhood hometown.
Work.
Gwyneth Walker has written over 300 compositions for orchestra, chamber ensembles, chorus, solo voice, and individual instruments. They have been performed nationwide in venues such as Carnegie Hall, the Washington National Cathedral, and The Ellen Show.
Her work, while appealing to modern sensibilities, is traditional and accessible in the unadorned style of American composers such as Aaron Copland and Charles Ives. "My pieces always have melody and form and a rhythm that’s right there for you," she says. Among Walker's more popular works is "Songs for Women's Voices," a cycle of choral works based on six poems by the American poet May Swenson, and "A Vision of Hills," a piano trio that Walker says was inspired by her home state of Vermont. 
In recent years, Gwyneth Walker traveled across the United States working with a variety of musicians as they recorded her works. As a result of these collaborations, several new CDs have been released: 
Gwyneth Walker's choral work, “Songs to the Lord of Peace” was commissioned by the Center for Catholic Studies at Fairfield University in celebration of the 60th Anniversary Season of the Fairfield University Glee Club, which premiered the work on April 14, 2007 in Fairfield, CT.
Gwyneth Walker's choral work, “A Heart in Hiding (The Passionate Love Poems of Emily Dickinson),” was commissioned and performed by the Thomas Circle Singers in Washington DC, in 2008.
Walker's piano concerto, "Across the Water: Songs of the Water for Piano and Orchestra" was premiered in October 2012 with the Holyoke Civic Symohony and pianist Evan Roider in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Walker composed a new setting of the Longfellow poem, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the town of Lexington, Massachusetts which had its premiere in January 2013.

Karin Immergut

Karin Johanna Immergut (born December 22, 1960) is a judge in the state of Oregon. A native of New York, she was the United States Attorney for the District of Oregon from 2003 until her resignation in July 2009 when she was appointed as circuit court judge for Multnomah County, Oregon, by Governor Ted Kulongoski. Before serving as a U.S. Attorney, Immergut worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in both Oregon and California, was a deputy district attorney in Portland, and work for Ken Starr during his investigation of President Bill Clinton.
Early life.
Karin Immergut was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1960. Her father was an Austrian chemist and her mother a Swedish mathematician. Her parents married in Sweden and then immigrated to the United States where Karin was born. She graduated from Amherst College in 1982 and received her law degree in 1987 from Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. After law school she worked as a litigation associate at the law firm of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. for one year.
Legal career.
Following private practice, Immergut served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California in Los Angeles for six years. During her tenure in the Central District of California, Immergut prosecuted several large-scale complex narcotics and money laundering cases and served as a Deputy Chief of the Narcotics Section and Chief of the Training Section. She spent six years there and then moved to Burlington, Vermont, to work for the firm Gravel & Shea for two years. In 1996, Immergut then moved to Portland, Oregon, where she married James T. McDermott and was hired by Multnomah County.
Immergut served for five years as a Deputy District Attorney in Portland, where she primarily prosecuted white collar crimes. In 1998, Immergut was a Multnomah County deputy district attorney and a longtime Democrat when she went to work for Ken Starr, who was investigating then-President Bill Clinton. She re-registered as an independent upon taking that position. Immergut personally questioned Monica Lewinsky in an August 6, 1998, deposition. In 2001, she joined the U.S. Attorney's office in Portland as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Oregon. Serving two years in the position, she prosecuted cases involving white collar crime and worked on Project Safe Neighborhoods, a national gun violence reduction initiative.
U.S. Attorney.
Immergut was sworn in as interim United States Attorney on October 3, 2003, and the United States Senate confirmed her nomination on that same date. She was appointed by President George W. Bush to the position. Bush signed her commission to serve as the United States Attorney for the District of Oregon on October 4, 2003, and she was sworn in as the United States Attorney on October 8, 2003. She succeeded Michael W. Mosman in that role.
As U.S. Attorney, Immergut serves as the district's top federal law enforcement official. She manages a staff of approximately 107 people, including 51 Assistant U.S. Attorneys, who handle civil litigation on behalf of the United States and criminal investigations and prosecutions involving violations of federal law such as white collar crime, narcotics trafficking, violent crime, money laundering and cybercrime. In addition, Immergut served on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee.
In January 2008, Immergut applied to succeed Judge Garr King on the Oregon District Court. She was initially considered the leading candidate for the post, as the preferred choice of U.S. Senator Gordon Smith. But after news reports highlighting her role in the investigation of president Bill Clinton's sex scandal, she was not one of the final candidates for the position. She re-registered as a Republican at the beginning of Bush's first term as president, in the same month that she went to work for Mosman. Attorney Brandon Mayfield blamed Immergut more than anyone else at a local level for her role in his being falsely accused of terrorist activity in 2004. She resigned from the office in July 2009 in order to be appointed as a circuit court judge for Multnomah County.

Baek Yoon-sik

Baek Yoon-sik (born March 16, 1947) is a South Korean actor. He is known for his characteristic near-expressionless facial acting.
Career.
Baek Yoon-sik made his debut in 1970 on KBS TV. In the coming years he would appear in four films, taking lead roles in his debut "Excellent Guys" and in romantic comedy "Only With You" with Seo Mi-kyung, a young star of the time. He also studied in the film and theater department at Chung-Ang University's graduate school.
Nonetheless, his film career appeared to end in the 1970s and he became known thereafter as a TV actor. In the late 1990s and early 2000s he attained a certain degree of visibility in TV dramas such as "Moon Over Seoul" (1994, with Han Suk-kyu and Choi Min-sik) and "Jang Hee-bin" (2002, with Kim Hye-soo).
In 2003, however, Baek's career was revived in spectacular fashion with a major role in Jang Joon-hwan's acclaimed debut feature "Save the Green Planet!". Playing an arrogant company executive—believed by the film's hero to be an alien from Andromeda Galaxy—Baek's performance won him a Best Actor Award from the 2003 Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, as well as numerous best supporting actor mentions from local awards ceremonies. He quickly became sort of a cult figure among younger cinephiles.
Following on this success, Baek went on to appear in several more high-profile films, including a memorable role in Choi Dong-hoon's caper film "The Big Swindle" and a showstopping performance as intelligence chief Kim Jae-gyu in Im Sang-soo's controversial drama "The President's Last Bang".
The year 2006 turned out to be a particularly prolific year for Baek, as he took leading and supporting roles in four films. (It was a profitable year as well, with his fee rising to $400,000 per film—just a shade below that of the top stars.) Of these four, Choi Dong-hoon's "" proved to be a runaway hit, selling close to 7 million tickets.
Personal life.
Baek divorced his wife in March 2004 after 27 years of marriage. His two sons Baek Do-bin and Baek Seo-bin are also actors.

The Electoral district of East Hobart, sometimes referred to as Hobart East, was an electoral district of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It was based in Tasmania's capital city, Hobart.
The seat was created as a single-member seat ahead of the 1871 state election following the dissolution of the multi-member Hobart Town seat. It was abolished at the 1886 election when neighbouring seats absorbed its area and became two-member seats.
The seat was then recreated as a single-member seat at the 1903 state election and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model for the entire state in 1909.
Members for East Hobart.
First incarnation: 1871–1886
Second incarnation: 1903–1909

Ardalan–Shoja–Kiuru syndrome

Ardalan–Shoja–Kiuru syndrome is a clinical syndrome featuring hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis and retinitis pigmentosa. This syndrome was first recognized by two Iranian physicians, Mohammad Ardalan and Mohammadali Shoja and Finnish neurologist Sari Kiuru-Enari in an Iranian family. Hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis has originally been reported by Finnish ophthalmologist Jouko Meretoja and is known as Meretoja syndrome or Familial Amyloidosis, Finnish type. In addition to the classic manifestations of Finnish type Familial Amyloidosis, cutis laxa, progressive peripheral neuropathy and corneal lattice dystrophy, some of the afflicted members of the Iranian family have retinitis pigmentosa. This feature had not been previously reported with this type of amyloidosis. Ardalan–Shoja–Kiuru syndrome or hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis plus retintis pigmentosa has not been found outside this single Iranian family.

Red Cross Society of the Republic of China

The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China () is the national Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, known as "Taiwan". The society is recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). From its founding in 1904, to 1949, when the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, the society shared its history with the Red Cross Society of China. Both societies associate their origins with the founder, Shen Dunhe, a tea merchant.
Origin.
On 3 March, 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Shen Dunhe created the "Manchuria Red Cross Benevolent Society" and on 10 March, 1904, the society was renamed the "Shanghai International Red Cross Committee". Its founders were Chinese business and political leaders and expatriates from the West. Shen chose the aegis of the Red Cross because its neutrality allowed aid to reach those Chinese civilians caught between Japanese and Russian forces in Manchuria.
Expansion.
After the Russo-Japanese War, the society expanded and its mission to aid those affected by war and disaster continued. The society opened Red Cross hospitals in Shanghai and other cities. Local Red Cross chapters were popular because the association represented international connections, modernity and its activities were seen as patriotic. For example, the society sent workers to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and workers, medicines and funds were sent to Japan after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. In 1920, there were over 300 Red Cross chapters in China.
Recognition.
In 1912, the ICRC recognised the society as the national chapter of the Republic of China (Taiwan). In 1919, the society joined the International Federation as one of its first members.. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the society held ties with American and British Red Cross, the Kuomintang government and the Shanghai business community. In 1933, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Act of Administrative Rules and Procedures of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China () was passed. The society was renamed the "Red Cross Society of the Republic of China".
The society's activities during the war time period (1937 - 1945) were limited to Kuomintang held areas in southwest China and to some areas under Japanese control. Supplies were received through Burma and India from the United States and the United Kingdom. Expatriate Chinese also raised funds. 
Relocation to Taiwan.
After 1950, when the major hostilities of the Chinese civil war had ended, the society moved its headquarters to Taiwan. In 1955, the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) declared the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China the sole national humanitarian organization of the country and wrote this in legislation. The act clarified the role of the society in the case of invasion by the forces of the Communist Party of China and in caring for wounded Taiwanese soldiers and prisoners of war. Fiscal exemptions for society volunteers were approved. The organization was tasked with provision of basic sanitation and hygiene to the most impoverished; and, with teaching first aid to adults and children.
International Recognition.
The society meets most of the conditions laid out in Article 4 of the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of 1995, except that Taiwan is not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. Its mission may be made more difficult because of a lack of clarity surrounding the society's independence from the Red Cross Society of China.
Kinmen accord.
On 11 September 1990, the society held talks with its counterpart in China at Quimoy (Kinmen) resulting in the Kinmen accord. The talks were about issues such as repatriation of criminals, smugglers or fugitives in the spirit of humanity and practicality.

<doc id="20584393" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20584393" title="MicroAngelo">
MicroAngelo

SCION's MicroAngelo was an early graphics card for S-100 bus computers. Each MicroAngelo board produced a 512 by 480 pixel monochrome image, high resolution for the era. The MicroAngelo Palette (or Colour Mixing) Card used the output of multiple MicroAngelo's as individual bit-planes to produce images with up to 256 colors (using 8 cards). Early versions of AutoCAD supported the MicroAngelo system.
The original MA512 board included 32 kB of RAM for the frame buffer, a Z80 processor operating as a controller and memory refresh driver, and 4 kB of ROM containing one of two optional sets of subroutines. Users programed the MicroAngelo in assembly language using the Z80's input/output parallel ports, which sent data over the internal S-100 bus at relatively high speeds. The data sent over the bus was examined by the Z80 on the card, which then ran a selected subroutine contained in its ROM to place data into the frame buffer. The screen buffer could be moved to or from the computer's main memory - useful for printing when pushed from the card to the computer, or displaying bitmap graphics when reversed.
The 4 kB ROM normally contained "Screenware Pak I", which provided routines to emulate an 85 by 40 line character screen, which also allowed the user to define their own 12 by 6 pixel character sets in the card's RAM. The optional 6 kB "Screenware Pak II" (in 8 kV of ROM) was a superset of Pak I, adding circle, line and polygon drawing routines, flood fill and a variety of other features. Pak II also added a "split screen" function, allowing a portion of the screen to be placed in graphics mode and the rest in text mode, which some considered a necessity.
The MA512 had a number of problems that were addressed in the later MA520, released in 1982. In particular, the software interface required only two of the input/output "ports", but a single MA512 would lock down an entire set of eight, typically F0 to FF. This made expanding a system with a complete set of eight MicroAngelo boards difficult, because the eight cards and the associated palette card would end up using up the vast majority of 256 available ports. The MA520 locked down only the two ports it actually used. The MA520 also used 64 kB DRAMs and 2732 EPROMs to reduce chip counts and expand the frame buffer to 64 kB. Although the video system could only see one bank of 32 kB, the other 32 kB could be used for a variety of purposes, including scratch buffers and storing routines.
MicroAngelo also supported a light pen, connected through input terminals on the top of the card. The Screenware software automatically converted the coordinates into the card's coordinates. Screenware also included routines for drawing movable cursors in hardware (as opposed to bit bliting), and the cursor could be made to follow the light pen simply by reading the pen coordinates and feeding them into the cursor.
Shortly after the MA520 was announced, SCION stated they were going to produce a standalone terminal consisting of a complete Zilog Z80-based CP/M machine packaged with a MA520, and optionally a monitor as well. Known as the Mirage 1, a version with a color monitor (and Palette Card) would be known as the Mirage 2. However, there is no record of either version having shipped.
Form and Function packaged a graphics terminal using a single MicroAngelo board placed inside an existing Ball monochrome monitor to produce the "IM-1". The IM-1 connected to any computer using a serial port, data being passed along to the cards. The system could be upgraded to greyscale by adding additional cards, and to color by swapping the screen. This solution had a number of problems, including the fact that it did not support existing terminal standards like VT52, and that the serial port would start to bog down above about 6000 bit/s, slow even for the era.

Josep Manyanet i Vives

Josep Manyanet Vives (7 January 1833 – 17 December 1901) was a Spanish priest who is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. He founded the Sons of the Holy Family, a congregation of Catholic priests.
Life.
Early life.
Josep (also known as José or Joseph) was born into a large and pious family in the municipality of Tremp, Catalonia, Spain, and at the age of five he was offered to the Blessed Virgin Mary by his mother. He received his education with the Piarist Fathers in Barbastro, Aragon, and then went on to be trained in the theological institutes of Lleida and La Seu d'Urgell.
Priesthood.
He was ordained to the priesthood on 9 April 1859 and went on to become the private secretary to the Bishop of Urgel, Josep Caixal Estradé. Josep's other priestly tasks included being the seminary librarian, the chancery administrator and also the secretary for pastoral visitations.
In 1864, Josep founded the Congregation of the Sons of the Holy Family which in 1874 was followed by the Missionary Daughters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. He went on to found a number of schools and ministerial centers in several Spanish towns and also wrote books and papers which were aimed at encouraging devotion to the Holy Family.
Illnesses and death.
Josep was subject to prolonged, physical illnesses during his life, including open sores on his side, which he labelled "God's mercies" for 16 long years. He died on 17 December 1901, at his school "Jesús, María y José" in Barcelona; his last words were in prayer: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph, may I breathe forth my soul in peace with you."
His remains are kept in a burial chapel at the same school where he died.
Veneration.
Today, Josep Manyanet i Vives is recognized and venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 25 November 1984 and canonized on 16 May 2004, also by Pope John Paul II. His feast day is on 17 December.

<doc id="20584449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20584449" title="Media Key Block">
Media Key Block

The Media Key Block (MKB) is one of the keys included inside the copying protection system (DRM) AACS. This system is used to protect Blu-ray and HD DVD formats from being copied. The system was developed by big companies from the film industry and the electronics industry including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Matsushita (Panasonic), Sony, Toshiba, The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros.
The MKB key is found in the physical support (the disc) together with the content of the disc encrypted. The "MKB" has the function of validating the reproduction devices on which the disc is being played and obtaining, from the devices codes, the key that will allow the decryption of the disc content. That is the Media Key (Km).
How it works.
"Blu-Ray" or "HD-DVD" have as content the encrypted data (usually video), the Volume ID (VID), the Encrypted Title Key(s) and the "MKB". The "MKB" is also found encrypted in the disc to prevent it from being extracted off the disc and being manipulated and/or reproduced by another non authorized device.
The reproduction device will have available its own keys, uniques for each model, called Device Keys. These keys are conceded by the "AACS" organization. In the moment of the reproduction, one of these keys will decrypt the "MKB" contained on the disc and as a result of this process we obtain the "Media key". 
The "Media key" is combined together with the "VID" (Volume ID) and as a result we obtain the Volume Unique Key (Kvu). With the "Kvu" we are able to decrypt the "Encrypted Title Key" and obtain the Title keys which finally allows to decrypt the content of the disc and view it.
This way the system can protect contents from being viewed in devices that have not been authorized. Therefore, the system allows modifying the "MKB" in future relaunch of a determined content in order to select the devices in which this content can be viewed.
Key Structure.
Even though it seems a simple mechanism the "MKB" key which is found in the physical support of the disc follows a complex structure. The "MKB" is distributed in blocks that contain the version of the "Media key", the list of devices that have been revoked, a field to authenticate the "MKB", and other fields that specify parameters corresponding to the decrypting algorithm and define the structure of the own "Media Key" and also the "Media key" itself. 
The "MKB" itself is found inside the field Media Key Data Record and has a variable length but it is always a multiple of 4 bytes.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Many consumers associations have complained against this protection system since it can lead to a situation where physical devices cannot reproduce contents even though they do not infringe any intellectual property. This situation can be achieved either by trying to reproduce some content in old devices, therefore not certified by the "AACS", or because the device model has been disallowed by AACS, as a result all the owners of that device model will not be able to view contents protected with the "MKB".
This situation has become even worse with the recent publication in multiple web sites of the Media Key, that is, the key that allows decrypting the "Volume ID"
, and at the same time, the encrypted content, without the need of using a certified device by the AACS or a valid MKB. This is especially critical because nowadays the Volume ID is the same in all the Blu-ray or HD-DVDs with equal content.

Louisiana's 2nd congressional district election, 2008

The Election for congress was seen as safe for Democratic 9 term incumbent William Jefferson in a district that mostly covered New Orleans. But the republican narrowly defeated him in an upset.
Jefferson's Corruption investigation.
The investigation began in mid-2005, after an investor alleged $400,000 in bribes were paid through a company maintained in the name of his spouse and children. The money came from a tech company named iGate, Inc. of Louisville, Kentucky, and in return, it is alleged, Jefferson would help iGate's business. Jefferson was to persuade the U.S. Army to test iGate's broadband two-way technology and other iGate products; use his efforts to influence high-ranking officials in Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon; and meet with personnel of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, in order to facilitate potential financing for iGate business deals in those countries.
On 30 July 2005, Jefferson was videotaped by the FBI receiving $100,000 worth of $100 bills in a leather briefcase at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Arlington, Virginia. Jefferson told an investor, Lori Mody, who was wearing a wire, that he would need to give Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar $500,000 "as a motivating factor" to make sure they obtained contracts for iGate and Mody's company in Nigeria.
A few days later, on 3 August 2005, FBI agents raided Jefferson's home in Northeast Washington and, as noted in an 83-page affidavit filed to support a subsequent raid on his Congressional office, "found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers." Serial numbers found on the currency in the freezer matched serial numbers of funds given by the FBI to their informant.
Late on the night of 20 May 2006, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Jefferson's office in the Rayburn House Office Building. This is "believed to be the first-ever FBI raid on a Congressional office," raising concerns that it could "set a dangerous precedent that could be used by future administrations to intimidate or harass a supposedly coequal branch of the government."
The affidavit used to support these raids alleged:
The election.
Incumbent U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson won the Democratic primaries in Fall 2008. Jefferson had weathered a major challenge in the Louisiana 2nd congressional district election, 2006, when voters had fresh on their minds allegations that the representative had inappropriately used the services of a Louisiana Army National Guard unit in accessing his house during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
By fall 2008 the incumbent faced longstanding federal charges of bribery involving Nigerian business interests and was perceived by some as vulnerable, with only 25 percent of Democrats voting for him in the first round of the 2008 Democratic primaries. Jefferson faced six African-American challengers along with newscaster Helena Moreno in the first primary, all of them clamoring for change from Louisiana's reputation for political corruption. Jefferson defeated Moreno by 57 percent to 43 percent in a runoff which went largely along racial lines. Moreno later endorsed Cao in the general election. Cao, unopposed for the Republican nomination, was running against Jefferson, as were Green Party candidate Malik Rahim and Libertarian Party candidate Gregory Kahn. An earlier candidate, independent Jerry Jacobs, had withdrawn.
On November 30 the New Orleans "Times-Picayune" editorially endorsed Cao while on the op-ed page its columnist James Gill asserted that Jefferson's reelection "is not going to happen." The prospect of a serious general election in the majority African-American and heavily Democratic 2nd district was all the more startling in that the last Republican to represent the district was Hamilton D. Coleman, who left the office in 1891. According to the "Los Angeles Times", Cao, if elected, would become the first individual of Vietnamese extraction to serve in the U.S. Congress.
Cao's candidacy received the endorsement of the Alliance for Good Government, the Family Research Council's Action PAC, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and even entertainer Pat Boone. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin had announced his support for Jefferson during the Democratic primary elections. The New Orleans "Gambit Weekly", citing its opposition to Jefferson's alleged corruption and Cao's noncommittal statements on embryonic stem-cell research, made no endorsement.
The days before the December 6 election were characterized by what Jefferson's campaign called "overly negative" tactics undertaken on behalf of Cao's campaign by outside organizations such as the National Republican Congressional Committee. Besides references to Jefferson's removal from the House Ways and Means Committee by Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the negative tactics included automated telephone calls from a woman identifying herself as "Katy" and citing incumbent Jefferson's federal indictment on 16 counts of corruption. In a meeting of African-American ministers, the Reverend Samuel Butler said that the real reason for the negative campaign tactics was to disenfranchise African-American voters, which comment motivated Cao advisor and former New Orleans City Council member Bryan Wagner to assert that, "with Rev. Butler's imagination, he may want to go to work for Walt Disney."
On December 6, the "Times-Picayune" reiterated its endorsement of Cao, this time pointing to President-Elect Barack Obama's efforts on behalf of Democrat Paul Carmouche in the simultaneous election in Louisiana's 4th congressional district and Obama's non-involvement in efforts to support Jefferson.
On December 6 at 10:20 PM CST, CNN projected Cao the winner. Final unofficial results on the Louisiana Secretary of State's web site showed Cao with 33,122 (49.55%), Jefferson 31,296 (46.82%), Kahn 548 (0.82%), and Rahim 1,880 (2.81%). Jefferson won by 23,197 to 20,246 in Orleans Parish, where 21 of the 392 precincts showed zero votes for Cao, but Cao more than made up the difference with a margin 12,696 to the incumbent's 8,099 in Jefferson Parish.

One for the Road (Cheers)

"One for the Road" is the name of the final episode of the American television series "Cheers". This episode serves as the 271st episode and the 25th episode of the eleventh season of "Cheers". It first aired on NBC in Thursday, May 20, 1993, to an audience of approximately 42.4 million households in a 98 minute version, making it the second-highest-rated series finale of all time behind the series finale of "M*A*S*H" and the highest-rated episode of the 1992-1993 television season in the United States. The 98 minute version was re-shown on Sunday, May 23, 1993, and an edited 90 minute version aired on Thursday, August 19, 1993.
In this finale, Sam Malone reunites with his former on-off love interest, Diane Chambers, after six years of separation. When they rekindle, Sam and Diane decide to move out of Boston and leave everyone and everything behind, including his friends. They have second thoughts about their relationship and part ways again. After his separation from Diane, Sam celebrates his reunion with his friends at the bar. Meanwhile, other characters experience changes in their lives. Rebecca Howe elopes with her boyfriend Don and quits managing the bar. Woody Boyd becomes an elected councilman and gives Norm Peterson a job. Cliff Clavin gets a promotion from his postal office.
Background.
The television series "Cheers" follows the fortunes and inter-relationships of a group of Bostonians who meet regularly at "Cheers", their local bar. Sam Malone (Ted Danson), a ladies' man, former baseball player, and bartender, and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), a college graduate student and cocktail waitress, had had on-and-off relationships throughout first five seasons of "Cheers" (1982–1987) until Diane left Boston to pursue a writing career in the Season Five finale, "I Do, Adieu" (1987), making it Shelley Long's last contract appearance as Diane Chambers. Six years after the Season Five finale, the storyline of Sam and Diane is resurfaced by the special guest appearance of Shelley Long and then concluded during the third part of this episode.
During Season Eleven before the finale, there are many transformations. Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), another bartender at Cheers, is married to socialite Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), expecting a child with her, and has been elected to the Boston City Council. Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) has gone through husbands and flings and is currently a single mother. Norm Peterson (George Wendt) is still currently semi-unemployed. Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) is still a postal carrier and living with his mother. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) face marital problems, including Lilith's affair with another man. In the preceding episode, "The Guy Can't Help It" (1993), Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), the manager of Cheers, and Don (Tom Berenger), a plumber, spend time dating each other. Meanwhile, Sam faces his sexual addiction and begins to attend group therapy.
Production.
300 people attended the filming of the finale in Paramount Studios' Stage 25 in Los Angeles on Wednesday, March 31, 1993, from 7:20pm to 2:15am. Due to Shelley Long's commitment to the CBS sitcom, "Good Advice", the finale's bar scene ending was filmed without her on Wednesday, April 7, 1993, after the penultimate episode "The Guy Can't Help It" was completely filmed on the same day. However, the ending was concealed from the general public, especially the studio audience, until the original airing. Before her special guest appearance in this episode, Shelley Long's reprisal appearance as Diane Chambers was rumored in 1989 when she appeared with Ted Danson at the premiere of one of his movies, "Cousins". A spokesperson for Paramount Television denied these rumors. Long appeared as herself for the 200th episode special in 1990, hosted by John McLaughlin, along with other surviving cast members at the time.
President Bill Clinton was invited to be part of this finale, but he declined the offer. Brandon Tartikoff, former executive of NBC and former chief of Paramount Studios, and Garry Trudeau, cartoonist of "Doonesbury", appeared in the finale as uncredited bar extras.
Promotion.
This finale was massively promoted, including in the media, before the finale's initial airing. NBC executives expected a rating of 65 percent of total television households of 1993. Sources from Madison Avenue estimated a Nielsen rating of 33–40s and a share of 50–70; one expected a rating of 37–38 and a share of 60. Each 30-second commercial for the original broadcast cost $650,000; the total number of commercials that aired on the initial broadcast was 25 to 30.
News programmes of NBC, such as "Dateline NBC" and "Today", and NBC affiliates, such as of KNBC, discussed an upcoming airing of the finale, including on the day of the finale. KTLA, a Los Angeles station that re-ran "Cheers", played a variation of the show's theme song, "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", during re-runs for one week before the finale. "Entertainment Tonight" covered blooper reels of "Cheers" during the week. Ratings of episodes of Season 11 (1992–1993) were growing in the last several weeks prior to the finale.
In April 1–4, 1993, the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center) surveyed 1,011 people on telephones. Sam Malone was voted a favorite of 26% and had 15% chance of a spin-off. Answering a question as to whom he should marry, 21% voted Diane Chambers, 19% voted Rebecca Howe, 48% voted Sam to stay single, and 12% had "no opinion" on this matter. Woody Boyd was voted a favorite of 18% and had 12% chance of a spin-off, and Norm Peterson was voted by 14% and had 10% chance of a spin-off.
Newspapers, in ways, counted down the finale of "Cheers". "The Washington Post" covered the background of "Cheers". "Philadelphia Inquirer" assured the future of "Cheers" after the end of the first-run broadcast. "Star Tribune" published stories related to "Cheers", including the following: local residents played trivia games that tribute to "Cheers", including such characters as Cliff and Norm; the future of Sam Malone, a fictional character, was addressed with presumptions. "Deseret News" offered its readers to send their own fantasy endings of the finale (in 500 words or less) to the newspaper no later than May 3, 1993.
Plot.
NOTE: This episode ran for 98 minutes, including commercials, at its original broadcast. It reaired for and was trimmed down to 90 minutes in August 19, 1993. In syndicated and online reruns, this episode was split into three parts, but the DVD release has the original, uncut version.
Diane Chambers, making her first appearance on the series after six years, appears on television, accepting an outstanding award for writing a television movie, surprising Sam. At night, Diane calls Sam by the bar's phone number to thank him for the congratulatory telegram that he sent earlier. Then Sam invites Diane to return to Boston, and she accepts. The next day, Diane arrives with her "husband" Reed (Mark Harelik), but then Reed's partner, Kevin (Anthony Heald), arrives to confront him for "cheating" on him with Diane. After the gay couple left the scene, Sam and Diane learn from each other that they have no family of their own. Diane admits to Sam that she failed to return to him for six months as promised in the episode "I Do, Adieu" (1987). In fact, her manuscript was rejected by publishers but then became a television movie, prompting her to stay in Los Angeles for further success in six years. Then they confess that they are a "mismatch", despite good times together. As she prepares to leave, Sam stops Diane and convinces her to have another fling with him again.
The following day, Woody is now a councilman and then gives Norm a city job, Cliff is promoted, and Rebecca regrets marrying the plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger). Sam and Diane walk in and announce their engagement, but his friends disapprove. Having enough of their disapprovals and of years without a family, Sam leaves the bar with Diane. In the plane, Sam and Diane begin to reconsider their decisions to be together again. As the flight is delayed and returning to the airport, the pair amicably decide to peacefully part ways. Diane goes to another plane for Los Angeles. Then Sam returns to Cheers to see his friends again. While Sam and his gang celebrate the reunion by smoking cigars, Rebecca happily announces that Don has a job at the sewer department and leaves in excitement with tickets to their honeymoon trip. When rest of the gang head home, Norm stays behind and admits that he knew that Sam would return to Boston for his "one true love", saying: "You'll always come back to her." After Norm leaves, Sam ponders these words and then turns all lights off.

Reception.
Reviews of this episode at the time of its initial broadcast were mixed. John J. O'Connor from "The New York Times" called this episode "overly long and uncharacteristically labored" and considered the originally-broadcast length of this episode "a miscalculation." Nevertheless, O'Connor wrote, "Things didn't turn absolutely soppy, but nearly." Tony Scott from "Daily Variety" praised the writing, yet he found the finale "overly long" and the last 30 minutes "limping." John Carman from "San Francisco Chronicle" "liked the finale" and "was choked up at the end"; nevertheless, he found Shelley Long's special guest performance "disappointing" and "cute pills" past "expiration date." Ann Hodges from "Houston Chronicle" "found the conclusion fitting" but was not sad about the series's cancellation. One of readers' published letters from "The Post-Standard" pointed out this episode's omittance of Coach, one of original "Cheers" characters who died in 1985, and expressed disdain toward such omittance, even when the Geronimo picture was shown at the ending.
Reactions were mixed in local Sacramento bars about the episode's ending. Some called its ending a "perfect way to end the popular series." Others either called it "dull or weak" or were not pleased with the final breakup of Sam and Diane.
The reviews in later years drew more attention, mostly positive. In 1998, A. J. Jacobs from "Entertainment Weekly" graded this finale a B+, called it "a satisfying nightcap" and "sharply written by brothers," and considers its final moments "classy as a flute of chilled Cristal." In 2006, Ron Geraci, author of the book "The Bachelor Chronicles: A Dating Memoir", called it "raw and moving" and "significant." In 2007, Dalton Ross from "Entertainment Weekly" called it one of his "Five Best (pre-"Sopranos") Series Finales." In 2007, Douglas Durden from "Richmond Times-Dispatch" named it his fifth most-favorite television finales of all-time. In 2009, the A.V. Club ranked it No. 3 in "10 American TV Series with Satisfying Endings" of the book "Inventory". In 2010, Sharon Knolle from "The Huffington Post" was relieved to see final onscreen romance of Sam and Diane short-lived rather than concluded with marriage. In the same year, Oliver Miller from "The Huffington Post" was heartbroken by Sam and Diane's on-screen "absurd protracted double-gut-punch break-up" in this episode. Meanwhile, Claire Suddath from the "Time" magazine called it one of top ten "anticipated" finales ever. In 2011, the finale was ranked fifth on the TV Guide Network special, "TV's Most Unforgettable Finales".
Aftermath.
Before and after production of "Cheers" had ended, the whole cast of "Cheers" had moved on to other priorities in their careers. Shelley Long (Diane) appeared on CBS's then-newer show, "Good Advice", before this episode and had resumed her work there. Ted Danson (Sam) appeared on "Made in America", which opened in theatres soon after this episode aired. Kirstie Alley (Rebecca) participated in "Look Who's Talking Now" while it was filmed.
Woody Harrelson (Woody) appeared in "Indecent Proposal", which also starred Demi Moore and Robert Redford and already hit theatres, and participated in Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" while filmed. George Wendt (Norm) appeared in an off-broadway play. John Ratzenberger (Cliff) appeared in Fox's newer show, "Locals". Rhea Perlman (Carla) semi-retired from acting. Kelsey Grammer soon reprised his role as Frasier Crane in his spinoff "Frasier", set in Seattle, Washington, with an addition to Frasier's job as a host of his new radio show and domestic life without Lilith Sternin and their son Frederick.
On the first airing of this series finale, over 500 people, including the whole cast of "Cheers" (except Shelley Long, Kirstie Alley, and Bebe Neuwirth) and politicians like William M. Bulger and past State Governor William Weld, participated on the afternoon at the Beacon Street near the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, Massachusetts, to celebrate the ending of this series. After the episode aired, the remaining cast appeared live on the East Coast (tape delay on the West) in "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" to be interviewed by Leno, set in the Pub. According to host Jay Leno, the cast was too intoxicated to be aware that they were interviewed onscreen.
In 1997, one copy of this episode's script was donated by George Wendt to the Handel and Haydn Society, an institution of music in Boston, Massachusetts. It contained the autographs of eight cast members, including of Shelley Long, Woody Harrelson, and George Wendt. On February 15, 1997, the script was stolen from the Four Seasons Hotel of Boston; meanwhile, the high bid was $1,000 before theft. About one week later, the stolen script in a manila envelope was left behind at a church; the Society then retrieved it. On March 1997, the autographed copy of the finale script was sold to the Bull and Finch Pub (now Cheers Beacon Hill) for $10,000.

Reviews.
Bear Family Records: (2008/SEDUCTION) 16 tracks - "Superb new album of old school Rock & Roll, Rockabilly and Ballads. Recorded in Texas (produced by Phil York) and featuring the legendary Bobby Rambo !, Rene Hall, Earl Palmer a.o. 50th Anniversary after the release of "School Of Rock & Roll" 1958 !"
CD Baby: 
"The venerable and early rock n roll legend Gene Summers celebrates his 50th anniversary in music recording (starting in Feb. 1958!) with this new CD of sixteen songs in the early rock n roll style, and with a few edging over into the rockabilly style! The title song, "Reminisce Cafe" is chart bound and is already being played by a number of vintage music radio stations. For some listeners, the punch-line in the song prompts tears of remembrance. The album was produced by 3-Grammy recording engineer and producer Phil York, and CD notes were written by legendary disc jockey and celebrity radio personality, Ron Chapman. There are twelve relevant photos plus the great, vintage cover photo of Gene and his high school sweetheart and wife, Dea..."
Take Note Magazine (France)- April, 2008 - "Have you heard the news? There's good rockin' tonight with that new CD coming from Texas. Released on February 1st, 2008, exactly 50 years after the release date of Gene's and his Rebels first single, 
"School of Rock'n'Roll" (Jan 11-100), that CD is accurately
titled "Reminisce Cafe". Produced by Phil York with nice liner notes from DJ Ron Chapman, that CD offers 100% Texas rockin' music shaped with the support of great musicians like Bobby Rambo and Joey D'Ambrosio. It's also interesting to note the presence of Red Callendar, Plas Johnson, Rene Hall and Earl Palmer, all legendary session musicians, who backed Gene on his "Jan" sessions in 1958. 
The booklet is a neat one with some vintage 1950s and '60s photos plus two full size record label shots. But a record is at first music so let's talk a little about the first song that gives the title to the CD. "Reminisce Cafe" is a nice ballad where you will meet Elvis, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and Jerry Lee Lewis. A nice place to be! The next song is "She Bops a Lot" written by Floyd Dakil of "Dance Franny Dance" fame. The next three songs are originals from Gene and his wife Dea's pen and cover the whole spectrum of 50's music from ballad to guitar lead rockabilly and sax/vocal chorus movin' rockin' ditty. "I Won't Take Any Less" carries the shades of Elvis and "(It's Love Baby) 24 Hours a Day" is a moving cover of the Ted Jarrett song first recorded by Louis Brooks, in 1955. From Gene's own pen, "Heartbreak City Limits" offers more of a country flavor before Gene takes a stroll on Elvis Presley's repertoire with "Love Me Tender". The next track "Gonna Drive 'em Up A Wall" is a wild, rockin', Little Richard styled song written and performed by Gene and his son Shawn as a duet. The remaining songs are all strong rockers, the last four coming from a 2002 session cut in Sweden and already issued on his album "Do Right Daddy". As you listen to this album it seems like 1958 is back again! I have heard the news - There's good rockin' tonight." -by camilledad58

Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework

Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) was an Enterprise architecture framework for treasury, based on the Zachman Framework. It was developed by the US Department of the Treasury and published in July 2000. May 2012 this framework has been subsumed by evolving Federal Enterprise Architecture Policy as documented in "The Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture".
The material presented here is obsolete and only useful for historical reference and is not the current policy in use by the Department of the Treasury.
Overview.
The Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) an architectural framework that supports Treasury’s business processes in terms of products. This framework guides the development and redesign of the business processes for various bureaus in order to meet the requirements of recent legislation in a rapidly changing technology environment. The TEAF prescribes architectural views and delineates a set of notional products to portray these views. 
The TEAF describes provides:
The TEAF's functional, information and organizational architecture views collectively model the organizations processes, procedures, and business operations. By grounding the architecture in the business of the organization, the TEAF defines the core business procedures and enterprise processes. Through its explicit models, a TEAF-based architecture enables the identification and reasoning of enterprise- and system-level concerns and investment decisions.
History.
The Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) is derived from earlier treasury models, such as the US Treasury model (TISAF) released 1997, and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), released in 1999. The first version of the TEAF was released July 2000. 
In the new millennium the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) has developed into the Treasury Enterprise Architecture (TEA), which aims to establish a roadmap for the modernization and optimization of the U.S. Treasury Department’s business processes and IT environment. The Treasury Enterprise Architecture will provide a framework to guide IT investment planning, streamline systems, and ensure that IT programs align with business requirements and strategic goals.
TEAF Topics.
Enterprise Architecture.
Effective management and strategic decision making, especially for information technology (IT) investments, require an integrated view of the enterprise—understanding the interrelationships among the business organizations, their operational processes, and the information systems that support them. An Enterprise Architecture formalizes the identification, documentation, and management of these interrelationships, and supports the management and decision processes. The Enterprise Architecture provides substantial support for evolution of an enterprise as it anticipates and responds to the changing needs of its customers and constituents. The Enterprise Architecture is a vital part of the enterprise’s decision-making process, and will evolve along with the enterprise’s mission. 
The TEAF has been designed to help both the bureaus and the Department develop and maintain their Enterprise Architectures. The TEAF aims to establish a common Enterprise Architecture structure, consistent practices, and common terminology; and to institutionalize Enterprise Architecture governance across the Department. This architectural consistency will facilitate integration, information sharing, and exploitation of common requirements across Treasury. 
Enterprise Architecture Framework.
The purpose of the Enterprise Architecture Framework is to provide a structure for producing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) and managing Enterprise Architecture assets. To reduce the complexity and scope of developing and using an Enterprise Architecture, it must be subdivided so that portions may be used independently or built incrementally in separate projects. The TEAF subdivides an Enterprise Architecture by:
The TEAF identifies, as shown in the figure, resources and work products that provide direction for EA development, work products constituting the EA description, and work products documenting how to accomplishment an EA implementation. The resources and work products for EA direction and accomplishment are not part of the EA description itself, but are developed and applied during the overall enterprise life cycle. The TEAF Matri, organizes the subdivisions of the EA description and demonstrates the relationships among them. The following sections describe the subdivisions of the EA and their relationships to the TEAF Matrix.
TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.
The TEAF Matrix is a simplified portrayal of an EA structure to aid in understanding important EA aspects from various vantage points (views and perspectives). The TEAF Matrix aims to provide a simple, uniform structure to an entire framework. As depicted in the figure, the TEAF Matrix consists of four architectural views (Functional, Information, Organizational, and Infrastructure), which are shown as columns, and four perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, and Builder), which appear as rows. The TEAF Matrix is a four-by-four matrix with a total of 16 cells. The views and perspectives are described in the following sections.
When an EA description work product is shown within one cell of the TEAF Matrix, it means that the main vantage points for developing that work product correspond to that column (view) and row (perspective). However, information from other views (and sometimes other perspectives) is needed to produce a work product. Not all cells must be “filled-in” by producing an associated work product. Each bureau must define in its EA Roadmap its plans for producing and using an EA to match its needs.
Enterprise Life Cycle activities.
An Enterprise Life Cycle integrates the management, business, and engineering life cycle processes that span the enterprise to align its business and IT activities. Enterprise Life Cycle refers generally to an organization’s approach for managing activities and making decisions during ongoing refreshment of business and technical practices to support its enterprise mission. These activities include investment management, project definition, configuration management, accountability, and guidance for systems development according to a System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The Enterprise Life Cycle applies to enterprise-wide planning activities and decision making. By contrast, a System Development Life Cycle generally refers to practices for building individual systems. Determining what systems to build is an enterprise-level decision. 
The figure on the left depicts notional activities of an Enterprise Life Cycle methodology. Within the context of this document, Enterprise Life Cycle does not refer to a specific methodology or a specific bureau’s approach. Each organization needs to follow a documented Enterprise Life Cycle methodology appropriate to its size, the complexity of its enterprise, and the scope of its needs.
Products.
The TEAF provides a unifying concept, common terminology and principles, common standards and formats, a normalized context for strategic planning and budget formulation, and a universal approach for resolving policy and management issues. It describes the enterprise information systems architecture and its components, including the architectures purpose, benefits, characteristics, and structure. The TEAF introduces various architectural views and delineates several modeling techniques. Each view is supported with graphics, data repositories, matrices, or reports (i.e., architectural products). 
The figure shows a matrix with four views and four perspectives. Essential products are shown across the top two rows of the matrix. It is notable that the TEAF includes an Information Assurance Trust model, the Technical Reference Model, and standards profiles as essential work products. These are not often addressed as critical
framework components. One of these frameworks should provide a means to logically structure and organize the selected EA products. Now, in order to effectively create and maintain the EA products, a toolset should be selected.
System Interface Description.
The System Interface Description (SID) links together the Organizational and Infrastructure Views by depicting the assignments of systems and their interfaces to the nodes and needlines described in the Node Connectivity Description. The Node Connectivity Description for a given architecture shows nodes (not always defined in physical terms), while the System Interface Description depicts the systems corresponding to the system nodes. The System Interface Description can be produced at four levels, as described below. Level 1 is an essential work product, while Levels 2, 3, and 4 are supporting work products.
The System Interface Description identifies the interfaces between nodes, between systems, and between the components of a system, depending on the needs of a particular architecture. A system interface is a simplified or generalized representation of a communications pathway or network, usually depicted graphically as a straight line, with a descriptive label. Often, pairs of connected systems or system components have multiple interfaces between them. The System Interface Description depicts all interfaces between systems and/or system components that are of interest to the architect.
The graphic descriptions and/or supporting text for the System Interface Description should provide details concerning the capabilities of each system. For example, descriptions of information systems should include details concerning the applications present within the system, the infrastructure services that support the applications, and the means by which the system processes, manipulates, stores, and exchanges data.

The Book Man

The Book Man consists of two secondhand bookstores in British Columbia, Canada. The original store at 45939 Wellington Avenue in Chilliwack measures over , and is noted as the second-largest used bookstore in the province. Their second branch is located in Abbotsford at #5-2630 Bourquin Crescent West in the Little Oak Mall and is . The stores are both named after the owner's father's nickname. The Book Man originated in 1963 and was acquired by David Short under the name Erna's Book Nook in 1990. After he changed the name to The Book Nook, Short expanded inventory and shelving until yet another move was required. His daughter Amber Short became co-owner and full-time manager in 2000 after many years of part-time work, and is now the sole owner after David passed the business down to her in August 2012. The Book Man employs a staff of fourteen . Their resident cat Nietzsche lives in Chilliwack and has gained international fame as a poster cat for bookstore cats. Gatsby, a grey and white cat, resides in their Abbotsford store. Both cats are known for greeting customers at the front door, and for their gentle and friendly dispositions. A program by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to the Chilliwack branch of The Book Man as "the mirror image to City Lights".
Community involvement.
The Book Man puts together community activities, such as story time within the store, storytelling circles, and musical events. They are known for bringing acts such as Immaculate Machine Klesmer accordion artist Geoff Berner and folk singer Raghu Lokanathan to play gigs in Downtown Chilliwack during their Book Man Concert Series.

Bayerisch Eisenstein station

Bayerisch Eisenstein station (Czech: Železná Ruda-Alžbětín) is a railway station on the border of southeast Germany and the Czech Republic. It forms the junction between the Bavarian Forest railway from Plattling to Bayerisch Eisenstein, which was started in 1874 by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (or Bavarian "Ostbahn") and completed by the Royal Bavarian State Railways, and the Pilsen–Markt Eisenstein (today: Plzeň-Železná Ruda) railway built by the [Pilsen–Priesen(–Komotau) railway in what was then Bohemia. The national border between Germany and the Czech Republic runs through the middle of the station building.
Construction.
The basis for this railway junction was the Bavarian-Austrian state treaty of 21 June 1851. On the Bohemian side, the Pilsen–Priesen(–Komotau) railway company built the missing section from Neuern to Eisenstein station and opened it on 20 October 1877. On the German side, after the Bavarian "Ostbahn" was nationalised on 10 May 1875, the line was completed by the Royal Bavarian State Railways and the last section from Ludwigsthal to Eisenstein was opened to railway traffic on 15 November 1877. 
Not until just before the completion of the railway lines, did the two railway administrations agree, on 17 May 1877, details of the very large station building and extensive track system needed for the transfer of goods and passengers. This required the local terrain to be filled with over 250,000 m³ of earth and levelled off. The station building was built with its centre section exactly on the border. On either side was an adjoining wing belonging to the respective railway company. The waiting room was designed in a way that was very representative of the style of that era. In the first class waiting room is the largest surviving planked ceiling of its type - a so-called "Cologne ceiling" ("Kölner Decke"). The station was completed in 1878. On its southern side, west of the track network, that had 9 tracks to begin with and later 11, is the roundhouse with its turntable. Today it houses the Bavarian Localbahn (=branch line) Museum in which the Bavarian Localbahn Society stables more than 20 vehicles from the Lokalbahn era.
The railway line was conceived as the shortest link between Prague and Munich, but because of the steep inclines and tight curves, especially on the Bohemian side, it never attained its intended importance. There was no cross-border traffic until 2006, even after the forced annexation of the Sudetenland into the German Reich in 1938. Only around the turn of the 20th century, in 1900, did through coaches run along the route for a few years from Munich to Prague. Through goods traffic restricted itself to the region.
Iron Curtain.
After the end of the Second World War cross-border traffic came to a complete standstill. In 1953 a wire fence was erected across the station yard by Czechoslovakia and the tracks were severed. Even in the station building itself the border was blocked by walls. Czech passenger services now terminated several kilometres to the north of the border at Železná Ruda ("Markt Eisenstein") station. The Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) ran its trains up to the buffer stop by the border fence and used the southern half of the divided station building. DB steam services to Bayerisch Eisenstein ended for both passenger and goods traffic in the 1970s. For a long time thereafter, railbuses were used; these were later replaced by diesel locomotives hauling silver Silberling coaches. 
Reconnexion.
The border crossing was opened again for rail traffic on 2 June 1991. Since then it has been possible to change for České dráhy (ČD) trains to Klatovy and Plzeň after a short wait. Shunters can use the tracks belonging to both railway administrations without worrying about crossing the border. Today on the German side the Regentalbahn runs trains under contract from DB Regio Bayern using the logo "Waldbahn" (Forest Railway) from Plattling via Regen and Zwiesel to Bayerisch Eisenstein. Once the signal installations of the station were prepared for cross-border services on 28 May 2006 "Waldbahn" Regio-Shuttles started running as far as Špičák ("Spitzberg"), 7 km away, where connexions to Pilsen are possible. This is the first timetabled cross-border service on this line since it was built in 1877. The Bayerwald-Ticket (Bavarian Forest ticket) fare was extended to cover journeys to Špičák.
In December 2006 the former name of the Czech part of the station, "Železná Ruda", was officially changed to "Železná Ruda-Alžbětín".
In the 2007/08 annual timetable, trains run hourly from Plattling to Bayerisch Eisenstein. Some of these continue on as far as Špičák. On the Czech side, local trains run to Klatovy and expresses to Pilsen, some going on to Prague.

Nocturnes (book)

Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall is a 2009 collection of short fiction by Japanese-English author Kazuo Ishiguro. After six novels, it is his first collection of short stories, though described by the publisher as a "story cycle". As the subtitle suggests, each of the five stories focuses on music and musicians, and the close of day. The hardback was published by Faber and Faber in the United Kingdom on 7 May 2009 and in the United States by Knopf in September 2009.
Stories.
As the subtitle suggests, each story focuses on music and musicians, and the close of day. All of the stories have unfulfilled potential as a linking theme, tinged with elements of regret. The second and fourth stories have comic undertones. The first and final stories feature cafe musicians, and the first and fourth stories feature the same character. All five stories have unreliable male narrators and are written in the first person.
Reception.
Robert Macfarlane writes in "The Sunday Times" that "Closing the book, it’s hard to recall much more than an atmosphere or an air; a few bars of music, half-heard, technically accomplished, quickly forgotten." Christian House of "The Independent" writes that "Ultimately this is a lovely, clever book about the passage of time and the soaring notes that make its journey worthwhile".

Portobello (novel)

Portobello is a novel by British writer Ruth Rendell, published in 2008. It is set in and around the Portobello Road in Notting Hill, London. Written in the third-person narrative mode, it follows the lives of a number of Londoners—rich and poor alike—living near the Portobello Road Market whose paths cross by accident rather than design. In other words, "Portobello" is about "the destinies of an oddly assorted group of people, whose only common characteristic is their postcode." 
Throughout the novel, something menacing seems to lurk behind every street corner, and the suspicion that something awful or sinister is going to happen any minute "(this is after all a novel by Ruth Rendell) is what hooks the reader" As "one of the leading chroniclers of contemporary London", Rendell has known the area and its inhabitants for so long that her "take on Notting Hill restores some of the rawness taken away by gentrification and the saccharine stammer of the film of the same name." 
Plot summary.
The central character of the novel is Eugene Wren, a wealthy, middle-aged art dealer whose secretive personality jeopardizes both his sanity and his relationship with, and eventual engagement to, Ella Cotswold, an attractive general practitioner ten years his junior. Having in the past overcome various slight addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and food, Wren gets hooked on a special brand of sugar-free sweet, which he wants to conceal from his fiancée. When the couple decide that Ella should sell her flat and she moves in with him, he starts inventing excuses and lies so as to be alone just for the time it takes to suck a sweet and to get rid of the sweet smell on his breath afterwards. Extremely ashamed of his habit, he buys, hoards, and consumes the sweets secretly, and he establishes several caches in his antique-studded home. When Ella happens to find one of them, out of curiosity goes on to search the rest of the house, and finally confronts Wren with her find, he is so ashamed of himself that he sees no other way than to break off their engagement and move into a hotel.

Sue K. Hicks

Sue Kerr Hicks (December 12, 1895 – June 17, 1980) was an American jurist who practiced law and served as a circuit court judge in the state of Tennessee. He is best known for his role as a co-instigator and prosecutor in the 1925 trial of John T. Scopes, a Dayton, Tennessee teacher accused of teaching the Theory of Evolution in violation of Tennessee state law. Hicks may have also been the inspiration for the Shel Silverstein song "A Boy Named Sue," which was popularized by country music performer Johnny Cash in 1969.
Life and legal career.
Hicks was born in Madisonville, Tennessee on December 12, 1895. He was the youngest child of Charles Wesley and Susanna Coltharp Hicks. Hicks was named "Sue" after his mother, who died a few days after giving birth to him. Charles Wesley Hicks, Sue's father, was a prominent Madisonville lawyer, and Wesley J. Hicks, Sue's great-uncle, was the author of a manual on Tennessee Chancery law practice and played a key role in getting lawsuits dismissed against former Confederate officers in the Knoxville area after the American Civil War. Sue trained at Hiwassee College and the University of Kentucky before joining his older brother, Herbert, in Dayton, where Herbert had been appointed acting Rhea County attorney. 
In Dayton, the Hicks brothers were regulars at the F.E. Robinson Drugstore, where the town's professionals often gathered to socialize and discuss the issues of the day. In May 1925, the Hicks brothers and other regulars became involved in a discussion over an American Civil Liberties Union advertisement seeking a challenge to the Butler Act, a recently-enacted state law barring the teaching of the Theory of Evolution. Realizing the publicity such a case would bring to Rhea County, the group— who would eventually become known as the "drugstore conspirators"— decided to engineer a case that would test the constitutionality of the Butler Act. The group recruited local physics teacher John T. Scopes— a friend of Sue's— to admit to teaching the Theory of Evolution. One of the conspirators, George Rappleyea, swore out a warrant for Scopes' arrest on May 5, and charges were filed the following day.
Sue Hicks served as a member of the Scopes Trial prosecution team, although his role was vastly overshadowed by the presence of William Jennings Bryan, an activist and former presidential candidate who had been invited to join the team as a special prosecutor. While the trial was wildly successful in bringing publicity to Rhea County, much of the publicity was negative, and portrayed local residents as backward and uneducated. And although Scopes was convicted— as had been planned— the "test case" came to an end in 1927, when the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled the Butler Act constitutional, but overturned Scopes' conviction on a technicality. This kept the case out of the federal court system and ended any chance of it proceeding to the United State Supreme Court, which the drugstore conspirators had originally hoped. Hicks later wrote the following about his views on the trial:"We cannot speak other than with commendation as to the conduct of Judge Raulston in the Scopes Case. It was a very trying case. Religious fanatics, reds, and all manner of rabble were assembled at this trial, and at times the excitement of the crowd became almost a frenzy, and almost beyond the control of the small number of officers which we had at our disposal. Beside the attorneys for the defense did every thing they could to provoke the Court and to get on the front pages of the newspapers as much as they could, so the situation was very hard to handle."
Between 1936 and 1958, Sue Hicks served as a state circuit court judge, and continued to serve in a reserve status until the 1970s. He presided over more than 800 murder cases, and gained a reputation for being "fair" and "tough". In the mid-1960s, Hicks served as president of the Fort Loudoun Association, and led the early opposition to the Tennessee Valley Authority's plans to build Tellico Dam at the mouth of the Little Tennessee River. Hicks died on June 27, 1980 in Sweetwater, Tennessee. He is buried at Haven Hill Memorial Gardens in Madisonville. The Sue K. Hicks Papers, which consist primarily of Hicks' correspondence regarding the Scopes Trial and later legal cases, are currently on file at the University of Tennessee Special Collections Library in Knoxville.
Inspiration for "A Boy Named Sue".
Hicks' oddly feminine first name may have inspired the song, "A Boy Named Sue", which Johnny Cash first performed in 1969. The song's author, Shel Silverstein, attended a judicial conference in Gatlinburg, Tennessee— at which Hicks was a speaker— and apparently got the idea for the song title after hearing Hicks introduced. While Cash said he was unaware that Silverstein had any one person in mind when he wrote the song, he did send Hicks two records and two autographed pictures signed, "To Sue, how do you do?"
While his name may have inspired the song's title, Hicks pointed out that the character in the song's lyrics— who seeks revenge against his father after a lifetime of teasing— bore little resemblance to his own life. Hicks' father named him after his deceased mother, who had died from complications with Hicks' birth, rather than, as the song suggests, to make him "strong". Hicks also claimed to have always had a sense of humor about his name, and didn't consider it a source of derision. In 1970, Hicks noted: "It is an irony of fate that I have tried over 800 murder cases and thousands of others, but the most publicity has been from the name 'Sue' and from the evolution trial. ... I was named Sue for my mother, who died after childbirth."

The Girl Who Played with Fire

The Girl Who Played with Fire () is the second novel in the best-selling "Millennium" series by Swedish writer Stieg Larsson. It was published posthumously in Swedish in 2006 and in English in January 2009.
The book features many of the characters that appeared in "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", among them the title character, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant computer hacker and social misfit, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist and publisher of "Millennium "magazine.
Widely seen as a critical success, "The Girl Who Played with Fire" was also (according to "The Bookseller" magazine) the first and only translated novel to be number one in the UK hardback chart.
Synopsis.
The novel is formally divided into a prologue followed by four parts. The prologue of the book opens with a girl captured and restrained inside a dark room by an unidentified male. To cope with being captured, she mentally replays a past episode when she threw a milk carton filled with gasoline onto another man inside a car and tossed an ignited match onto him.
Part 1 – Irregular Equations.
After finishing the job on the Wennerström affair (described in "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"), Lisbeth Salander disappeared from Sweden and traveled throughout Europe. The novel opens with her on the shores of the Caribbean in St George's, the capital of Grenada. Salander has become interested in Fermat's Last Theorem and mathematics, an interest that resounds with the opening page of each Part in this novel. From within her room in her hotel she observes on several occasions that her neighbor, Dr Forbes, an American tourist from Texas, physically abuses his wife, in the next room to Salander. She also befriends George Bland, a sixteen-year-old orphaned student living in a small shack, and begins tutoring him in mathematics. Salander finds Bland's company relaxing and enjoyable because Bland does not ask her personal questions, and the two develop a sexual relationship.
Salander uses her connections among the hackers' network to investigate Dr Forbes and learns that he was once accused of mishandling funds in his faith-based foundation. Currently he has no assets, but his wife is the heir to a fortune worth $40 million. Concerns for the safety of the residents at the hotel cause the hotel management to begin ushering them into a cellar as a hurricane hits Grenada. Salander remembers Bland and braves the strong wind and rain to collect him. As the two reach the hotel entrance, Salander sees Dr Forbes on the beach with his wife and realizes that he is attempting to kill her for her inheritance. Salander attacks Forbes with the leg of a chair, and abandons him to the elements. Salander, Bland and Mrs Forbes retreat to the cellar and receive medical care; Dr Forbes is later confirmed as the only fatality of the storm.
Part 2 – From Russia with Love.
Lisbeth Salander returns to Stockholm after more than a year away. Immediately before the Wennerström affair became public knowledge, Salander laundered a sum of three billion kronor (the equivalent of about half a billion $US) into a disguised bank account. With this sum she purchases a new up-scale apartment outside of Mosebacke Torg and moves out of her old apartment in Lundagatan (SV). Salander allows her current sex partner, Miriam Wu, to move into her old apartment, for the price of 1 krona and the condition that Wu forward all of Salander's mail. She also re-establishes contact with Dragan Armansky, her former boss at Milton Securities, and former legal guardian Holger Palmgren, who fell victim to a stroke during the events of "Dragon Tattoo".
Nils Bjurman, Palmgren's replacement, continues to nurture a growing hatred for his ward after the events of "Dragon Tattoo". His fury has caused him to diminish his practice down to a single client (Salander) and focus his attention on capturing her and destroying the film she made of him raping her. He scrutinizes Salander's medical records, and identifies an incident named "All the Evil" as well as a person from her past as his strongest ally.
In the meantime, Mikael Blomkvist, the publisher of "Millennium" magazine, has lost contact with Salander, who has refused even to open his letters. He is therefore surprised, shortly after her return, while he is walking past her apartment in the vain hope of running into her, to see her being attacked by a ponytailed man with a beer gut, a member of the Svavelsjö outlaw motorcycle club. Blomkvist attempts to help, to Salander's astonishment, and their joint efforts enable her to elude her attacker.
"Millennium" is approached by Dag Svensson, a young journalist, and his girlfriend Mia Bergman. They have put together a meticulously-researched report, ironically titled "From Russia with Love", about sex trafficking in Sweden and the abuse of underage girls by high-ranking figures; this is the subject of Bergman's doctoral thesis and Svensson wants "Millennium" to publish his exposé in book form. Whilst the research is mostly complete, Svensson, Bergman and the "Millennium" staff are intrigued by recurring mentions of "Zala," a shadowy figure heavily involved in Sweden's sex-trafficking industry. Salander, hacking Mikael Blomkvist's computer, is taken aback by the mention of Zala and visits Svensson and Bergman to ask questions.
Part 3 – Absurd Equations.
Later the same night, Blomkvist calls on the couple, to find them both shot dead in their apartment, the killer having apparently left the building only seconds before. Blomkvist notifies Erika Berger, the editor in chief of "Millennium" and his lover, of the double murder, and the magazine's management team holds an emergency meeting at which they decide to postpone the publication of Svensson's book and the associated magazine special. They decide to backtrack Svensson's research to ensure the accuracy of the material, and to comb through it for possible murder motives, while Blomkvist is tasked with finishing Svensson's mostly-completed book.
Prosecutor Richard Ekström assembles an investigation team, led by Inspector Jan Bublanski, who selects Sonja Modig for inclusion in the team because of her sensitivity to women's issues. The team identifies Salander's fingerprints on the murder weapon, and her formal record establishes her as a violent, unstable, psychotic young woman with a history of prostitution. Armansky, Blomkvist and Berger all vouch for her intelligence and moral fiber; neither Mikael nor Erika were even aware of her psychiatric history. While investigating Salander's social circle, Modig finds Bjurman shot dead in his apartment with his own revolver, the same weapon used on Svensson and Bergman; Salander remains the prime suspect. In the light of this new evidence, Ekström holds a press conference and discloses Salander's name and psychiatric history to the press, describing her as a danger to others and herself.
Blomkvist enlists the help of managing editor Malin Eriksson to investigate the murders, during which he realizes that Salander has hacked into his notebook computer. He leaves her notes on his desktop, and her replies point him to "Zala". He confronts Gunnar Björk, a policeman on sick leave and one of the johns identified by Dag and Mia, who agrees to disclose information about Zala if Blomkvist leaves him out of "Millennium"'s exposé.
Armansky realises that Milton Security should become involved in the investigation and sends two of his employees, Hedström and Bohman, to aid the formal police investigation. Miriam Wu returns from a Paris trip to find herself taken to the police station and confirms Salander's intelligence and moral character. However, Hedström, who carries an old grudge against Salander, leaks Wu's identity to the press, who publish stories about Wu's involvement in a Gay Pride Festival and Salander's prior friendship with a female rock group; both she and Salander are sensationalized in the media as members of a "lesbian Satanist gang". The press also publishes information about Salander's past.
Part 4 – Terminator Mode.
Part 4 begins with Salander wondering why the press's inside source has chosen not to publicize "All the Evil," the events which dominated the gap in her biography, information she knows would swing public opinion even further against her. Blomkvist is approached by Paolo Roberto, a boxing champion and Salander's former coach. Blomkvist asks Roberto to help by finding Miriam Wu, who, released by the police, has been avoiding all press contact, including Mikael. In the meantime, at Salander's suggestion, Blomkvist focuses onto Zala as the key connection between the three murders and sex trafficking. As the police continue the investigation, Blomkvist's team also notices the three-year gap in Salander's biography. Blomkvist decides to confront Björk and trade his anonymity for information on Zala.
Roberto, staking out Salander's former apartment in the hopes of catching Wu, witnesses her being kidnapped into a van by a paunchy man with a ponytail (Salander's former attacker) and a "blond giant". He follows the van to a warehouse south of Nykvarn, where he attempts to rescue Wu by boxing with the giant. He finds his opponent unusually muscular and totally insensitive to pain, and only through applications of massive blunt trauma can he and Wu stun the giant enough to escape. The giant recovers and sets the warehouse on fire to destroy the evidence. However, Roberto is able to direct the police to the site, where they find three buried and dismembered bodies.
Visiting Bjurman's summer cabin, Salander finds a classified Swedish Security Service file written about "All The Evil", and begins to make the connection between Bjurman and Zala, whose real name is Alexander Zalachenko. By coincidence, two members of Svavelsjö MC, Carl-Magnus Lundin (the paunchy ponytail man) and Sonny Nieminen, have been dispatched to burn the place down; Salander outwits them, leaving more suspects for Bublanski to find. She returns to her apartment and, having no choice, decides to find Zalachenko and kill him. Salander discovers the blond giant's identity ("Ronald Niedermann") and his connection to a post office box in Göteborg and goes there to find him and Zalachenko.
In his apartment, Blomkvist finds Salander's keys, which he had picked up after her escape from Lundin. He manages to find her new, up-scale apartment as well as the DVD revealing Bjurman's crime. With information from Björk and Salander's former guardian, Holger Palmgren, Blomkvist is able to piece together the entire story: Zalachenko is a Russian defector under secret Swedish protection, whose very existence is kept classified by Säpo; Bjurman and Björk knew about him only because they happened to be the junior officers on duty the day he marched into a police station and demanded political asylum. Zalachenko, a source of vital information on Russia's intelligence operations, began to traffic in sex slaves on the side, whilst simultaneously settling down with an 18-year-old girl who became pregnant with twins, Camilla and Lisbeth. He was physically and emotionally abusive to his partner, and while Camilla tended to repress all knowledge of the situation, Lisbeth attempted to defend her mother. The cycle of violence culminated in Salander deliberately setting his car alight with gasoline while he was in it. This is the event Salander refers to as "All the Evil", since the authorities, instead of listening to her pleas on behalf of her mother, imprisoned her and declared her insane. Salander's mother was left with the first of a series of brain aneurysms which consigned her to nursing homes until her death. Salander realised that the government would never acknowledge Zalachenko's crimes, which would require them to admit his existence. Zalachenko was allowed to walk away, but suffered serious injuries and had to have his foot amputated. Svensson and Bergman were killed by Niedermann on Zalachenko's orders: when Salander visited them, she asked whether Bjurman had ever showed up as one of their johns, and they called him immediately after she left; Bjurman then called Zalachenko in a panic, leading not only to their deaths but to his own.
Blomkvist does not share all of his findings with Bublanski, out of respect for Salander's privacy, but between his testimony, the various character witnesses, and the additional accomplices piling up, the police are forced to admit that their original suspicions of Salander as a psychotic murderer may have been wrong. Milton Security are ejected from the investigation when it becomes clear that Hedström is the inside source who has been leaking sensational details to the press; Armansky is satisfied, as his true goal in aiding the investigation—ensuring Salander is not simply condemned as a murderer out of hand—has been achieved. Finally, Blomkvist finds Niedermann's Göteborg address, and sets off for the farm where Niedermann and Zalachenko await. He has deduced that Salander has entered what Roberto and his boxing friends called "Terminator Mode", where she attacks without restraint to defend her life and those she cares about.
Salander enters the farmhouse and is captured as a result of secret cameras and alarms Zalachenko had installed. He tells Salander that Niedermann is her half-brother. When Salander attempts to escape, Zalachenko shoots her in the hip, shoulder and head, and Niedermann buries her alive. Salander digs herself out and again attempts to kill Zalachenko with an axe, noting that Zalachenko's use of a Browning .22 firearm is the only reason she survived. On his way to Göteborg, Blomkvist sees Niedermann trying to hitch a ride, and captures him at gunpoint, tying him against a signpost by the road. The book ends as Blomkvist finds Salander and calls emergency services.
Reception.
The English version was published in January 2009 and immediately became a number 1 bestseller. It received generally positive reviews from most of the major UK newspapers. Many reviewers agreed with Joan Smith at the "Sunday Times" that this novel was “even more gripping and astonishing than the first”.
Carla McKay at the "Daily Mail" said that, like its predecessor, the book is "not just a thrilling read, but tackles head-on the kind of issues that Larsson himself railed against in society".
Most of the reviewers concentrated mainly on the character of Lisbeth Salander, with Mark Lawson at the "Guardian" saying that "the huge pleasure of these books is Salander, a fascinating creation with a complete and complex psychology."
Boyd Tonkin in "The Independent" saying that "the spiky and sassy Lisbeth Salander – punkish wild child, traumatised survivor of the 'care' system, sexual adventurer and computer hacker of genius" was "the most original heroine to emerge in crime fiction for many years".
Cultural notes.
The character of Paolo Roberto is an actual person. He is a former boxer and television chef who has also dabbled in politics. He played himself in the film based on the book.
In the first part of the book, Salander is exploring "Dimensions in Mathematics" apparently written by L. C. Parnault and published by Harvard University Press in 1999. On February 9, 2009, Harvard University Press announced on their website that this book, as well as the author, is purely fictitious.
The mysterious Karl Axel Bodin, in whose house Salander finds Zalachenko and Niedermann, is a historical name. Bodin was born in Karlstad and later moved to Sundsvall. He went to Norway to join the Waffen-SS; at the end of World War II, he was attached to the country's branch of the Gestapo. At the war's end, Bodin and another Swedish volunteer stole a car in an attempted escape to Sweden. The car's owner saw the theft, and soon a gunfight erupted in which the car owner and Bodin's friend were shot. Bodin left his friend behind and crossed the border.

1997 Tennessee Volunteers football team

The 1997 Tennessee Volunteers football team represented the University of Tennessee during the 1997 season. Quarterback Peyton Manning had already completed his degree in three years, and had been projected to be the top overall pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, but returned to Tennessee for his senior year. The Volunteers opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA, but for the third time in his career, Manning fell to Florida, 33–20. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10–1, and advanced to the SEC Championship Game game against Auburn. Down 20–7, Manning led the Vols to a 30–29 victory. Throwing for four touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. The #3 Vols were matched up with #2 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Had Tennessee won and top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl, the Vols would have been expected to win the national championship. However, the Vols' defense could not stop Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up over 400 yards on the ground in a 42–17 loss. As a senior, Manning won numerous awards. He was a consensus first-team All-American and won the Maxwell Award, the Davey O'Brien Award, the Johnny Unitas Award, and the Best College Football Player ESPY Award, among others. However, he did not win the Heisman Trophy, finishing second to Charles Woodson of Michigan.

Thomas Simpson (explorer)

Thomas Simpson (July 2, 1808 – June 14, 1840) was an arctic explorer, Hudson's Bay Company agent and cousin of HBC governor Sir George Simpson.
Early life.
Simpson was born in Dingwall, Scotland the son of magistrate Alexander Simpson (1751–1821) by his second wife Mary who had helped raise George Simpson. He was a sickly and timid youth, avoiding rough sport. He was educated with a view to his becoming a clergyman, and was sent to King's College, Aberdeen at the age of seventeen. Sir George Simpson offered him a position in the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, which he declined in order to complete his studies. He graduated in 1828, at the age of 20, with a Master of Arts. He enrolled in a divinity class that winter with the goal of becoming a clergyman, when the offer of a position in the Hudson's Bay Company was again extended, and this time he accepted. In 1829 he arrived in Norway House to join the Hudson's Bay Company as George Simpson's secretary.
Simpson was stationed at the Red River Colony in the 1830s, serving as second officer to chief factor Christie.
Arctic Expedition.
From 1836 to 1839, Thomas Simpson was involved in an expedition to chart the Arctic coast of Canada in order to fill two gaps left by other expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage. The expedition was headed by Peter Warren Dease, a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Thomas was the junior officer but Dease ceded most of the responsibility to Simpson. Several writers present Simpson as an ambitious and over-confident young man while Dease was 20 years older, experienced in Arctic travel, efficient but perhaps under-confident. Ten more men went with them including the canoemen James McKay and George Sinclair who had been with George Back in his 1834 journey down the Back River.
The expedition was organized by the Hudson's Bay Company rather than the Royal Navy which did most of the northwest passage work. They were to descend the Mackenzie River to the Arctic, turn west, and close the gap between John Franklin's 1826 furthest west and Frederick William Beechey's furthest east at Point Barrow. The next summer they were to go down Coppermine River, repeat Franklin's 1821 route east to Cape Turnagain and continue along the unknown coast at least to the mouth of the Back River which had been reached overland in 1834. 1836: They spent the winter of 1836-37 at Fort Chipewyan where they built two 24-foot boats. 1837 (west): They left on June 1 and a month later reached the mouth of the Great Bear River. There they detached four men to go upriver to the lake and build winter quarters at Fort Confidence while the rest went down the Mackenzie to the Arctic which they reached on 9 July. They went west along the coast past Franklin's Return Reef until they were blocked by ice at Boat Extreme about 50 miles east of Point Barrow. Simpson and five men continued on foot and reached Point Barrow on 4 August. They returned to the Fort Confidence on 25 September. At this point the north coast had been mapped from Bering Strait to the mouth of the Coppermine. 1838 (east): Early in the year Simpson went overland to find the upper Coppermine River. In summer they descended the Coppermine, which was full of meltwater, and reached the still-frozen Arctic. They waited two weeks for the ice to clear and began working slowly east. On 20 August they were blocked by ice a few miles from Franklin's Point Turnagain on the Kent Peninsula. Dease stayed behind with the boats and Simpson walked about 100 miles ()
east to a place he called Point Alexander. To the north he saw and named "Victoria Land". To the east he saw open water in Queen Maud Gulf. He returned to Dease and the frozen-in boats. A few days later the ice suddenly cleared and they had an easy sail back to the Coppermine. They had gone only a little further than Franklin. 1839 (east again): It was a better year for ice. They followed the same route, passed Point Turnagain and Cape Alexander, sailed for the first time the Dease Strait and the Queen Maud Gulf, found the Adelaide Peninsula and Simpson Strait to its north and reached Chantry Inlet where McKay and Sinclair had been in 1834. At Montreal Island (Nunavut) they found a cache left by George Back in 1834. Leaving Chantry Inlet they were struck by a gale that lasted four days. Fifty miles northeast they turned back at the Castor and Pollux River. Returning they followed the south shore of King William Island to a point they called Cape Hershel where the coast turned north, followed the south shore of Queen Maud Gulf and the south shore of Victoria Island. It had been the longest boat voyage ever made in Canadian Arctic waters.
At this point the entire Arctic coast had been roughly mapped from the Bering Strait to beyond Chantry Inlet. The remaining problems were the possibly of a water route from Chantry Inlet to the Gulf of Boothia and the huge rectangular area north of the coast and south of the Parry Channel. The party returned to Great Slave Lake in September of that year, and from there Thomas drew up a letter to the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company describing the results of the expedition, which was published in many newspapers of the day. He also transmitted a plan for an expedition to complete further exploration of the coast between the straits of the Fury and Hecla and the eastern limits of his previous explorations. To attend to preparations for this new expedition, he immediately left for the Red River Colony, making the entire journey in 61 days, arriving on February 2, 1840. The annual canoes from Canada to the settlement in June of that year brought no word of the reception of his exploits, or authorization to continue exploration, as word had not reached England in time to reply at that opportunity. Without authorization from the Directors, Thomas had no authority to arrange another expedition. Instead of waiting for an entire year for word, he decided to return to England in person.
Death.
Thomas left the Red River Colony on the June 6, 1840, intending to travel to England by way of the Minnesota River. He initially set out with a group of settlers and Métis, but soon left the main party with four Métis travelling companions in order to make better time. On June 14, 1840, he and two of his travelling companions died in a shoot-out. According to the two survivors, Simpson had become increasingly anxious and even deranged during the journey, finally accusing two of the party of plotting to kill him. He shot them, and the witnesses fled, returning to the larger party, a portion of which then went to Simpson's encampment. They found him dead of gunshot wounds, his shotgun beside him. The authorities ruled it a murder-suicide.
All the witnesses agreed that Simpson shot dead John Bird and mortally wounded Legros Senior. Legros Junor and James Bruce fled to the main party. When the posse reached the site they found Legros Sr. dead and Simpson alive. Five minutes later Simpson was dead. All involved said that the wound was self-inflicted. Bruce claimed that Simpson told him that he killed the two men because they intended to "murder him on that night for his papers." The papers were sent to Sir George Simpson. Three years later, when Sir George sent the papers to Thomas' younger brother Alexander, the diary and all correspondence between Sir George and Thomas were missing. What the missing papers may have contained is unknown. A number of people have studied the evidence without reaching a conclusion.
In the mean time, the company's directors in London had sent permission for him to continue with his explorations. He had also been awarded the Royal Geographical Society’s gold medal, and the British government had announced its intention of granting him a pension of £100 a year. Instead, being accused of murder and suicide, and being disgraced in the eyes of the church, Thomas was buried in an unmarked grave in Canada.
Thomas' brother, Alexander Simpson, published Thomas' "Narrative of the Discoveries on the North Coast of America, effected by the Officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, during the years 1836—39" in 1843, and later wrote "The Life and Times of Thomas Simpson, the Arctic Explorer" (London, 1845), in which he examine's the possibility that the travelling companions were planning to steal his notes and maps which they could have sold to the Hudson's Bay Company’s American rivals.

<doc id="20584730" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20584730" title="New Gallery (London)">
New Gallery (London)

The New Gallery was an art gallery founded at 121 Regent Street W., London, in 1888 by J. Comyns Carr and Charles Edward Hallé. Carr and Hallé had been co-directors of Sir Coutts Lindsay's Grosvenor Gallery, but resigned from that troubled gallery in 1887.
The building.
The New Gallery was designed by Edward Robert Robson FSA, and constructed in little more than three months to ensure that it could open in the summer of 1888. 
The gallery was built on the site of an old fruit market. Existing cast-iron columns supporting the roof were encased with marble to give the impression of "massive marble shafts" topped with gilded Greek capitals. The architrave, frieze, and cornices above the columns were covered with platinum leaf. At the opening, the West and North Galleries on the ground floor were devoted to oil paintings, and the first floor balcony around the Central Hall displayed smaller works in oils, watercolours, etchings and drawings. Sculpture was displayed in the Central Hall itself.
Artists and exhibitions.
The New Gallery continued the ideals of the Grosvenor, and was an important venue for Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic movement artists. Edward Burne-Jones, then at the height of his popularity, supported the new venture, serving on its Consulting Committee and lending three large oils for the opening, thus ensuring its financial success. Lawrence Alma-Tadema and William Holman Hunt also joined the Consulting Committee, and George Frederic Watts and Lord Leighton transferred their loyalty to the New Gallery. 
The private view of the first exhibition was held on Tuesday, 8 May 1888, and the exhibition opened to the public on Wednesday, 9 May, for three months. The private view was a great social success, with former Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone among the early arrivals.
In October and November 1888, the New Gallery hosted the first showcase of industrial and applied arts by the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society under the direction of its founding president, illustrator and designer Walter Crane. No attempt had been made to show contemporary decorative arts in London since the Grosvenor Gallery's Winter Exhibition of 1881, which included cartoons for mosaic, tapestry, and glass, and the Society's annual (later triennial) exhibitions at the New Gallery were important events in the Arts and Crafts Movement at the end of the 19th century.
The New Gallery was the setting for a major Burne-Jones retrospective in 1892–93 and a memorial exhibition of his works in 1898. In 1893 the New Gallery exposed for the first time four panels by Masaccio, later attributed to the Pisa Polyptych (now in Staatliche Museen, Berlin). 
Carr continued as co-director until 1908. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1910 was the last to be held at the New Gallery, which briefly became the New Gallery Restaurant in 1910, and was remodeled again and opened as a cinema in January 1913.
Other uses for the building.
In 1910, the interior was converted into a restaurant,"The New Gallery Restaurant",but it was converted again in 1913, this time to a cinema. Enlargement and modifications were made to the cinema in 1925, including the installation of a Wurlizer organ. It was the location of the UK showing of the first full-length animated cartoon, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in 1938.
When the need for West End cinema was reduced the building was sold to the Seventh-day Adventist Church and was used as a church from 1953 until the 1990s, although the cinema was occasionally used for religious films. It remained empty until 2006, when it became a Habitat furniture store. The Wurlitzer organ remained in place and was restored to its original condition.
Habitat surrendered the lease in March 2011, and the site will become part of a flagship store for Burberry.
The New Gallery Cinema is a Grade II Listed building.

The Chalk Circle Man

The Chalk Circle Man (French: "L'Homme aux cercles bleus") is a novel by French crime-writer Fred Vargas. It is the first of her Detective Adamsberg series, published in 1991. 
The novel describes the background of Adamsberg's move to Paris, the origins of his partnership with inspector Danglard, and a glimpse at his elusive relationship with Camille. Much emphasis is placed on the theme of different ways of thinking - contrasting the two policemen's distinct approaches to investigations, and indeed life. There are also a number of typical Vargas elements in the story: a pedestrian's view of the geography of Paris, independent, eccentric but effective older women, a misdirection of the apparently abnormal drawn over the deliberate actions of a killer.
A telefilm of the novel (2009) starred Jean-Hugues Anglade, Charlotte Rampling, Jacques Spiesser and Jean-Pierre Léaud.

His work has been featured in the traveling exhibition "Will Boys Be Boys?" curated by Shamim Momim of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Humphrey's most recent solo exhibition, "All of Nothing", was at DCKT Contemporary. Humphrey was also a contestant in Season I of "Top Design", Bravo's reality show.
Recently, Humphrey was included in the "Queens International 4" exhibition at the Queens Museum of Art. His large-scale installation, titled "Fast Forward" (2009), included BMX ramps adjacent to a wall-to-ceiling collection of trophies and customized BMX bikes, and he continued this theme in his installation "Look for the dream that keeps coming back" (2010) at Kunsthalle Galapagos. Humphrey expresses his growing up in BMX culture through his art. The assemblage also included several paintings, created by the artist for the exhibition, and several sculptures of BMX bike wheels. The paintings were small drips that recall the works of Jackson Pollock, and the BMX sculptures are similar to Marcel Duchamp's "Bicycle Wheel". The installation included an opening night performance by legendary BMX pro Dizz Hicks and Ryan Humphrey on the ramps. An edition of 20 silkscreen posters was made by the artist, and signed by himself and Dizz Hicks, to commemorate the event.

Brain Strainers

Brain Strainers is an early music video game designed for the ColecoVision. It is one of the first video game clones of the popular 1970s audio game, "Simon", which became a large hit in the early 1980s. The game was recognized by magazines such as the Atari-centric "Antic" for excellence in educational software and it is notable for being one of the earliest music video games to employ pitch-based gameplay in the "Clef Climber" portion of the game.
Gameplay.
"Brain Strainers" consisted of two musically-themed sub-games: "Follow The Leader," and "Clef Climber." The intention of the game was to provide an educational video game experience. Skills that were targeted were eidetic musical memory and tonal accuracy.
Follow The Leader.
The "Follow The Leader" sub-game is an eidetic music game designed to test the player's memory. Here, a pattern of musical notes are played and four colored panels light up correspondingly. The player then has a few seconds to repeat the sequence back to the computer. If the sequence is repeated correctly then the computer generates a longer string of notes to perform. As the game progresses, the speeds at which the tune is performed and at which the response by the player must be given are increased. Further enhancing the difficulty of the game, the four colored panels cease to light up in higher levels.
Clef Climber.
The "Clef Climber" sub-game is a pitch-based video game where the player is given a reference note and then a tone corresponding to a different musical note that must be matched shortly after being played. As the game progresses, the reference note ceases to be played and the player must rely on his intuitive sense of pitch. The player can chose whether or not to view the notes on the musical staff, however even if musical notes are selected for display, they disappear at higher levels of the game.

All Alone Am I

"All Alone Am I" is a song from 1962 (see 1962 in music) popularized by the American singer Brenda Lee. The music was originally composed by the Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis and recorded by Tzeni Karezi for the soundtrack of the film "To nisi ton genneon" ("The Island of the Brave"). Later, a new version of the song was produced by Owen Bradley and appeared as the title track on one of Lee's albums. The song is written in the key of D minor.
Chart success.
"All Alone Am I" became a top 10 pop hit in both the US and the UK. The song peaked at number three on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in November 1962 and number seven on the UK Singles Chart in February 1963. The song also spent five weeks atop the US "Billboard" easy listening chart in November and December 1962, Lee's only song to do so. The B-side to the single, "Save All Your Lovin' For Me", reached number 53 on the US pop chart.
Accolades.
In 1960, the Greek film "Never on Sunday" was released to considerable acclaim, earning multiple Academy Award nominations in the US. The film's star, Melina Mercouri, was nominated for Best Actress, while the title song from the film won the Oscar for Best Original Song for Greek musician Manos Hadjidakis, who had composed the music used in the film. A melody that appeared in both "Never on Sunday" and "The Island of the Brave" was sent to Lee's management as a tune to be considered for the singer to record, and after being translated into English by Arthur Altman, became "All Alone Am I".
Covers.
Grady Martin released an instrumental version in 1965 on his Instrumentally Yours album.
Isannide and H. Ithier composed a new French lyric for the song; the French version, C'est Joli la Mer, was recorded by several artists, such as Nana Mouskouri; as well Finnish singer Carola Standertskjöld recorded it (with some changes to the lyrics) for the soundtrack of the film "The Cold Old Days" in 1965. The movie won the Golden Rose of the Montreaux Film Festival.
Filipino singer-actress Nora Aunor, released a single of this song in 1971 and is part of her album Superstar Nora Aunor.

Mazinger Z vs. Devilman

Story.
The movie opens with a battle between the Super Robots Mazinger Z and Aphrodite A against three of Doctor Hell’s Mechanical Beasts. The heroes win, but the battle apparently frees the female demon Sirène from below the ground. She flies away before they can do anything about it. However she is seen by Akira Fudo, who transforms into his real form of Devilman to fly after her.
Dr. Hell, who observed the battle, correctly realizes that Sirène is part of a “demon tribe” that according to a legend ruled the Earth in prehistoric times. Using a flying fortress (not the Gool, the one seen in the regular Mazinger series, but rather the Navalon, one exclusive to this movie) Hell and his henchman Baron Ashura follow Sirène to the Himalaya Mountains, were the rest of the tribe is frozen. Hell helps to free some of the demons (notably absent is their leader, Zenon) and makes a deal with them to help them defeat their enemy, Devilman, if they will help him defeat Mazinger. They are unaware that Devilman has spied on their conversation.
Later, Akira goes to warn Koji about this but ends up mocking the Mazinger for being unable to fly; this leads to the two hot-tempered teenagers racing each other on motorcycles (it ends in a draw.) It turns out that Mazinger’s headquarters, the Photon Research Laboratory, is already working on solving the robot’s disadvantage against flying enemies by making the Jet Scrambler, a giant winged jetpack. However one of the demons has spied on them and reports this development to Dr. Hell. He sends the shapeless demon and Sirène to destroy the Scrambler. They manage to damage it before being driven off by Koji’s raygun; Sirène escapes by taking Koji’s brother Shiro and his friend Sayaka hostage. She then lets them fall from the sky, but they are saved by Devilman. When Koji goes to pick them up, he watches Akira change into Devilman and so learns his secret. Devilman follows the amorphous demon to the sea, but falls into a trap; he’s rescued by Koji in the Mazinger. Afterwards they talk, and Akira reveals to him that he’s a rogue member of the Demon Tribe who fights to protect humanity.
The combined forces of Dr. Hell and the demons then attack the Laboratory; Devilman flies to help defend it, but is overwhelmed and captured. He’s taken to some (obviously magical) clouds, where he’s placed on an ice cross and tortured by the demons for being a traitor. However, as soon as the Scrambler is repaired, Koji uses it to fly the Mazinger into the clouds, killing the demons, freeing Devilman and finally destroying the flying fortress, although Hell and Ashura escape alive.
The movie ends with Koji and Akira on good terms, with the two flying off together into the sunset.

Lostock Hall Gatehouse

Lostock Hall Gatehouse is an Elizabethan building located in Lostock, a western suburb of Bolton in Greater Manchester, England. 
The now demolished Lostock Hall, built as a manor house for the Anderton family, was a half-timbered building with four overhanging gables. Over the entrance door were the initials CAD, representing for Christopher Anderton and his wife Dorothy, and the date 1563. Most of the rooms were wainscoted with many panels. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the hall was used as a farmhouse. In 1816, part of the hall was pulled down, and the remainder was demolished in 1824.
The gatehouse, a Grade II* listed building, is all that now remains of the hall. The main front is of ashlar and the other three sides are covered with thin coursed rubble. The central arch was originally was open, which a man could ride through, is now built up with a doorway. Originally there were no windows on the ground floor, but two sash windows have been introduced between the Tuscan columns, one on each side of the door. The upper floor windows are flanked by pairs of widely spaced Ionic and Corinthian columns. Above the first floor window is a square panel with the Anderton coat of arms, and above the second floor window is a shield bearing the royal arms of Queen Elizabeth I with the date 1591 and the royal initials E.R. For many years the gatehouse was also used as a farmhouse, but today is a private residence.

Saturn V

The Saturn V ("Saturn five") was an American human-rated expendable rocket used by NASA's Apollo and Skylab programs from 1966 until 1973. A multistage liquid-fueled launch vehicle, NASA launched 13 Saturn Vs from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida with no loss of crew or payload. It remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful rocket ever brought to operational status and still holds the record for heaviest payload launched and heaviest payload capacity to Low Earth orbit (LEO).
The largest production model of the Saturn family of rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of Wernher von Braun and Arthur Rudolph at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors. Von Braun's design was based in part on his work on the Aggregate series of rockets, especially the A-10, A-11, and A-12, in Germany during World War II.
To date, the Saturn V is the only launch vehicle to transport human beings beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon, three of them twice, in the four years spanning December 1968 through December 1972.
Historical background.
The origins of the Saturn V rocket begin with the US government bringing Wernher von Braun along with about seven hundred German rocket engineers and technicians to the United States in Operation Paperclip, a program authorized by President Truman in August 1946 with the purpose of harvesting Germany's rocket expertise, to give the US an edge in the Cold War through development of intermediate-range (IRBM) and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). It was known that America's rival, the Soviet Union, would also try to harvest some of the Germans.
Von Braun was put into the rocket design division of the Army due to his direct involvement in the creation of the V-2 rocket. Between 1945 and 1958, his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind the V-2 to the American engineers. Despite Von Braun's many articles on the future of space rocketry, the US Government continued funding Air Force and Navy rocket programs to test their Vanguard missiles despite numerous costly failures. It was not until the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik atop an R-7 ICBM capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead to the US, that the Army and the government started taking serious steps towards putting Americans in space. Finally, they turned to von Braun and his team, who during these years created and experimented with the Jupiter series of rockets. The Juno I was the rocket that launched the first American satellite in January 1958, and part of the last-ditch plan for NACA (the predecessor of NASA) to get its foot in the Space Race. The Jupiter series was one more step in von Braun's journey to the Saturn V, later calling that first series "an infant Saturn".
Saturn development.
The Saturn V's design stemmed from the designs of the Jupiter series rockets. As the success of the Jupiter series became evident, the Saturn series emerged.
C-1 to C-4.
Between 1960 and 1962, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) designed a series of Saturn rockets that could be used for various Earth orbit or lunar missions.
The C-1 was developed into the Saturn I, and the C-2 rocket was dropped early in the design process in favor of the C-3, which was intended to use two F-1 engines on its first stage, four J-2 engines for its second stage, and an S-IV stage, using six RL-10 engines.
NASA planned to use the C-3 as part of the Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) concept, with at least four or five launches needed for a single lunar mission. But MSFC was already planning an even bigger rocket, the C-4, which would use four F-1 engines on its first stage, an enlarged C-3 second stage, and the S-IVB, a stage with a single J-2 engine, as its third stage. The C-4 would need only two launches to carry out an EOR lunar mission.
C-5.
On January 10, 1962, NASA announced plans to build the C-5. The three-stage rocket would consist of five F-1 engines for the first stage, five J-2 engines for the second stage, and a single, additional J-2 engine for the third stage. The C-5 was designed for the higher payload capacity necessary for a lunar mission, and could carry up to to the Moon.
The C-5 would undergo component testing even before the first model was constructed. The rocket's third stage would be utilized as the second stage for the C-IB, which would serve both to demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility for the C-5, but would also provide flight data critical to the continued development of the C-5. Rather than undergoing testing for each major component, the C-5 would be tested in an "all-up" fashion, meaning that the first test flight of the rocket would include complete versions of all three stages. By testing all components at once, far fewer test flights would be required before a manned launch.
The C-5 was confirmed as NASA's choice for the Apollo Program in early 1963, and was given a new name—the Saturn V.
The C-1 became the Saturn I, and C-1B became Saturn IB. Von Braun headed a team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in building a vehicle capable of launching a crewed spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon. Before they moved under NASA's jurisdiction, von Braun's team had already begun work on improving the thrust, creating a less complex operating system, and designing better mechanical systems. It was during these revisions that the decision to reject the single engine of the V-2's design came about, and the team moved to a multiple-engine design. The Saturn I and IB reflected these changes, but still did not have the potential to send a crewed spacecraft to the moon. These designs, however, provided a basis for which NASA could determine its best method towards landing a man on the moon.
The Saturn V's final design had several key design features. Engineers determined that the best engines were the F-1s coupled with the new liquid hydrogen propulsion system called J-2, which made the Saturn C-5 configuration optimal. By 1962, NASA had finalized its plans to proceed with von Braun's Saturn designs, and the Apollo space program gained speed.
With the configuration finalized, NASA turned its attention to mission profiles. Despite some controversy, a lunar orbit rendezvous for the lunar module was chosen over an Earth orbital rendezvous. Issues such as type of fuel injections, the needed amount of fuel for such a trip, and rocket manufacturing processes were ironed out, and the designs for the Saturn V were selected. The rocket was to be built in three sections from the bottom up: SI-C, S-II, and S-IVB. Each section was designed by von Braun in Huntsville and built by outside contractors such as Boeing, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft, and IBM.
Selection for Apollo lunar landing.
Early in the planning process, NASA considered three leading ideas for the Moon mission: Earth Orbit Rendezvous, Direct Ascent, and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR). A direct ascent configuration would launch a larger rocket which would land directly on the lunar surface, while an Earth orbit rendezvous would launch two smaller spacecraft which would combine in Earth orbit. A LOR mission would involve a single rocket launching a single spacecraft, but only a small part of that spacecraft would land on the moon. That smaller landing module would then rendezvous with the main spacecraft, and the crew would return home.
NASA at first dismissed LOR as a riskier option, given that an orbital rendezvous had yet to be performed in Earth orbit, much less in lunar orbit. Several NASA officials, including Langley Research Center engineer John Houbolt and NASA Administrator George Low, argued that a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous provided the simplest landing on the moon, the most cost–efficient launch vehicle and, perhaps most importantly, the best chance to accomplish a lunar landing within the decade. Other NASA officials were convinced, and LOR was officially selected as the mission configuration for the Apollo program on 7 November 1962.
Technology.
The Saturn V's size and payload capacity dwarfed all other previous rockets which had successfully flown at that time. With the Apollo spacecraft on top it stood tall and without fins it was in diameter. Fully fueled, the Saturn V weighed 6.5 million pounds (3,000 metric tons) and had a payload capacity of to LEO. Comparatively, at , the Saturn V is 58 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty from the ground to the torch, and 48 feet taller than the Big Ben clock tower.
In contrast, the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle used on Freedom 7, the first manned American spaceflight, was just under longer than the S-IVB stage, and delivered less sea level thrust () than the Launch Escape System rocket ( sea level thrust) mounted atop the Apollo command module.
Saturn V was principally designed by the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, although numerous major systems, including propulsion, were designed by subcontractors. It used the powerful new F-1 and J-2 rocket engines for propulsion. When tested, these engines shattered the windows of nearby houses. Designers decided early on to attempt to use as much technology from the Saturn I program as possible. Consequently, the S-IVB-500 third stage of the Saturn V was based on the S-IVB-200 second stage of the Saturn IB. The Instrument Unit that controlled the Saturn V shared characteristics with that carried by the Saturn IB.
Blueprints and other Saturn V plans are available on microfilm at the Marshall Space Flight Center.
Stages.
The Saturn V consisted of three stages—the S-IC first stage, S-II second stage and the S-IVB third stage—and the instrument unit. All three stages used liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. The first stage used RP-1 for fuel, while the second and third stages used liquid hydrogen (LH2). The upper stages also used small solid-fueled ullage motors that helped to separate the stages during the launch, and to ensure that the liquid propellants were in a proper position to be drawn into the pumps.
S-IC first stage.
The S-IC was built by The Boeing Company at the Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans, where Space Shuttle External Tanks would later be built by Lockheed Martin. Most of its mass of over two thousand metric tonnes at launch was propellant, in this case RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer with a fuel efficiency of just under 5 inches per US gallon (just under 4 cm per liter) overall. It was tall and in diameter, and provided over of thrust to get the rocket through the first of ascent. The S-IC stage had a dry weight of about and fully fueled at launch had a total weight of . The initial design included four F-1 engines, which provided just enough force to lift the spacecraft and rocket. A fifth F-1 engine was added in the center of a quincunx to provide additional thrust to accommodate the growing weight of the Apollo payload. That center engine was fixed, while the four outer engines could be hydraulically turned (gimballed) to control the rocket. In flight, the center engine was turned off about 26 seconds earlier than the outboard engines to limit acceleration. During launch, the S-IC fired its engines for 168 seconds (ignition occurred about 7 seconds before liftoff) and at engine cutoff, the vehicle was at an altitude of about , was downrange about , and was moving about .
S-II second stage.
The S-II was built by North American Aviation at Seal Beach, California. Using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, it had five J-2 engines in a similar arrangement to the S-IC, also using the outer engines for control. The S-II was tall with a diameter of , identical to the S-IC, and thus was the largest cryogenic stage until the launch of the STS. The S-II had a dry weight of about and fully fueled, weighed . The second stage accelerated the Saturn V through the upper atmosphere with of thrust (in vacuum). When loaded, significantly more than 90 percent of the mass of the stage was propellant; however, the ultra-lightweight design had led to two failures in structural testing. Instead of having an intertank structure to separate the two fuel tanks as was done in the S-IC, the S-II used a common bulkhead that was constructed from both the top of the LOX tank and bottom of the LH2 tank. It consisted of two aluminum sheets separated by a honeycomb structure made of phenolic resin. This bulkhead had to insulate against the 126 °F (70 °C) temperature gradient between the two tanks. The use of a common bulkhead saved . Like the S-IC, the S-II was transported by sea.
S-IVB third stage.
The S-IVB was built by the Douglas Aircraft Company at Huntington Beach, California. It had one J-2 engine and used the same fuel as the S-II. The S-IVB used a common bulkhead to insulate the two tanks. It was tall with a diameter of and was also designed with high mass efficiency, though not quite as aggressively as the S-II. The S-IVB had a dry weight of about and, fully fueled, weighed about .
The S-IVB-500 model used on the Saturn V differed from the S-IVB-200 used as the second stage of the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.
The S-IVB was the only rocket stage of the Saturn V small enough to be transported by plane, in this case the Pregnant Guppy.
Instrument Unit.
The Instrument Unit was built by IBM and rode atop the third stage. It was constructed at the Space Systems Center in Huntsville, Alabama. This computer controlled the operations of the rocket from just before liftoff until the S-IVB was discarded. It included guidance and telemetry systems for the rocket. By measuring the acceleration and vehicle attitude, it could calculate the position and velocity of the rocket and correct for any deviations.
Range safety.
In the event of an abort requiring the destruction of the rocket, the range safety officer would remotely shut down the engines and after several seconds send another command for the shaped explosive charges attached to the outer surfaces of the rocket to detonate. These would make cuts in fuel and oxidizer tanks to disperse the fuel quickly and to minimize mixing. The pause between these actions would give time for the crew to escape using the Launch Escape Tower or (in the later stages of the flight) the propulsion system of the Service module. A third command, "safe", was used after the S-IVB stage reached orbit to irreversibly deactivate the self-destruct system. The system was also inactive as long as the rocket was still on the launch pad.
Comparisons.
The Soviet counterpart of the Saturn V was the N-1 rocket. The Saturn V was taller, heavier and had greater payload capacity, while the N-1 had more liftoff thrust and a larger first stage diameter. The N1 never became operational; four test launches each resulted in catastrophic vehicle failure early in flight, and the program was canceled. The first stage of Saturn V used five powerful engines rather than the 30 smaller engines of the N-1. During two launches, Apollo 6 and Apollo 13, the Saturn V was able to recover from engine loss incidents. The N-1 likewise was designed to compensate for engine loss, but the system never successfully saved a launch from failure.
The three-stage Saturn V had a peak thrust of at least (SA-510 and subsequent) and a lift capacity of 118,000 kg to LEO. The SA-510 mission (Apollo 15) had a liftoff thrust of . The SA-513 mission (Skylab) had slightly greater liftoff thrust of . By comparison, the N-1 had a sea-level liftoff thrust of about . No other operational launch vehicle has ever surpassed the Saturn V in height, weight, or payload capability. The closest contenders were the US Space Shuttle and the Soviet Energia.
The Space Shuttle generated a peak thrust of , and payload capacity to LEO (excluding the Orbiter itself) was , which was about 25 percent of the Saturn V's payload. Total mass in orbit, including the Orbiter, was about , compared to the Apollo 15 total orbital mass of the S-IVB third stage and Apollo spacecraft, of .
Energia had the same liftoff thrust as SA-513, . The Energia flew twice in 1987 and 1988, and was planned as the launcher for the Buran shuttle. However, the Energia and Buran programs were cancelled in 1993. Hypothetical future versions of Energia might have been significantly more powerful than the Saturn V, delivering of thrust and able to deliver up to to LEO in the "Vulkan" configuration. Planned uprated versions of the Saturn V using F-1A engines would have had about 18 percent more thrust and payload. NASA contemplated building larger members of the Saturn family, such as the Saturn C-8, and also unrelated rockets, such as Nova, but these were never produced.
Some other recent US launch vehicles have significantly lower launch capacity to LEO than Saturn V: the US Delta 4 Heavy capacity is , the Atlas V 551 has a capacity of , and the planned SpaceX Falcon Heavy has a projected capacity. The European Ariane 5 ES delivers up to and the Russian Proton-M can launch .
S-IC thrust comparisons.
Because of its large size, attention is often focused on the S-IC thrust and how this compares to other large rockets. However, several factors make such comparisons more complex than first appears:
Without knowing the exact measurement technique and mathematical method used to determine thrust for each different rocket, comparisons are often inexact. As the above shows, the specified thrust often differs significantly from actual flight thrust calculated from direct measurements. The thrust stated in various references is often not adequately qualified as to vacuum vs sea level, or peak vs average thrust.
Similarly, payload increases are often achieved in later missions independent of engine thrust. This is by weight reduction or trajectory reshaping.
The result is there is no single absolute figure for engine thrust, stage thrust or vehicle payload. There are specified values and actual flight values, and various ways of measuring and deriving those actual flight values.
The performance of each Saturn V launch was extensively analyzed and a Launch Evaluation Report produced for each mission, including a thrust/time graph for each vehicle stage on each mission.
Assembly.
After the construction and ground testing of a stage was completed, it was then shipped to the Kennedy Space Center. The first two stages were so large that the only way to transport them was by barge. The S-IC, constructed in New Orleans, was transported down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. After rounding Florida, it was then transported up the Intra-Coastal Waterway to the Vertical Assembly Building (now called the Vehicle Assembly Building). This was essentially same route which would be used later by NASA to ship Space Shuttle External Tanks. The S-II was constructed in California and thus traveled to Florida via the Panama Canal. The third stage and Instrument Unit could be carried by the Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy, but could also have been carried by barge if warranted.
On arrival at the Vertical Assembly Building, each stage was checked out in a horizontal position before being moved to a vertical position. NASA also constructed large spool-shaped structures that could be used in place of stages if a particular stage was late. These spools had the same height and mass and contained the same electrical connections as the actual stages.
NASA "stacked" or assembled the Saturn V on a Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP), which consisted of a Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) with nine swing arms (including the crew access arm), a "hammerhead" crane, and a water suppression system which was activated prior to launch. After assembly was completed, the entire stack was moved from the VAB to the launch pad using the Crawler Transporter (CT). Built by the Marion Power Shovel company (and later used for transporting the smaller and lighter Space Shuttle), the CT ran on four double-tracked treads, each with 57 'shoes'. Each shoe weighed 900 kg (2,000 lb). This transporter was also required to keep the rocket level as it traveled the to the launch site, especially at the 3 percent grade encountered at the launch pad. The CT also carried the Mobile Service Structure (MSS), which allowed technicians access to the rocket until eight hours before launch, when it was moved to the "halfway" point on the Crawlerway (the junction between the VAB and the two launch pads).
Lunar mission launch sequence.
The Saturn V carried all Apollo lunar missions. All Saturn V missions launched from Launch Complex 39 at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After the rocket cleared the launch tower, flight control transferred to Johnson Space Center's Mission Control in Houston, Texas.
An average mission used the rocket for a total of just 20 minutes. Although Apollo 6 experienced three engine failures, and Apollo 13 one engine shutdown, the onboard computers were able to compensate by burning the remaining engines longer to achieve parking orbit. None of the Saturn V launches resulted in a payload loss.
S-IC sequence.
The first stage burned for about 2 minutes and 41 seconds, lifting the rocket to an altitude of and a speed of and burning of propellant.
At 8.9 seconds before launch, the first stage ignition sequence started. The center engine ignited first, followed by opposing outboard pairs at 300-millisecond intervals to reduce the structural loads on the rocket. When thrust had been confirmed by the onboard computers, the rocket was "soft-released" in two stages: first, the hold-down arms released the rocket, and second, as the rocket began to accelerate upwards, it was slowed by tapered metal pins pulled through dies for half a second. Once the rocket had lifted off, it could not safely settle back down onto the pad if the engines failed. The astronauts considered this one of the tensest moments in riding the Saturn V, for "if" the rocket did fail to lift off after release they had a low chance of survival given the large amounts of propellant. A fully fueled Saturn V exploding on the pad would have released two kilotons of energy. To improve the odds, the Saturn Emergency Detection System (EDS) inhibited engine shutdown for the first 30 seconds of flight. (See Saturn V Instrument Unit)
It took about 12 seconds for the rocket to clear the tower. During this time, it yawed 1.25 degrees away from the tower to ensure adequate clearance despite adverse winds. (This yaw, although small, can be seen in launch photos taken from the east or west.) At an altitude of the rocket rolled to the correct flight azimuth and then gradually pitched down until 38 seconds after second stage ignition. This pitch program was set according to the prevailing winds during the launch month. The four outboard engines also tilted toward the outside so that in the event of a premature outboard engine shutdown the remaining engines would thrust through the rocket's center of gravity. The Saturn V reached at over in altitude. Much of the early portion of the flight was spent gaining altitude, with the required velocity coming later. The Saturn V broke the sound barrier at just over 1 minute at an altitude of between 3 and 4 nautical miles. At this point, shock collars, or condensation clouds, could be seen forming around the bottom of the command module and around the top of the second stage.
At about 80 seconds, the rocket experienced maximum dynamic pressure (max "Q"). The dynamic pressure on a rocket varies with air density and the square of relative velocity. Although velocity continues to increase, air density decreases so quickly with altitude that dynamic pressure falls below max "Q".
Acceleration increased during S-IC flight for three reasons. One, increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This was the least important factor, though this feedback effect often led to an undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 engine efficiency increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1 1/4 "g", i.e., the astronauts felt 1 1/4 g while the rocket accelerated vertically at 1/4 g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4 g at T+135 seconds.
It would have increased further except that at 135 seconds the inboard (center) engine shut down to prevent it. Acceleration then resumed its increase, again reaching nearly 4 g on the remaining 4 engines when oxidizer and/or fuel depletion was sensed in the suction assemblies. First stage separation occurred a little less than one second after cutoff to allow for F-1 thrust tail-off. Eight small solid fuel separation motors backed the S-IC from the interstage at an altitude of about . The first stage continued ballistically to an altitude of about and then fell in the Atlantic Ocean about downrange.
S-II sequence.
After S-IC separation, the S-II second stage burned for 6 minutes and propelled the craft to and 15,647 mph (25,182 km/h– 7.00 km/s), close to orbital velocity.
For the first two unmanned launches, eight solid-fuel ullage motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the S-II stage, followed by start of the five J-2 engines. For the first seven manned Apollo missions only four ullage motors were used on the S-II, and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches. About 30 seconds after first stage separation, the interstage ring dropped from the second stage. This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage, only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them. Shortly after interstage separation the Launch Escape System was also jettisoned. See Apollo abort modes for more information about the various abort modes that could have been used during a launch.
About 90 seconds before the second stage cutoff, the center engine shut down to reduce longitudinal pogo oscillations. At around this time, the LOX flow rate decreased, changing the mix ratio of the two propellants, ensuring that there would be as little propellant as possible left in the tanks at the end of second stage flight. This was done at a predetermined delta-v.
Five level sensors in the bottom of each S-II propellant tank were armed during S-II flight, allowing any two to trigger S-II cutoff and staging when they were uncovered. One second after the second stage cut off it separated and several seconds later the third stage ignited. Solid fuel retro-rockets mounted on the interstage at the top of the S-II fired to back it away from the S-IVB. The S-II impacted about from the launch site.
On the Apollo 13 mission, the inboard engine suffered from major pogo oscillation, resulting in an early automatic cutoff. To ensure sufficient velocity was reached, the remaining four engines were kept active for longer than planned. A pogo suppressor was fitted to later Apollo missions to avoid this, though the early engine 5 cutoff remained to reduce G-forces.
S-IVB sequence.
Unlike the two-plane separation of the S-IC and S-II, the S-II and S-IVB stages separated with a single step. Although it was constructed as part of the third stage, the interstage remained attached to the second stage.
During Apollo 11, a typical lunar mission, the third stage burned for about 2.5 minutes until first cutoff at 11 minutes 40 seconds. At this point it was   downrange and in a parking orbit at an altitude of   and velocity of 17,432 mph. The third stage remained attached to the spacecraft while it orbited the Earth two and a half times while astronauts and mission controllers prepared for translunar injection (TLI).
This parking orbit was quite low by Earth orbit standards, and it would have been short-lived due to aerodynamic drag. This was not a problem on a lunar mission because of the short stay in the parking orbit. The S-IVB also continued to thrust at a low level by venting gaseous hydrogen, to keep propellants settled in their tanks and prevent gaseous cavities from forming in propellant feed lines. This venting also maintained safe pressures as liquid hydrogen boiled off in the fuel tank. This venting thrust easily exceeded aerodynamic drag.
For the final three Apollo flights, the temporary parking orbit was even lower (approximately ), to increase payload for these missions. The Apollo 9 Earth orbit mission was launched into the nominal orbit consistent with Apollo 11, but the spacecraft were able to use their own engines to raise the perigee high enough to sustain the 10-day mission. The Skylab was launched into a quite different orbit, with a perigee which sustained it for six years, and also a higher inclination to the equator (50 degrees versus 32.5 degrees for Apollo).
On Apollo 11, TLI came at 2 hours and 44 minutes after launch. The S-IVB burned for almost six minutes giving the spacecraft a velocity close to the Earth's escape velocity of 11.2 km/s (40,320 km/h; 25,053 mph). This gave an energy-efficient transfer to lunar orbit with the moon helping to capture the spacecraft with a minimum of CSM fuel consumption.
About 40 minutes after TLI the Apollo Command Service Module (CSM) separated from the third stage, turned 180 degrees and docked with the Lunar Module (LM) that rode below the CSM during launch. The CSM and LM separated from the spent third stage 50 minutes later. This process is known as Transposition, docking, and extraction.
If it were to remain on the same trajectory as the spacecraft, the S-IVB could have presented a collision hazard so its remaining propellants were vented and the auxiliary propulsion system fired to move it away. For lunar missions before Apollo 13, the S-IVB was directed toward the moon's trailing edge in its orbit so that the moon would slingshot it beyond earth escape velocity and into solar orbit. From Apollo 13 onwards, controllers directed the S-IVB to hit the Moon. Seismometers left behind by previous missions detected the impacts, and the information helped map the inside of the Moon.
Apollo 9 was a special case; although it was an earth orbital mission, after spacecraft separation its S-IVB was fired out of earth orbit into a solar orbit.
On September 3, 2002, astronomer Bill Yeung discovered a suspected asteroid, which was given the discovery designation J002E3. It appeared to be in orbit around the Earth, and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide, which was a major constituent of the paint used on the Saturn V. Calculation of orbital parameters identified the apparent asteroid as being the Apollo 12 S-IVB stage. Mission controllers had planned to send Apollo 12's S-IVB into solar orbit, but the burn after separating from the Apollo spacecraft lasted too long, and hence it did not pass close enough to the Moon, remaining in a barely stable orbit around the Earth and Moon. In 1971, through a series of gravitational perturbations, it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly captured Earth orbit 31 years later. It left Earth orbit again in June 2003. Another near-earth object, discovered in 2006 and designated 6Q0B44E, may also be part of an Apollo spacecraft.
Skylab.
In 1965, the Apollo Applications Program (AAP) was created to look into science missions that could be performed using Apollo hardware. Much of the planning centered on the idea of a space station. Wernher von Braun's earlier (1964) plans employed a "wet workshop" concept, with a spent S-II Saturn V second stage being launched into orbit and outfitted in space. The next year AAP studied a smaller station using an S-IVB Saturn 1B second stage. By 1969, Apollo funding cuts eliminated the possibility of procuring more Apollo hardware, and in fact forced the cancellation of some later Moon landing flights. This freed up at least one Saturn V, allowing the wet workshop to be replaced with the "dry workshop" concept: the station (now known as "Skylab") would be built on the ground from a surplus Saturn IB second stage and launched on the first two live stages of a Saturn V. A backup station, constructed from a Saturn V third stage, was built and is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum.
Skylab was the only launch not directly related to the Apollo lunar landing program. The only significant changes to the Saturn V from the Apollo configurations involved some modification to the S-II to act as the terminal stage for inserting the Skylab payload into Earth orbit, and to vent excess propellant after engine cutoff so the spent stage would not rupture in orbit. The S-II remained in orbit for almost two years, and made an uncontrolled re-entry on January 11, 1975.
Three crews lived aboard Skylab from May 25, 1973 to February 8, 1974, with Skylab remaining in orbit until July 11, 1979.
Proposed post-Apollo developments.
After Apollo, the Saturn V was planned to be the prime launch vehicle for Prospector intended to deliver a 330 kg robotic rover on the Moon similar to Lunokhod and the "Voyager" Mars probes, as well an upscaled version of the "Voyager" interplanetary probes. It was also to have been the launch vehicle for the nuclear rocket stage RIFT test program and the later NERVA. All of these planned uses of the Saturn V were cancelled, with cost being a major factor. Edgar Cortright, who had been director of NASA Langley, stated decades later that "JPL never liked the big approach. They always argued against it. I probably was the leading proponent in using the Saturn V, and I lost. Probably very wise that I lost."
The (canceled) second production run of Saturn Vs would very likely have used the F-1A engine in its first stage, providing a substantial performance boost. Other likely changes would have been the removal of the fins (which turned out to provide little benefit when compared to their weight); a stretched S-IC first stage to support the more powerful F-1As; and uprated J-2s or a M-1 (rocket engine) for the upper stages.
A number of alternate Saturn vehicles were proposed based on the Saturn V, ranging from the Saturn INT-20 with an S-IVB stage and interstage mounted directly onto an S-IC stage, through to the Saturn V-23(L) which would not only have five F-1 engines in the first stage, but also four strap-on boosters with two F-1 engines each: giving a total of thirteen F-1 engines firing at launch.
The Space Shuttle was initially conceived of as a cargo transport to be used in concert with the Saturn V, even to the point that a Saturn-Shuttle was proposed, using the winged shuttle orbiter and external tank, but with the tank mounted on a modified, fly-back version of the S-IC. The first S-IC stage would be used to power the Shuttle during the first two minutes of flight, after which the S-IC would be jettisoned (which would then fly back to KSC for refurbishment) and the Space Shuttle Main Engines would then fire and place the orbiter into orbit. The Shuttle would handle space station logistics, while Saturn V would launch components. Lack of a second Saturn V production run killed this plan and has left the United States without a heavy-lift launch vehicle. Some in the U.S. space community have come to lament this situation, as continued production would have allowed the International Space Station, using a Skylab or Mir configuration with both U.S. and Russian docking ports, to have been lifted with just a handful of launches. The Saturn-Shuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space shuttle solid rocket boosters that ultimately precipitated the "Challenger" accident in 1986.
Proposed successors.

U.S. proposals for a rocket larger than the Saturn V from the late 1950s through the early 1980s were generally called Nova. Over thirty different large rocket proposals carried the Nova name, but none were developed.
Wernher von Braun and others also had plans for a rocket that would have featured eight F-1 engines, like the Saturn C-8, in its first stage allowing it to launch a manned spacecraft on a direct ascent flight to the Moon. Other plans for the Saturn V called for using a Centaur as an upper stage or adding strap-on boosters. These enhancements would have increased its ability to send large unmanned spacecraft to the outer planets or manned spacecraft to Mars. Other Saturn-V derivatives analyzed, included the Saturn MLV concept family of "Modified Launch Vehicles", which would have almost doubled the payload lift capability of the standard Saturn V, and was intended for use in a proposed manned mission to Mars by 1980.
Another Saturn-V potential derivative included the use of a solid nuclear thermal rocket engine, a number of which were successfully ground tested, and which was intended for the third stage of the vehicle; this rocket was designated Saturn C-5N, and was studied by Boeing in 1968. This would carry a considerably higher payload to interplanetary destinations than the all chemical version of the Saturn V, and was also being studied for a manned mission to Mars by 1980, however then-President Richard Nixon ended work on the engines in 1973, along with all Saturn V ELVs, in government budget cuts.
In 2006, as part of the cancelled Constellation Program that would have replaced the Space Shuttle, NASA unveiled plans to construct the heavy-lift Ares V rocket, a Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle using some existing Space Shuttle and Saturn V infrastructure. Named in homage of the Saturn V, the original design, based on the Space Shuttle External Tank, was tall, and powered by five Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) and two uprated five-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), while a modified variation would be used for the crew-launched Ares I rocket. Safety would be increased by having each vehicle be specialized for different tasks, keeping cargo and crew services separate. As the design evolved, the Ares V was slightly modified, with the same diameter as that of the Saturn V's S-IC and S-II stages, and in place of the five SSMEs, five RS-68 rocket engines, the same engines used on the Delta IV EELV, would be used. The switch from the SSME to the RS-68 was due to the steep price of the SSME, as that it would be thrown away along with the Ares V core stage after each use, while the RS-68 engine, which is expendable, is cheaper, simpler to manufacture, and more powerful than the SSME.
In 2008, NASA again redesigned the Ares V, lengthening and widening the core stage and added an extra RS-68 engine, giving the first stage core of the launch vehicle a total of six engines. The six RS-68B engines, during launch, would have been augmented by two "5.5-segment" SRBs instead of the original five-segment designs, although no decision was made on the number of segments NASA would have used on the final design. If the six RS-68B/5.5-segment SRB variant had been used, the vehicle would have had a total of approximately of thrust at liftoff, making it more powerful than the Saturn V or the Soviet/Russian Energia boosters, but less than 50–43 MN for the Soviet N-1. An upper stage, known as the Earth Departure Stage and based on the S-IVB, would have utilized a more advanced version of the J-2 engine known as the "J-2X," and would have placed the Altair lunar landing vehicle into a low earth orbit. At tall and with the capability of placing 180 metric tons into low Earth orbit, the Ares V would have surpassed the Saturn V and the two Soviet/Russian super-heavy lift vehicles in both height, lift, and launch capability.
The RS-68B engines, based on the current RS-68 and RS-68A engines built by the Rocketdyne Division of Pratt and Whitney (formerly under the ownerships of Boeing and Rockwell International), produce less than half the thrust per engine as the Saturn V's F-1 engines, but are more efficient and can be throttled up or down, much like the SSMEs on the Shuttle, and as with the Shuttle, the SRBs of the Ares V would have produced the majority of the lift off thrust. The J-2 engine, used in the Saturn V S-II and S-IVB stages, would have been modified into the improved J-2X for use both, on the Ares V Earth Departure Stage (EDS) as well as on the second stage of the proposed Ares I. Both the EDS and the Ares I second stage would have used a single J-2X motor, although the EDS was originally designed to use two motors until the redesign employing the five (later six) RS-68Bs in place of the five SSMEs.
In September 2011, NASA announced the Space Launch System (SLS) as the United States' new heavy-lift rocket for manned deep-space exploration, and which will be comparable in size and capabilities to the Saturn V. The new SLS, similar to the Saturn V and Ares IV concept that directly preceded it, is both a cargo and crew carrier. It has an upper-stage powered by a J2-X engine derived from the Saturn V launch vehicle, the first stage powered by five liquid-fueled rocket engines derived from the Space Shuttle's main engines, along with two strap-on SRBs also derived from the Shuttle program. The initial configuration of the new heavy lift vehicle as proposed by NASA could lift approximately 70 metric tons to low earth orbit, with later "Block II" variants with advanced SRBs possibly lifting up to 130 metric tons.
In 2012, it was noted if a derivative of the F-1 was integrated as a Liquid rocket booster (LRB) in the SLS Block II, the payload could be 150 metric tons to low earth orbit, 20 metric tons higher than that of the planned SLS Block II lifted by SRBs. In 2013, it was reported that the F-1B engine is to have improved efficiency, thrust, be more cost effective with a simplified combustion chamber, and have fewer engine parts. Each F-1B is to produce of thrust at sea level, an increase over the approximate of thrust achieved by the mature Apollo 15 F-1 engine.
NASA SLS deputy project manager Jody Singer of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, in 2012 stated that the vehicle will have a launch cost of approximately $500 million per launch, with a relatively minor dependence of costs on launch capability.
Cost.
From 1964 until 1973, a total of $6.5 billion ($ billion present day) was appropriated for the Saturn V, with the maximum being in 1966 with $1.2 billion ($ billion present day).
One of the main reasons for the cancellation of the Apollo program was the cost. In 1966, NASA received its biggest budget of US$4.5 billion, about 0.5 percent of the Gross domestic product(GDP) of the United States at that time. In 1969, the cost of a Saturn V including launch was US $ 185 million (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ).

John Baptist Medina

Sir John Baptist Medina or John Baptiste de Medina (1659 – 5 October 1710) was an artist of Flemish-Spanish origin who worked in England and Scotland, mostly as a portrait painter, though he was also the first illustrator of "Paradise Lost" by John Milton in 1688.
Life and portrait-painting.
Medina was the son of a Spanish army captain posted to Brussels, where he was born and later trained by François Duchatel, before coming to London in 1686 and setting up his studio in Drury Lane. Even in London he seems to have specialized in Scottish sitters, and in either 1688–89 or 1694 he moved to Edinburgh, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was encouraged and sponsored by the Earl of Melville, who he painted in London. From 1689 Melville, like many of Medina's subjects a strong Whig, was Secretary of State for Scotland, effectively running the country for the King in London. With little competition, Medina was the most prominent Scottish portraitist for the rest of his life, charging £5 for a head and £10 for a half-length.
His best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh; these are invariably compared to the "Kit Cat Club" series in London by Sir Godfrey Kneller. His style follows the conventions of Kneller, but his portraits are often more relaxed and informal, favouring relatively bright blues and rose-reds in the clothing, and dark backgrounds. The quality of the painting can vary considerably, probably reflecting the use of his assistants. In 1706 he was knighted, one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created before the Acts of Union 1707. Medina died at Edinburgh in 1710. He trained his son and the more talented William Aikman, the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation.
The Scottish National Portrait Gallery has a representative ten works, including another self-portrait, and most of his paintings remain in Scotland — there are none, for example, in the National Portrait Gallery, London.
Illustrations to "Paradise Lost".
Although he appears to have painted other types of work than portraits, the only works other than portraits known to survive are his eight (out of a total of twelve plates prefacing each book of the poem) engraved book illustrations for the fourth edition, the first to be illustrated, of "Paradise Lost" by John Milton, published in London by Jacob Tonson in 1688. Though they have been described, perhaps rather unfairly, as "stiff and archaic", these follow Milton's text carefully, unlike those of the artists used for the other prints, and usually include several different episodes in each illustration. Appropriately, Medina drew on traditional Biblical iconography, carefully and imaginatively adapting it to fit Milton's text. Medina's designs preface Books 3 and 5 to 11; the plates were engraved from his designs by a specialist, Michael Burghers (also Burgese or Burgess), a Flemish engraver working in Oxford, who signed all but one plate as the engraver. They were still being used, in rather worn-out condition, for the sixth edition of 1695.
The exact authorship of some plates is a matter of dispute. Purely based on the interpretation of a hand-written note attributed to Horace Walpole in the New York City Public Library copy of the book, Henry Aldrich, an Oxford don of diverse talents, but not otherwise known as an artist, has been identified as the unknown artist of some plates, usually Books I, II and XII. Bernard Lens II, otherwise known as a painter of enamels, is signed as the artist for Book IV, and Medina is signed as the artist for one more plate than some say would seem likely to be his on stylistic grounds.

American Foundry Society

The American Foundry Society traces its roots to 1896 when the American Foundrymen's Association was formed. The Association was subsequently named The American Foundrymen's Society, and later the name was shortened to the American Foundry Society, sometimes shortened to AFS. The society is considered an international organization consisting of 9,000 members across 48 countries, organized into 48 local chapters and 34 student chapters in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The AFS promotes the interests of the foundry industry to the federal government and consists of a professional staff and volunteer committee structure. Activities of the AFS include committee work, education, organization of regional and national conventions and other work in support of the metalcasting industry.
History.
For a number of years prior to the founding of the Society many local bodies of foundrymen met for mutual protection in regards to labor, prices and interchange of technical information. The attendance was usually strong in these organizations in times of prosperity but waned when economic conditions slowed. Early in 1896 the Philadelphia Foundrymen's Society through discussion with its members conceived that a more general, larger benefit might be gained through organizing a wider group of foundrymen. They invited foundrymen from around the country to Philadelphia for a meeting. The response was spontaneous and well received. On May 12, 1896 the American Foundrymen's Association was formed.
Organization.
The Society is organized into 13 Divisions with committees under each division:
In addition to these committees the organization has technical staff to assist with engineering services, a system to support research, and an extensive library.
Local Chapters.
Local Chapters organize educational events and hold chapter meetings, usually at monthly intervals, to promote technical or business subjects related to foundry and the foundry business.

<doc id="20585070" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20585070" title="Priory of St Mary in the Meadow, Beeston Regis">
Priory of St Mary in the Meadow, Beeston Regis

The Priory of St Mary in the Meadow, also known as Beeston Priory is a former Augustinian Priory, located in the village of Beeston Regis, Norfolk, United Kingdom.
History.
The priory was founded in 1216 by Margery de Cressy, and was dedicated to St Mary in the Meadow ("St Mary de Pratis"). Unlike many small houses of the Augustinian Order, Beeston Priory was independent.
The priory's canons served as parish priests for nearby churches, whilst also running a boys' school at the priory for both boarding and day students.
The priory was originally endowed with of land, and was given the rights to wrecks and flotsam and jetsam. Within the monastic precinct there were agricultural buildings and probably a smithy, a brewery, a guest-house, a wash-house, latrines and other buildings necessary for the running of the busy local community.
In 1317, a canon at the priory, John de Walsam, attacked the Bishop (most probably John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich) with a sword. After the matter was referred to Pope John XXII, de Walsam was sent to Rome. As the Bishop had recovered, the pope absolved de Walsam and instructed the Bishop to arrange for him to perform penance.
In 1291 the priory was inspected for tax and was recorded as having an annual value of £25 5s. 10¼d for its possessions in Norfolk, and £2 10s. 10½d for those in Suffolk.
On the 25 August 1494 the priory was visited by James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich. This visit revealed that, although there were other priests present, the Prior, John Poty, was the only canon at the priory, as the other, Thomas Taverner, had gone "absent without leave". Bishop Goldwell instructed Prior Poty to find two new canons as soon as possible.
The abbey was visited again on 18 July 1514, this time by Richard Nykke, Bishop of Norwich. Canon Thomas Taverner was again absent without leave, but was thought to have been in Norwich. The other canons were listed as Canon Nicholas Wodforth, Canon Robins, Canon Daume and Canon Rump. This visit revealed potential financial impropriety as the Prior would not produce the priory's accounts. Other concerns were that the school was not operational, and that matins were not being said at the right time.
Bishop Nykke visited the priory again in August 1532, on the election of Prior Richard Hudson. He found all the accounts and affairs at the priory to be in order.
The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 lists the priory as having an income, after expenses, of £43 2s. 4¾d., and debts of £20. The priory is recorded as being in good repair and was home to the prior and three canons, six boys (boarding at the school) and seven servants. The lead and bells at the priory were valued at £60, more than the annual income of the establishment.
The priory avoided immediate suppression when Prior Richard Hudson and his four canons, Nicholas Wodforth, William Wusbarow, James Fysser, and Robert Swyer accepted King Henry VIII's supremacy over the church. The priory was finally dissolved in 1538, at which time Prior Hudson was awarded an annual pension of £5 (which he was still in receipt of as late as 1553).
The suppression of the Priory and its school left no local provision for education. This is believed to have led Sir John Gresham to found Gresham's School at nearby Holt in 1555.
Writing to Thomas Cromwell in March 1538, Sir Richard Rich said that the Canons at the priory ""pretended themselves to be friars""; several historical documents have picked up on this and mistakenly referred to the priory as a Friary.
The Priory and its possessions were leased by The Crown to John Travers in 1540 before being awarded, in 1545, to Sir Edmund Wyndham and Giles Seafoule.
The site is currently owned and protected by Norfolk County Council, who have opened the ruins to the public.
The Priory ruins today.
Much remains of the main priory church. The ruins indicate that the church nave, from the west wall to the transept, was about long, and wide, having a chancel added later. The north wall of the nave still stands practically to the roof level, although the divisions between the windows have long gone. The chancel, at the eastern end of the ruin, remains to roof height on the north and south side. The original eastern wall has been demolished, but a flint wall has been built up to window-sill level. The north-east corner still has most of its window mouldings.
The cloister, to the south of the nave of the priory church, is now part of the Priory Farm garden. To the east of the cloister, still standing, are part of the walls of the chapter house, and also some traces of the dormitory. The refectory and other domestic buildings probably are beneath or have been incorporated into the 18th century Priory Farmhouse, which was probably built from materials from the demolition of the early buildings.
The belfry tower has gone, although the first steps can be seen in a doorway in the south wall. The south wall is only as high as the window-sill level. The west wall is standing almost intact to gable height, although the lining of the original door has been replaced by modern brickwork.
The north transept is long and wide. The east wall of the transept is entirely gone, except for traces of its junction with the north wall. At the south end of this wall once stood a pillar; the opposite pillar, west of the south door, is almost complete and in a good state of preservation. Also in the transept there is a doorway which leads to what is thought to be a sacristy, and is the only doorway remaining in its original form.
West of the transept there is a small chapel long and wide.
A tunnel is said to run to the Dunstable Arms Inn from the ruins of the priory, but if it ever existed, its whereabouts is a long-forgotten secret.
The site is currently owned and protected by Norfolk County Council, who have opened the ruins to the public.
Priors of Saint Mary's, Beeston Regis.
An incomplete list of Priors of St Mary's Priory:
The last Prior and his four canons all subscribed to the Act of Supremacy 1534 and were granted pensions. Richard Hudson became Rector of Newton Flotman, Norfolk.
The Priory Maze.

Cameron Hepple

Cameron Robert Hepple (born 19 May 1988 in Nassau) is a Bahamian footballer who is currently a unattached
Early career.
Youth, amateur and college.
At 9 years old Hepple was selected for the first Centre of Excellence program created for the Bahamas by English coach Gary White.
After impressing at the U-17 World Cup Qualifiers in Cuba, Hepple was scouted to go on trials in England with fellow Bahamian International Demont Mitchell.
Hepple had trials with Southampton and Wolverhampton Wanderers in England, before going on to play domestically for Bears FC in the Bahamian New Providence Football League at 13 years of age.
Hepple left the Bahamas to play college soccer in the United States in 2005, eventually settling at Bowling Green State University. During his time there he was name to the MAC 2nd team in 2007 and also in 2009.
Club career.
Following his graduation from Bowling Green State University, Hepple signed a two-year contract to play for the Kitsap Pumas of the Premier Development League in April 2010.
Kitsap Pumas.
In his first season with the Pumas Hepple was a regular in the side contributing eight goals and seven assists for the season gaining the honours of Western Conference Team for 2010. The Pumas also qualified for the US Open Cup after winning the first five matches of the season, however they lost in the second round to the Portland Timbers. The Kitsap Pumas ended the season second in the league behind the Portland Timbers U23's, and then went on to lose 2–1 in the play off finals to the Portland Timbers U23's, who continued their success to become the 2010 PDL Champions.
The next day Hepple was on a flight to the Bahamas representing his country in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualifications on 2 July 2011 against Turks and Caicos Islands at the TCIFA National Academy in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos. The Bahamas won the match 4–0, with Hepple tallying an assist to Nesley Jean and a goal.
During the month of June the Bahamian attacker had been receiving various enquires from clubs including some from Europe where Hepple would be able to utilise his British citizenship and would not be affected by non-EU quotas and restrictions. After discussing his options with his family, he and his club ultimately decided to sign a deal with the Albanian club KF Tirana the biggest team in the Albanian Superliga. Before signing for Tirana, Hepple also trialed with Varese of Serie B but was not offered a contract.
KF Tirana.
On 5 July 2011, Hepple was sold by the Pumas to KF Tirana of the Albanian Superliga. He arrived in Albania just one day before KF Tirana's UEFA Europa League encounter with Slovakian side Spartak Trnava, following a 32-hour trip from Bahamas to Tirane. He arrived in Tirane in the early hours of Wednesday morning and managed to attend training the same day after just a few hours sleep, where he went on to impress the manager Julián Rubio enough to offer him a place in the starting line-up for the game the very next day. On 14 July 2011, he became the first Bahamian to play in the Europa League, when KF Tirana played Spartak Trnava in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League Second Qualifying Round, KF Tirana tied 0–0 in the first leg and lost in the second leg 3–1 in Trnava on 21 July.
Hepple then played in the Albanian Supercup match on 18 August 2011 against the 2010–11 Superliga champions Skënderbeu Korçë played at Skënderbeu Stadium. The match was postponed 50 minutes due to the KF Tirana supporters being denied access to the stadium, KF Tirana refused to play until their fans were allowed into the stadium. Once the away supporters were allowed to enter the stadium the game then commenced for only 10 minutes before flares were thrown onto the pitch by the entering supporters, thus creating a riot between the fans resulting in the expulsion of the KF Tirana supporters. Riots then broke out on the pitch where fans for the home team Skënderbeu began entering the pitch and throwing rocks at the KF Tirana players forcing them to retreat to their locker room for safety. After crowd settled with police intervention, the match then restarted, KF Tirana won the match 1–0, becoming the first trophy Hepple has won since the start of his professional career.
During the Winter transfer window Hepple executed a clause in his contract which allowed him to leave the club due to unpaid wages, Hepple went on trials with Southend United in the English League 2 where he played a match against Colchester United in a scrimmage and notched a goal. He also was scouted and invited on trials with Championship club Watford FC where he notched an assist against English Premier League side Queens Park Rangers, unfortunately he was not able to secure a long-term contract with the two clubs.
Farnborough.
On 22 March 2012, Hepple signed a contract until the end of the 2012 season with Farnborough of the Conference South division in the English football league system pending international clearance.
Hepple was unable to receive international clearance due to previous club KF Tirana withholding on his ITC due to a FIFA claim against the club in January.
Alcobendas Sport.
On 31 January 2013, Hepple signed a contract with Madrid-based side Alcobendas Sport of the Tercera Division group 7 until the end of the 2013 season. In January and March 2013, Hepple had trials with Queens Park Rangers and Watford, both of high levels in the English football league system, but was not offered a contract despite an early interest from the latter. At the end of the season, Hepple left the club and had trials with clubs from Japan's J. League Division 2. Hepple decided to wait until the January transfer window before deciding on his next club after earning interest from clubs while in Japan. Hepple also expressed interest in Major League Soccer clubs, especially Toronto FC, because he holds a Canadian passport. He had previously generated interest from clubs in Major League Soccer in 2010, at which time he trialed with Seattle Sounders FC and Colorado Rapids.
International.
Hepple is a full international for the Bahamas national football team. He played for the Bahamas U-17 and U-23 teams before making his senior debut in a World Cup qualification match against Dominica in March 2004, when just 15 years old. Hepple has since earned 12 caps, six of those in World Cup qualification games. He scored his first goal for Bahamas in a 4–0 rout of Turks and Caicos in a 2014 qualification game.
Personal.
Hepple has a British father. He also holds a Canadian passport.

Montmorency cherry

The Montmorency cherry is a variety of sour cherry ("Prunus cerasus") grown in the United States, Canada and France, particularly in Michigan and in Door County, Wisconsin. Montmorency cherries are part of the lighter-red Amarelle cultivar of sour cherries, rather than the darker-red Morello cultivar. Michigan produces over 90,000 tons of Montmorency cherries each year.
The tree was named for Montmorency, a valley in France.
The tree produces large, light red fruit (although some trees produce a darker red fruit) and has been cultivated in the United States since at least the early 20th century. It is the most popular sour cherry in the United States and Canada, and is extensively used in cherry pies, as well as in jams and preserves.
Montmorency cherries are also marketed in dried form, and Montmorency cherry juice and juice concentrate is also sold.
Since the early 21st century, the Montmorency cherry has been promoted as a healthful food, due to several purported health benefits.
Due to the high ORAC (oxygen radical absorption capacity) values of Montmorency Cherry, the powdered fruit extracts are also placed in capsules as organic health supplement/vitamins.

Paul Joseph Stankard

Paul Joseph Stankard, considered the father of modern glass paperweights, was born April 7, 1943 as the second of nine children in an Irish Catholic family. He lived in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in his early years. He graduated from Salem Vocational Technical Institute (now Salem Community College) in Salem, New Jersey with a degree in Scientific Glassblowing. For the first ten years of his work career, he worked as a glassblower making scientific instruments for various chemical laboratories.
Stankard, whose driving desire was to "be on the creative side", started producing glass paperweights in his garage while working in industry to support his growing family. It was when Stankard displayed his early paperweights at a craft exhibit on the boardwalk of Atlantic City, New Jersey that Reese Palley, an internationally respected art dealer, saw his work and sponsored Stankard financially to move full-time into making glass art.
In the early 1960s, paperweights made by other American paperweight makers showcased brightly colored "crafty" type flowers that were not botanically accurate. Stankard labored to make his glass floral designs look more natural and botanically lifelike. His glass flowers were so real looking that many people mistakenly thought that he had found a way to encase actual flowers in glass. Soon thereafter, paperweight makers (mostly American) were following Stankard's lead. 
Stankard, who is now an internationally acclaimed artist, is largely credited with changing the status of glass paperweights from that of "craft" to that of "fine art". Among many other museums, Stankard's work is exhibited at The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC; the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York; the Musée des Arts Décoratifs and the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France; the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, England; and The Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York.
In his autobiography, Stankard chronicles his early struggles with dyslexia, which made him score poorly on tests because he couldn't read the test questions. His high school transcripts showed him graduating at the very bottom of his class with a low IQ. In the book, Stankard describes the pressure and stigma of being labeled a slow learner by an educational system that at the time was not aware of dyslexia, and the steps he took to overcome his low self-esteem and learning disabilities to become one of the foremost artists of his generation.

Organ donation taskforce

In December 2006, The UK Government set up the Organ Donation Taskforce to identify barriers to organ donation and recommend actions needed to increase organ donation and procurement within the current legal framework.
The Taskforce was asked to:
Membership.
The ODTF comprised medical professionals, National Health Service managers, patients and patient representatives and ethicists and is chaired by Elisabeth Buggins.
First Taskforce Report.
The ODTF published its first report ‘Organs for Transplants’ on 16 January 2008. [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_082122]
In the report, the Taskforce makes 14 recommendations to the Government, which could see a 50 per cent increase in organ donation in the UK within five years - resulting in an additional 1,200 transplants a year and saving thousands of lives.
The report proposes a radical shift from existing arrangements for the UK’s transplantation system. Together with other measures to improve donor coordination services this could result in a 10% increase in the consent rate for donation (currently at 60%).
Second Taskforce Report.
At the time of launch of the First taskforce report, the UK Prime Minister called for a review of the legislation over consent for organ donation.
The ODTF carried out an investigation and published its second report ‘The potential impact of an opt out system for organ donation in the UK’ on 17 November 2008 [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_090312]
This report provided an in-depth examination of the potential impact of changing to an opt out system of consent for organ donation. It concluded that an opt out system should not be implemented in the UK at the current time.
The Taskforce concluded that there was no convincing evidence that a change to opt out consent would deliver significant increases in the number of donated organs. It felt that such a system has the potential to undermine the concept of donation as a gift, to erode trust in NHS professionals and the Government and negatively impact on organ donation numbers. It concluded a change in consent system would be costly to implement.
It also felt that an opt out consent system would distract attention away from the need to improve the systems and infrastructure around organ donation in the UK and the need to improve awareness and understanding of organ donation.
In putting together the report, the Taskforce had discussions and engagement with academics, health professionals, members of the public, organ recipients, families of donors and faith leaders. The report details the considerable volume of evidence the ODTF considered before coming to its conclusions.
Presumed consent – the current legislative position.
Under Part 1 of the Human Tissue Act 2004, it is unlawful to remove, store, or use human organs and other tissue for scheduled purposes without appropriate consent. The removal, storage and use of an organ for the purpose of transplantation are scheduled purposes in this context.
Appropriate consent is defined within the Act as:
a. If a decision of a deceased person to consent to the activity, or a decision of his not to consent to it, was in force immediately before he had died, his consent.
b. Where such a decision is not in force, then consent is required from either a nominated representative, or, a person in a qualifying relationship (such as next of kin).
The Human Tissue Act 2004 covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 covers Scotland and has broadly similar provisions as far as transplantation is concerned.
Background to the Taskforce's work.
Transplants currently enable about 2,700 people to pursue an active life in the UK every year. Transplants are the best possible treatment for most people with organ failure.
Kidney transplants are the most common organ transplant performed in the UK. Transplants of the heart, liver and lungs are also regularly carried out. As medicine advances, other vital organs including the pancreas and small bowel are also being used in transplants. Tissue such as corneas, heart valves, skin and bone can also be donated.
The increasing effectiveness of transplantation means that many more patients can be considered for treatment in this way but there is a serious shortage of donors. Around 8,000 people in the UK are currently awaiting a transplant. For some people this means waiting, sometime for years, and undergoing difficult and stressful treatment. Many will die before a suitable organ becomes available.
Facts.
3,086 organ transplants were carried out, thanks to the generosity of 1,495 donors.
949 lives were saved in the UK through a heart, lung, liver or combined heart/lungs, liver/kidney, liver/pancreas or heart/kidney transplant.

Fábio Rosa

Fábio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa (Porto Alegre, 1960) is a Brazilian social entrepreneur whose initiatives have focused on rural electrification and the use of renewable energy sources.
Biography.
Rosa attended the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, where he graduated with a degree in agronomic engineering. In 1982, after leaving school, Rosa was invited by a classmate to visit the Palmeras area of the southern Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul. Unbeknownst to Rosa at the time, his colleague's father, Ney Azevedo, was the current mayor of Palmeras and in speaking with Rosa during this visit, Azevedo was so impressed that he offered him the position of secretary of agriculture.
Rural Electrification in Palmeras.
Seeking ways to improve life in the region, Rosa interviewed residents who noted the ongoing economic pressure driving rural flight from Palmeras. Rosa saw that high water costs were a significant impediment for local rice farmers and that lowering these costs could improve productivity and wealth. To address the high water costs, Rosa suggested expanding rural electrification to allow more farmers to drop their own wells for irrigation rather than paying exorbitant fees for water rights held by others.
At the time, 70 percent of rural residents in Palmeras were without electricity. Rosa favored expanding access to electricity through an inexpensive mono-phase electrification system developed by Professor Ennio Amaral of the local Federal Technical School of Pelotas. The use of mono-phase technology reduced the costs for distributing electricity to each of these rural households from $7,000 to $400.
Using this system, Rosa instituted a successful pilot project that took place between 1984 and 1988. In 1988, a new mayor of Palmeras was elected, who ended the program.
Pro Luz.
In 1989, Rosa was named a fellow by and using the organization's stipend, he continued his efforts to expand rural electrification. In 1990, along with colleague Ricardo de Souza Mello, Rosa began work on Pro Luz (Project Light) to expand the Palmeras model throughout Brazil. The program proved successful and the Brazilian government was receptive, even offering a dedicated line of credit for rural electrification programs. However, in 1992, Brazilian economic troubles led the government to reduce social spending on these types of projects. The repeated difficulties Rosa faced working through government led him to focus future efforts through private organizations.
S.T.A..
In 1992, Rosa established Sistemas de Tecnologia Agroelectro (STA) to popularize solar energy. He recognized that the critical barrier to the adoption of solar energy was its high cost. Thus, he worked to make it attractive by pairing it with electric fencing, which could help address Brazil's problems with overgrazing. Within several years STA had installed 700 solar powered fencing systems and Rosa "had gained national recognition as a leader in the delivery of low-cost solar energy".
Recent work.
Rosa left STA in 2001 to expand his work with a non-profit he established called the Instituto Para O Desenvolvimento De Energias Alternativas E Da Auto Sustentabilidade (IDEAAS). IDEAAS was designed to take the basic STA framework and apply it as a nonprofit model in lower income areas.
Through market research and consultation with various experts, Rosa designed two enterprises using solar technology that could work through STA and IDEAAS, respectively: The Sun Shines for All and The Quiron Project. The Sun Shines for All is a for-profit solar energy venture administered through STA that leases comprehensive electrification packages including solar kits and outlets to those without access to the grid. The Quiron Project is a non-profit run through IDEEAS that is designed to improve the well-being of the rural poor in an environmentally responsible manner through solar electrification, improved agricultural management, and conservation.

The Electoral district of Central Hobart, sometimes referred to as Hobart Central, was an electoral district of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It was based in Tasmania's capital city, Hobart.
The seat was created as a single-member seat ahead of the 1871 state election following the dissolution of the multi-member Hobart Town seat. It was abolished at the 1886 election when neighbouring seats absorbed its area and became two-member seats.
The seat was then recreated as a single-member seat at the 1903 state election and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model for the entire state in 1909.

DVTk

DVTk is an Open Source project for testing, validating and diagnosing communication protocols and scenario's in medical environments. It supports DICOM, HL7 and IHE integration profiles. 
History.
The history of DVTk goes back to 1997. Within the ARC group (Architecture Re-use and Communications) of Philips the first version of the Validation Test Suite (VTS) was developed. This was a DICOM Validation tool with a command line interface. Based on this, later on the ADVT (Agfa DICOM Validation Tool) was created. This was the first tool with a Graphical User Interface that made DICOM validation more pleasant.
Because Philips and Agfa wanted to join forces, in 2001 their cooperation became a fact and the first version of DVT (1.2) was born in 2002.
After major redesign and improvements DVT 2.1 was released in June 2005. This version was the transition of the appliation from the Philips-AGFA cooperation project to the Open Source community.
In 2006, ICT Automatisering joined the DVTk Open Source project as the third participating company next to Philips and Agfa.
In 2007, DVTk started participating in the IHE Gazelle project by supplying an External Validation Service (DICOM Validation Web Service). 
In 2008, Services for the DVTk Open Source project were introduced.

He worked in the private company "Gustaf Aspelin" from 1964 to 1962, and in the family business "Ric Bjørn" from 1964 to 1989.

From 1966 he held local leadership in the Socialist People's Party, which later became the Socialist Left Party. He opposed Norwegian membership in the European Union and NATO. Nonetheless, he did favor cooperation with the social democratic Labour Party, both locally as well as in the national Red-Green Coalition.
He was elected to serve in Tromsø municipal council in 1987. Halfway through the term, in 1989, he was elected to represent Troms in the Norwegian Parliament. He was re-elected in 1993 for a second, but final term. After this he served more terms in the municipal council. He finally retired in 2007.
Bjørn was married, and had three children. He died in November 2008, at the University Hospital of North Norway, of cancer.

<doc id="20585666" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20585666" title="Virgin Killer">
Virgin Killer

Virgin Killer is the fourth studio album by the German heavy metal band Scorpions. It was released in 1976 and was the first album of the band to attract attention outside Europe. The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence. The original cover featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, U.S. and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.
In December 2008, the image again gave rise to controversy when the British Internet Watch Foundation placed certain pages from Wikipedia on its internet blacklist, since it considered the image to be "potentially illegal" under the Protection of Children Act 1978. This resulted in much of the UK being prevented from editing Wikipedia, and significant public debate of the decision. The decision was reversed by the IWF after four days of blocking.
Reception.
The success of "Virgin Killer" was similar to other Scorpions albums featuring Uli Jon Roth as lead guitarist; it "failed to attain any serious attention in the United States" but was "quite popular in Japan" where it peaked at number 32 in the charts. The album was another step in the band's shift from psychedelic music to hard rock. Critic Vincent Jeffries of Allmusic contends in hindsight that the album was "the first of four studio releases that really defined the Scorpions and their urgent metallic sound that was to become highly influential." He also counts the title track and "Pictured Life" among the "all-time Scorpions standouts." Among the band members, Uli Jon Roth considers "Virgin Killer" and the previous release "In Trance" as his favourite Scorpions albums.
Cover art.
The original cover art for the album depicted a nude ten-year-old girl, with a shattered glass effect obscuring her genitalia. The image was designed by Steffan Böhle, who was then the product manager for RCA Records. Francis Buchholz was the bassist for the band and, in an interview conducted in early 2007, recollects that the model depicted on the cover was either the daughter or the niece of the cover designer. The photograph was taken by Michael von Gimbut. The band's rhythm guitarist Rudolf Schenker offers the following description of the circumstances behind the album cover:
We didn't actually have the idea. It was the record company. The record company guys were like, 'Even if we have to go to jail, there's no question that we'll release that.' On the song 'Virgin Killer', time is the virgin killer. But then, when we had to do the interviews about it, we said 'Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do.' Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.
In a separate interview, Schenker also notes that he thought the cover art was a "great thing" and that he had "pushed the band to really stay behind it" as he felt that people would "think differently" when they looked at the lyrics and realized that the cover art was only being used as "a symbol of the lyrics." In a 2008 interview, Schenker added "We would never again do something like this". The band's former lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth notes that the cover art of the "old Scorpion albums" were "usually done by other people." He has since expressed regret over the original album cover:
Looking at that picture today makes me cringe. It was done in the worst possible taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon the heart and soul of innocence.
In 2008, photographer Michael von Gimbut emphasized that his wife, the model's mother and sister and three female assistants had been present during the shooting and stated "Back then, we loved and protected children and did not sleep with them" ("Wir liebten und beschützten die Kinder damals und schliefen nicht mit ihnen").
The cover generated controversy: the album could only be sold sealed in black plastic in several countries and the cover was replaced in some countries with an alternative cover art depicting the band members. The original is named in various "worst album cover" lists: "Cracked" magazine online named it the No. 1 "Worst Album Cover of All-Time," while Gigwise.com lists it as No. 1 on its March 2008 "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time!" list. Similarly, it was named (by UGO Networks) one of the "Weirdest Album Covers," and placed No. 6 on the "All-Time Worst Album Covers" list made by "two.one.five" magazine.
This would not be the last time that the band attracted controversy with its album covers. Their next album, "Taken by Force", originally featured cover art that depicted "children playing with guns at a military cemetery in France and some people found that offensive." Their 1979 album "Lovedrive" featured a "bizarre artwork" that depicts "a woman on the back seat of a car with bubblegum over her breast." Both covers were replaced by an alternate design. Vocalist Klaus Meine explains that the band's penchant for controversial cover art stems from a desire "to go over the edge" and not "to offend some people or make the headlines that would be stupid", contrasting guitarist Rudolf Schenker's earlier statement, "We're using this only to get attention." In a 2010 interview Meine commented on the cover art again stating:
Back in those days (the 70's) it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today when you think of child pornography on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, "Look what we just released.." There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that?
Wikipedia controversy.
In May 2008, the U.S.-based social conservative site "WorldNetDaily" reported the cover image on Wikipedia to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented that: "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia." "EContent" magazine subsequently reported the Wikipedia community's internal debate as concluding that: "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed" and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases".
In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based non-government organization, added the Wikipedia article "Virgin Killer" to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image, which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: "erotic posing with no sexual activity". As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means of blocking in use. Following representations by the Wikimedia Foundation (who host the Wikipedia website) and public complaints, the IWF reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas. The IWF stated that one of the reasons for reversing their decision was that it had increased public interest in the image, an example of the Streisand effect.

Peter Warren Dease

Peter Warren Dease (January 1, 1788 – January 17, 1863) was a Canadian fur trader and arctic explorer.
Biography.
Early life.
Peter Warren Dease was born at Michilimackinac (now Mackinac Island) on January 1, 1788, the fourth son of Dr. John Dease, captain and deputy agent of Indian Affairs, and Jane French, Catholic Mohawk from Caughnawaga. His father was a nephew of Sir William Johnson, and first cousin of Sir John Johnson. He was named after Admiral Sir Peter Warren, an uncle of Sir William Johnson. He was raised by his family in Mackinac Island and then Montreal, until he left home at the age of 13 to work in the fur trade.
Fur trade.
Dease first worked for the New North West (XY) Company at Great Slave Lake. After that company's amalgamation with the North West Company in 1804, he was appointed to the position of clerk at Athabasca. In 1817 he was moved to the Mackenzie District, first at Fort Good Hope, then later at Fort Chipewyan and other Mackenzie posts. In 1821, the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies were united, and he became a chief trader for the Hudson's Bay Company, working in the Athabaska district.
Dease was asked by George Simpson to mount an expedition to explore the Finlay River basin in 1823, with the goal of developing the fur trade in that region, however Dease was unable to undertake the expedition that year, and the task was reassigned to Samuel Black. However in 1825 he was given the opportunity to participate in Sir John Franklin's second expedition to the arctic.
After his return from the Franklin expedition, Dease took charge of Fort Good Hope, and was stationed there from 1827 to 1829. In 1828 he was appointed a Chief Factor in the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as member of the Council. He was charged with developing trade along the newly discovered Peel's River. He recommended a post be established at near the source of the river, however it was another decade before the post, Peel's Post was built. In 1829 Dease handed over Fort Good Hope to John Bell, and was stationed briefly at Fort Simpson. He spent the winter of that year at the newly constructed Fort Halkett, serving in an advisory capacity.
In 1830 he was appointed to Fraser Lake to succeeded William Conolly in the New Caledonia district. In 1835 Dease requested a leave of absence due to ill health, probably failing eyesight. The leave was granted, after which he was placed in charge of a new arctic expedition.
Arctic exploration.
In 1825 Dease was placed in charge of the commissariat in Sir John Franklin's second expedition to the Arctic, having been personally requested by Franklin, who had met him on his first arctic expedition. Dease provided information about the local natives, and arranged for them to supply the expedition. He also supervised the construction of Fort Franklin at Great Bear Lake.
From 1836 to 1839 he was placed in charge of a 12 man expedition to explore the Arctic coast of North America, from the mouth of the Mackenzie River to Point Barrow, filling in information gaps left by other expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage. The expedition left on June 1, 1837, and arrived at Point Barrow on August 4. They wintered at Fort Confidence on Great Bear Lake and set out westward in the spring, mapping 100 miles of coastline and naming Victoria Land and Cape Pelly. They again wintered at Fort Confidence, and in the spring of 1839 explored eastward. On August 16 they reached Montreal Island and discovered a cache of supplies left by George Back.
Dease's junior officer, Thomas Simpson, often complained that he was indolent, and it is Simpson, as opposed to Dease, is generally given credit for the success of the mission. This may be because the only first-hand account of the expedition available until recently was Simpson's posthumously published journals. For his services in connection with this expedition Dease was given a ₤100 pension by Queen Victoria, and was rumoured to have been offered a knighthood, which he turned down.
Retirement.
Following the expedition, Dease was given another leave of absence, from 1840 to 1841, during which time he married (August 3, 1840) and settled on a farm in Côte Sainte-Catherine, near Montreal. He retired from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843. He remained at Côte Sainte-Catherine until his death on January 17, 1863. He and his wife, Elizabeth Chouinard, a Métis, had eight children: four sons and four daughters.
Personal description.
Dease was described in George Simpson's "Character Book" (compiled in 1832), as being:
About 45 years of Age. Very steady in business, an excellent Indian trader, speaks several of the Languages well and is a man of very correct conduct and character. Strong, vigorous and capable of going through a great deal of Severe Service but rather indolent, wanting in ambition to distinguish himself in any measure out of the usual cource, inactive until aroused to exertion and over easy and indulgent to his people which frequently occasions laxity of discipline, but when his temper gets ruffled he becomes furiously violent. His judgement is sound, his manners are more pleasing and easy than those of many of his colleagues, and altho' not calculated to make a shining figure, may be considered a very respectable member of the concern.

Norwegian Air Traffic Control System

NATCON (Norwegian Air Traffic Control System) is a nationwide Air Traffic Management system which is used by air traffic controllers in control towers (TWR), approach centres (APP) and area control centres (ACC) in Norway. The system is based on Auto Trac Air Traffic Management System from Raytheon (US) which also includes a flight data processing system originally developed by Indra (Spain). 
The latest major step forward was taken 22 November 2008 when all units belonging to Bodø AoR were upgraded from a fairly old legacy system (NARDS) to the latest NATCON version. A huge number of people in the Avinor organisation as well as external suppliers have contributed to this project. Avinor's System Development Unit has been in charge of the upgrade and development activities required in order to make the system ready for its deployment at Bodø ACC/APP as well as 35 other TWR and Approach units from mid to northern Norway.

<doc id="20585720" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20585720" title="Transport in Zagreb">
Transport in Zagreb

Transport in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, relies on a combination of city-managed mass transit and individual transportation. Mass transit is composed of 19 inner-city tram lines and 120 bus routes, both managed entirely by Zagrebački električni tramvaj. Croatian Railways manages the parallel Zagreb Commuter Rail system. The city is served by the Zagreb Airport, which carries more than 2,000,000 passengers per year.
Road transport.
Zagreb drivers typically use a wide network of avenues and other arterial streets. Due to the shape of the city, most of the trips done in the city are on the east-west relation, causing high traffic on roads like Vukovar Avenue, Dubrovnik Avenue and Zagrebačka Avenue. The Slavonska Avenue is the longest and one of the most congested roads in Zagreb, connecting the inner city to the A3 highway in the east.
Zagreb is a regional highway hub with eight highways and expressways radially leading into the city through the Zagreb bypass. Major highways and expressways include A1/A6, leading to Gorski Kotar, the Littoral and Dalmatia; A3 leading west to Rakitje, Samobor, Žumberak and Slovenia and east to Rugvica, Ivanić-Grad, Slavonia and Serbia; A2 leading northwest to Zaprešić, Zabok, Krapina and Central Europe; A4 leading northeast to Varaždin, Čakovec, Hungary and on to Eastern Europe; A11 leading southeast to Velika Gorica, Sisak and Petrinja (still in construction) and B28 leading east to Vrbovec, Bjelovar and Virovitica.
Similar to other European cities, Zagreb does not feature a regular grid plan. Donji Grad, the Zagreb downtown, mostly built in the 19th century, features a quasi-rectangular street plan, but the rest of the city depends on the form of wide straight avenues intersecting densely built neighborhoods composed of mostly chaotical street systems.
Taxicabs.
The first taxicab ever in Zagreb started operating on June 11, 1901. It was driven by Tadija Bartolović, a skilled fiaker driver. After a successful test drive where Bartolović drove mayor Adolf Mošinsky through Mesnička Street and Gornji Grad, the first taxicab stand in the city was opened on the Ban Jelačić Square.
The association of taxicab drivers Radio Taksi Zagreb, of over than 1,150 taxicabs, was the sole provider of taxi services in the city before 2011, when the first of many competitive services started to run taxicabs in the city.
Mass transit.
Mass transit in Zagreb is managed by the company Zagrebački električni tramvaj (ZET), part of the Zagreb Holding, a holding managing utilities and other city services. ZET's trams used to span the entire city, but due to only two expansions (the Dubec and Prečko routes) in the last 20 years, trams are today confined to the inner city. However, a bus network supplements the tram and services a large part of the Zagreb metropolitan area even outside the borders of the city proper. Other transport amenities are also available, such as the Sljeme gondola lift (closed for re-construction since 2007) or the Zagreb Funicular.
Tram.
The first tram line was opened on September 5, 1891, setting off a vital part of the Zagreb mass transit system. Zagreb today features an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines running over of tracks through 255 stations and transporting almost 500,000 passengers per day (almost twice as much as the Los Angeles County Metro Rail). The network covers much of the inner city, but some lines extend to the suburbs, such as line 15 (operating in Podsljeme) or lines 7 and 11 (operating in Sesvete). Although the trams are capable of achieving speeds in excess of , the unique fact that the network operates mostly at the curb limits their speed to the speed of surrounding vehicles, causing the trams to travel at speeds of 25–50 km/h (15-31 mph) in the inner city, with considerable slowdowns during the rush hours. 
The rolling stock is made up by various trams, including 87 ČKD-Tatra T4 cars (designated as TMK 401 by ZET), 15 TMK 101 cars (obsolete, used only as substitutes), 18 TMK 201, 16 Düwag GT6 (TMK 901), 16 TMK 2100 cars and 140 new, 100% low-floor TMK 2200 cars. TMK 2200 is produced by the Crotram consortium, composed of Končar elektroindustrija, TŽV Gredelj and Đuro Đaković. Another 70 shorter versions will be delivered in the following period.
Commuter rail.
With 21 trains, the Zagreb suburban railway mainly covers the eastern and western parts of Zagreb. It mostly operates on the same standard-gauge lines used for Croatian Railways' long-distance trains. The trains normally operate on a 15-minute frequency, but reach only a portion of the city's suburbs.
Metro.
A second light-rail or metro system, the Zagreb Metro, has been planned numerous times. It would complement the tram commuter rail networks, but currently it is not even clear if the system would be a full metro or a light Metro. 
The first plans were presented in 2004, under which a light Metro would be built, going at speeds of up to 35 km/h. 
It has been stated that the full Metro is not worth building. A full metro costs twice more than the light metro, and can carry up to 70,000 people per hour in a direction. Forecasts predict that by 2020 the maximum load of passengers will be 7,000.
The light metro's capacity would be 24,000, but due to the significantly cheaper cost, it was the preferred choice in January 2007, when the City Authorities announced plan for new Metro System consisting of 4-5 metro lines. Phase 1 of the new metro was going to be 22.7 km long, of, of these 10 km underground. The Metro system will be based on light rail PTN system currently in use in Vancouver, San Francisco or Singapore, but a full metro system is also a possibility.
There would be three lines running west-east, and two running north-south, converging on the city center. All lines were planned to go underground in the city center. Once the Zagreb metro system would be fully completed it would have 25 km of underground and 55 km overground lines. The cost of this entire system is thought to be about 5.5 billion Euro over 20 years. The initial cost would be between 600 million and 1,14 billion Euros.
Still no concrete work has been done, due to lack of funding. Still not clear nor anyhow decided, which of proposed variants will be finally used for traffic relief in Zagreb. Premetro concept, Light rail concept (fully excluding expensive tunnel boring) on existing heavy rail corridors which need updating and some newly built, or full scale subway.
At a 2008 conference named "Razvitak Zagreba" (Development of Zagreb), a proposal was presented by prof. dr. Damir Pološki of the Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Zagreb.
There is even a plan, that the completion of the project will be prolonged until 2030.
In September 2009, a plan for a light rail system was presented at the Croatian Chamber of Civil Engineers (HKIG) meeting by dr. Davorin Kolić, a rail system designer with international experience.
Water transport.
The river Sava flows through the city, but it is not navigable in Zagreb and the nearest port is located in Sisak. The city has had a history of flooding, and since the last catastrophic flood in 1964, when inundation affected 60 km2 of inner city territory, the city authorities had built a system of levees to protect itself from Sava, together with a discharge canal Sava-Odra, completed in 1971. Since then the city's waterside has been strictly isolated, spanned only by three central bridges between the north of Zagreb and Novi Zagreb in the south. Later, seven more bridges were built in the west and the east, also over the levees.

National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997

The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, also known as the Revitalization Act, was enacted on August 5, 1997, with provisions to reform the criminal justice system in Washington, D.C.. The act was spearheaded by North Carolina Republican Senator, Lauch Faircloth.
Corrections.
Under the legislation, prisoners were put under custody of the Bureau of Prisons, and the Lorton, Virginia prison was required to close by December 31, 2001. Offenders serving short sentences for misdemeanors serve time at either the Central Detention Facility or the Correctional Treatment Facility, both run by the District of Columbia Department of Corrections. Approximately 6,500 prisoners have been sent to Bureau of Prison facilities around the United States, including over a 1,000 sent to West Virginia, and another 1,000 to North Carolina. Following the passage of the Revitalization Act, a Corrections Trustee was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to oversee the District of Columbia Department of Corrections during the transition period.
Parole and probation.
The Revitalization Act transferred authority regarding parole to the United States Parole Commission, and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency was established to oversee probationers and parolees, and provide pretrial services. The functions were previously handled by the D.C. Superior Court and the D.C. Pretrial Services Agency.
Funding.
The Revitalization Act also mandated that the Federal government provide funding for the District of Columbia court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

Langcliffe Pot

Langcliffe Pot is a cave system on the slopes of Great Whernside in Upper Wharfedale, about 2 km SSE of Kettlewell in Yorkshire (UK NGR SD996711), and actually some 20 km NNE of Langcliffe village. The cave entrance is at an altitude of 470m. The system has a total surveyed passage length of about 10 km, and a depth of only a little more than 100m. It was explored originally in 1936 and 1954 by the Craven Pothole Club (CPC), extended in 1968 by the Yorkshire Underground Research Team (YURT), and in 1968-70 by the University of Leeds Speleological Association (ULSA).
Description.
The Oddmire entrance drops below a limestone slab at the bottom of an otherwise unremarkable shallow shakehole north-east of Fox Scar. A pitch of 30m leads to a traverse, then the start of 200m of wet crawling, Craven Crawl, the termination of the cave until 1968. Beyond Number One Junction, Stagger Passage leads 600m to Hammerdale Dub, and a junction with still larger passage continuing downstream. Some 1500m of streamway interspersed with boulder obstacles, Langstrothdale Chase, ends in a bedding plane crawl leading to Boireau Falls Chamber, 20m in diameter and 6m high, where the stream reappears and cascades into the boulders flooring the chamber. A complex boulder choke leads to a 20m pitch dropping into the Nemesis chamber. A massive collapse region, a tight and navigationally complex boulder choke, leads to Gasson's Series, initially high streamway, descending past Poseidon Sump and on into a procession of fine rift passage and chambers of the Agora, before turning east into Aphrodite Avenue, a handsome canyon with gour pools, and the Silver Rake. The system comes to an end at a wall of sand and boulders, which can be bypassed to a smaller descending passage reaching a sump.
Notwithstanding its limited depth, a trip into the far reaches of Langcliffe Pot is still rated as one of the more serious undertakings in British caving. A detailed passage description and survey is given in "Northern Caves". A survey in relation to the other caves of the Black Keld drainage system, and a detailed discussion of the geology and hydrology, is given in "Limestones and Caves of Northwest England, Chapter 22".
Geology.
The surface region displays the classical scar morphology of the Great Scar Limestone. The higher beds, of Yoredale Limestones, form wide benches separated by steep scars, and the highest of these, the Middle Limestone bench, is pitted with shakeholes and partially covered by peat, sphagnum bog, clay and sandstone debris. The majority of the Langcliffe cave system is developed within the Middle Limestone series, with visible horizons of shale, chert and fossil bands. The Nemesis Pitch cuts through an otherwise impervious layer of shale to enter the Simonstone Limestone, while Gasson's Series below is totally developed within the Hardraw Limestone. The Silver Rake is named after the vein of the North Mossdale suite which controls the direction of passage below the Agora.
Hydrology.
The catchment area of Great Whernside, some 20 km2 in size, is a gathering ground for water entering the Langcliffe system, as well as the largest stream of the area which sinks into the ground at Mossdale Scar. Beneath Mossdale Scar, several entrances amongst a chaos of boulders unite close to the entrance to enter Mossdale Caverns, a 10 km long complex system of underground passage. The Mossdale sink takes an average flow of 100 litres/sec, and resurges at Black Keld. Langcliffe Pot, which also feeds the Black Keld rising, terminate some 180m above, and several kilometres distant from it, leaving many questions about its detailed hydrology beyond the present limit of exploration. Surface sinks above Gasson's Series, for example, do not enter the Langcliffe system itself, but are diverted into separate cave systems by the layers of impervious strata above the Hardraw Limestone. Langcliffe Pot demonstrates the scale and complexity of the integrated cave system which must exist below the flanks of Great Whernside, a future challenge for sporting cavers and speleologists.

Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem

Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem (born March 4, 1940, in Hannover) is a German legal scholar and a former judge of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.
Career.
Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem was born into a family of teachers. He had four siblings, one of whom died at a very young age. After passing the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur) at the Walddörfer-Gymnasium in Hamburg, he studied law while minoring in economics at the Universities of Hamburg, Freiburg i.Br., Munich, and Berkeley. He was awarded an LL.M. at Berkeley. In 1964 he passed the first state examination and in 1968 obtained a doctorate in law. After passing the second state examination in 1970, he spent four years working as a lawyer. In 1974 he obtained his postdoctoral qualification (Habilitation), which led to an appointment as professor of public law and public administration at the University of Hamburg. From 1977 to 1979, he was the spokesperson for Law Department II at the University of Hamburg, which offered a new single-tier law education as an alternative to the traditional two-tier education in Law Department I. He was offered but declined faculty appointments at the Universities of Hannover, Frankfurt a.M., and Berlin.
From 1979 to 1995, Hoffmann-Riem was director of the Hans Bredow Institute for media research, which is affiliated with the University of Hamburg, and from July 1998 until December 1999, he chaired its newly created directorate. Following his appointment as judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, he became an honorary member of the directorate. From 1981 to 1983, he served as chair of the German Association for the Sociology of Law and from 1989 to 1992 as chair of the German Communication Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Publizistik- und Kommunikationswissenschaft, DGPuK). Since 1988 he has been director of the Research Centre for Environmental Law and since 1996 director of the Centre for Research in Law and Innovation, CERI, both at the University of Hamburg. From 1995 to 1997, he was Minister of Justice of the State of Hamburg. During this period, he also chaired the Committee on Legal Affairs of the German Bundesrat. From 1999 to 2008, he served as judge in the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court. In 2007 he was appointed by the federal government as the German representative on the European Commission for Democracy through Law, also known as the Venice Commission. In 2009/10 Hoffmann-Riem was a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study (Wissenschaftskolleg) in Berlin. Since 2012 he serves as affiliate professor at the Bucerius Law School, Hamburg.
Main Areas of Research.
Hoffmann-Riem has sought to change the understanding of law as a discipline dealing solely with the interpretation of norms to one in which actions and decisions focus on resolution of problems. Emphasizing the problem-solving capacity of the legal system, he has maintained that law can help overcome social problems and achieve resolution of specific conflicts if suitable frameworks are deployed in a legal system that is efficient and results-oriented. In his view, this concept derives from the interaction between norms and social reality – that is, the operative area of norms (the so-called "Realbereich") – and from the effects of the way in which law is applied, with such effects being measured across disciplines by incorporating sociology, economics, and natural sciences.
This fundamental understanding has been given expression by Hoffmann-Riem throughout all phases of his extensive career and research. An example of this is his role in reforming legal education in Germany. Traditionally having two parts, the manner of instruction he helped to create forged a stronger bond between the once-separate theoretical and practical aspects. In numerous advisory roles with governments, parliaments, and organizations, as well as his participation in a variety of commissions, he has strived to include the voice of practitioners. In addition, his extensive research and teaching engagements abroad (e.g., at Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, and Melbourne) have enabled him to incorporate views from other legal systems as well. In analyzing the problems and possibilities associated with legal regulation, he has focused on the media. Thanks to ground-breaking technological breakthroughs (cable and satellite television, digitalization, the Internet) and accompanying shifts in the market, this area has offered him a rich source of material for studying the interplay between responses at the law-making level and social, technological, economic, and political developments. While this transformation was happening, he was head of the Hans Bredow Institute for Radio and Television, whose main focus was on sociological issues.
Hoffmann-Riem has seen environmental law as another example of a field warranting closer examination of the problems associated with traditional governmental regulation – variously characterized by writers as a "crisis" – and of the need for new regulatory approaches. On these topics, his primary interest has been the interplay between governmental and private entities (so-called "cooperative administrative law"), specifically the question of just what type of law is required when the state largely turns over its public-interest responsibilities to the private sector while remaining tasked with their fulfillment. In an attempt to describe this dynamic, he coined the term "regulated self-regulation."
In the early 1990s, Hoffmann-Riem initiated a systematic discussion among academics and practitioners on the need and possible options for the reform of administrative law. In doing so, he gained the support of the renowned Heidelberg scholar Eberhard Schmidt-Aßmann. This discussion resulted in a ten-volume series entitled "The Reform of Administrative Law" ("Schriften zur Reform des Verwaltungsrechts"), published by Nomos Verlag. Another project ensuing from this discussion on reform was a systematic handbook with Hoffmann-Riem as editor – again with Schmidt-Aßmann and also Andreas Voßkuhle – entitled "Fundamentals of Administrative Law" ("Grundlagen des Verwaltungsrechts"), which was published in three volumes between 2006 and 2009 by Beck Verlag. Fifty authors contributed to this project. Vol. 1 and 2 have been published in 2012, vol. 3 will follow in 2013.
In the 1990s, taking note of on-going public criticism that the ability of German society to innovate was hamstrung on account of restrictions imposed by law, Hoffmann-Riem called for the establishment of a new legal discipline, which came to be called research in law and innovation (see, e.g., "Research in Law and Innovation" ["Schriften zur rechtswissenschaftlichen Innovationsforschung"], published by Nomos Verlag). In 1995 he founded the Centre for Research in Law and Innovation (CERI) at the University of Hamburg and undertook several research projects on the importance of law in society-based technological and social innovation.
During his tenure as Senator of Justice in the Hamburg Senate, Hoffmann-Riem conceived and initiated an overhaul of Hamburg's judicial administration termed "Justice 2000", and it became a model for other German states.

In 1999 the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) nominated the politically unaffiliated scholar Hoffman-Riem as judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, and he was subsequently elected by the Bundesrat. His scope of responsibility encompassed, inter alia, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, general protection of privacy, protection of personal information, and competition law. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he authored a series of decisions that gave rise to spirited public debate, including those on freedom of assembly and the relationship between freedom and security (for example, decisions on sweeping wiretapping powers ["Großen Lauschangriff"], wiretapping using foreign trade law or general police regulations, profiling, online searches, automated recording of car license plates, and data retention.) While recognizing the need for the state to ensure public safety, the Constitutional Court held that guarantees afforded by the rule of law may not be ignored and governmental power must be limited, and even in the face of perceived threats, it is paramount that the principles of proportionality and certainty in the application of law be respected and procedural safeguards be maintained. In these decisions (for example, in the ruling dealing with online searches), the Constitutional Court dealt extensively with developments in current technology that have long been the subject of Hoffmann-Riem's research.
Honors.
In 2008 the German Federal President bestowed on Hoffmann-Riem the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Azerbaijan–Italy relations

Azerbaijani–Italian relations have lasted for centuries and today remains strong. Azerbaijan has an embassy in Rome. Italy has an embassy in Baku. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
History.
Roman Azerbaijan.
An ancient Latin inscription on the rocks in the territory of Qobustan testifies that the Roman legions crossed through Azerbaijan in the old times. In 75 AD, XII "Fulminata" was in Caucasus, where Emperor Vespasian had sent the legion to support the allied kingdoms of Caucasian Iberia (Georgia) and Caucasian Albania (Azerbaijan). Even though Roman Empire controlled Azerbaijan as a vassal state, Azerbaijan, unlike Armenia and Iberia didn't turn out to be as an actual part of the Roman Empire and protected its independence. Caucasian Albania also signed a peace treaty with Roman Republic as Strabo attested. Sara Ashurbeyli's book about history of Baku brings a possibility of settlement of Ramana was that possibly founded by the Roman troops of Lucius Julius Maximus from Legio XII Fulminata in c. 84-96 AD and derives its name from the Latin "Romana".
The Roman Empire has left a notable influence on Azerbaijan. Christianity remains as one of them. According to Strabo, who traveled to the region in the 1st century BC, the local tribes practiced polytheism but Christianity entered into Caucasian Albania in early 1st century. In the 4th century, Eastern Roman Empire accepted Christianity as a state religion, but Christianity didn't spread among nation that strongly. During Arab invasions, Azerbaijani people had to accept Islam because polytheist and Zoroastrian religious views were a sin according to Islamic rule; however, the Christian minority were able to protect their belief (monotheist views are respected among Muslims) and still certain parts of Azerbaijan remain Christian. Despite the Islamisation of Azerbaijan, the oldest Christian church in the Caucasus, the Albanian Church founded by the apostle Yelisey in Sheki, near Kish, as well as the Gandzasar, Targmanchats and Amaras monasteries in Karabagh have reached our times in relatively good shape. Christianity was not the only thing of a huge cultural legacy Rome left to Azerbaijan; it also left the Latin alphabet and the western-oriented society of contemporary Azerbaijanis. After Arab invasions, Azeri people stuck to the Arabic alphabet. However, a Latin-based alphabet was adopted in 1928 but soon, in 1939, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin ordered the Azerbaijanis to use the Cyrillic alphabet (which is used for the Russian language). When Azerbaijan gained its independence again in 1991, head of state Ayaz Mutallibov and its parliament adopted a Latin-based alphabet.
Archaeological works have proved that Caucasian Albania used Rome coins and dinars. Azerbaijan protects such ancient founds in their museums.
Aq Qoyunlu - Italian states.
The Republic of Venice tried independently or together to build both political and military alliance with Ruler of Persia and Azerbaijan Aq Qoyunlu (White Sheep Turkomans) Uzun Hassan against the Ottoman Empire. Many diplomatic missions were exchanged between 1463 and 1477 In December 1463, the Venetian senate opted to enter an alliance with Hassan. Lazzaro Quirini was sent to Empire and, in the same year, the Aq Qoyunlu ambassador Haji Mohammad was sent to Rome for the inception of the pontificate of Sixtus IV and then to Venice. Caterino Zeno was dispatched by the senate on a similar mission to the empire. Zeno was married to a niece of Uzun Hassan's wife and in a way counted as a member of his family and was very well liked at his court.
Pope Sixtus IV was among the major supporters of establishing connections with Aq Qoyunlu. Soon afterw the alliance between the Italian States and Iran & Azerbaijan were established, they were many times confirmed and reinforced with military supplies. Hassan was promised control of whole Anatolia on the condition that he would not construct any fortresses on the coastline and would allow free passage for Venetian ships. but his hesitations and rare successes at war put him out of the international arena. Uzun Hassan died in 1478 which is the day that can be noted as the end of possible alliance between Italian states and Azerbaijan (Iran).
Safavid Empire.
In July 1501, Ismail I was enthroned as Shah of Azerbaijan. and later on, he became the Shah of Iran. Diplomatic relations were reestablished with Italian states Friendship and an intention for an alliance was repeatedly affirmed but there was never any strong alliance during the time of Ismail nor with his successor Tahmasp I. However, strong commercial ties between Safavid Empire and many Italian states remained, especially during the reign of Shah Abbas.
Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.
Russo-Perso War resulted with the invasion of present-day Azerbaijan territory by Russian Empire. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Azerbaijan Democratic Republic established the first democratic and secular state in the whole Muslim world. Italy was one of the countries that was able to establish diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan. Italy opened its consulate and military office in Baku. In that time, official visits of the Azerbaijani delegation to Italy and the Italian delegation to Azerbaijan were realized.
Recent political relations.
Italy recognized the independence of Azerbaijan from Soviet Union on January 1, 1992. The diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on May 8, 1992. The first embassy of Italy among the Southern Caucasian republics was opened in Azerbaijan in 1997 and the embassy of Azerbaijan to Italy has been functioning since 2003. 
Heydar Aliyev paid his first official visit to Italy on September 1997 and, between 1998-2003 government officials of Italy visited Azerbaijan, which resulted with signed agreements on cooperation in different spheres. Italian ambassadors to Azerbaijan have stated that visas might have lift in soon between two countries. In April 1999, Italy opened a new building of the Italian Embassy in Baku.
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Italy is notable for being the first chairman of OSCE Minsk Group's acting for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. During Ilham Aliyev's official visits to Italy the subject was touched on again. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi reminded that the attempts of the Minsk Group of OSCE had not produced any results yet and stated that he would do his best to strengthen the activity of the Minsk Group. In June 2005, during his visit to Azerbaijan, the head of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Migration of the Senate of Italy, said that Italy will protect the just position of Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Economic relations.
Italy has become the biggest trade partner of Azerbaijan in importing crude oil and oil products. 51.9% of exportation from Azerbaijan has been directed to Italy since 2003. Italy mainly exports pipes for oil sector, tobacco, leather and furniture to Azerbaijan. The visits of the ministers of Economic Developments of both countries in 2007 resulted in signed agreements on the cooperation between Azerbaijan and Italy in the sector of natural gas.
Co-operation in oil.
In 2005 Azerbaijan exported 50% of its oil to Italy. The owner of a 5% share in the "Contract of the Century", an Italian company "Eni-Agip", is involved in the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. A number of other companies in Italy also participated in the construction of the pipeline on the basis of the contract. The official opening ceremony was held in July 2006. "Eni-Agip" is also active in the project "Shahdeniz" and in the oil field "Kyurdashy". In June 2013, it was decided that the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) will go from Azerbaijan through Turkey and Greece to southern Italy.
Cooperation in the field of viticulture.
Azerbaijan also plans to collaborate with the Italian "Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo" in the field of viticulture. Italy's Manual "Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo" and, in order to exchange experience, has invited officials of the Ministry of Agriculture of Azerbaijan economy to Italy.
Cultural relations.
During the Soviet era, in 1972, city of Italy, Naples, and the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, were declared sister cities. Since that time, the cultural ties between Italy and Azerbaijan have become more intense but relations between two countries have a long history which can be seen from travelers visiting Azerbaijan in the Middle Ages (including Marco Polo) and Nasreddin Tusi's book "Interpretation of Euclid's "Elements" being translated into Latin and published in 1594 in Rome. There are different paintings by well-known Italian painters in museums of Azerbaijan, and many carpets and jewelry articles made in Azerbaijan are in different museums and private collections in Italy. Since the end of 19th and the beginning of 20th century in Baku, different buildings were built by famous Italian architects. The works of Dante and Petrarch were translated into Azerbaijani and published in great quantities. Some legendary singers of Azerbaijan such as Bulbul and Muslim Magomayev mastered the bases of opera art in Italy. Many cultural events have been held in both countries. Italy is among those countries who render humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan. The agreement on the humanitarian aid between Azerbaijan and Italy, signed on June 1, 2005, is directed at easing the hard life of refugees and IDPs settled in Azerbaijan. The Italian government helped a number of medical and social institutions in Azerbaijan as well. The soloist of the State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, honored artist Fidan Hajiyeva, became the first artist from Azerbaijan to perform on the stage in Italian city of Rimini.

Fergal Healy

Fergal Healy (born 1977 in Craughwell, County Galway) is an Irish sportsperson. He plays hurling with his local club Craughwell and has been a member of the Galway senior inter-county team from 1997-2009.
Playing career.
Club.
Healy plays his club hurling with his local club in Craughwell and has enjoyed much success. He started to hurl with the club when he was only seven years-old and went on to play in county under-14 and under-16 finals before inspiring the rural Galway side to an historic under-21 county championship breakthrough in the mid-1990s. Healy, however, has never won a senior county title with his club.
Inter-county.
Healy came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Galway at an early age. As a member of the county's under-14 team he captured a Tony Forrestal Cup winners' medal in the early 1990s. Healy was later chosen on the Galway under-16 team, with whom he collected a Nenagh Co-Op title.
Healy subsequently became a member of the Galway minor team, where he was successful once again. In 1993 Galway qualified for the All-Ireland final, however, Healy was not a member of the starting fifteen. He did enter the field of play as a substitute, however, Galway were defeated by Kilkenny on that occasion. In 1994 Galway were back in the All-Ireland minor final once again, with Healy lining out on the half-forward line. Cork provided the opposition on this occasion, however, Galway emerged victorious by 2-10 to 1-11. It was Healy's first All-Ireland medal. Healy played with the Galway minor again in 1995, however, the team's championship involvement ended at the semi-final stage.
In 1996 Healy was eligible to play with the Galway under-21 hurling team. It was a successful year as the county reached the All-Ireland final in that grade. Wexford were the opponents in that game, however, Galway had a comfortable 1-14 to 0-7 victory. It was Healy's first All-Ireland medal in the under-21 grade. In 1997 Galway qualified for the All-Ireland final once again. This time Cork provided the opposition and it was Cork who claimed the victory at the full-time whistle. 1998 saw Healy line out in a third consecutive All-Ireland under-21 final. Cork were the opponents once again. After an entertaining hour of hurling it was 'the Rebels' who emerged victorious by 2-15 to 2-10.
1996 also saw Healy taste success with the Galway junior hurling team. That year Healy's county reached the All-Ireland final in that competition. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was Galway who took a 1-14 2-9. This gave Healy a coveted All-Ireland title at junior level.
Healy made his competitive debut with the Galway senior hurling team in 1997. It took him a few years, however, before he established himself on the championship team.
In 1999 Galway qualified for the final of the National Hurling League competition. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion, however, after an entertaining seventy minutes it was Tipp who emerged victorious by 1-14 to 1-10. 1999 also saw Healy taste success with the Galway intermediate hurling team. That year Healy's county reached the All-Ireland final in that competition. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was Galway who took a 3-13 to 2-10. This gave Healy a coveted All-Ireland title at intermediate level.
2000 saw Galway reach the National League final for a second year in-a-row. Tipperary were the opponents once again, however, on this occasion Galway had the upper-hand. A 2-18 to 2-13 victory gave Healy his first major title at senior level. Later that same year Healy made his senior championship debut in an All-Ireland quarter-final against Tipperary. Galway recorded a victory on that occasion, however, Healy had a less than auspiscious debut. Galwya were defeated by Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final.
In 2001 Galway ended a barren spell in the championship by reaching the All-Ireland final. Recent rivals Tipperary were the opponents in what turned out to be an entertaining contest. Healy had a good game in the forward line. He scored a goal for Galway and hit the post twice, however, Mark O'Leary's two goals gave Tipp the threshold to withstand a Galway fight-back. At the full-time whistle Tipp were the victors by 2-18 to 2-15.
Galwya went through a barren spell following this appearance in the championship decider. In 2005 Galway shocked Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the games of the decade to book a spot in the All-Ireland final with Cork. A Ben O'Connor goal in the sixteenth minute paved the way for a cork victory, in spite of a Damien Hayes goal reducing the deficit to one point. Galway failed to score in the last ten minutes as Cork recorded a 1-21 to 1-16 victory.
The following few seasons saw Galway fail to build on this. In 2006 and 2007 Kilkenny restored the status quo by defeating Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. In 2008 Healy's side failed to beat fourteen-man Cork, thus not even reaching the All-Ireland quarter-final in spite of great expectations.
Provincial.
Healy has also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial competition. He won a Railway Cup winners' medal in 2004 as Connacht defeated Munster in the final.

The story is set on Christmas Eve in a New England town in the late 1890s. The Cosgrove family’s home is in an uproar over the holidays. The patriarch, Clark Cosgrove (Paul Lynde) is frazzled by the gift demands of his loud children. His wife Nellie (Anne Meara) runs into endless friction with Clark’s formidable mother (Alice Ghostley), who lives with them. Nellie’s inebriated father (Foster Brooks) and cat-loving mother (Martha Raye) arrive for the holiday, and tensions arise between the mothers-in-law. A German uncle (Howard Morris) is also arriving, but complications ensue when a traveling salesman (George Gobel) is mistaken for the uncle. Adding to the tumult is a visit from a caroling neighbor (Anson Williams). During the night, Clark’s mother-in-law’s cat escapes from the house and winds up on the roof. Clark goes to retrieve the cat and creates a ruckus, waking the house. When the children ask if the noise came from Santa Claus, Clark initially wants to dispel the myth of Santa Claus. Instead, he appeases them by reciting "A Visit from St. Nicholas."
Production.
'"Twas the Night Before Christmas" was part of a series of American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television specials starring Paul Lynde. Whereas previous offerings, most notably the 1976 production of "The Paul Lynde Halloween Special", relied on a sketch comedy revue format, '"Twas the Night Before Christmas" retained a narrative format where Lynde and his castmates remained in character for the entire show.
Lynde was responsible for casting Martha Raye as his mother-in-law, telling an interviewer: “It’s my chance to repay her for all the times she used me in her NBC "Comedy Hour" back in the 1950s.”
For the climactic recitation of "A Visit from St. Nicholas," Lynde was not allowed to rely on cue cards because director Tim Kiley felt they would distract the child actors in the cast. Lynde would later recall: “I had to do the poem five different times for five different camera angles. If America thinks I did this with cue cards, I’ll kill myself.”
Broadcast.
'"Twas the Night Before Christmas" was broadcast by ABC on December 7, 1977. Reviews were not favorable, with "The New York Times" dismissing its plot as “anemic” and adding its “conceptual hugger-mugger was fatal.” "Variety" complained that “an inept script and a subpar performance by Paul Lynde worked against the best efforts of a charming cast in this ABC yuletide special.” The broadcast ranked 30th for that week’s Nielsen ratings. However, it later received an Award of Excellence from the Film Advisory Board.
'"Twas the Night Before Christmas" was never rebroadcast by ABC or any other U.S. television network. To date, it has not been made commercially available on DVD and, except for a one-time screening at a New York City retro film and television festival in 2001, it has not been seen since its only telecast.

Schtroumpf Vert et Vert Schtroumpf

Schtroumpf Vert et Vert Schtroumpf is the ninth comic book adventure of the Smurfs, written and drawn by Peyo with Yvan Delporte as co-writer. The story is considered a parody on the still ongoing language war between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in the authors' native Belgium. The plot is similar in a way to "King Smurf", an earlier adventure, in that the usually harmonious community of Smurfs falls into disarray due to the failure of father-figure Papa Smurf to exercise his leadership.
When released in book form, the French and English versions included a number of one-page stories with the Smurfs undertaking various forms of sport from archery to fishing with comical results.
Title.
The title literally means "Smurf Green and Green Smurf", as the adjective in French variably could be placed both before and after a noun, also a reference to the Belgian saying chou vert et vert chou, lit "cabbage green and green cabbage", "two sides of the same coin", stating that an identical meaning could be phrased in two different ways.
Plot summary.
From the moment they first appeared in "La Flûte à six trous" in 1958 it was established that the Smurfs talked in Smurf language, where the term "smurf" was used on an apparently random basis in their speeches: for instance, "It's smurfing a gale today".
Now it is revealed that actual differences in the language exist in the otherwise very homogenous community of Smurfs: the Smurfs who live in the northern part of their village use the term "smurf" as a noun; while the Smurfs in the south use it as an adjective or verb.
This difference of opinion is raised when Handy Smurf, a Southern Smurf who is the local inventor, asks a Northern Smurf to return his ""smurf opener"", but he fails to do so on the grounds that it should be called a ""bottle smurfer"". Instead of agreeing to disagree, they have an increasingly heated argument about which is the correct term to use.
Papa Smurf is locked away in his laboratory, trying to complete a difficult chemical experiment, which keeps him out of the argument. Meanwhile other Smurfs start debating the linguistic issue. They part, returning to their own sides of the village, failing to agree on the subject, and as a result there is much tension in the air.
One night, during a theatre performance of "Little Smurf Riding Hood", the Northern part of the audience keeps interrupting the Southern actors over the use of language, claiming, among other things, that the title should be "Little Red Riding Smurf". The arguing and interruptions continue to the point where the play erupts into an all-out fight. Papa Smurf breaks it up, pointing out the silliness of fighting over a matter of words. At first the Smurfs appear to think that he is right, but then start arguing again over whether they should "shake smurfs" or "smurf hands".
The next day, Papa Smurf tries to lift the tension by insisting that they play ball together in a friendly manner. At first it appears to work, but then other Smurfs watching the game begin to divide along lingual lines and the arguments begin again. The tension returns, this time apparently to stay, with insults being traded and both sides trying to assert their indifference and superiority over the other.
One Smurf eventually paints a demarcation line across the middle of the village to separate the two groups. This means that they have to stick to their own sides of the border. In one case, a Smurf finds his house marked in two by the straight demarcation line and goes almost crazy since he cannot figure out if he is of the North or the South: for instance, he cooks a "boiled smurf" on one side of his house and then consumes a "smurfed egg" on the other.
All this time, Papa Smurf has been in his laboratory working on his experiment — the nature of which is never revealed — but when he finally succeeds and calls on the other Smurfs to celebrate, it is already too late: the fuse that was set long ago has exploded with both North and South finally coming to blows in an all-out battle. Papa Smurf's pleas for them to stop are in vain.
In a desperate move to restore order, Papa Smurf turns to Gargamel, the evil sorcerer and sworn enemy of the Smurfs. Looking him in the eye, Papa Smurf pronounces a magic spell that immediately causes him and Gargamel to exchange their physical appearances: Gargamel becomes Papa Smurf and Papa Smurf becomes Gargamel.
Gargamel's cat Azrael is taken aback when he hears the voice of his master coming from Papa Smurf's body and goes his own way, overwhelmed by confusion.
Papa Smurf (as Gargamel) and Gargamel (as Papa Smurf) return to the Smurf village together where the battle is still ongoing. However, upon seeing Gargamel attack, the Smurfs on both sides reunite to fight against their common archenemy. Papa Smurf (as Gargamel) allows himself to be subdued and tied down. He hoped to teach them a lesson in being united ("smurf for all and all for smurf"), but they mock his claim to actually be Papa Smurf and refuse to release him.
The real Gargamel, in Papa Smurf's body, breaks into the laboratory and finds the magic spell. He thus restores himself and Papa Smurf into their original bodies, freed from the bonds. Gargamel immediately takes the opportunity to chase and seize the Smurfs throughout the village and further into the woods. But then he and the Smurfs come across Azrael who attacks him, thinking that it's still Papa Smurf in Gargamel's body.
All the Smurfs successfully escape from Gargamel's hands, while Gargamel (as usual) fails to find his way back to their village. At first it would seem as if peace has returned but then Papa Smurf overhears another argument about whether it should be a "smurf opener" or a "bottle smurfer". To prevent further clashes, he decrees that all the terms pronounced differently on the north and south sides of the village are now banned from use, so it should henceforth be "an object to unscrew bottles".
However, the Smurfs find it very difficult to use this new politically correct language, since very complicated and descriptive forms of expression are now needed and are subject to different interpretations, meaning that the resolution of the linguistic issue is still a long way off.
Publication history.
"Smurf vs. Smurf" was originally published in issues 1808 to 1836 of "Spirou" magazine in 1972 and then in book form by Dupuis in 1973. As well as the original French, other translations include English (as "Smurf Of One And Smurf A Dozen Of The Other"), Dutch, German, Swedish, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Serbocroatian, Polish, Catalan and Chinese.
Issues.
In this story, Peyo and Yvan Delporte make open political comments about the still ongoing language conflict between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.
The story also illustrates how easily systems with undeveloped institutions fall into disarray as the few authorities that there are suddenly stop functioning: Papa Smurf is the only regular decision-making body in the community of Smurfs and his failure to get involved in the debate leads to the breakdown of order. Brainy Smurf is the only other neutral figure in the plot, but his attempts to resolve the issue with the help of a grammar book fall on deaf ears given the low opinion that the other Smurfs have of him.

Maa Bhoomi

Maa Bhoomi (Telugu: మా భూమి, English: Our land) is a 1979 Telugu film is based on a play written by Kishan Chander called Jab Khet Jaage, on the Telengana Rebellion in Hyderabad State.B. Narsing Rao wrote the screenplay. It also depicts a typical life of villagers under feudal society in Telangana region. It was the first feature film of acclaimed Indian director Goutam Ghose. The film is listed among CNN-IBN's list of hundred landmark Indian films of all time.
The plot.
The film follows the story of a young landless Telangana peasant named Ramaiah (Sai Chand) from Siripuram, Nalgonda, a region under foreign rule. The British have appointed the Nizam as the regions governor. The nizam in turn have appointed the Reddys and the Patils as the Zamindars(Known locally as "Doras") of the region who collect taxes among various other things for the Nizam. Further, the Nizam have granted them with Titles, Jagirs and Judicial rights enabling them to seize thousands of acres of land from the peasants and turning them into tenants.
Ramaiah Rebels against the corrupt Nizam leadership in Hyderabad. When his wife has to submit to sexual coercion by the officials, he befriends the Communists and participates in the independence struggle. The peasants form various paramilitary groups and launch guerilla warfare attacks across the region with country made weapons. They raid and take over regional "Dora" bases across rural telangana at night and burn all the land documents found in the bases in the open yard symbolising their triumph. Eventually they take over the village after the Indian Independence.
The "Doras" manage to escape to Hyderabad reporting the events to the Nizam leadership. The Nizam commands the Razakars, a private Islamist militia, which perpetuates a massacre over the Telangana peasants. After months of burning, looting, rapes and killings, the Indian army marches into Hyderabad and suppresses the Razakars and the Nizam with Operation Polo in September 1948 and annexes the Telangana region back into the Indian Union. In independent India, the Zamindars("Doras") are returned back to power by joining the Congress government. The "Doras" have abandoned the Nizam and pledged allegiance to the Congress Party. The Telangana people now find themselves facing the same struggle all over again.
Soundtrack.
The music for the songs was set by Vinjamuri Seeta.

List of countries by westernmost point

This is a list of countries by westernmost point on land (dependent territories included). A selection of dependent territories are listed in "italics" and are not ranked.
The order doesn't always reflect the proximity of the country's territory to the 180th meridian. In such a case there would be three both the very westernmost and the very easternmost countries, territories, or continents Russia, Fiji and Antarctica, since the 180th meridian passes through them on land. Instead for the number of countries, namely Russia, New Zealand, Fiji, United States, and Kiribati that have territory on both sides of the 180th meridian, the given westernmost point of the country is the westernmost point in the direction of travel. Russia, New Zealand, and Fiji have most of their territories west of the 180th meridian, in the Eastern Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the easternmost countries with their territory stretching as far to the east as beyond the 180th meridian into the Western Hemisphere. Conversely, the United States and Kiribati have most of their territories east of the 180th meridian, in the Western Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the westernmost countries with their territory stretching as far to the west as beyond the 180th meridian into the Eastern Hemisphere.

Thompson Pond

Thompson Pond in Pine Plains, New York is a 15,000-year-old glacial kettle pond at the foot of Stissing Mountain. It is the source of Wappinger Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River that drains much of Dutchess County.
The pond and mountain are part of a nature preserve managed by the Nature Conservancy. The pond was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1973 for its calcareous bog, unlike the more common acidic bogs in the Northeast.
History.
Thompson Pond and two other nearby bodies of water, Stissing Lake, and Twin Island Lake, were all originally connected, but separated over time.
The pond is supposedly named for Amos Thompson who settled in the area around 1746.
Thompson pond and Stissing Mountain were the inspiration for the New York State Environment displays in the Warburg Memorial Hall at the American Museum of Natural History built in 1951.
In 1958 the Executive Secretary of the Conservancy, Elting Arnold convinced Briarcliff farms to sell the land to the Conservancy for $20,000 which was raised from public donations.
Visiting.
The preserve is open dawn to dusk, every day of the year for passive recreational and educational use. There are hiking trails around the pond and one that goes to the top of Stissing Mountain.
Plants and Wildlife.
There are more than 387 species of plants in the preserve including pipewort, round-leaved sundew, St. Johnswort and cattails. The surrounding woods include oak, sugar maple, ash, hemlock and hickory trees.
The preserve is part of the migratory flyway, over 162 bird species have been spotted here. There are also 27 types of mammals identified in the preserve.

The Logar Valley (, "Logarjeva dolina") is a valley in the Kamnik Alps, in the Municipality of Solčava, Slovenia. The Slovene name for the valley is of relatively recent coinage and is derived from the Logar farm, which in turn is derived from "Log" (literally, 'swampy meadow'). In 1987, the valley received protected status as a landscape park encompassing .
Geography.
The Logar Valley is a typical U-shaped glacial valley. It is divided into three parts. The lower part is named "Log", the middle part "Plest" or "Plestje" (it is a mostly wooded area), and the upper part "Kot" (literally 'cirque') or "Ogradec" (it is a wooded area with scree slopes). Altogether 35 people live on the isolated farmsteads in the valley.
Peaks.
The Logar Valley is ringed by the following peaks: Strelovec (), Krofička (), Ojstrica (), Lučka Baba (), Planjava (), Brana (), Turska Gora (), and Mrzla Gora (). It terminates in a head wall beneath the Okrešelj Cirque, where the Savinja River starts at an ice-cold spring at an elevation of 1,280 meters and flows to Rinka Falls.
Climate.
Although the Logar Valley is not particularly narrow (about 500 m at its narrowest), inversions are very common due to the influence of a northern anticyclone. Temperature distributions on the slopes are greatly influenced by differences between the sunny and shady areas, which is seen in different snow and ice conditions in the winter.
A walking path (2–3 hours) through the valley leads past a number of points of interest: the source of Black Creek (), wooden logging chutes, a burl-covered ash tree, a charcoal-maker’s hut, and other sights.

1811 German Coast Uprising

The 1811 German Coast Uprising was a revolt of black slaves in parts of the Territory of Orleans on January 8–10, 1811. The uprising occurred on the east bank of the Mississippi River in what are now St. John the Baptist and St. Charles parishes, Louisiana. While the slave insurgency was the largest in US history, the rebels killed only two white men. Confrontations with militia and executions after trial killed ninety-five black people.
Between 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from sugar plantations near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast toward the city of New Orleans. They collected more men along the way. Some accounts claimed a total of 200-500 slaves participated. During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops. They were armed mostly with hand tools.
White men led by officials of the territory formed militia companies to hunt down and kill the insurgents. Over the next two weeks, white planters and officials interrogated, tried and executed an additional 44 insurgents who had been captured. Executions were by hanging or decapitation. Whites displayed the bodies as a warning to intimidate slaves. The heads of some were put on pikes and displayed at plantations.
Since 1995 the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration in January of the uprising, in which they have been joined by some descendants of participants in the revolt.
Background.
The German Coast was an area of sugar plantations, with a dense slave population. According to some accounts, blacks outnumbered whites by nearly five to one. More than half of those enslaved may have been born outside Louisiana, many in Africa.
Fernin F. Eaton believes these figures are too high, noting that the 1810 census recorded slaves in a less than 3:1 ratio to whites in St. Charles Parish, and about 1:1 ratio in St. John Parish. Sugar cane plantations west of New Orleans may have had higher numbers of slaves. Slaveholders fleeing the Haitian Revolution had brought slaves to the region directly from Saint-Domingue, or in 1809 when forced by the Spanish Empire from Cuba. In addition, until 1808, the United States had continued to import enslaved people from Africa and the Caribbean.
In the overall Orleans Territory, from 1803-1811, the free black population nearly tripled, to 5,000, with 3,000 arriving as migrants from Haiti (via Cuba) in 1809-1810. In Saint-Domingue they had enjoyed certain rights as free people of color.
After the US acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Gov. William C.C. Claiborne of the Territory of Orleans struggled with his diverse population. Not only were there numerous French- and Spanish-speaking people, but a much greater proportion of native Africans among the slaves than in more northern US states. In addition, the mixed-race Creole and French-speaking population grew markedly with refugees from Haiti following its successful slave revolution. The American Claiborne was not used to a society with the number of free people of color which Louisiana had, especially in New Orleans. But he worked to continue their role in the militia, which had been established under Spanish rule. He had to deal with the competition for power between long-term French Creole residents and new US settlers in the territory. Lastly, Claiborne was suspicious that the Spanish might encourage an insurrection. He struggled to establish and maintain his authority.
The waterways and bayous around New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain made transportation and trade possible, but also provided easy escapes and nearly impenetrable hiding places for slaves who escaped. Some maroon colonies continued for years within several miles of New Orleans. With the spread of ideas of freedom from the French and Haitian revolutions, European-Americans worried about slave uprisings in the Louisiana area.
According to a paper by Nathan A. Buman,
The rebellion.
A group of conspirators met on January 6, 1811. It was a period when work had relaxed on the plantations after the fierce weeks of the sugar harvest and processing. As planter James Brown testified weeks later, "the black Quamana, owned by Mr. Brown, and the mulatto Harry, owned by Messrs. Kenner & Henderson, were at the home of Manuel André (Andry in some accounts) on the night of Saturday–Sunday of the current month in order to deliberate with the mulatto Charles Deslondes, chief of the brigands." Slaves had spread word of the planned uprising among the slaves at plantations up and down the German Coast.
The revolt began on January 8 at the André plantation. After striking and badly wounding Manuel André, the slaves killed his son Gilbert. "An attempt was made to assassinate me by the stroke of an axe," Manuel André wrote. "My poor son has been ferociously murdered by a horde of brigands who from my plantation to that of Mr. Fortier have committed every kind of mischief and excesses, which can be expected from a gang of atrocious bandittis of that nature."
The rebellion gained momentum quickly. The 15 or so slaves at the André plantation, approximately 30 miles upriver from New Orleans, joined another eight slaves from the next-door plantation of the widows of Jacques and George Deslondes. This was the home plantation of Charles Deslondes, a field laborer later described by one of the captured slaves as the "principal chief of the brigands." Small groups of slaves joined from every plantation which the rebels passed. Witnesses remarked on their organized march. Although they carried mostly pikes, hoes and axes but few firearms, they marched to drums while some carried flags. From 10-25% of any given plantation's slave population joined with them.
At the plantation of James Brown, Kook, one of the most active participants and key figures in the story of the uprising, joined the insurrection. At the next plantation down, Kook attacked and killed François Trépagnier with an axe. He was the second and last planter killed in the rebellion. After the band of slaves passed the LaBranche plantation, they stopped at the home of the local doctor. Finding the doctor gone, Kook set his house on fire.
Some planters testified at the trials in parish courts, run according to French rules and without appeal, that they were warned by their slaves of the uprising. Others regularly stayed in New Orleans, where many had townhouses, 
and trusted their plantations to be run by overseers. Planters quickly crossed the Mississippi River to escape the insurrection and raise a militia.
As the slave party moved downriver, they passed larger plantations, from which many slaves joined them. Numerous slaves joined the insurrection from the Meuillion plantation, the largest and wealthiest plantation on the German Coast. The rebels laid waste to Meuillion's house. They tried to set it on fire, but a slave named Bazile fought the fire and saved the house.
After nightfall the slaves reached Cannes-Brulées, about 15 miles northwest of New Orleans. The men had traveled between 14 and 22 miles, a march that probably took them seven to ten hours. By some accounts, they numbered "some 200 slaves", although other accounts estimated up to 500. As typical of revolts of most classes, free or slave, the insurgent slaves were mostly young men between the ages of 20 and 30. They represented primarily lower-skilled occupations on the sugar plantations, where slaves labored in difficult conditions.
The suppression.
After being injured, Col. André went to the other side of the river to round up a militia organized by planters, who began pursuing the slave rebels.
By noon on January 9, the residents of New Orleans had heard of the insurrection on the German Coast. Over the next six hours, General Wade Hampton I, Commodore John Shaw, and Governor William C.C. Claiborne sent two companies of volunteer militia, 30 regular troops, and a detachment of 40 seamen to fight the slaves.
By about 4 a.m., the troops reached the plantation of Jacques Fortier, where Hampton thought the insurgents had encamped for the night. The insurgents had left hours before Hampton's arrival and started back upriver. Over the next few hours, they traveled about 15 miles back up the coast and neared the plantation of Bernard Bernoudy.
There, planter Charles Perret, under the command of the badly injured André and in cooperation with Judge Saint Martin, had assembled a militia of about 80 men from the opposite side of the river. At about 9 o'clock, this second militia discovered the slaves moving toward high ground on the Bernoudy estate. Perret ordered the militia to attack the slaves. Perret later wrote that there were about 200 slaves, about half on horseback. (Most accounts said only the leaders were mounted, and historians believe it unlikely the slaves could have gathered so many mounts.)
The battle was brief. Within a half hour of the attack, 40 to 45 slaves had been killed and the remainder slipped away into the woods. Perret and Andrée's militia tried to pursue slaves into the woods and swamps, but it was difficult territory.
On January 11, the militia captured Charles Deslondes, whom André considered "the principal leader of the bandits." The militia did not hold him for trial or interrogation. Samuel Hambleton described Deslonde's fate: "Charles had his Hands chopped off then shot in one thigh & then the other, until they were both broken — then shot in the Body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted!"
The trials.
Having suppressed the insurrection, the planters and government officials continued to search for slaves who had escaped. Those captured were interrogated. Officials conducted two sets of trials, one at Destrehan Plantation owned by Jean Noel Destréhan and one in New Orleans. The Destréhan trial, run by the parish court under French law without appeal, resulted in the execution of 18 slaves, whose heads were put on pikes. The plantation displayed the bodies of the dead rebels to intimidate other slaves. One observer wrote, "Their Heads ... decorate our Levée, all the way up the coast, I am told they look like crows sitting on long poles."
The trials in New Orleans, also in the parish court, resulted in the conviction and summary executions of 11 more slaves. Three of these were publicly hanged in the Place d'Armes, now Jackson Square, and their heads were put up to decorate the city's gates.
Outcome.
Whites killed about a total of 95 slaves at the time of the insurrection, and by execution after trials as a result of this revolt. From the trial records, most of the leaders appeared to have been mixed-race Creoles or mulattoes, although numerous slaves in the group were native-born Africans.
Fifty-six of the slaves captured on the 10th and involved in the revolt were returned to their masters, who may have punished them but wanted their valuable laborers back to work. Thirty more slaves were captured, but the whites determined they had been forced to join the revolt by Charles Deslondes and his men, and returned them to their masters.
The heirs of Meuillon petitioned the legislature for permission to free the mulatto slave Bazile, who had worked to preserve his master's plantation. Not all the slaves supported insurrection, knowing the trouble it could bring.
As was typical of American slave insurrections, the uprising was short-lived and quickly crushed by local white forces; it lasted only a couple of days and did not overcome local authorities. Showing planter influence, the legislature of the Orleans Territory approved compensation of $300 to planters for each slave killed or executed. The Orleans Territory accepted the continued presence of US military troops after the revolt, as they were grateful for their presence. The insurrection was covered by national press, with Northerners seeing it arising out of the wrongs suffered under slavery.
No state or federal historical marker commemorates the insurrection, though it is mentioned on the marker for the Woodland Plantation (formerly Andre Plantation): "Major 1811 slave uprising organized here." Despite its size and connection to the French and Haitian revolutions, the rebellion is not thoroughly covered in history books. As late as 1923, however, older black men "still relate the story of the slave insurrection of 1811 as they heard it from their grandfathers." Since 1995, the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration at Norco in January, where they have been joined by some descendants of members of the revolt.
Controversy.
In a 2011 lecture, the independent historian Fernin F. Eaton suggests that evidence is insufficient to support either the premise that the slaves engaged in any uprising, or the claims as to the extent of involvement. Eaton notes evidentiary shortfalls, such as the planter Manuel André (or, Andry) reporting his son, Gilbert, was killed by the slaves. The records of the Archdiocese show that Gilbert had died January 2 and been buried January 3, five days before the uprising.
Eaton considers the reported events in the context of planter and white unrest. They followed by a few weeks a violent uprising by planters and other elites upriver against Spanish rule, and a short-lived challenge to American domination as well. Historians frequently connect that revolt, referred to as the 1810 West Florida Rebellion, to secret initiatives and possible financial underwriting by the federal government under President James Madison. This maneuvering continued into the 1812 East Florida Rebellion, a/k/a "The Patriots' War". Eaton suggests further research is needed to put these reported 1811 German Coast events into the context of the ambivalent loyalties of the planters. Several planters on the German Coast were still pensioners of the Spanish government at that time. The planters and other elite had already been in a state of high alert, not against the slaves, but against the abolitionist sentiment of the American Congress, which had restricted "the African trade" in 1808 and the importation of slaves into Louisiana. In these conditions, they could have panicked at rumors of a rebellion and rounded up "likely" slaves. It had happened before in Louisiana and other southern states.

Fiscal theory of the price level

The fiscal theory of the price level is the idea that government fiscal policy affects the price level: for the price level to be stable (to control inflation), government finances must be sustainable: they must run a balanced budget over the course of the business cycle, meaning they must not run a structural deficit.
It is a unorthodox theory, which contrasts with the usual monetary theory of the price level, where the price level is primarily or exclusively determined by supply of money.
These two contrasting views of prices may or may not contradict one another. By its proponents, the fiscal theory is seen as complementary to the monetary quantity theory. By its detractors, the fiscal theory is seen as incorrect, and either irrelevant or simply wrong-headed.
Statement.
In nominal terms, government must pay off its existing liabilities (government debt) either by refinancing (rolling over the debt, issuing new debt to pay the old) or amortizing (paying it off from surpluses in tax revenue). In real terms, a government can also inflate away the debt: if it causes or allows high inflation, the real amount it must repay will be smaller. Alternatively, it could default on its obligations.
The fiscal theory states that if a government has an unsustainable fiscal policy, such that it will not be able to pay off its obligation in future out of tax revenue (it runs a persistent structural deficit), then it will pay them off via inflating the debt away. Thus, fiscal discipline, meaning a balanced budget over the course of the economic cycle is necessary for the price level to remain stable; unsustainable deficits will require inflation in future.
History.
The fiscal theory of the price level was developed primarily by Eric M. Leeper (1991), Christopher A. Sims (1994), and Woodford (1994, 1995, 2001). It has been criticized by Narayana Kocherlakota and Christopher Phelan, Willem Buiter (2002), Bennett T. McCallum (1999, 2001, 2003), Oscar Arce, and Dirk Niepelt.

HIRF

HIRF is an acronym for High Intensity Radiated Fields and refers to radio frequency energy of a strength sufficient to adversely affect either a living organism or the performance of a device subjected to it. A microwave oven is an example of this principle put to controlled, safe use.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set limits for the amounts of Radio Frequency Energy exposure permitted in a standard work-day.
Radio-Frequency Energy is non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, its effects on tissue are through heating.
Electronic components are Affected via rectification of the RF and a corresponding shift in the bias points of the components in the field.
History.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and industry EMC leaders have periodically met to define the adequacy of protection requirements for civil avionics from outside interference since 1980. In 1986 The FAA Technical Center contracted for a definition of the electromagnetic environment for civil aviation. This study was performed by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center (ECAC). The study has shown levels of exposure to this threat as high as 4 orders of magnitude (10000 times) higher than the then current civil aircraft EMC susceptibility test certification standards of 1 volt/meter (DO-160). This environment was also 2 orders of magnitude higher (100 times) than the then prevailing military avionics systems test standards (MIL-STD 461/462).
Units of measurement.
An RF electromagnetic wave has both an electric and a magnetic component (electric field and magnetic field), and it is often convenient to express the intensity of the RF environment at a given location in terms of units specific to each component. For example, the unit "volts per meter" (V/m) is used to express the strength of the electric field (electric "field strength"), and the unit "amperes per meter" (A/m) is used to express the strength of the magnetic field (magnetic "field strength"). Another commonly used unit for characterizing the total electromagnetic field is "power density." Power density is most appropriately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from an antenna to be located in the "far-field" zone of the antenna.

U.S. Route 2 in Minnesota

U.S. Highway 2 (US 2) is a highway in northwest and northeast Minnesota, which runs from the Red River at East Grand Forks and continues east to Duluth, where the route crosses the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay. The route connects the cities of East Grand Forks, Bemidji, Grand Rapids, and Duluth.
Of the of U.S. 2 in Minnesota, have four lanes, mostly located in the northwest part of the state.
Route description.
US 2 enters the state from the west at the city of East Grand Forks, at the Red River. From the North Dakota state line to Cass Lake, US 2 is a four lane divided highway for . This expressway portion of US 2 in northwest Minnesota passes through the cities of East Grand Forks, Crookston, Erskine, Fosston, Bagley, Bemidji, and Cass Lake.
The portion of US 2 from Bemidji to Cass Lake is officially designated the "Paul Bunyan Expressway".
After Cass Lake, US 2 continues east as a two lane roadway for 40 miles to Deer River.
East of Deer River, US 2 is a four lane divided highway for seven miles (11 km) until the city of Grand Rapids, where it has a junction with US 169.
US 2 then heads southeast as a two lane roadway for to the unincorporated area of Saginaw, where it has an interchange with State Highway 33 (MN 33). The route then continues east for two miles to its intersection with MN 194 at Solway Township.
US 2 then continues southeast for before entering the city of Proctor, where it is the main street through town. The route widens to a three-lane roadway as it approaches its intersection with Boundary Avenue (County Road 14).
The route enters the city limits of Duluth, where it has a junction with Interstate 35 (I-35), US 2 joins that route's freeway. US 2 is concurrent with I-35 for two miles (3.2 km) in West Duluth, proceeding down Thompson Hill.
US 2 then exits the I-35 freeway in West Duluth and crosses the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay, entering the state of Wisconsin and the city of Superior. US 2 then follows Belknap Street in Superior.
Legally, the Minnesota section of US 2 is defined as Routes 8 and 203 in the Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(134). The route is not marked with those numbers.
History.
U.S. Highway 2 in Minnesota was authorized on November 11, 1926. It followed the route of old state Trunk Highway 8 in its entirety. At the time it was marked, it was paved along a short concurrency with U.S. Route 75 north of Crookston and from its junction with then-Trunk Highway 11 (present-day U.S. 53) through Duluth. The remainder was graveled or graded, except for a section west of Bagley which was simply a maintained dirt surface.
The route in Minnesota was completely paved in 1939. The last segment to be completed was between then-State Highway 94 (now Highway 194) at Solway Township and the community of Adolph.
A few short (four-lane) divided highway segments of US 2 were constructed west of Bemidji during the 1960s.
In the present day, from East Grand Forks to Cass Lake, this route is built to expressway standards and a posted speed limit. From Cass Lake to Duluth, there are only a couple of short four-lane divided highway segments, but the non-urban portions of this segment are posted speed limit.

Bipalium

Bipalium is a genus of large predatory land flatworms, terrestrial planarians. They are often loosely called "hammerhead worms" or "broadhead planarians" because of the distinctive shape of their head region. Land planarians are unique in that they possess a "creeping sole" on their ventral side. Several species are considered as invasive to the United States and to Europe. Some studies have begun the investigation of the evolutionary ecology of these invasive planarians.
Feeding habits.
"Bipalium" species are predatory. Some species prey on earthworms, while others feed on mollusks. It has been shown that the flatworms can track their prey. When captured, earthworms will begin to react to the attack, but a flatworm uses the muscles in its body as well as sticky secretions to attach itself to the earthworm to prevent escape. Several studies have indicated that the planarians will cover, or cap the prostomium, peristomium and anterior end to end the violent reaction by the earthworm. To feed on its prey, a flatworm extends its pharynx out from its mouth on the mid-ventral portion of its body and secretes enzymes that begin digestion of the earthworm external to the flatworm. The liquefied earthworm tissues are sucked into the branching gut of the flatworm by ciliary action.
Reproduction.
Reproduction in "Bipalium" may be asexual or sexual and all species are hermaphroditic. "B. adventitium" reproduces sexually and creates egg capsules, which hatch around 3 weeks post-deposition. The egg capsules have a tough exterior and generally contain multiple juveniles. "B. kewense" have rarely been observed using egg capsules as a primary method of reproduction. Asexual fragmentation is the main reproductive strategy in "B. kewense" in temperate regions. Juveniles of this species, unlike "B. adventitium", do not appear the same coloration as parents in their early days.
Taxonomy.
The genus "Bipalium" is one of four genera in the subfamily Bipaliinae, within the family Geoplanidae. Other genera include "Diversibipalium", "Novibipalium" and "Humbertium".
Invasive species.
There is very little known about the ecology of terrestrial planarians, however research has been done on different genera and species, including several native and invasive species in Brazil, "Arthurdendyus triangulatus", "Rhynchodemus" and "Bipalium". Currently, there are four known invasive species to the United States: "B. adventitium", "B. kewense", "B. pennsylvanicum" and "B. vagum". It is believed that these planarians came to the US on horticultural plants.
Individual "Bipalium adventitium" are characterized by a single dark dorsal stripe. They were first discovered in the US in California and New York but have been found in Illinois as well as most northern states "Bipalium kewense" have five dark dorsal stripes and a partial dark collar. They have undergone several name changes since their discovery in North America. "B. kewense" is commonly found across the southern regions of the US. "B. kewense" is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions. " Bipalium pennsylvanicum" is characterized by its dark brown head and three dorsal stripes. Thus far it has only been found in Pennsylvania. "Bipalium vagum" is characterized by two dark dorsal blotches on the head, a thick black band around the neck and three dark dorsal stripes. This species has recently been found in several Gulf Coast states.

I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 9)

"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!" returned to ITV1 and ITV2 for a ninth series on 15 November 2009. It broadcast for three weeks and concluded on 4 December 2009. There was however an additional episode on 7 December 2009, showing all the celebrities and what they did after they left the jungle. This was the first and so far only series to feature a contestant from a previous series, Katie Price made her second appearance on the show, having first appeared the third series in 2004.
Presenters.
Ant & Dec returned to present the main show. Emma Willis and Matt Willis stood down from the role as presenters of "I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here! Now" and were replaced by last year's winner Joe Swash and Caroline Flack for the 2009 series.
Celebrities.
The participants were:
Camps.
The contestants made their way into the jungle in a variety of ways, including sky-diving and hiking. They were situated in the base camp used in previous series.
On Day 5 the camp was split into 2 teams. Each celebrity had to draw a stick and the 2 with a coloured tip were captains and took turns to select their team members. Colin picked Justin, Katie, Sabrina, Jimmy and Joe. Lucy picked Gino, Stuart, George, Sam and Kim.
A trial followed in which they were each positioned under a bucket and using a stick had to balance the contents of the bucket by keeping a button pressed. The winning team was the one that had the final member still standing after all of their opponents had been eliminated. Sabrina was the final contestant to survive, making Colin’s team the winner. They were excluded from the first elimination vote and lived in the relative luxury of base camp.
Base Camp was transformed into a relative jungle paradise. It was furnished with camp chairs, pillows for the beds, dressing gowns, firewood and purified water.
Lucy’s team entered the Exile camp. It was a rat infested clearing containing only the bare essentials, with one log to sit on and only one bed, no shower and only rice and beans to eat.
Over the next 3 days, everyone in Exile Camp participated in a Bush Battle with the winner of each one being allowed to return to Base Camp and gain immunity from the first public elimination vote. The battles were won by Stuart, Kim and George.
While the camp was split, all celebrities selected for Bushtucker Trials competed for 12 stars as usual. However, the first meals were allocated to Base Camp, 1 for each member at the time with any remainder providing food to the Exile team, except for Vile Vending in which Kim competed for 5 stars for Exile while Katie competed for 7 for base camp. This would have placed added pressure on any Exile member who completed a 1-person trial, as they would have had to collect all 12 stars to feed their own camp, however Katie competed in both of them, and, despite trying, failed to get all stars in any of her 6 trials.
On Day 8 the two camps reunited, located at 'Base Camp'.
Results and elimination.
Notes.
Kim and Joe competed in four rounds of both having the same drinks, to win all 8 meals, then completed another with different drinks to win the ninth meal and a chocolate treat. During this final round Kim vomited her "sampuka" on Ant and Dec, and was told it didn't count, but was given another, which she drank.
Ratings.
All ratings are taken from the UK Programme Ratings website, BARB.
Controversy.
Gino D'Acampo and Stuart Manning were initially charged by New South Wales Police after RSPCA Australia complained over their killing and eating of a rat during the show, the killing of animals for performance being illegal.
ITV apologised for not having properly advised the contestants of Australian legislation regarding animal cruelty. However, the charges were dropped against D'Acampo and Manning when ITV accepted responsibility for the incident. They were subsequently charged around £1600.

Tiatr

Tiatr is a type of musical theatre popular in the state of Goa on the west coast of India as well as in Mumbai and with expatriate communities in the Middle East, London and other cities where Konkani speakers have a considerable presence. The dramas are performed in the Konkani language and includes music, dancing and singing. Tiatr performers are called "tiatrists".
Etymology.
The word "tiatr" comes from the Portuguese word for theatre, "teatro". Earlier variations were Theatro, Thiatro and Tiatro.
Description.
Tiatr today revolves around social, religious and political themes. It is considered to be a mirror of Goan culture. The drama consists of 6 or 7 acts called "pordhe" . The acts are interspersed by songs which need not be directly linked to the content or the issues of the main drama. There are 2 or 3 songs between each of the acts.
Tiatrist have always demonstrated a very high degree of social awareness. Most of the themes of tiatr are concerned with social problems confronting the people.
The Tiatr is an instance where mass support plays a crucial role. It is one of those arts which despite centuries of Portuguese suppression and post-liberation neglect from the state governments, has not just survived but also thrived and reinvented itself in many ways. 
Songs.
Songs integral to the plays are known as 'Kants'. Other songs, called "kantaram" are generally either comedic or based on topical, political and controversial issues that are interspersed through the performance. These musical interludes are independent of the main theme of the play. The songs are often satirical and unsparing of the politics and politicians of Goa. The music is provided by a live band including keyboard, trumpet, saxophone, bass guitar and drums.
Tiatr today.
Besides the regular commercial shows, tiatrs are held as part of the celebrations of nearly every church and chapel feast in the State. 
The Goa Kala Academy organises a state level Tiatr competition every year while the Tiatr Academy organises a Popular Tiatr competition for dramas which have exceeded 25 performances .
Tiatr songs and performances are recorded and sold on CD and DVD in Goan and Middle Eastern markets.
Although efforts have been made to preserve the art form as a tradition of Goa, there have been calls for greater recognition of Mumbai based tiatrists.
Khell tiatr.
There is another version of the Tiatr called the "Khell Tiatr", whose performance is restricted to the festivals of Carnival, Intruz and Easter. It differs from the Konkani Tiatr in another respect, that is that its songs are integrated with the main drama and do not deviate in content from it.
History.
Prior to the emergence of tiatr, entertainment in Konkani was mainly through "zagors" and "khells". Both of them had their distinct style. While the "zagor" was more lyrical, the "khell" had dialogues and while the former was more popular in Bardez, the latter was firmly entrenched in Salcete.
Costancio Lucasinho Caridade Ribeiro, more popularly known as Lucasinho Ribeiro, who was from Assagao was seeking employment in Bombay. Passionate about the performing arts, he was highly impressed with the stylised Italian operas performed there. He took up a job for an Italian opera troupe which was touring Indian cities at the time, staging an opera called 'Italian Boy'. When the troupe left India, Lucazinho Ribeiro bought the costumes used in the play with the intention of staging a Konkani play on the style of the Italian Opera. His collaborators in the effort were Caetaninho Fernandes of Taleigao and Joao Agostinho Fernandes of Borda, Margao.
On Easter Sunday, 17 April 1892 the first tiatr performance ever, "Italian Bhurgo", adapted from the Italian play, was staged at the New Alfred Theatre, Bombay. This day is celebrated as "Tiatr Dis" (Tiatr Day). Hence, the Goan art form of tiatr was the product of the meeting of Goan culture and the opera of Italy, which, incidentally is the birthplace of the opera, and the tiatr was born in Bombay. Since there were many different scenes in this tiatr and as it required different stage sets, they thought of dropping the curtain and introducing songs and dances in front of the curtain. This was needed to entertain the audience while the Stage Setting was being done behind the curtain. These songs and dances did not have any relevance to the theme of the play.
The first original tiatr script was written and directed by Joao Agostinho Fernandes, entitled "Belle de Cavel" or "Sundori Cavelchi" in 1895 in Bombay and for all his consistent devotion and encouragement over fifty years, he was conferred the title "Pai Tiatrist" (Father Tiatrist).
Mrs. Regina Fernandes, wife of the playwright Joao Agostinho Fernandes, became the first female tiatr actor in "Bhattkara" on 22 November 1904. "Divorce", a tiatr written and directed by Airistides Dias was the first konkani tiatr to complete 100 performances on 5 October 1980.
Before Tiatr was born, entertainment for the Goan masses was provided by folk dramatic forms namely Zagor & Khell. Zagor was popular in North Goa whereas Khell, which was also known as Fell, was popular in South Goa.
However as time passed the standard of Zagor as well as Khell deteriorated in quality with the introduction of elements of vulgarity. Educated people stopped patronizing the Zagor as well as the Khell. While tiatr was making its presence felt, its original form – the zagors and the khells - were dying a slow death and the zagor finally stopped being performed while the khells continued. 
But in 1956 the khell underwent a dramatic change. Given its state at that time, Antonio Moraes thought it fit to take the khell from the street performance to a stage performance. Helped by his friend and colleague Antonio Marian, the khell was performed on a stage for the first time with a backdrop and other paraphernalia associated with theatre. The first Khell Tiatr 'Sandlolo Put' written and directed by Antonio Moraes was staged on the third day of Carnival of March 1956. However, this form became very popular only in the 1970s when Rosario Rodrigues coined the term khell tiatr and came up with extremely successful shows. Thus, the ground based plays known as Khells evolved onto the stage and further into 'Non-stop dramas' but have now generally dropped this label and are generally referred to as Tiatrs.
Tiatr contributed to keeping the Konkani language alive during Portuguese colonial rule, when Konkani was suppressed. Tiatrists played a major role in the struggle to make Konkani the officials language of Goa.
In 2007, the Government of Goa started the Tiatr Academy of Goa [ TAG ] to facilitate the development of "Tiatr". In 2008 legislation was approved granting 15 lakh rupees to the newly formed Tiatr Academy of Goa.

List of countries by easternmost point

This is a list of countries by easternmost point on land (dependent territories included). A selection of dependent territories are listed in "italics" and are not ranked.
The order does not always reflect the approximately of the country's territory to the 180th meridian. In such a case there would be three both the very westernmost and the very easternmost countries or territories, Russia, Fiji, and Antarctica, as 180th meridian passes through them on land. Instead for the number of countries, namely Russia, New Zealand, Fiji, the United States, and Kiribati, which have territory on both sides of the 180th meridian, the given easternmost point of the country is the easternmost point in the direction of travel. The United States and Kiribati have most of their territory east of the 180th meridian, in the Western Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the westernmost countries with their territory stretching as far to the west as beyond the 180th meridian into the Eastern Hemisphere. Conversely, Russia, New Zealand, and Fiji have most of their territory west of the 180th meridian, in the Eastern Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the easternmost countries with their territory stretching as far to the east as beyond the 180th meridian into the Western Hemisphere.

Emery Theatre

The Emery Theatre, or Emery Auditorium, is a historic, acoustically exceptional theater located in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. The building was constructed in 1911 as the home for a trade school (the Ohio Mechanics Institute), but its large, impressive auditorium was intended for public use.
The design of the Emery Theatre is based on the "isacoustic curve" principles that were first proposed by John Scott Russell. The theatre was built with two balconies and a total of 2,211 seats. It was one of the first concert halls in the United States to have no obstructed seats.
The Emery was the home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, who performed there from January 6, 1912 until 1936 when they moved to the larger Music Hall. The quality of acoustics in the Emery Theatre is legendary. The famous conductor Leopold Stokowski compared its acoustics to that of Carnegie Hall in New York City.
Many world renown performing artists and Broadway stars have appeared at the Emery, including George Gershwin, John Philip Sousa, Bette Davis, Arturo Toscanini, Fritz Reiner, Katharine Cornell, and Russian ballet dancers Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova. Gershwin performed Rhapsody in Blue there with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra shortly after premiering it in New York City.
The Emery Theatre has fallen into disuse, but there is a long-standing community interest in restoring the historic auditorium as a mid-sized performing venue. A modern restoration of the theatre would allow seating for approximately 1,600 guests. 
The current revival effort aims to see the theatre restored as a community arts venue.

The quality of acoustics in the Emery Theatre is legendary. The famous conductor Leopold Stokowski compared its acoustics to that of Carnegie Hall in New York City.
History.
The Emery Theatre was the third in a series of four theatre-style concert halls whose design was derived from Adler and Sullivan's Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, and that were specifically built for the symphony orchestras of their respective cities. The four halls were Carnegie Hall in New York City (1892), Orchestra Hall in Chicago (1904), Emery Auditorium in Cincinnati (1911), and Orchestra Hall in Detroit (1919). Unlike its three sister halls, the Emery Theatre is not freestanding, but is part of a school building. The school was the Ohio Mechanics Institute (OMI), now known as the Ohio College of Applied Science.
By the early 1900s, the OMI's need for a new and larger building was imperative. Preliminary plans were first made public in a promotional brochure, which appeared in the spring of 1906. This brochure showed a four-story building with a small stage, limited backstage facilities, and seating capacity of 1,280, which would have precluded its use by any large-scale theatrical or concert productions. However, outside influence was soon felt in the form of Mrs. Mary M. Emery's philanthropy.
Initially, Mrs. Emery offered to fund only part of the project, but OMI Superintendent John L. Shearer induced her to take on the entire cost of the project and make the whole building a memorial to her husband. Mrs. Emery only asked that the auditorium be "so constructed as to be serviceable for public and private lectures, entertainments, symphony and other concerts. May Festival rehearsals, and for such other entertainment as in the judgement of the Trustees of your institution may be proper." She avoided mention of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, which she hoped would be the new hall's main tenant.
Thanks to new management and a need for a smaller concert hall, the CSO eventually made Emery Theatre its home. The original plan for 1,500 seats would not, however, be enough. A second balcony was added, and the final design helped to make the Emery the first concert hall in the United States to have no obstructed seats.
Design.
Adler’s design helped Harvey Hannaford with the design problems of the Emery Auditorium. Adler used the principle of the "isacoustic curve" first described by John Scott Russell in 1836 not only to calculate the best placement of the Auditorium's main floor and its three balconies, but also to design a series of terraced ellipses that form the ceiling in the front part of the hall. These ellipses helped direct sound evenly throughout the hall. They serve the added function of lessening the overall volume so sound in this large hall is not boomy or cavernous but still resonant, especially for the audience in the second and third balconies.
The final 1911 Emery Auditorium design is derived from the 1909 design. Hannaford made the ellipse shallower, shifted the three coffered ceiling segments toward the stage, and added in the back of the hall a smooth ceiling which is rounded in the front. The ellipse was now the same as Music Hall's ellipse.
The two massive balconies are the most wonderful structural aspects of the 1911 design. Viewed from the stage, the balconies appear to be strung effortlessly between the walls of the hall. Their "secret" lies in two I-beams of structural steel, one for each balcony, over eighty-nine feet long and weighing thirty-three tons each, running the width of the hall. The balconies rest largely on these beams. The beam for the second balcony is tied directly into the back pair of the hall's four main support columns. The anchorage for the lower balcony's beam is less obvious. It appears to float above the main floor because it enters the walls immediately above two sets of exit doors. Actually, it is riveted at both ends into plate girders that span the doors like lintels, and which are in turn attached to the support columns. These plate girders are completely covered over by masonry. An intricate system of cantilever trusses extends out from these I-beams to form the front part of the balconies. This method of balcony construction was relatively new in 1910 and had, to the author's knowledge, never been used in a concert hall in the United States prior to the Emery Auditorium. Its use in two balconies adds further precedent to the Emery's design.
In regard to acoustics, Leopold Stokowski commented on the hall's excellent combination of clarity and blend, and the effective increase in the orchestra's power. Individual instrumental colors could now be heard with greater resolution because of the greater logistical intimacy between audience and orchestra, and because the hall's shape and dimensions created a less diffuse sound, while at the same time creating resonance which blended the clearer, more powerful sound into a well-balanced whole. Unfortunately, we have no record of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra’s sound in the Emery, as they made no commercial recordings and no radio broadcast transcription disks are known to exist from the period the orchestra performed there. 
Timeline of Ownership.
1969 —The University of Cincinnati gains ownership of the building that houses both the Emery Theatre and the Emery Center Apartments after OMI-CAS (Ohio College of Applied Science) becomes incorporated into UC. 
1977-1999 —The American Theatre Organ Society managed the theatre and reduced the seating capacity to 1,360 by closing the second balcony to the public. During this period, silent, sound, and 3D films were shown during the weekends, and organ concerts were performed several times each year.
1988 —OMI-CAS moves to Edgecliff Campus, and the non-theatre classroom portion of the building sits vacant. The University of Cincinnati remains the owner of the building.
1988 —The non-profit Emery Center Corporation (ECC) is created to promote the restoration and sustainable operation of the Emery Theatre. The ECC still maintains the lease for the auditorium portion of the building today.
2001— The Emery Center Apartments Limited Partnership (ECALP) leases the building (excluding the theatre) from UC in order to redevelop the building into market-rate rental apartments and commercial spaces. The theatre portion of the building remains in need of major renovation and continues to be unused.
2008 —A group of over 100 local volunteers from Give Back Cincinnati spends a day cleaning up the dusty theatre.In November, the Cincinnati Entertainment Awards are held at the Emery.[14
2009 —The ECC begins to develop plans to sublease the theatre to the nonprofit The Requiem Project.
Recent community use of the theatre.
Despite the theatre's condition, temporary occupancy permits have been obtained over the past several years to allow the following activities:
Current revival plan.
The non-profit Emery Center Corporation (ECC), formed in 1989, is responsible for re-opening the theatre. In September 2009, the ECC began to work with a non-profits arts company, The Requiem Project, a site-specific non-profit dedicated to the permanent re-establishment of The Emery Theatre, The revival of the Emery Theater is now referred to as "The Requiem Project: Emery Theatre."
Founded in 2008 under the artistic direction of Tina Manchise and Tara Lindsey Gordon, The Requiem Project is a revitalization plan and re-programming of the Emery Theatre, both as a multi-purpose arts venue for diverse and innovative arts programs at an affordable cost, and as an educational resource center for professional development of artists. In addition to opening the theatre’s 1600 seat auditorium for live performances and films, The Requiem Project's programming focuses on increasing employable skills for working artists through teacher certifications in the movement arts, such as Pilates and yoga, and fine arts classes in dance, music, and writing.
The renovation of the Emery Theatre intends to open the building in modular phases, with a full-scale renovation that will include gallery space, a sculpture garden, dance studios, music rooms, alternative performance spaces, and event rental space.
Under the direction of The Requiem Project, two architectural firms were hired to assist in creating the outline and renderings for the overall for the reconstruction project. The firms are John Senhauser Architects, and Westlake Reed and Leskosky. Westlake Reed and Leskosky specialize in the revitalization in historic theatres (The Emery will be the 74th theatre associated with the firm), and Senhauser Architects are historic preservation specialists.
The first event to be held at the Emery under The Requiem Project’s artistic direction was the “11.11.11,” a preview of the Emery and an introduction to the four avenues of the company's public mission, which is the development of an innovative arts destination as a space for creative possibility with the belief that meaningful artistic interactions create community.
The Requiem Project.
One-Year of Continuous Programming
An invaluable step in the overall revitalization project was the sponsorship of one-year of programming (November 2011-November 2012), with the inaugural event being held on November 11, 2011. This event was titled “11.11.11, A Preview of The Emery.” The intent of the “11.11.11” event was to introduce to the community to the kind of programming that could and would happen at The Emery, and to the collaborations and productions that The Requiem Project envisioned at The Emery. 
The intention behind the 2011-2012 year of programming was bi-fold; to highlight the value of The Emery to the local community prior to launching a Capital Campaign, and to demonstrate that the operation of the theatre was a viable business venture. The goal was to illuminate to the community how The Emery could identify itself in Cincinnati, as well as to collect data regarding patron and community support, demographic reach, etc. The information collected in this step helped to provide reliable statistics and a constituency of support that is integral to the implementation of the Capital Campaign.
Among the artists that performed during the first year of programming were The National, Bill Frisell, Dirty Projectors, and Ralph Stanley. The Emery also hosted a film premiere, the Cincinnati Film Festival and the Cincinnati Fringe Festival. Additionally, in collaboration with the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center, the Emery hosted 13 Most Beautiful Songs for Andy Warhol’s Screen Tests performed by Dean & Britta.
Under the direction of The Requiem Project in 2012 The Emery Sessions were commissioned. Emery Sessions are a series of single take (one shot), high-fidelity music videos shot throughout The Emery by acclaimed rock-n-roll photographer Michael Wilson with audio recording by Cameron Cochran, audio mixing by Henry Wilson, and titles and digital juju by Matthew Davis. Sessions have already been filmed with Over The Rhine, Ralph Stanley, Daniel Martin Moore, The Comet Bluegrass All-Stars and many more. All the Emery Session videos are available on YouTube.

White Horse (Taylor Swift song)

"White Horse" is a country music song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman, with Swift's aid. The song was released on December 8, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's second studio album "Fearless". Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift's ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was not what she had perceived of him. It focused on the moment where Swift accepted the relationship was over. "White Horse" is, musically, a country pop song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals. Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to fairytales.
Critically, "White Horse" garnered generally positive reception. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, "White Horse" won the Grammy Awards for Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The song also performed well commercially, although it did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, "Love Story". In the United States, it peaked at number thirteen in the "Billboard" Hot 100 and number two on Hot Country Songs. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song's accompanying music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video features Swift as she decides to end a relationship via phone call. In the video, Swift recalls multiple memories with her love interest, both positive and negative. Swift promoted "White Horse" via live performances, including numerous during the Fearless Tour (2009–10).
Background.
Swift commenced composing "White Horse" almost a year before the release of "Fearless", weeks after composing "Fearless" lead single "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, "Taylor Swift" (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered around recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." About the difference in themes between "White Horse" and "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.
The song was not originally intended to be included on "Fearless", due to Swift believing solemness was already represented accurately on the album; therefore, Swift was planning on including the track on her third studio album, what would become "Speak Now" in 2010. However, when Swift's Los Angeles managing agency set up an appointment with the executive producers of her favorite television series, "Grey's Anatomy", Betsy Beers and Shonda Rhimes, they discussed including Swift's music on the series. Swift chose to play them "White Horse" live with an acoustic guitar. Beers and Rhimes were very impressed and told Swift they would respond her via telephone as soon as they could. Swift decided to not include the track on "Fearless", until the producers responded, which they did not for some time. When "Grey's Anatomy"s representatives called, Swift and Nathan Chapman recorded the song immediately, sent a CD to them, and they decided to use it on the television series. "White Horse" debuted on the fifth season premiere of "Grey's Anatomy", "Dream a Little Dream of Me", on September 25, 2008.
Composition.
"White Horse" is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 55 seconds. It is set in common time and has a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Therefore, it is categorized as ballad. It is written in the key of C major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G3 to A4. "White Horse" follows the chord progression C5–F(add)2–Am7–F(add)2. The song is based upon a pop hook, and has an instrumentation mainly based on acoustic guitar and soft piano, with accents of cello. The production, however, is sparse, leaving an emphasis on Swift's soft and breathy vocals.
The lyrics of "White Horse" are written in first person, with Swift reflecting on an occasion when a relationship, which seemed like a fairytale in the commence, fell apart: "I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale/ I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet/ Lead her up the stairwell." The track spoke about pain and disillusionment, in the clear perspective of a reborn realist. Due to the heartbreak, the protagonist escapes from the small town that she resided in. Several music critics, like Kate Kiefer of "Paste", noted the lyrical disparity between "White Horse" and Swift's previous single, "Love Story", where Swift viewed fairytales in a positive light, with a happy ending. Kiefer assumed that "White Horse" withdrew everything she said in "Love Story".
Critical reception.
August Brown of "The Los Angeles Times" compared the song with Dolly Parton's "Jolene" (1973), saying Parton would have recognized her own predicament in "White Horse" and may have congratulated Swift for attempting to move on. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine called "White Horse" a "lovely ballad" with a prominent hook and deemed it "easily the best song" on "Fearless". However, Keefer stated, "Even 'White Horse' [...] makes use of a well-worn, clichéd image that Swift doesn't use in any novel way." Josh Love of "The Village Voice" thought "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" shined through the lyrics and theme of "White Horse"; Love also mentioned that it was one of "Fearless"' "great songs". Lucy Davies of the BBC said it demonstrated how repetitive the lyrical themes on "Fearless" were. She noted Swift recycled the phrase "face of an angel" from the album's previous track, "Hey Stephen". An uncredited review from "Billboard" stated, "The second single from Taylor Swift's top-selling CD is a beautiful, understated ballad that showcases her skill with a lyric and shines a spotlight on her signature tender, heart-on-her-sleeve vocals." The review stated that the latter was accomplished by the song's production, which made Swift's vocal performance more palpable and emotive. The review also complimented the song, as something everyone could relate to. Kate Kiefer of "Paste" recognized it to be one of Swift's best songs. Sean Dooley of About.com attributed the track's effectiveness to be in how Swift captured the heartbreaking moment. While reviewing "Fearless", Dooley selected "White Horse" as one of the best tracks on the album. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, "White Horse" won the Grammy Awards for Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.
Chart performance.
On the week ending November 29, 2008, "White Horse" debuted and peaked at number thirteen on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Its appearance, along with six other songs, on the chart tied Swift with Hannah Montana (Miley Cyrus) for the female act to have the most songs charting on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the same week, a record later surpassed by Swift herself when she charted eleven songs at once in 2010. The following week, the song dropped to number fifty-six, and, on the week ending April 25, 2009, it spent its last week on the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number forty-four, after a total of twenty-two weeks on the chart. The song is one of thirteen songs from "Fearless" charted within the top forty of the "Billboard" Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top forty entries from a single album. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments exceeding one million copies. As of August 2012, "White Horse" has sold 1,766,000 copies in the United States.
The single debuted at number thirty-seven on "Billboard" Hot Country Songs on the week-ending December 12, 2008. It jumped at number twenty-six on the following week, the biggest jump of the week. On the week ending February 14, 2009, it entered the top ten at number ten, scoring Swift's seventh consecutive top ten hit on the chart. It peaked at number two on the week-ending April 4, 2009 and held there on the following week before dropping at number seven. It charted for a total of twenty weeks on "Billboard" Hot Country Songs.
"White Horse" debuted at number twenty-seven in Canada on the week ending November 29, 2008. On the week ending January 24, 2009, "White Horse" peaked at number forty-three in Canada. It was certified gold by Music Canada for sales of 40,000 digital downloads. In Australia, the track entered at its peak at number forty-one on the week ending February 22, 2009. In United Kingdom, "White Horse" debuted and peaked at number sixty on the week ending March 21, 2009. It stayed on United Kingdom for two weeks.
Music video.
The accompanying music video for "White Horse" was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take and how to make the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was the person who someone was unfaithful to, but the one who someone was unfaithful with: "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series "", where she acknowledged him to be "cute", and later on "One Tree Hill", where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.
The video was shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, on the day of filming, it rained heavily, something which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.
The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as they speak via telephone. He begins, "All I want is you. Do you love me?" She affirms, and he asks for another chance. The video transitions to Swift sitting on the living room floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashback to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced in the beginning of the video, with Colletti repeating, "Will you give me another chance?" A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her sitting beside the fireplace.
Live performances.
On her first televised performance of "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown as she sat on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief, and on "Dancing with the Stars". Swift performed "White Horse" on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, standing at the edge of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang "White Horse" in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of "The Washington Post" reported, "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" Swift said in a 2012 interview with "Cosmopolitan" that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it."

Elasto Mania

Elasto Mania (also known as Elma) is a physics-simulation game released in 2000. It claims to be "based on a real physical model." It explores the notion of elastic motorcycles. The goal of each level is to collect every apple (disappearing by contact) spread throughout it, and then to touch the flower (the "exit" object). Some people, especially the ones part of online groups such as "Mopolauta", play the game trying to finish levels as fast as possible, while others, mostly quite-new-to-the-game players, simply concern themselves with the accomplishment of levels, often first requiring figuring out a way for them to be solved. Ultimately, though, experienced players are motivated by the objective of finishing levels in the least amount of time possible, trying either to settle down personal, or world, records. That contributes to setting the stage for serious competition, especially in the official game levels.
Gameplay.
The player controls a motorbike rider, and has to restart the level anytime his head or bike's wheels touch a "killer" (seen as a rotating spiky wheel), or his head touches a solid structure (such as a wall). All the apples in a level must be collected before the player can touch the flower and proceed to the next level. A few levels contain apples that change the direction of gravity, causing the motorcycle to drive on the walls or on the ceiling, although those are quite unpopular. Only the head and wheels of the driver may interact with the level. His body may overlap walls without injury, allowing for bizarre-looking situations, such as hanging upside down with the wheels on top of a thin floating island, with the rest of the motorcycle and the driver's body overlapping the island and his head being some distance below it.
Accelerating the motorcycle uninterruptedly slowly raises its front wheel as the balance shifts. Failure to modify the vehicle's balance results in overturn, causing the driver to hit his head on the ground. This can be prevented by periodically briefly releasing the accelerator, to balance the torque of the back wheel with gravity. The brake applies to both wheels simultaneously. Because of the infinite friction between the wheels and the ground in the game, if the brake is not used carefully, the rider will abruptly be thrown over the front wheel.
Rotating left and right, known as volting, is accomplished by the rider either pushing or pulling on the handlebars. This maneuver is used to climb obstacles and otherwise pass through broken ground, and also allows the motorcycle to land on the ground wheels down after a jump. Turning around causes the driver and motorcycle frame to rotate as a paper silhouette in a comical fashion while the wheels remain in place, causing the front wheel to become the back wheel and vice versa. One of the most unique properties of the physical model is the elasticity of the bike frame, allowing for example the wheels to extend corresponding to angular momentum.
The physical model provides for wide range of tricks that can be performed by experienced players. These range from subtle maneuvers to increase speed to more dramatic effects, such as an exploit of a reproducible bug in the physical model, allowing for the bike to be propelled some distance up in the air.
Versions.
"Elasto Mania" was created by Balázs Rózsa as a sequel to the 1997 game titled "Action SuperCross". The two main differences between the two games are the slight change in physics and the addition of twelve internal levels. The free demo version contains 18 official levels, while the full one contains 54. In addition to these official "internal" levels, many "external," fan-created levels can be found online, in some cases gathered in "level packs".
The latest official patch for Elasto Mania is version "1.11a," while the latest-prior-to-EOL-era Unofficial patch is version "1.2 very final," the latter having been coded by Hibernatus, a so-nicknamed member of the game community.
Development of unofficial patches sprang as an effort to bring together various implementations that brought modification to the game, for example a replay merger, an enhanced replay viewer, and an alovolt patch. This latter implementation was forum-thread discussed in 2002 as a solution to the growing climate of unfairness surrounding the fact that an increasing number of players had trouble, due to differences in terms of hardware, performing an essential move: the "alovolt."
Online content.
In the beginnings of the history of the game, players would join the IRC channel "#battle" and participate in what is known as "battles," that is, a competition for the best score in innovative levels. More precisely, players shared levels of their creation with one another, one at a time, and except-the-level-author players had a fixed-by-level-author time to drive and post the best time (or, in some cases, highest number of apples) back in channel. The winner would then have to share the replay matching his announced-before-deadline score with other players as a proof of his actual performance. Doing so would also in some cases have a second purpose, being to satisfy potential curiosity from the part of the other battlers on how such a score could possibly have been achieved.
In January 2006, "Battle Elma," a patch, having been developed by a member of the community nicknamed "milagros," allowing in-game (that is, without having to rely on IRC) access to battles, in addition to featuring an in-game chat client and the ability of real-time seeing other players, was released to the general public.
In August 2010, an even-more enhanced patch, too having been developed by milagros, called "Elma Online," or, in its short form, simply "EOL," was released. Through the inclusion of various additional functions, it is feeling more polished than the thus-made-obsolete "Battle Elma." EOL, also referenced to as version "1.3," was launched conjointly with the Elma Online website, maintained by another member, this one nicknamed "Kopaka." The latter site features, among others, miscellaneous instant statistics, and the ability of browsing previously battled levels, examining their layout, both their battle-time and all-time standings, downloading its shared associated replays, commenting and rating them, and more.
