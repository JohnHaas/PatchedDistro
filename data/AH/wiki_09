Puketiro Wind Farm

The Puketiro Wind Farm is a renewable energy project being developed by the Greater Wellington Regional Council on Puketiro Forest land owned by the council near Pauatahanui, north of Wellington, New Zealand. After a tender process in 2006, RES NZ Ltd was selected to develop the project.
It is planned for approximately 40 wind turbines with a capacity of up to 130 MW.
Wide public consultation was undertaken during early development of the project. 1300 submissions were received, with over 90% in favour. Nonetheless, a group of residents (Pauatahanui Futures Society Inc.) sought an injunction in May 2008 to stop the wind farm from proceeding. The Greater Wellington Regional Council has since withdrawn permission for the three turbines that were to be installed in Battle Hill Farm Forest Park, and banned all turbines from the park.

David Campos

David Campos (born September 28, 1970), is a Guatemalan-American attorney and member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors representing District 9. The district consists of Bernal Heights, part of Portola and the Inner Mission and it elected him on November 4, 2008 in the 2008 San Francisco elections. 
Early life and career.
Campos was born in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. Escaping from the Guatemalan Civil War, he immigrated with his parents and two sisters to the United States illegally. Although he did not know English, Campos graduated at the top of his class at Jefferson High School in South Central Los Angeles. Applying as an international student, Campos received scholarships to Stanford University, applied for legal status through a job, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1993. In 1996, Campos graduated from Harvard Law School and became a permanent resident of the United States while attending. Campos worked as a lawyer in private practice and then a Deputy City Attorney for San Francisco. As Deputy City Attorney, Campos was lead counsel in the school desegregation consent decree of the San Francisco Unified School District, sued the gun industry, and represented the city against PG&E and other energy companies.
San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
Campos took office one month before the other freshman supervisors elected in November 2008: his predecessor, Tom Ammiano resigned from the Board of Supervisors in early December on the day he took his seat in the California State Assembly and mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Campos to the vacant supervisorial seat on December 4, 2008. Campos, like Ammiano, is openly gay.
As Supervisor, Campos introduced legislation in August 2009 that would bar local authorities from notifying the federal government about illegal immigrant juveniles who were arrested until said juveniles were convicted of their charged crimes. Last year, following the arrest of illegal immigrant Edwin Ramos for a triple murder, Mayor Newsom amended the sanctuary city policy of San Francisco to allow the city to refer juvenile illegal immigrant convicted of felonies to federal authorities for deportation. San Francisco had also been referring such youth arrested but not yet tried in court to federal authorities. In an editorial for the "San Francisco Chronicle", Campos stated that his proposal "strikes a balance between the former city policy that failed to report people who should have been reported, and the current one, which in essence violates the right of these young people to a hearing on the accusations against them and can ultimately tear them from the protection of their families" and that he believed "every person has the right to a hearing before being punished and is innocent until proven guilty."
State Assembly campaign.
On August 1, 2013, accompanied by his partner of 17 years, Phil Hwang, Campos filed papers at San Francisco City Hall to run for the California State Assembly seat of Tom Ammiano who is being termed out.

Abyssobrotula galatheae

Abyssobrotula galatheae is a species of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, and the only species in its genus. It is the deepest-living fish known; one specimen, trawled from a depth of 8,370 m (27,453 ft) in the Puerto Rico Trench in 1970, holds the record for the deepest fish ever captured. The first examples of this fish were misidentified by Staiger as "Bassogigas profundissimus", before being described as a new species by Jørgen Nielsen in 1977. The species name refers to the research ship "Galathea", which captured the first specimens.
Distribution and life history.
Though uncommon, this species is known from the tropical and subtropical waters of all oceans. It occurs in the abyssal and hadal zones below a depth of 3,110 m (10,203 ft). It is bottom-dwelling in nature, although one individual has been captured from the water column in the Gulf of Panama. Its diet consists of polychaete worms and crustaceans, such as isopods and amphipods. Reproduction is oviparous, possibly with pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass as in other members of the family.
Description.
"A. galatheae" has a short head with a downward inflection, a swollen snout, and an inferior mouth. The body is soft, with a tapering tail and loose, transparent skin. Both the body and the head are covered with scales. The teeth are small and pointed, arranged in irregular rows; the two median and single pair of basibranchial (on the most ventral gill arch) tooth patches are distinctive for this species. The eyes are tiny, deep-set, and hidden. They are unlikely to be functional, but there is a well-developed system of sensory pores on its head. The lateral line is only visible on the frontmost part of the body and lacks developed pores.
Externally, "A. galatheae" can be distinguished from other deep-sea ophidioids by its long pectoral fins, which contain only 10-11 fin rays each, and its flat, weakly developed opercular spine. The long dorsal and anal fins contain 97-116 and 76-96 rays respectively. The pelvic fins and caudal fin are small and contain 2 and 8 rays respectively. The coloration is yellowish; the branchial cavity is black and the peritoneum dark brown. The skeleton is well-ossified, consistent with a benthic lifestyle; there are 18-21 precaudal vertebrae. It grows to at least 16.5 cm (6.5 in) long.

RS-127,445

RS-127,445 is a drug which acts as a potent and selective antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, with around 1000x selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The role of the 5-HT2B receptor in the body is still poorly understood, and RS-127,445 has been a useful tool in unravelling the function of the various systems in which this receptor is expressed.

Acton Supermarket closure.
In October 2007 the Board of Directors made a decision not to renew the license of the Acton Supermarket owned by Pijpers Holdings Pty Ltd. Board Chair Chris Steel claimed the decision was made on the basis of the continued viability of the Union's business operations which had suffered as a result of the Federal Government's "Higher Education (Abolition of Upfront Student Union Fees) Amendment Act 2005" that had cut the Union's revenue by around $213 000 per annum. Under an alternative business model it was proposed that the ANU Union would incorporate a supermarket into its own retail operations.
The closure resulted in a Facebook group called 'Keep the ANU Supermarket' with over 1000 members. A petition with over 1500 signatures was also raised by the supermarket owners and made to ANU Vice-Chancellor Ian Chubb. The protesters claimed that the ANU Union would sell stock at higher prices than the independently run Acton Supermarket.
In May 2008 a new licensee of the Union opened a 3 store in the previous location of the Acton Supermarket and the ANU Union refurbished part of its own Union Shop to accommodate a new supermarket.

<doc id="20564967" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20564967" title="Daughters of Destiny (novel)">
Daughters of Destiny (novel)

Daughters of Destiny is a 1906 adventure novel written by L. Frank Baum, famous as the author of the Oz books. Baum published the novel under the pen name "Schuyler Staunton," one of his several pseudonyms. (Baum arrived at the name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle, Schuyler Stanton.)
The 1906 edition of the book featured eight illustrations, three by Thomas Mitchell Pierce and five by Harold DeLay. Pierce was a son-in-law of Baum's sister Harriet Alvena Baum Neal; he contributed illustrations to Baum's 1898 poetry collection "By the Candelabra's Glare".
Baum had originally intended to call his novel "The Girl in the Harem".
Adult Fiction.
Overall, Baum dedicated his literary career to writing for children. For a brief period in the middle of the twentieth century's first decade, though, he made a concentrated effort to write for an adult audience as well. This effort produced two other novels in addition to "Daughters of Destiny" — "The Fate of a Crown" (1905), the first Schuyler Staunton novel, and "The Last Egyptian" (1908), published anonymously.
Writing to entertain, Baum chose exotic locales and melodramatic elements for these books. "The Fate of a Crown" is set in Brazil, and deals with the revolution of 1889; "Daughters of Destiny" is set even farther afield, in Baluchistan. In Baum's fiction, Baluchistan is still an independent state, though the region had fallen under the sway of the British Empire in the later nineteenth century.
Islam.
Given his setting and subject, Baum's book had to involve the religion of Islam and an Islamic culture. While his text does deliver some stereotypical "dog of an infidel" dialogue, Baum for the most part takes a serious and respectful approach to Islam — something that was far from universal among Americans and Westerners of his generation. Baum recognizes the existence of Sunni Islam (he uses the term "Sunnite"), with its Imams ("Imaum"). Significantly, he introduces a "Grand Mufti" named Salaman in Chapter 15 of his book, and portrays him as a man of real and profound spirituality and wisdom.
Perhaps most notably, Baum's hero is a half-Persian, half-American Muslim who marries the Christian American heroine, with no mention of religious conversion.
Synopsis.
The American Construction Syndicate wants to build a railroad across Baluchistan, as part of their plans for global development. The company appoints a commission, headed by Colonel Piedmont Moore, to obtain the right of way from the Baluchi ruler. Moore chooses his personal friend and physician Dr. Warner as his second in command; and with commendable nepotism he selects his son Allison Moore as the commission's surveyor. Dr. Warner's ebullient daughter Bessie wants to come along, and solicits Moore's daughter Janet to come too; the young women will by chaperoned by Bessie's Aunt Lucy. (Col. Moore is secretly pleased that his daughter Janet will make the trip; she has been melancholy after an unhappy love affair, with a man the Colonel regards as a thief and scoundrel.)
The Americans travel to Baluchistan, and promptly get themselves imbroiled in a succession conflict. The reigning Khan of the country is dying, and two cousins vie for the crown. One, Kasam, is masquerading as their guide. What follows is a complex but tightly-woven plot that involves subterfuge and conspiracy, poisonings and attempted assassinations, sword fights and a pursuit in the desert, a scheming "femme fatale", disguises and false identities — all the ingredients of melodrama.
In the end, Prince Kasam's rival Ahmed (or Hafiz) inherits the throne of Baluchistan — but he yields it to Kasam so he can return to the United States with the heroine, Janet Moore. It is revealed that Ahmed/Hafiz is actually Howard Osborne, the man Janet had previously loved (and secretly married, seven years before). Osborne had nobly but foolishly taken the blame for an embezzlement actually committed by Allison Moore, the Colonel's son and Janet's brother. Once all the secrets are out, the difficulties are resolved; and the requisite happy ending is achieved. And Bessie stays behind to marry Prince Kasam, and become the Khanum of Baluchistan.
Notably, Ahmed/Hafiz/Osborne abdicates his throne in part for personal reasons, but also because he thinks it would be bad for the country to be ruled by someone deeply influenced by American culture. It is better, he thinks, for the people of Baluchistan to maintain their traditional way of life than to be thrust into the frenetic modern world — an interesting rejection, on the author's part, of imperialism and the idolatry of progress.
Biases.
"Daughters of Destiny" was reprinted in the 1998 issue of the annual "Oz-story Magazine", with new illustrations by Eric Shanower. That publication was accompanied by a notice that the story "contains a number of offensive stereotypes. Fortunately, they have very little bearing on the story." The comic character David the Jew, the Americans' interpreter, would be offensive to the sensibilities of many modern readers.
In his thoughtful and deliberative frame of mind, Baum was in favor of tolerance and against bigotry of all types; this is reflected in "Daughters of Destiny" and in other of his books. (For pertinent examples, see "Sky Island" and "Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea".) Yet he was not, and could not have been, a man with a mindset of modern political correctness. Most often when writing humorously (or attempting to do so), as with David the Jew in this book, Baum willingly exploited the ethnic and racial stereotypes that were current in his era. (See also "", "The Woggle-Bug Book", and "Father Goose's Year Book".)

History.
The HT4 tours began on January 10, 2009 as the eco-adventure history on wheels with about 5 participants. The original tours were written up in the Miami Herald, Hollywood Gazette and other articles. 
The company was started as the owner became aware of the intriguing history and tradition unique to Hollywood (FL), with its early beginnings in the 1920s, the visionary City founder, Joseph Young and the current focus of the City government on investing in art and culture. From the beginning the City embraced the idea of a city-wide bike tours. The distances were adjusted and the word "history on wheels" was changed to "eco-adventure kewl bicycle tours" to make the events more appealing to tourist and the general public.

Histoire de Pen

Histoire de Pen (also released internationally as Inside, and in the United Kingdom as Banged up) is a Québécois film directed by Michel Jetté and released in 2002, about a young man's time in a penitentiary. It is based on Léo Lévesque's collection of prison stories "Contes en coup de poing". The film was classified 13+ in Québec and 18+ in the United Kingdom, and features Emmanuel Auger, Karyne Lemieux and David Boutin.
Plot summary.
19-year-old Claude begins a 10-year sentence at a penitentiary. Rousseau, a member of Tarzan's gang, attempts to rape him soon after his entry, but Claude is not a novice at fighting and dissuades him from further attempts. Tarzan puts out a contract to assassinate him.
The leader of a rival gang, Zizi Grenier, reveals the contract to Claude and offers his protection if Claude will fight for him. The two gangs hold public boxing events to avoid all-out war, with disputed territories put on the line. Claude accepts, but over the course of these duels learns of the power games playing out in the background.
Claude becomes friends with Lucia (a transvestite) and Jacques (a schizophrenic). He tells them about his love for a girl named Karine and their misadventures which led to his imprisonment, including petty theft, car theft, drug use, an attempted armed robbery gone wrong, and finally involuntary manslaughter during their escape. Lucia is later found dead in her cell.
Claude quits the fights, and befriends a man known as "the Phantom". After Claude is raped with the secret backing of the prison administration, the Phantom helps him escape by illicitly getting him into the prison workshop, and hiding him in a locker shipped out of the prison.
Claude rejoins Karine in her drug business, but on a delivery comes across one of the gang members who aided in his rape, arranges a meeting, and murders him. He is arrested and returned to the penitentiary, to learn of Jacques' suicide. Soon after he is subdued when he learns that he has AIDS, and at the Phantom's request is transferred to a minimum-security prison. The movie ends with a letter from the Phantom to Karine informing her of his transfer.

Kill Memory Crash

Kill Memory Crash is an Electronic band from Chicago, Illinois. They originally formed around 1998 as a duo (Alex SanFaçon and Adam Sieczka), and made an almost self-imposed exile from the music industry due to their indifferences to the popular styles of Electronic music at the time. Kill Memory Crash eventually became known for their subversive lyrical themes and dark musical style, blurring the boundaries between industrial, techno, electro, pop, and rock. 
They signed with Ghostly International in 2002 and released their first full length album "American Automatic" in 2005 (the follow-up to their mini-LP, "When The Blood Turns Black"). In 2008 they were joined by live percussionist (and DJ) Gabriel Palomo of Zuvuya Recordings, who was introduced to them through a mutual friend.

<doc id="20565106" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20565106" title="Vermont Route 62">
Vermont Route 62

Vermont Route 62 is a short state highway in Washington County, Vermont, United States. The road was designed to serve as a connector between Interstate 89 and the industrial and commercial centers of Berlin and Barre, akin to the three-digit spur interstates that are present throughout the United States. Unlike those roads, however, Route 62 is not a fully grade separated limited-access highway, having five signaled intersections with local roads over the course of its route. 
When established in 1970, it was not initially assigned a route number, but informally known as the "Berlin Hospital Connector,". Until the mid-1970s, the road ended adjacent to Central Vermont Medical Center, connecting to the Berlin State Highway, which runs a southeasterly course to the Edward F. Knapp State Airport. It was only after 1974, once the road had been extended to its present course, that it became known as Route 62. 
This road, as with other new arterial road construction, spurred further development around the Berlin Corners area, an unincorporated village within the town that is generally considered the main village of Berlin. Within Barre, most of the road passed through areas either previously developed, or where development was considered impractical because of the terrain. 
Today, the road is a heavily used artery, relative to the population of the area, with a maximum AADT of 18,000 vehicles, as of a 2008 estimate. Even with the road being mostly restricted to per hour, as with the majority of other State-maintained thoroughfares in Vermont, and with no grade separation between it and other roads, the highway is designed to enable drivers to maintain a constant speed throughout their journey. Signage is generally sized and placed in the manner of an Interstate Highway, and with three exceptions - one in Berlin and two in Barre - all turns are executed from roadway dedicated to that purpose, be those lanes with exclusive signals, or in two cases, ramps.
Route description.
Interstate 89 to Berlin Mall Rd..
Route 62 starts at Exit 7 of Interstate 89 in Berlin. From that point, and for most of the road's length, it is a divided highway with two through lanes in each direction. For the first , the road travels through a wooded swampland before intersecting with Paine Turnpike. 
Close to the intersection are one of Berlin's Fire Departments, as well as the town's Elementary School. With regard to commercial development, a motel and restaurant are amongst the longer-standing establishments, each overlooking the roadway. A well used, but sparsely signed Park and Ride lot is on the other side of the highway.
From there, the road continues east, curving north before the next intersection. As opposed to the previous intersection, this one, with Berlin Mall Road, is completely undeveloped, surrounded throughout by woods. The southwest corner of the intersection is land that belongs to the Elementary School, within which is a nature trail used by educators to educate students about ecology and the pre-development environment of the area. 
Even as the road ostensibly is an exclusive service road to the Berlin Mall, it is actually a town thoroughfare, that, while directly between the mall and its parking lots, continues past a few auto dealerships and intersects with another town road. There is a dedicated left turn lane and signal for eastbound (away from Interstate) traffic. While opposing traffic can turn right, any traffic to the mall from that direction is provided with alternate methods further back to get there.
Berlin Mall Rd. to Berlin State Highway.
Continuing its northerly path, the road intersects with Fisher Rd. and Airport Rd. Adjacent to the intersection is the Central Vermont Medical Center, the primary care center in the Barre/Montpelier area. Further along Fisher Rd. is the other end of Berlin Mall Rd. - most drivers from Barre turn onto there as opposed to continuing on Route 62. On Airport Rd. is the Edward F. Knapp State Airport, as well as the town's primary industrial area, with some light manufacturing facilities as well as the regional hubs for UPS and FedEx. 
Approaching the intersection on East 62, drivers are advised to choose a travel lane based on whether they are going to Barre or Montpelier. This is because approximately after the Fisher Rd./Airport Rd. intersection, the road intersects with the termini of the Berlin State Highway. While there are dedicated left turn lanes in each direction, the right-turn lanes lead to short ramps for traffic to exit the road without having to come to an absolute stop. 
The setup of this intersection, along with the proximity of the Berlin State Highway split, makes this section of road problematic for westbound (towards I-89) travelers (see diagram at left). While Route 62 maintains two through lanes, drivers entering from the Berlin State Highway merge with the highway at a well signed and routinely enforced yield - the nature of the traffic on the main road usually means those drivers are coming to a complete stop before entering. Two things present potential complications - 
In opposition to the weaving and other conflicts in the westbound road, eastbound travelers have it much easier. As drivers have been provided ample warning prior to Fisher Rd., with an additional overhead gantry between the two intersections, the right travel lane becomes an exit-only lane for the Berlin State Highway. Additionally, an overly wide hard shoulder continues for a short distance after the split, in case a driver happened to be stuck in the wrong lane or changed their mind at the last second.
Berlin State Highway to Barre.
While the Berlin State Highway continues the northerly path, down a long hill into a heavily developed commercial area colloquially known as 'Lower Berlin' (in deference to the elevation change), Route 62 curves east, descending the same range. While descending the hill, the roadway becomes undivided and is reduced to three lanes - one heading downhill and two heading uphill. Drivers heading downhill are afforded a view of Barre's North End and the mountainous terrain that is north and east of the city. 
At the bottom of the hill, the roadway re-divides and resumes having two lanes in each direction. Through this area, the roadway is completely undeveloped, as the road traverses a flat that is only the width of the road. Drivers can look out and over the eastern edge of development, once exclusively large stately homes, but now some businesses and smaller starter homes, along Route 302 in Berlin. 
The road enters a more developed area of Barre city, and the speed limit is reduced to per hour. Shortly after is an intersection with Berlin St., the historic road from the North End of Barre to Berlin (hence its name). Turning left from East 62 onto Berlin St. is a shortcut to Route 302, particularly west, used by some locals. However, at that street's intersection with 302, a large building creates a significant blind spot requiring drivers to partially obstruct traffic on 302 to see around it. A traffic island at the intersection that does not prohibit, but by its design discourages, all left turns at the intersection, makes it worth a driver's time to continue on Route 62. As Route 62 has supplanted the original purpose of Berlin St., right turns from either direction are usually taken by local traffic only. Thus, unlike the other intersections, right-turning traffic shares the travel lane with through traffic. 
From Berlin St. to the road's terminus, the road somewhat resembles expressways in more urban cities, with the elevated nature of the road above all other terrain (though not on an actual constructed skyway), and the obvious appearance of the road being placed there long after the surrounding streets and buildings. The road continues east until a sharp turn north right before the final intersection. At this point the roadway crosses an occasionally used railroad, and Route 62 "technically" ends about 50 feet from the intersection with Vermont Route 14 and US 302, where the speed limit drops to the city-wide mandated per hour. This intersection is prone to backups and delay from all approaches, as it is the convergence of three signed roads, two of which form a concurrency east into the main commercial area of Barre. Adding to the delay is the fact that no dedicated turn lanes exist from Route 62 - this being more a space constriction (abutting properties) versus a deliberate choice by the city.

14&quot;/50 caliber gun

The 14"/50 caliber gun was a naval gun mounted on - and s. These ships also featured the first "three-gun" turrets, meaning that each gun in each turret could be "individually sleeved" to elevate separately (however, they could be linked so they would elevate as a unit, similar to the triple turrets on other Navy ships). The 14"/50 caliber guns were designated as Mark 4 and 6, with later versions known as Mark 7, 11, and B. These guns were more powerful than the main gun mounted on the previous two classes of US battleships (the and es), the 14"/45 caliber gun.
History.
The , 50 caliber gun was the weapon chosen as the main armament on the s when they were originally designed, but it was later switched to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun in a 1917 redesign. The ships were eventually canceled in 1922 after the Washington Naval Treaty was signed.
The 14"/50 caliber gun was designed in 1916 and entered service in 1918 on the s. The guns were capable of firing a armor-piercing (AP) projectile at an angle of 15 degrees, to a range of . Each gun weighed approximately , including the breech, and was long. The propellant charge used for the ammunition weighed and was contained in four bags.
A newer version of the 14"/50 caliber gun, Mark B, was designed in 1937. It was the original gun intended for use on the s. Although it was simpler and lighter than the older versions, the Mark B was the most powerful 14 inch weapon ever designed by the United States. However, the prototype of this gun was not completed.
Naval service.
The 14"/50 caliber gun was installed on five battleships: , , , , and . Although both "Tennessee" and "California" were damaged during the attack on Pearl Harbor, both of these ships' guns, along with the other three, were used in the Second World War in shore bombardment duty. "Mississippi", "Tennessee", and "California" all participated in the last line battle to date: the Battle of Surigao Strait. As shore bombardment platforms, these five battleships participated in all phases of the war, such as the Aleutian Islands Campaign ("Idaho", "Tennessee"), the Battle of Kwajalein ("New Mexico", "Mississippi", "Idaho", "Tennessee"), and the Battle of Guam ("New Mexico", "Idaho", "Tennessee", "California").
Railway artillery.
During World War I, five of the 14"/50 caliber guns served as railway guns on the Western Front in France.

<doc id="20565286" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20565286" title="2009 International Bowl">
2009 International Bowl

The 2009 International Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game between the Connecticut Huskies (UConn) and the Buffalo Bulls at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on January 3, 2009. The game was the final contest of the 2008 NCAA Division I-Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I-FBS) football season for both teams, and ended in a 38–20 victory for Connecticut. UConn represented the Big East Conference (Big East) in the game; Buffalo entered as the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion.
Connecticut was selected as a participant in the 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No. 12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team would not be allowed to play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50 years later.
The game began at 12:00 PM EST. Connecticut, led by running back Donald Brown's 208 yards rushing, dominated the first half statistically, but found themselves down 20–10 midway through the second quarter because they committed six fumbles, five of which were recovered by Buffalo. UConn would close the gap to 20–17 by halftime, and take the lead for good late in the third quarter off a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tyler Lorenzen to tight end Steve Brouse. The Connecticut victory was sealed when, late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy threw a pass that was intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston and returned 100 yards for a touchdown.
UConn junior running back Donald Brown was named player of the game. He finished with 261 rushing yards and one touchdown; his 2,083 rushing yards for the 2008 season was best in the NCAA. Following the game, Brown declared his eligibility for the 2009 NFL Draft; he would become the first Connecticut player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round.
Team selection.
The International Bowl had contracts with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences that allowed them to select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned that they would not be allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December 7, 2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.
Buffalo accepted an invitation to the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Although in past years the MAC champion had been invited to the Motor City Bowl, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to Division I-A and joining the MAC in 1999.
The Bulls and Huskies had been frequent opponents during the previous decade as both programs made the transition from Division I-AA to Division I-A. The two teams played each other in six consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2005, with Connecticut winning five of the six contents. The 2005 game, won by UConn 38–0, was the most recent meeting between the two teams. Overall, the Huskies and Bulls had played each other 16 times since their first meeting in 1939, with Connecticut holding a 12–4 advantage in the all-time series. Prior to the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had signed a contract to play a four-game, home-and-home series beginning in 2010.
Buffalo.
Entering 2008, the Bulls sought to build off of their 2007 season, where they shared the MAC East championship but did not appear in the championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.
Buffalo opened the season stronger than expected, with a dominant home win over the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP), 42–17. This was followed by a closer-than-predicted loss at heavily favored Pittsburgh, 27–16. Buffalo's third game and conference opener, versus Temple, was a back-and-forth contest that came down to the final play of the game. Keeping the game within seven points for the first three quarters, the Bulls first took the lead with 2:27 left in the fourth quarter, on a 25-yard field goal by A.J. Principe. Temple responded with a nine-play, 74-yard drive capped by a 11-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Bruce Francis, his second score of the game, to take a 28–24 lead with only 38 seconds remaining. Taking over at their own 40-yard line after the kickoff went out of bounds, the Bulls drove down the field, scoring the game-winning touchdown on a 35-yard desperation heave from Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt with no time remaining on the clock. Buffalo's record following the last-second win was 2–1, marking the first time since 1969 that the Bulls had a record over .500 beyond Week 1 as a Division I-A team. The last time the Bulls had started a season 2–1 was 1998, while they were still played in Division I-AA.
The Bulls proceeded to lose their next three games. Buffalo was unable to keep up with No. 5-ranked Missouri, losing 42–21 in a game that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season. In the next contest, against MAC opponent Central Michigan, down nine points with under three minutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard pass to James Starks, recovered an onside kick to retain possession, and attempted a game-winning field goal—but A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the right goalpost to give Central Michigan the victory. In the next game, against the Western Michigan Broncos, also in the MAC, Buffalo squandered a two-touchdown advantage with just over five minutes left, allowing the Broncos to win the game in overtime. Buffalo's overall record fell to 2–4, 1–2 in the MAC.
Bouncing back, Buffalo won their next five games. Against Army, Buffalo reversed the result of the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime. Handling conference opponents Ohio and Miami (Ohio) with relative ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the Rubber Bowl. In their next game, against Bowling Green, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to Kent State, was only a formality. The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.
Buffalo's opponent in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No. 12-ranked Ball State Cardinals, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. Ball State was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game; Buffalo in its history was 0–5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls struck first with a touchdown late in the first quarter; Ball State responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10–7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter. Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having driven into the red zone, the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won the game 42–24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked opponent in nine attempts.
Connecticut.
The Huskies entered 2008 seeking to prove their success the previous season was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, West Virginia, 66–21. A loss to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9–4. In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.
UConn started the season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) opponent Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as the remnants of Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214 yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was not decided until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No. 24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No. 23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies would be forced to rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.
The Huskies were unable to match their early success in the second half of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, including one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No. 25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No. 23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.
Pregame buildup.
In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach Turner Gill, who had taken over the team in 2007.
Comparatively, Connecticut was an afterthought heading into the game. Pre-bowl coverage of UConn focused on NCAA rushing leader Donald Brown, who was considering foregoing his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. Brown indicated before the game that he had decided to return to UConn for the 2010 season.
Coaching change rumors.
Following the regular season, speculation surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He was identified as a candidate at two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over in favor of Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, a move that prominent former National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.
UConn head coach Randy Edsall, who had been with the Huskies since 1999, was also rumored to be a candidate for the Syracuse job. Edsall, a Syracuse alumnus, denied any interest. Offensive coordinator Rob Ambrose accepted the head coaching position at Towson, his alma mater; he would stay to coach UConn during the bowl game, however.
Legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls.
While the 2009 International Bowl marked the first appearance of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, it was not the first time the school had been invited to a bowl. Fifty years earlier, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls team finished with a record of 8–1. They were awarded the Lambert Cup, given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the 1958 Tangerine Bowl, where they would face Florida State. There was one catch: the team's African-American players—starting running back Willie Evans and backup defensive end Mike Wilson—would not be allowed to play. The Tangerine Bowl Stadium was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited integrated football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on whether they would accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.
Surviving members of the 1958 Bulls team were invited to the 2009 International Bowl and were honored before the game. The Reverend Jesse Jackson spoke at the kickoff luncheon prior to the game, paying tribute to the legacy of the 1958 team.
Offensive matchups.
Buffalo offense.
Buffalo featured a high-powered, high-tempo, balanced offense that was good at not committing turnovers. During the regular season the Bulls averaged 380.5 offensive yards per game, 45th best in the nation, and scored an average of 31.3 points per game, 31st best. Buffalo's turnover margin was 6th best in the nation, at +1.15.
The Bulls were led offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, and wide receiver Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14 single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25 touchdowns against only five interceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300 yards and caught 41 passes for 340 yards, scoring 16 touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt was seen as the top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last five games and scoring at least once in his last seven.
Connecticut offense.
Especially compared to Buffalo, the UConn offense was extremely unbalanced; the Huskies ranked 19th in the nation in running, averaging 204.6 yards per game, but only 106th in the nation in passing, averaging 147.3 yards per game. Connecticut's offense was centered around running back Donald Brown. Described as "the ultimate workhorse", Brown led the NCAA in rushing going into the game with 1,822 yards. He had already tied the school single-season rushing touchdown record with 17 scores. His dominant performance led to him being named the Big East offensive player of the year as well as an All-American by multiple organizations. Somewhat surprisingly, he was not a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, annually given to the best running back in college football; the award was eventually won by Shonn Greene of Iowa. UConn's rushing attack was supplemented by the efforts of quarterback Tyler Lorenzen and running back Jordan Todman.
The Huskies struggled to pass the ball all season, only completing four touchdown passes as a team heading into the International Bowl. Lorenzen completed under half of his passing attempts on the season. He threw for 820 yards with more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (two). Nevertheless, before the game Randy Edsall confirmed that Lorenzen would be the starting quarterback for UConn in the International Bowl. This would be his ninth appearance at quarterback on the season; he missed four games with a broken right foot.
Defensive matchups.
Buffalo defense.
The Buffalo defense was described as "among the worst in the MAC, meaning it's among the worst in college football". In Division I-FBS, the Bulls ranked 84th in total defense, allowing an average of 408 yards per game. Buffalo's run defense was 83rd in the country, allowing 141.1 yards per game; their pass defense was ranked 97th, allowing almost 250 yards per game. The Bulls allowed other teams to score an average of 27 points against them per game, which ranked 73rd in the country.
Buffalo did have one strength on defense: forcing turnovers. The Bulls recovered 20 fumbles and caught eight interceptions on the year. Buffalo's turnover margin of +1.15 was 6th best in the nation.
Connecticut defense.
Conversely, UConn boasted one of the better defenses in the country. The Huskies allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281 yards allowed. Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165 yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259 yards during the regular season.
The Huskies had several standout players on defense. One was defensive end Cody Brown, who led UConn with 14 tackles for a loss (TFL) and nine sacks while also being named to the All-Big East first team. Cornerback Jasper Howard was another standout player: he had 37 tackles and four interceptions on the year while also leading the Big East in punt returns.
Game summary.
The 2009 International Bowl kicked off on January 3, 2009, at 12:00 PM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Official attendance was listed at 40,184, the highest in the history of the International Bowl. The attendance record was largely due to Buffalo fans; an estimated 30,000 attended the game. John Saunders, Jesse Palmer, and Doug Flutie, all with ties to Canada, were the announcers for the television broadcast, which aired on ESPN2. The game was watched by over 2 million households with a rating of 2.12, both the highest in International Bowl history. Prior to the game, spread bettors favored Connecticut to win by four and a half points.
First quarter.
Buffalo received the ball first to begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in three plays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nd down and 5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A holding penalty on the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteen yards but was unable to reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.
Buffalo took over at their own 19-yard line and promptly earned their 1st first down of the game on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball any closer to the end zone, and settled for a 38-yard field goal by kicker A. J. Principe, giving them a 3–0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.
The ensuing kickoff was returned by UConn running back Jordan Todman 45 yards to the Buffalo 45-yard line. On the first play from scrimmage, Donald Brown broke through the Buffalo defense and ran the length of the field for the first touchdown of the day. UConn kicker Dave Teggart's extra point attempt was good, giving UConn their first lead of the day, at 7–3.
Buffalo got the ball back at their own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the ball back to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard returned the ball 26 yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing the ball to the Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At the end of the first quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.
Second quarter.
UConn began the second quarter by having Tyler Lorenzen rush the ball for four yards. On 3rd and 7, Lorenzen attempted his first pass of the game, which was behind Husky wide receiver Michael Smith. Dave Teggart kicked a 32-yard field goal to increase Connecticut's lead to 10–3.
The Bulls began their next drive at their own 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball over the head of UConn returner Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.
UConn's turnover woes continued on their next possession when, on their second play from scrimmage after receiving Buffalo's kickoff, Tyler Lorenzen was sacked, causing him to fumble the ball. The Bulls recovered and drove down the field to the UConn 12-yard line where they were stopped. Principe kicked a 29-yard field goal giving Buffalo back the lead, at 13–10.
The ensuing kickoff saw yet another Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball off of the kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone. Frey recovered the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule it would have been a touchback and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.
Connecticut fumbled the ball for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was responsible for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, but was unable to score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13 yards out. Neither team scored for the remainder of the first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.
Third quarter.
Connecticut received the ball to start the third quarter and drove down the field on rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own end zone. The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an offside penalty on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a play-action pass, only their second pass attempt of the game, to fool the Bulls; UConn tight end Steve Brouse was wide open in the end zone, catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24–20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.
Buffalo received the ball off the kickoff on their own 28-yard line. Losing eight yards on their three plays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back with less than a minute left in the quarter and completed two passes, moving the ball 13 yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.
Fourth quarter.
Buffalo began the final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 situation and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo managed to get a first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were unable to move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.
Connecticut took over at their own 32-yard line and, after throwing only two passes in the first three quarters, completed three passes over 10 yards apiece to move down the field. On a 2nd-and-5 from the Buffalo 15-yard line, Tyler Lorenzen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. UConn's lead was extended to 31–20 with less than five minutes left in the game.
Receiving the ball at their own 8-yard line following a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy completing a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for four yards on first down; on second down, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100 yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.
Final statistics.
For his performance in the 2009 International Bowl, Connecticut running back Donald Brown was named the player of the game. Brown rushed for 261 yards and one touchdown on 29 attempts. He finished the 2008 college football season with 2,083 rushing yards which led the nation. Brown set several new UConn school records, including the single-season records for rushing yards (2,083), attempts (367), and yards per game (160.2), the career records for rushing yards (3,800) and attempts (698), and the record for consecutive games with at least 100 yards rushing (8). His performance did not break the International Bowl rushing records, however; the previous year Rutgers running back Ray Rice ran for 280 yards and four touchdowns.
Brown's dominant rushing performance was supplemented by RB Jordan Todman's 62 yards on seven attempts, QB Tyler Lorenzen's 32 yards on twelve attempts, including two touchdowns, and fullback Anthony Sherman's three yards on one attempt; in total Connecticut ran for 358 yards. The Huskies attempted to pass only six times during the game; Lorenzen completed four of them for 49 yards and a touchdown. Four different UConn receivers caught one pass each: wide receiver Kashif Moore (18 yards), cornerback and sometime wide receiver Darius Butler (16 yards), fullback Anthony Sherman (11 yards), and tight end Steve Brouse (4 yards and a touchdown).
Buffalo's offensive performance was in some ways the opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24 yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25 yards on thirteen carries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran three times for five yards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost six yards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43 passes for 213 yards and one interception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90 yards on eight catches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught four passes for 54 yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22 yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21 yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17 yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9 yards.
Connecticut dominated Buffalo statistically in the first half, gaining 225 yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208 yards rushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20 points off UConn turnovers in the first half, but were held scoreless in the second half when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.
Aftermath.
Connecticut's win gave the team a final record of 8–5 and back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2003–04. Buffalo's final record fell to 8–6, which still marked the first winning season for the Bulls since transitioning to Division I-A football in 1999.
In a press conference after the game, Brown announced that he would not return for his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, saying he told the media he said he was staying to take the focus off of himself prior to the game. Brown was drafted 27th overall by the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the first UConn player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round: Darius Butler 41st overall by the New England Patriots, William Beatty 60th overall by the New York Giants, and defensive end Cody Brown 63rd overall by the Arizona Cardinals. Tight end Martin Bédard was drafted 15th overall in the second round of the Canadian Football League's (CFL) 2009 Draft. Buffalo did not have any players drafted by either league in 2009; in the 2010 NFL Draft James Starks was selected in the sixth round, 193rd overall, by the Green Bay Packers. UConn cornerback Robert McClain was also drafted by the NFL in 2010, in the seventh round, 249th overall, by the Carolina Panthers.
In the offseason Connecticut hired Joe Moorhead as their new offensive coordinator, replacing the departed Rob Ambrose. Turner Gill returned to coach Buffalo in 2009. Following that season, however, he left to take over the football program at the University of Kansas.
Connecticut and Buffalo resumed their rivalry on September 25, 2010, playing a regular season game at UConn's Rentschler Field. Although the score was tied 14–14 at halftime, the Huskies pulled away in the second half after changing quarterbacks, winning the rematch 45–21.

Scribblenauts

Scribblenauts is an emergent puzzle action video game developed by 5th Cell for the Nintendo DS published by WB Games. The game was released on September 15, 2009 in North America, September 30, 2009 in Australia, October 9, 2009 in Europe and on January 27, 2011 in Japan as by Konami. It is the third Nintendo DS video game made by 5th Cell, the first two being "Drawn to Life" and "Lock's Quest". The objective of "Scribblenauts", as implied by its catchphrase "Write Anything, Solve Everything", is to complete puzzles to collect "Starites", helped by the player's ability to summon any object (from a database of tens of thousands) by writing its name on the touchscreen. The game is considered by its developers to help promote emergent gameplay by challenging the player to solve its puzzles within certain limitations or through multiple solutions.
Jeremiah Slaczka, creator of "Scribblenauts", envisioned the game as a combination of solving life situation puzzles alongside Mad Libs. His vision was brought to realization through the "Objectnaut" engine created by 5th Cell's technical director, Marius Fahlbusch. Objectnaut allowed for a data driven approach, and a significant portion of the development time was spent researching nouns and their properties, and categorizing them into the Objectnaut database. This, along with the simple art designs of 5th Cell's Edison Yan, allowed for the team to easily add new words to the database without expending much effort to program new behavior.
"Scribblenauts" was first shown in a playable form at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and became a sleeper hit, winning several "Best of Show" awards, being the first portable console game to win such praise. Reviewers believed that 5th Cell delivered on their promise to allow nearly any possible object to be created for use in "Scribblenauts", but also lamented that the choice of controls in the game hampered their full enjoyment of the title.
A sequel, "Super Scribblenauts", was developed for the Nintendo DS and was released on October 12, 2010. It features enhanced controls, the ability to modify nouns with adjectives, and an increased focus on puzzle levels. An iOS version, "Scribblenauts Remix", was released a year later on October 12, 2011, featuring selected levels from both DS games and new levels for the iOS version. A sequel for the Wii U, "Scribblenauts Unlimited", was unveiled at Nintendo's E3 2012 press conference. It was named the best of E3 Expo that year. Later, the Scribblenauts Unlimited sandbox game was released under Steam for Windows. In 2013, both "Scribblenauts" & "Super Scribblenauts" were re-released as a 2-in-1 combo pack for Nintendo DS, called "Scribblenauts Collection".
Gameplay.
"Scribblenauts" is an exclusively side-scrolling game controlled almost entirely with the Nintendo DS stylus, with the D-pad and face buttons controlling the camera and the left and right shoulder buttons rotating objects. The player controls a character named Maxwell, who must collect objects called "Starites" to complete each level. Maxwell is guided by tapping the touchscreen, or if the player taps an object, Maxwell will pick it up or be given other options for interacting with that object, such as riding a horse or bicycle or shooting at an object if he holds a weapon. A fundamental element of "Scribblenauts" is the ability of the player to summon myriad objects into the game. This is achieved by writing the name of an object on the touchscreen. For example, the player can write "ladder", summoning a ladder, which the player may use to climb to an out-of-reach Starite. The player may turn the ladder on its side and set it on fire. The player may also chain objects together, such as chaining a piece of meat to a pole and holding it while riding on a raptor. As such, the developers consider the game to strongly promote emergent gameplay.
Summoned objects range among animals, weapons, forces of nature, famous people (both fictional and real), vehicles, household objects, easter eggs of the development team, and even internet memes. However, the game does not include trademarked terms, nor potential profanity (summoning "ass" will spawn a donkey; summoning "cock" will spawn a rooster). The game includes a homonym system to offer the player possible choices between similar-sounding objects, such as distinguishing between a toy balloon and a hot-air balloon; there is also a spellchecker to provide close matches for misspelled words. The North American release includes support for other languages including Brazilian Portuguese, French, and Spanish, with French-Canadian and Latin American variants available for words in the French and Spanish language sets, respectively. The UK version also accounts for difference between American and British English, such as the differing meanings of the word "football". 5th Cell has stated that the limit to what objects may be summoned is up to the player's imagination. Players, using special software, claimed to have discovered that the full list of words is greater than 22,800 unique entries, but, in response, Slaczka asserted there were many more than this number.
The game is segmented into 220 levels over 10 themed areas, and each given a 4 star ranking based on its difficulty, with later areas featuring more high ranked levels. Puzzles are given a par for the number of objects they can summon, typically being between two and four, though the player is free to summon more, so long as there is space in the meter at the top screen (summoning the same number of objects as the par or less earns more points). There are two types of levels—puzzle and action levels. Puzzle levels are real-life situations (such as having to open a piñata) where the Starite is awarded once the puzzle is solved, while action levels will appeal to gamers that prefer side-scrolling platformers, featuring switches, spike traps, and other similar elements. Players are awarded "merits" for completing levels while meeting certain requirements, such as not summoning any weapon-like object. Once the player completes a level, a silver star appears on the level selection button and a "Free play" mode is unlocked. At that point, the player is given the option to play through the level three consecutive times without reusing objects. Successfully completing the challenge grants the player a gold star for that level. "Scribblenauts" presents a simplistic storyline, as the developers wished to focus on engaging gameplay. The game always rewards the player with "Ollars", its in-game money, to allow them to purchase new areas, different avatars and other visual changes to the game.
The game includes a level editor, allowing users to share these levels over the Nintendo Wi-Fi system. The player can start with any level that they have already beaten from the main game, and add new objects with new game properties. These new properties can vary significantly from the normal behavior, such as having a bear able to eat a plane.
Development.
"Scribblenauts" was first conceived in the second quarter of 2007, near the same time that they had envisioned "Lock's Quest". Creative Director for 5th Cell, Jeremiah Slaczka, stated that they were seeking counterparts of "Nintendogs" and "", games that had attracted a much wider demographic than most other niche games, that 5th Cell could develop. The concept of "Scribblenauts" came from a combination of a previous idea he had for the DS that was similar to Mad Libs and a dream of his. An example given for the Mad Libs was that players could write a Mad Lib of a "dog walking through a forest", and a dog would appear in a forest and walk through it. However, he realized the game would be tedious and that players would only be interested in using keywords. The dream was of being inside an Aztec temple and having to solve puzzles; one in particular involves three paintings, with the objective being straightening them and then moving on to the next room through a portal. While he thought it was a cool idea for a game, he also felt that it lacked both a hook and replayability. He debated whether this would work best on the Wii or the DS, but later decided to combine the writing element with a puzzle element to fix the lack of replayability. Slaczka realized that the concept of the game may have been considered impossible by other programmers, but found that 5th Cell's Technical Director Marius Fahlbusch felt confident they could create the required elements.
During development, Slaczka and the team tried to figure out what the DS was all about, trying to make "Scribblenauts" appeal to everyone. As "Lock's Quest" was thought of first, they focused on releasing that game first while beginning the development of "Scribblenauts". The game entered beta around May 2009, and had numerous play-testers exploring the game. About half of 5th Cell's staff worked on the game. It was developed alongside the DS version of "".
"Scribblenauts" was originally developed without having a publisher for the game. Slaczka noted that unlike other games where the developers could complete and polish a single level to garner interest while work on the rest of the game continued, "Scribblenauts" needed to show support for its large dictionary from the start, making it difficult to promote the game. The company was in negotiations with a publisher in the early part of 2009, letting that publisher decide when it would be best to announce the game. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment officially announced itself as the publisher for "Scribblenauts" in May 2009. Slaczka noted that of the other publishers they talked to, they felt Warner Bros. was the best one, particularly due to their proximity to 5th Cell and their interest in the title.
"Scribblenauts" was originally titled "Wordplay", but the team felt that this was "generic". The title "Scribblenauts" began as a temporary name to replace it that would work better for pitching the game, but as development proceeded, the team couldn't think of a better one, so the name stuck and became the final title of the product.
Konami published the game in Japan on January 27, 2011, which features Konami characters such as Old Snake, Manaka Takane and the Vic Viper.
Engine.
The core engine of "Scribblenauts" is a data-driven engine called "Objectnaut" created by Fahlbusch. Within Objectnaut, each object is given a set of properties, including physical characteristics, artificial intelligence behavior, and how the player (through Maxwell) can interact with it. Five people from the team spent six months researching dictionaries and encyclopedias to create a large database of objects within the Objectnaut's framework, and then mapped out a hierarchy of data from this information. For example, every mammal-based object in the game is given the property of having "organic flesh", allowing it to be eaten or turned into meat, without having to specify these functions for each type of mammal they used. The Objectnaut approach allowed the team to create two distinct objects for words that may have similar meanings simply by adjusting each word's properties in the database: "lion", "tiger" and "leopard" while similar will behave differently and have different art assets, while the only difference in the game between "croissant" and "danish" is that the danish may be able to roll like a wheel. The team made sure to balance the abilities of the various objects that could be summoned to avoid creating an "uber character" that would act as a skeleton key for solving all of the levels, and give players more courage to try different elements. Slaczka noted that he would be frequently asked if certain difficult words were in the game when interviewed by the press, most of the time being able to respond affirmatively to these questions. In an example given by Slaczka, a "hardcore" journalist wanted twenty minutes with the game to try to stump it during the 2009 E3 convention, but, according to Slaczka, "he had a real hard time stumping it and shook my hand" after that period.
Designing each item required the developers to go word-by-word. Slaczka stated that certain kinds of words, such as cheeses, require little to no differences, besides items such as Limburger which would scare people away from it. He stated that the developers used discretion when deciding what to make look different, providing a cyborg, robot, and android, which he felt were different enough to require their own individual designs. He later stated that there was no way to test out each item and each way they interact with another item, as it was virtually impossible for them to accomplish this, using an example of an airplane being frozen, brought back in time, placing an old man on top of it, bringing it back to present time, and setting it on fire. Slaczka stated that while many games create a first level with enemies and platforms, polishing the level and moving on, the players can write any item available in level one that they can write in a later level. He commented that if players wrote "anvil" and it was missing its "heavy" property, they may be turned off of the game. They spent roughly 80% of the development fine-tuning the various items, and as such, they could not provide a preview to demonstrate the game.
Each of the words programmed into the game has associated art with it led by 5th Cell artist Edison Yan. The task of creating the art was simplified through the "minimal" design style of 5th Cell's previous games. Each object is rendered as in 3D with objects acting as doll on a 2D plane. This was chosen to avoiding having to create a large number of animations for 2D. The development team had to design each AI-controlled object by hand, according to Slaczka, describing how the objects moves, and what it likes and dislikes, how much health it has, and other possible characteristics. Level design focused on providing a large variety of situations, including splitting levels between Puzzle and Action types, to avoid having the player develop a limited toolbox of common words and not exploring other possible solutions. Much of the initial level development was done on paper and to explore situations not commonly found in video games, due to their vocabulary system. They ended up selecting more than a hundred levels out of over seven hundred they had generated internally for the game. Both Merits and Ollars were added to reward the player for completion, with Slaczka comparing these to Xbox Live Achievements.
The game primarily uses the touchscreen to control Maxwell and other objects; the developers considered using the directional pad of the DS but realized that they would still need to rely on the touchscreen for certain actions and thus focused most of the game's controls through that interface. The game includes 5th Cell's own handwriting recognition system for writing down objects which Slaczka considered to be better than Nintendo's own system for "". The team included a virtual keyboard in addition to this system knowing that even "the human brain can't understand chicken scratch".
Promotion.
Players who pre-order the game at GameStop and EB Games in the United States, Canada, and Australia will receive a replica of Maxwell's "rooster hat", a term coined by Destructoid according to Slaczka. However, several customers who did pre-order from GameStop and EB Games did not receive a rooster hat, due to extremely limited supplies. The game was launched by a special event at the Nintendo World Store in New York City on September 13, 2009, with Slaczka and other 5th Cell developers on hand for the event. Toys "R" Us announced that on the day of its release, it would be $14.99 instead of $29.99 Pixel Verdict.com put the game on its "most anticipated game of September" list.
Reception.
Pre-release.
The game was very well received at the 2009 E3 Convention and was considered the "sleeper hit" of the show. "Scribblenauts" is the first portable video game in history to win "Best of Show" awards for E3 from any major gaming media outlet. The game was named "Best Original Game" and "Best Handheld Game" by the Game Critics Awards. "Scribblenauts" was named the overall "Best of Show" by Gamespot, Gamespy, and IGN, in addition to other awards. 1UP.com named "Scribblenauts" their E3's "Most Innovative" title. X-Play gave the game its E3 "Best Original Game" and "Best Handheld Game" awards. Ars Technica considered the game as the show's "Most Pleasant Surprise". Joystiq performed a ten-word test of the game, and found only one word, "plumbob", was not yet present in the game, but were promised it would be in the final version. Part of the success at E3 was considered partially due to the inclusion of then-recent Keyboard Cat Internet meme, which led to a grassroots-type excitement about the game at the convention. Adam Sessler of G4 TV believed that "Scribblenauts"s E3 success was from being a small but successful game from a small company in contrast to numerous other premier titles from other major developers and publishers that have become standard for the convention, such that the uniqueness of everything about the game made it the standout title of the show. "Scribblenauts" was given a much more predominate display in Warner Bros. Interactive's booth at the next major convention, the 2009 Comic-Con International.
IGN listed "Scribblenauts" in a preview of Nintendo DS games in 2009, labeling it as one of their top picks for the year. They described it as "quite possibly one of the system's most ambitious designs yet." IGN readers ranked the world debut article about "Scribblenauts" as the eighth best Nintendo DS article of 2008 on their web site.
One example of the possibilities of "Scribblenauts" that led to further attention to the game are given in the ESRB's attempt to describe the "cartoon violence" and "comic mischief" within the game as to grant it an "E10+" rating. The ESRB's description includes possible examples of the game's level of violence as "a club can be used to hit an animal; steak can be attached to a baby to attract lions; rockets can be lobbed at a man". In a post at NeoGAF within a thread dedicated to the game, user "Feep" relayed the experience of discovering during E3 that he was able to go back in time with a time machine to collect a dinosaur in order to defeat an army of robot zombies that could not be defeated with regular weapons. The story, as memorialized as "Post 217", has led to 5th Cell artist Edison Yan creating a desktop wallpaper image of the story, in appreciation of the positive fan response to the game, and the terms "Post Two One Seven", "Feep", and "Neogaf" have been included as summonable objects in the game. The image has been used as promotional material, appearing as an insert poster for the Italian version of "Official Nintendo Magazine". Slaczka credits the word-of-mouth popularity of "Post 217" for part of the game's success at E3, and noted that he had contacted Feep to gain his permission to include "Feep" (appearing as a robot zombie) within the game. The NeoGAF forums proceeded to expand on their praise for the game by creating a series of avatars of video game and other related characters (which will not otherwise appear in the game due to trademark issues) for their forums inspired by Yan's art design, and even some of the members that created the avatars were contacted to work in the second game, Super Scribblenauts. Yan himself has drawn several more avatars in the same style for other games such as "Street Fighter II" and "Final Fantasy VII".
Release.
"Scribblenauts" was found by reviewers to live up to the premise that the game was built on the ability to bring about nearly any object imagined into the game. John Walker of Eurogamer considered the game "an incredible achievement", with its word database "so utterly complete in its collection of everything ever in the universe" and its specificness on these terms. Craig Harris of IGN asserted that "the developers fully deliver on promise" of allowing player to summon nearly any imagined object, and, based on the core game alone, is an "incredibly versatile Nintendo DS experience". Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica praises the game as "undeniably new and impressive" and urged players to support games that take risks with their innovation. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com noted that while the game "isn't exactly the be-all end-all videogame" that it received prior to release, the game remains "unmissable" due to its sheer novelty value. The game's feature of forcing the player to consider different solutions when replaying levels was seen by Anthony Gallegos of Gamespy as a "really clever way to encourage replayability while subtly upping the challenge".
However, reviewers complained about the game's poor controls, to the point that the implementation "almost kills a fantastic game". Reviews specifically commented how the touch screen is used both to manipulate the objects placed in the game and to move Maxwell; this would result in inadvertently having Maxwell walk to his death or to disrupt a delicately prepared arrangement of objects prior to being ready to move him. Craig Harris of IGN notes that while one can direct Maxwell indirectly, the character would often fail to avoid or overcome simple obstacles, similar to troop movements in real-time strategy games, such that overcoming these issues requires a significant amount of precise controls by the player. It was suggested that while it was understood why 5th Cell opted to use the touchscreen in this manner to avoid too much flipping between the stylus and face-button controls, they would have appreciated the option for customizing the controls. The decision to use the touch screen controls was described by Walker as "possibly the most wildly stupid design decision of all time", and that if the movement controls were mapped to the face buttons, the game would have been a "beautiful thing". Walker also questioned the choice to have the game's camera snap back to Maxwell as soon as the controls for it were released by the player, as it made it both difficult to set up objects that were off-screen from Maxwell, and to watch the results of certain interactions, such as fights between computer-controlled characters, that occurred off-screen.
When it is possible to connect objects to other objects, reviewers found that finding the connection points to be difficult, and would often trigger Maxwell to move. Barnholt described the entire game as feeling like a prototype with its odd physics and not as polished as 5th Cell's previous games, though acknowledged the overall game is still an impressive feat for the small development team. IGN's Ryan Geddes criticized the game's poor controls and physics to require an amount of patience to overcome in order to enjoy the game, and raised concerns that the title was rushed to market after its overwhelming positive response from the E3 convention. In a postmortem, 5TH Cell's co-founder Joseph Tringali stated that they were aware that the controls would take "a big hit" from game reviewers, and attempted to work in a face-button control scheme, but would have not been able to complete it within the deadline set by their self-funded schedule. Tringali further noted that they did not spend as much time on the stylus controls earlier in development, and would have considered sacrificing another feature, like the Nintendo Wi-Fi, to improve them.
Reviewers also identified some unexpected behavior from some objects or combinations of them, leading to an inconsistency in the difficulty of the various puzzles. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica, in calling "Scribblenauts" a "a frustrating, often maddening game", described that he often encounters puzzles that, after trying several solutions that should have worked by common sense, he eventually happened upon a less logical solution that worked. Walker considered the puzzles range "between uninspired and simple and frustratingly obscure and fiddly". Many critics experienced that after getting stumped on a puzzle, they would often resort to playing around in the free play mode. "Edge" magazine identified that the free play mode was more enjoyable as it masked the problems with controls, physics, and the general structure of the puzzle game that followed it, and considered what improvements in these modes could be made to create an experience closer to that of "LittleBigPlanet". In particular for the action levels, reviewers found that they would be less likely to explore alternate solutions and fall into the pattern of using the same set of objects, making these levels repetitive towards the end. On the other hand, the puzzle levels were well-received; Andrew Reiner of "Game Informer" stated the time spent while solving the puzzle levels was when his "creative juices were joyously sapped". The presence of the "Ollars" currency system allows players to skip levels they found difficult. Kurchera also noted that with some puzzles, the game is often better played with others, including young children, as the combination of imaginative ideas will likely eventually stumble upon a solution. Simon Parkin of Game Set Watch agreed, believing the game is best enjoyed when one thinks like a child as "free of the dry, efficient logic of adulthood, a child’s imagination also opens the game up in ways beyond most adults’ reach". Seth Schiesel of the "New York Times" considers the ultimate experience of the game a let-down after the E3 hype due to the controls and obfuscation of the puzzles, and though it was not a "great game", he considers the concept a "great idea" that can be built upon for a possible sequel.
According to the NPD Group, "Scribblenauts" sold 194,000 units in the United States during September 2009, following "" and "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" in top Nintendo DS sales. The game also showed strong sales during December 2009, becoming the 16th best selling game of that month in North America. By February 2010, the game had sold more than one million units worldwide. It was the 5th best-selling Nintendo DS game for 2009 in North America and the 1st best selling 3rd party game on DS.
"Time" named "Scribblenauts" the 7th best video game of 2009. "Scribblenauts" won the "Outstanding Innovation in Gaming", "Portable Game of the Year", and "Outstanding Achievement in Portable Game Design" awards, and was nominated for the "Casual Game of the Year" award for the 13th Annual Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The game won "Innovation" and "Best Handheld Game" at the 10th annual Game Developers Choice Awards.
Lawsuit.
In May 2013, Charles Schmidt and Christopher Orlando Torres, the creators of the Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat characters respectively, jointly sued 5th Cell and Warner Bros. for copyright infringement and trademark infringement for the appearances of these characters without permission across "Scribblenauts" and its sequels. Schmidt and Torres have both registered copyrights on their characters and have pending trademark applications on the names.
Legacy.
"Super Scribblenauts".
A Nintendo DS sequel to "Scribblenauts" titled "Super Scribblenauts" was released on October 12, 2010. In addition to addressing issues with the control scheme, "Super Scribblenauts" includes a larger vocabulary including the use of adjectives to modify nouns, influencing the objects' behavior.
"Scribblenauts Remix".
"Scribblenauts Remix", a version of "Scribblenauts" for the iOS platform, was released by Warner Bros. Interactive on October 12, 2011. Ported to the platform by developers Iron Galaxy, the iOS version provides forty levels from both "Scribblenauts" and its sequel, along with ten new levels for the iOS. The mechanics of the game are based on "Super Scribblenauts", allowing for the use of adjectives in addition to nouns. The game uses built-in features of iOS, such as the touch keyboard, and was released simultaneously with iOS version 5, incorporating new features such as cloud storage to play the game across multiple devices. In addition to the fewer levels, this version does not include many of the features of Super Scribblenauts: for example the action mode for the more platforming heavy levels, the replay mode where you had to solve the same puzzle 3 times without repeating words, and the level editor.
As a result of a price drop, to approximately one dollar, "Scribblenauts Remix" took the top sales spot for iOS games during the week of November 14, 2011, knocking long-term favorite "Angry Birds" from this spot.
According to the official app page on iTunes, Scribblenauts Remix 2.0 now gives you the "World Pass" feature and the choice to play as different avatars in-game, something that was native to the Nintendo DS systems before now.
On July 18, 2013, Scribblenauts Remix was released in the Google Play store for compatible Android devices.
"Scribblenauts Unlimited".
A fourth title, "Scribblenauts Unlimited", was released for Wii U, PC and Nintendo 3DS in November 2012. The same "adjectives" add-on applies, and Maxwell must walk through different worlds and find ScribbleQuests (when completed, Maxwell receives a whole Starite) and people or objects that need help (when completed, Maxwell receives a piece of a Starite). There is a function called "Starite Mode", where the screen and entities become dark blue (Maxwell becomes maroon) and challenges and things that need help go to a different appearance; bright yellow and orange with yellow Starites respectively. Things that need help do not retain their Starite Mode appearance when solved, but ScribbleQuests will, and will let you play them again. When a Starite piece is received, the piece is given to Maxwell automatically, but when a whole Starite is received, it falls to the ground, requiring the player to pick it up.
"Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure".
A fifth game in the franchise, "", was announced in development for Wii U, PC and Nintendo 3DS, featuring over 2000 characters from the DC Comics universe. The game was released on 24 September 2013.

<doc id="20565421" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20565421" title="Cannabis in New Zealand">
Cannabis in New Zealand

Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in New Zealand. In the population of more than 4-million, 13.4% of those between the ages of 16–64 use cannabis. This ranks as the ninth highest cannabis consumption level in the world. The use of cannabis in New Zealand is governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of cannabis illegal. However, there are some political efforts seeking to remove penalties on its use for those over 18 years of age.
Usage.
Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in New Zealand and the third most widely used recreational drug after alcohol and tobacco.
The usage by those aged between 16–64 is 13.4%, the ninth highest level of consumption in the world, and 15.1% of those who smoked cannabis used it ten times or more per month. According to a UN study usage by 15–45 year olds in 2003 was about 20% and this dropped to 17.9% in 2010.
A 25 year longitudinal study of "1000 Christchurch born young people between the ages of 15 – 25" concluded that "regular or heavy cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of using other illicit drugs, abusing or becoming dependent upon other illicit drugs, and using a wider variety of other illicit drugs". The lead author of the study, Professor David Fergusson, stated:
Legality.
Cannabis use is controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. Possession of any amount of cannabis is illegal and can result in a fine of up to $500 or even a 3-month prison sentence. Section 7(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 contains a rebuttable presumption against imprisonment in respect of possession offences in respect of Class C controlled drugs including cannabis. This presumption does not apply for offences of supplying or possession for supply. Anyone caught in possession of at least 28 grams of cannabis or 100 cannabis joints is presumed to be a supplier, unless the defendant can prove they are not. However, in "R v Hansen" , a majority of the Supreme Court held that this presumption was inconsistent with section 25(c) of the Bill of Rights Act, which affirms the right of those charged with an offence to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. They also held that it was not a justified limitation under section 5 of that Act. Cannabis is a Class C drug, of which the penalty for dealing can result in a maximum prison sentence of 8 years under the Act. There have been many public campaigns to decriminalise Cannabis but so far none have succeeded. It is generally accepted that the usage rate is high and possession in small quantities may not often be prosecuted. In some cases first offences may result in a formal warning and confiscation by police.
The Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party has stood candidates since the 1996 general election. They won 1.66% of the party vote in that election, the largest proportion in its history. The party has never won an electorate seat, without which they must receive at least 5% of the party vote to be represented in parliament.
In 2006, Green Party MP Metiria Turei's Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. The purpose of the bill was to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medicinal purposes, and to permit the cultivation and possession of a small amount of Cannabis by registered medical users or a designated agent. The bill received a conscience vote at its first reading in July 2009, and was defeated 84–34. All MPs in the ruling National Party voted against the bill, as did the sole members from United Future and Jim Anderton's Progressive Party; while all members from the Green Party and ACT voted in favour of the bill (other than ACT MP Roger Douglas, who did not vote). The vote was split from MPs in the opposition Labour Party and the Māori Party.
Enforcement.
At least four people have died while policing cannabis in New Zealand. Detective Travis Hughes and Christopher Scott were killed when their Cessna 172 crashed in Central Otago while on cannabis reconnaissance. Detective Tony Harrod died falling from a helicopter sling recovering plants in Taranaki.
During the 2009 Napier shootings, Jan Molenaar fired on three police officers executing a cannabis search warrant, killing Senior Constable Len Snee. People who knew Molenaar described a long standing, tense relationship between him and the police surrounding the legality of his cannabis involvement, saying, 'Molenaar believed his home was being watched and told friends he was determined to "go out in blaze of glory" if police came to arrest him', and, 'police knew who Molenaar was and knew what he would do in a situation'.
A notable case involving cannabis growing equipment was the prosecution of the owner and general manager of the Switched on Gardener stores following a series of arrests and raids in 2010.
Medicinal use.
Cannabis-based medicines such as Sativex are legally available in New Zealand with a prescription from a specialist doctor, but is currently not subsidized and requires patients to meet strict criteria. Only around 30 prescriptions have been given out over the last 4 years. The New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA) supports having evidence based peer reviewed studies of medical cannabis. In 2010 the New Zealand Law Commission made a recommendation to allow for its medical use. The NZMA, which made submissions on the issues paper, supports the stance put forward by the Law Commission.

Nashville Charter Amendment 1

Nashville Charter Amendment 1 of 2009 (also known as the Nashville English Only Amendment or Nashville English First Amendment) was a proposed amendment to the charter of Nashville, Tennessee which, if passed, would have restricted the use of foreign languages in relation to the functions of the city government. Early voting was held from January 2, 2009 to January 17, 2009. Regular voting was held on January 22, 2009. The amendment failed to pass with only 43% of voters supporting it.
The referendum took place amidst a broader English-only movement in the United States. Most of the funding for the initiative came from the Virginia-based lobbying organization, ProEnglish.

The text of the proposal read as follows:
“English is the official language of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. Official actions which bind or commit the government shall be taken only in the English language, and all official government communications and publications shall be in English. No person shall have a right to government services in any other language. All meetings of the Metro Council, Boards, and Commissions of the Metropolitan Government shall be conducted in English. The Metro Council may make specific exceptions to protect public health and safety. Nothing in this measure shall be interpreted to conflict with federal or state law.”
Components.
Accordingly, there were five components to Proposal 1:
Previous efforts to pass this type of legislation had been met with vigorous opposition from then-Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell, who argued that the passage of an ordinance making English the official language of Nashville would create legal confusion, resulting in countless lawsuits. In his statement vetoing the ordinance in February, 2007, Purcell said: "If this law takes effect, this city will be engaged in years of lawsuits testing the effect and constitutionality of the ordinance. That means hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees whether we win or lose, for no good reason."
Proponents of the proposal referred to it as "English First" while opponents called it "English Only" - each side claimed that the other side's terminology was misleading. The Associated Press called the measure a "foreign language ban".
Supporters of Proposal 1 argued that government communication in only one language is simple and cost-effective and provides an incentive to non-English speakers to learn the language. The proponents of Proposal 1 were represented by Nashville English First, the brainchild of Nashvillians Jon Crisp and Eric Crafton, with the legal, financial, and moral support of ProEnglish out of Arlington, Virginia.
Opponents argued that the measure is antagonistic toward immigrants in transition, redundant in that English was already the “official and legal language” of Tennessee, and that passage of the measure could damage Nashville’s reputation as a welcoming city, its international economy, its budget, and its safety. The most formal opposition came from Nashville for All of Us, a coalition of Nashville groups.
Results.
The amendment failed to pass, with 41,752 votes opposed (57%) and 32,144 votes in support (43%).

Sergei Kramarenko

Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko () (born 23 April 1923) was a Soviet Air Force officer who fought in the World War II and the Korean War. For his service in Korea became a holder of the Title of Hero of the Soviet Union. He achieved several high command positions in the USSR and was also Air Force advisor in Iraq and Algeria in the 1970s. Retired in 1977 with the rank of Major-General, he lives with his family in Moscow.
Childhood and Encounter with Aviation.
Sergei Kramarenko was born on 23 April 1923 in the village of Kalinovka in Sumskaya province, Ukraine, the eldest of three sons of Makar Kramarenko and Nadezhda Galkovskaya. His parents were divorced when he and his brothers were still children and he went with his mother and brothers to live first in the Caucasus, and later to a kolkhoz (collective farm) near the Volga river.
During the 1930s the young Kramarenko listened to radio broadcasts about the deeds of Soviet airmen like Valery Chkalov and Georgiy Baidukov, and so decided to become a pilot. In the autumn of 1940 he began a flying course at the Dzerzhinskiy aeroclub, and as one of the 80 who graduated with the highest marks was offered the opportunity to become a military pilot. Kramarenko accepted and began military training on 1 April 1941 at Borisoglevsk aerodrome.
The German-Soviet War (1941-45).
Sergei Kramarenko first saw action in late November 1942 over Stalingrad, as part of the 523rd IAP- equipped with the LaGG-3. Like most inexperienced fliers, he began as wingman to more experienced pilots, such as Capt. Mikhail Baranovskiy and Lt. Yury Ryzhov. In early 1943 his unit was re-equipped with the Lavochkin La-5, which performance-wise proved to be on a par with the German FW-190 and Bf-109.
First aerial victory.
On 23 February 1943 he was flying as wingman in a flight led by Capt. Baranovskiy when they engaged a group of dive-bomber Stukas. Several escorting FW-190s jumped his element leader Ryzhov and he promptly rushed to assist:
In that moment in front of me, with a left turn at 100-150 meters arrived two unknown aircraft of green color - in their fuselages were black crosses. In spite it was the first time I saw them, immediately I knew they were two FW-190s. As soon as they finished their turn, one of them began to shoot at my leader. I opened fire against the trailing airplane and I saw shell strikes all over the aircraft. I watched that suddenly it went upwards turning, and his leader after him.
Right then, ahead of me from the left went by tracers. I looked to the left and saw that 300 meters behind at the left were two Focke-Wulfs. They shoot right at me, and the tracers of their aircraft get closer and closer to my airplane. What should I do? To climb was impossible, because there were two more Focke-Wulfs. Immediately broke to the left, underneath the tracers. I dove [...]
Many years later, while I described this episode to a journalist friend of mine, he told me that he saw in German memoirs a report of the leader of that "schwarm". [...] After the combat with me, while returning home, one of his pilots, because of unexplainable reasons, got into a dive and crashed into the ground. I realized that one of the shells of my cannons hit the pilot's cockpit and wounded the pilot, who because of the loss of blood fainted and crashed to his death.
Kramarenko's first victory claim was FW-190A-3 (WkNr 2265) of "Oberfeldwebel" Karl Stadeck, (of 2./JG 51 "Mölders"), who was killed. He claimed while flying Lavochkin La-5 "Red 34".
Downed, Wounded, Captured and Rescued.
On 19 March 1944 three La-5FNs of the 19th IAP intercepted a group of Ju-88 bombers escorted by six Bf-110 fighters. Kramarenko's leader - Pavel Maslyakov - shot down one of the Junkers, but was in return jumped by one of the Bf-110s. Kramarenko was ready to cover him, scoring hits on the Messerchmitt. He then fell prey to the Bf-110 wingman, who set his aircraft on fire and forced him to bail out with severe burns to face and hands.
Kramarenko was captured almost immediately by German troops, and as he was unwilling to answer the questions of his SS interrogator he was to be executed. Fortunately for Kramarenko the order was cancelled at the last minute by a Wehrmacht General, who ordered also that Kramarenko be sent to a German field hospital. Two weeks later Kramarenko was rescued by Soviet troops liberating the hospital.
Service in Kozhedub's 176th GIAP.
After several months of convalescence in a Moscow burns hospital, he returned to his regiment (now redisignated 176th GIAP). Kramarenko was appointed wingman to the Regiment navigator Major Aleksandr Kumanichkin, already an ace with 35 aerial victories ( he claimed five more in Korea). Both men were aggressive and disciplined in the air and they became a lethal team. He flew Kumanichkin's wing for several of the ace's victories, and shared some of them. On 16 April 1945 Kramarenko scored his second full victory: a FW-190 over Eastern Prussia. The aircraft he flew that day was the Lavochkin La-7 "Red 27", of the regimental executive officer Major Ivan Kozhedub. Kozhedub had lent Kramarenko his aircraft because he was not scheduled to fly and no other aircraft was available.
The Post War and the beginning of the Cold War (1945-50).
In 1946 the 176th GIAP was redeployed to the aerodrome of Teplyy Stan on the south-west outskirts of Moscow and was among the first units to receive the new prop-driven La-9, the jet-propelled La-15, and in late 1949 the MiG-15. Already the "zamkomesk" (Замкомэск, заместител командир эскадрилии = "zamestitel komandir eskadrilii" = deputy squadron leader) of the regiment's 3rd AE of Aleksandr Vasko, Капитан ("Kapitan" = Captain) Kramarenko flew the MiG-15 during the 1950 May Day fly-past over the Kremlin and Red Square, and on 14 August over Tushino airbase (for Air Force Day ).
The Korean War (1950-53).
In early October 1950 the 176th GIAP were called to a meeting in the Officers' Club at Teplyy Stan by General Redkin, the Executive Officer of the Air Defense of Moscow, with Vasily Stalin (son of Joseph Stalin) also attending. Redkin detailed the critical situation in North Korea, with American B-29 heavy bombers bombing the poorly defended North Korean cities. The Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Korea had officially requested Soviet assistance. When asked for volunteers all pilots, including Kramarenko, raised their hands. The unit was soon deployed to Korea. Soviet involvement would be a secret until well after the end of the Cold War.
Travelling across Siberia, Kozhedub's 324th IAD (made up of the 176th GIAP and 196th IAP) arrived in the city of Dunfyn, where they were given Chinese uniforms to wear. The Soviet fliers received their first salary in Chinese currency which they spent at local markets, buying civilian clothing to replace the Chinese uniforms. An intense period of air-to-air training in the MiG-15 followed. The Russians trained alongside Chinese pilots in the nearby airbase of Mukden. Kozhedub brought Kramarenko with him and personally checked the training of their Chinese and Korean apprentices. Kramarenko remembered the poor training of the Chinese students who could barely perform even basic training flights. Both he and Kozhedub also realized the meager diet of rice they received was a problem. As soon as the Chinese rations were replaced by meat and other high-calorie food the situation improved.
First victories.
Both regiments of the 324th IAD redeployed to the forward airbase at Antung, and entered into battle in early April 1951. On 3 April they suffered three losses for no victories, although on 4 April 1951 Fiodor Shebanov managed to shoot down an F-86 and the pilot captured).
Kramarenko noted that the main reason for such a defeat was their failure to enter Korean airspace at higher altitude and superior speed in comparison with American aircraft. Yevgeny Pepelyaev (196th IAP's commander) and Sergei Vishnyakov (176th GIAP's executive officer) instructed the MiG pilots to jump the American formations in co-ordinated attacks from different directions. Now with these coordinated attacks and both height and high speed the MiG-15 fliers had combat conditions in their favor.
These tactics were tested on 12 April 1951 when 44 MiG-15s of the 176th GIAP and 196th IAP faced an American formation made up of 48 B-29s escorted by 96 jet fighters. Against these uneven odds the Soviet fliers claimed some 10 B-29s, 3 F-80s, and 1 F-86 shot down. Kramarenko's first victory in Korea was the F-80C of Captain A. B. Swanson (18th ABG). Kramarenko's second victory in the Korean sky occurred on 2 June, as he recalls:
In such conditions (on 2 and 17 June I managed to shot down some Sabres. For example, reminded me the following combat: We flew in a "zveno" [a flight, a 4-airplanes formation in the area assigned to patrol, having performed some circuits, when we spotted a group of eight Sabres. heading in a head-on course. We maneuvered to gain altitude and turned around to attack them from the rear hemisphere, but the Sabres spotted us and turned around too. A quartet kept on flying straight, and I with a dive began to chase the aircraft of the rearmost quartet. Two Sabres went to left, and two to the right; Lazutin's pair attacked the pair on the left, and went towards the right. The Sabres began to dive, but by then the range had decreased, and at about 400 meters I open fire. I see hits all over the Sabre wingman, which releasing smoke kept on diving. My wingman jumped the second Sabre, but his aircraft began to shake, due to the speed had almost reached 1.000 km/h, and consequently missed. We got out of the dive, and we saw that below remained only one Sabre - no trace of the second. Soon the ground control confirmed us, that he fell.
His victory was probably confirmed by the interception of American radio dialogue: the F-86A Bu.No 49-1130 of Thomas C. Hanson (336th FIS, Killed), although USAF records list the aircraft as lost in an accident shortly after take-off.
Clash of Titans.
On 17 June 1951 Kramarenko and his six wingmen almost fell in an American ambush when they engaged eight Sabres who were acting as bait for three more F-86s lying in wait and ready to attack from above. What follows is Kramarenko's account of the duel he had against an American ace of World War II:
"Then the Sabres changed to another tactic. Individual pairs of their most experienced pilots would sit off to the side, and when combat was joined would pounce on the trailing aircraft of our group, and frequently shoot them down. [...]
My flight was flying to reinforce the strike group in the lead battle. As we got to the place of combat, the enemy were just finishing up moving out over the sea. Our side was also running out of fuel, and they were heading for home. As we got there, we could see an eight of Sabres coming right at us at the same altitude. Without thinking, I gave the command “Let’s attack them” and turned at a nearly 90 degree bank to wind up 600 meters behind this group. It was just as I got the leader in my sights and gave him a burst that I got a sensation of that something was behind me. That sensation made me turn right and look behind me, and what it was I do not know to this day. Perhaps I had seen something. But inexplicable as it was, there I now saw less than 100 meters behind me the huge nose of a Sabre and the blasts and tracers of its six machine guns firing at me. Without thinking, in the space of a few hundredths of a second I reacted automatically, and my MiG momentarily did a half roll, dropping into a dive. While in the dive, I looked back and saw a group consisting of three Sabres right behind me in a dive. [...]
I could have initiated a dive, but I have been told that the Sabre was heavier than the MiG, so it should dive better. Because of that, to dive wasn't an option. Then I saw right in front of me a cluster of saving clouds. My only choice was to head my aircraft towards one of them. Once inside the cloud, I made a very sharp turn of 90° to the left, I got out of the clouds and performed a right turn. I supposed that the lead Sabre would thought that my MiG kept on diving straight after getting out of the cloud. And that was exactly what happened. Now, below me, there were these three Sabres, which were looking for me downwards. Without losing not even a second, I jumped them. I have turned the wits. Now it was my turn to attack.
But somehow they spotted me and immediately they split: the wingmen performed a diving turn to the left, and the leader a climbing right turn. This tactic allow them to neutralize my attack and to transform me into their prey: it was a trap. Whichever one I attacked, I would be forced to turn my tail to the others and then they would get me under fire. What was I to do? I could climb up and give battle, but I did not want to get into this interesting and advantageous situation: if you are going to do battle with strong pilots, with the Sabre wing commander, you had better be in a better position.
It is true that they were 3, but it didn't matter to me: I was very self-confident in my skills and my MiG. But now, I should decide fast who I shall to attack. Should I attack the pair which was diving, or the Sabre which was climbing? If I would jumped the first ones, the latter would dive after me and he would shoot me down. That's why I choose the later, because it was closer and was making a climbing turn to the right. So, I dived and soon I put myself behind him, I aimed, and at a distance of about 600 meters, I opened up. To slow down and to hold my fire until to be closer it was impossible, because the two remaining Sabres could catch me. My shells struck the Sabre. Evidently, some of the projectiles should hit it close to the engine, because the aircraft began to leave a trail of dark-gray smoke. The Sabre began to descend, and later entered in a steep dive.
I could not see all the fall, because when I looked back, I saw a couple of Sabres at 500 meters. A little bit more, and both would open fire with their 12,7 mm (0,50") machineguns.
Evidently, that was when I made a mistake. I should increase my angle of climbing and drag the Sabres to high altitude, where the MiG had the advantage. But I came to that conclusion only a long time later. At that time I reversed my heading, passed over the Sabres and in a slight dive I led my aircraft to a small group of clouds. Once there I turned to the right and went I got out of them, I started a ‘Boyeboj Razvorot [‘Combat Turn’, a climbing turn with a roll angle of 40-50°] to the left, but I didn’t found the Sabres bellow where I expect them to be, but behind at my left. [...]
I threw my aircraft in a dive, but instead of a sharp pull-up into a climb I began to slowly roll my aircraft into a flat dive. The Sabres, who didn’t expect that, stayed in the height, far above and behind.
I dived to the right towards the hydroelectric station over the Yalu river station is referred in the Russian cartography as Suphun hydroelectric station, and as Suiho Dam/Reservoir in the American one – Note of the authors. This huge reservoir had a dam of 300 meters height and a power station which provided energy not only to half of Korea but also the whole North-East of China. Precisely it was the main target we should protect. Besides us, their defense consisted in a dozen of anti-aircraft batteries, which had the order to shoot at any airplane which get closer to the dam.
I had the hope that the gunners of these batteries would help me to get these Sabres out of my tail. And that was what happened: the gunners accomplished their order to open fire at any intruder, and in front of me it appeared a dark cloud caused by the detonation of the anti-aircraft shells. I didn’t want to evade that cloud, because the Sabres would reduce the distance and they would shot me down. At that moment I preferred to eventually die in the hands of my fellow gunners, rather than the bullets of the Sabres, so I headed for the very center of a cloud. The aircraft punched into the cloud. Once inside and away from the shell bursts I immediately swung the aircraft from side to side, up and down. Grabbing the stick, I pulled back on it. The results were that the wings fluttered a bit.
But after several tens of seconds passed, suddenly I was once again out in the sunshine. The aircraft had punched through the black cloud. Behind and below me were the dam and the reservoir. Off to the left I could see the departing Sabres, having lost me in the cloud and perhaps figured I was dead. Following me had proven to be useless, the sea was near, and not wanting a new fight, even though I had come close to passing out from the stress. In order to not lose consciousness I focused my attention in front of me and pinched the arteries in my neck, as I did not want the blood to leave my head. It was far easier for the Sabre pilots to take this stress – they had a special anti-G suit which, when it sensed increased stress on the pilot, filled with air and, grasping him tightly, prevented the blood from leaving his head. Up until then our designers had never thought of such an idea.
I circled the airfield a couple of times, landed and then, taxiing over to the hardstand, saw my wingmen. They, having lost me during the sharp turn, continued to go after the eight Sabres, but when they got to the coastline had to turn back, searched for me, and not finding me, returned to the airfield.
Subsequent examination of my gun camera footage showed good hits on the Sabre. Ground command reported where it had impacted.”
The Sabre downed by Kramarenko was the F-86A BuNo 49-1281 of Lt.Col. Glenn Todd Eagleston (4th FIG's commander, a famed World War II ace with 18.5 Luftwaffe kills while flying a P-51 Mustang, and two victories against MiGs in Korea), who belly-landed his jet at Kimpo Airbase South Korea. The jet was damaged beyond repair and was written off. The leader of the two Sabres who came to assist Eagleston was also a notable combat pilot: Lt.Col. Bruce Hinton, the first Sabre pilot to shoot down a MiG on 17 December 1950.
First Jet-vs-Jet Ace in History.
Kramarenko's streak of successes continued during June and July. On the 23rd he was credited with another F-86 kill (although records show no Sabre was lost that day). On 11 July the 176th GIAP engaged a group of Sabres escorting F-80s, while the 196th IAP intercepted the fighter-bombers. While leading six MiG-15bis Kramarenko engaged a flight of six Sabres, and at 300 meters shot down one F-86 which was seen to crash south-west of Tetsuzan, the pilot ejecting into the sea.
On 29 July 1951 sixteen MiG-15bis of the 176th GIAP relieved other MiGs of the 17th IAP which were tangling with Sabres. Kramarenko's flight was among them, and flying at 14,000 meters he spotted two F-86s at 10,000 meters. A single burst at 250 meters sent one of them downwards out of control. The heavy 37 and 23 mm shells from Kramarenko's MiG-15bis destroyed the rudder and elevators of the F-86A BuNo 49-1098 (4th FIW) and its pilot managed to reach South Korea where he bailed out safely. This was Kramarenko's fifth victory. Sergei Kramarenko was the actual first ace of the Korean War, and due to the fact that all his victims were jets the First Jet-vs-Jet Ace in History.
Hero of the Soviet Union.
The 324th IAD had been fighting without a respite since April. During August it was allowed to rest for a month. When the unit came back into the fight, Kramarenko soon claimed new victories:
Kramarenko was postulated to be awarded the "Zolotaya Svezda", which is given the title of "Geroy Sovietskogo Soyuza" (Hero of the Soviet Union).He was finally decorated with this award on 10 November 1951 by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolay Shvernik. On his return to the skies over Korea, Kramarenkokept on scoring victories:
"After takeoff and climb to altitude we saw the entire sky was filled with moving dots. We dropped our tanks and hit the throttles, and our MiGs went into combat. Immediately the regiment broke up into several groups and pairs. I and my six were following the group commander’s flight, which were attacking a group of Sabres flying an intersecting course from below the Sabres. At that moment his group found itself under attack from a flight of Sabres. I gave the command to my wingman to repulse the attack, and we proceeded to cut through their flight. A long burst in front of the Sabres forced them to break off the attack and climb away. I gave the command to Lazutin to go after them, while I and my wingman turned to follow the group commander, who had opened fire as he closed on the Sabres, but they made a sharp maneuver to avoid his fire and split up. One flight went into steep left bank, and the other did the same to the right. Vishnyakov’s flight split up as well and began to go after both groups as pairs. At that moment his pair was jumped from above by a pair of Sabres, who literally popped up about 300-400 meters from me. I immediately went over to get on their tails. The Sabres rolled over and went into a dive. I ordered Gogolev, my third pair leader, “Cover the commander,” and tried to go after the Sabres. I could see that the Sabres were holding a dive at an angle of about 60 degrees – I aimed at them and immediately gave one of them a burst. I saw the shells detonate in the area of the cockpit, and there was clearly black smoke now visible inside the cockpit; the Sabre’s dive angle increased and he kept ongoing down. At that moment, Gulyy called me:
-I’m spinning! 
I looked behind me and saw his aircraft nearly inverted. I gave the command: 
-Hit your air brakes! Pull out!
I saw Gulyy pull out of the inverted position and we then went into a dive, climbed back up to altitude, and returned home. [...]
Fifty years later a special group carrying out a search for American pilots who were missing in action asked me if the pilot of the Sabre I shot down had bailed out. I could only repeat what I wrote above.”
Fired Upon.
On 17 January 1952 Kramarenko flew his last combat mission in Korea. During it he damaged an F-86, but was not only shot down himself but also fired upon by the Sabre flier while he was hanging defenseless in his parachute. He himself describes the events:
“17 January was a heavy day for me. The radar station picked up the approach of a group of ground attack aircraft on their way to Anju. Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but we were not able to attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. 
Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. 
I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty – as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft – I managed to get my hand on the ejection seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so I pulled on the parachute ripcord ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. 
Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.
Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. 
Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.
I looked down. The cloud was now much closer – perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first – will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers."
Kramarenko landed safely was found by a North Korean villager who took care of him until he was recovered by a search party and returned to Antung. The Sabre attacked by Kramarenko was the F-86E BuNo 50-636 of Major George V. Wendling (16th FIS), which received "major damage" on that day. Almost certainly the pilot who shot down and shot at the Soviet ace was Major William F. Shaeffer, of the 16th FIS, 51st FIW.
Following the decision of General Staff of USSR's Armed Forces, the VVS 303rd and 324th IAD were replaced by PVO divisions, the 97th and 190th IAD. So, on 31 January 324th, IAD ceased combat operations in Korea and 176th GIAP (and Kramarenko with it) returned to the Soviet Union.
Credits for aerial victories of Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko.
In the German-Soviet War Sergei Kramarenko scored two individual victories and 10 more group (shared) kills, plus a balloon. During the Korean War he flew 104 combat sorties, engaged UN aircraft in 42 occasions, and was officially credited with 13 victories. After cross-referencing his credited victories with German and US losses, it seems that in fact he shot down one German warplane during World War II, and he scored at least eight or nine victories in Korea, besides seriously damaging three more UN jets.

Post War Career and Family.
After his return to the Soviet Union, he studied at the Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 1954. Around that same time, in Moscow, he met an art student - Yulya Alekseyevna. Soon they began dating and going together to the Bolshoy Theater and others. In 1956 he got his first command duty as deputy commander of a regiment placed in Machulishchi, Belarus. In 1957 he proposed marriage to Yulya, and she accepted. Already married, that same year Kramarenko received his second command assignment - the 167th IAP in Georgia. Soon other commissions followed all over the Soviet Union, and he was also blessed by the births of his son Aleksandr and his daughter Nadezhda.
In 1970 he received a new appointment, this time on foreign soil: the Iraqi Air Force had bought brand new MiG-21s, and Kramarenko helped Iraqi pilots and officers to learn to operate the Soviet aircraft and trained them in tactics. A similar duty followed in Algeria in the mid-1970s. Finally, already a Major-General of the Air Force, Kramarenko retired in 1977.
Today Sergei Kramarenko is the vice-president of the "Rossiskaya Assotsiatsya Geroev" (Russian Association of Heroes, the War Veteran Association, named that way because many of his members are Heroes of the Soviet Union), author of his autobiography and collaborator in many other books where Russian pilots have openly described his wartime experiences. Sergei Kramarenko lives currently in his flat in Moscow together with his wife, receiving the love of his daughter and four grandsons.

Grant Depot and Water Tower

The Grant Depot and Water Tower (or The Grand Rapids, Newaygo and Lake Shore Railroad Company Depot and Water Tower) is a state historical site in Grant, Michigan. The railroad depot, and water tower was built in 1891 by the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad, and within a few years became part of the Pere Marquette System. The water tower is believed to be the last original wooden water tower in the State of Michigan, and the site was added to the Michigan State Historical Registry on June 10, 1980.
History.
After being built in 1891, the station quickly became a very important part of the local enonomy. In terms of agriculture, around this time, Grant shipped a lot of produce by rail. In 1915, 10 to 12 cars of peaches a day were shipped, and later in the 1930s carloads of onions were shipped out from this station, earning Grant the title of “Onion Capital of the World.”
This station was also very important in regards to the lumbering industry. During the seasons of 1872-73, of logs came of out of Newaygo County, mostly from the Grant Station, at the rate of 100,000 a day. This was one of the first log trains in Michigan. By 1885 Andrew T. Squire, owner of the local saw mill and founder of Grant, was producing of lumber per year.
Until the late 1940s, there were two passenger trains, (each way) running everyday between Grand Rapids and Traverse City, through the Grant Depot. The last passenger train ran in 1963. 
In 1979 the depot was rebuilt to serve as a restaurant. The agents office and waiting room became a dining room. The freight room, became a kitchen, and an addition on the east side serves as an additional dining room. This restaurant is still operational today.
Water Tower Move.
Up until June 26, 2008 the City-owned water tower sat on of CSX owned land. The City of Grant had been paying a lease for that land for many years and CSX railroad was not interested in allowing for a state historical marker to be placed. Therefore it was decided to move the water tower to the east, in front of the city-owned caboose. This would allow the city to stop paying the lease, a historical marker to be place, and a small park to be created at the site. This move cost the city $60,000, of which the Fremont Area Community Foundation awarded $50,000 in grants. The move attracted hundreds of on-lookers to the city including local television, and newspaper media. Prior to the move, The State Historical Commission was contacted, and they gave their approval and support for the project.
State Historical Registry.
This site was added to the Michigan State Historical Registry on June 10, 1980. It was assigned ID# P24311.

L. Brooks Leavitt

L. Brooks Leavitt (1878–1941) was an investment banker and antiquarian book collector who served as an overseer of Bowdoin College, to whose library he donated part of his collection of rare books and manuscripts. Born in Wilton, Maine, to a father who was a stagecoach driver who died when Leavitt was young, Brooks Leavitt was an aesthete turned banker whom Maine's poet laureate later eulogized at his funeral.
Biography.
Leon Brooks Leavitt was born to William Newcomb Leavitt and Ada Idela (Russell) Leavitt in Wilton, Maine, on April 3, 1878. Leavitt's father dropped dead of a heart attack when Brooks Leavitt was attending Wilton Academy. Leavitt subsequently attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he became a voracious reader, and to which he later helped send his younger brother Russell by paying his tuition.
On graduating, Leavitt worked briefly as the principal of a Farmington, Maine high school, and then went to work for the United States Census Bureau. Leavitt subsequently attended George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C., and practiced law briefly in New York City, before joining the Wall Street investment banking firm of Bertram, Griscom & Company.
Within a few years, Leavitt joined the investment banking firm of Paine, Webber & Co., where he worked at the firm's headquarters on Wall Street in Manhattan. Leavitt became a bond specialist, and was later one of the partners in charge of the company. While working at Paine Webber, Leavitt indulged his true loves – literature, oriental carpets and the companionship of artists and writers of the day. Having eventually made a fortune on Wall Street, Leavitt retired back to his beloved Maine.
One of Leavitt's lifelong friends was Robert P. T. Coffin, a fellow Mainer, Bowdoin graduate and Bowdoin professor. Coffin dedicated his novel "Captain Abbey and Captain John" to his friend Leavitt, "a fellow son of Maine." Following Leavitt's death from heart disease, Coffin eulogized him in his poem "Brooks Leavitt", read at Leavitt's 1941 funeral in Wilton. A longtime patron of the arts, Brooks Leavitt was close to many New York artists and actors, including Francis Wilson, the foremost Broadway stage actor of his day. Among other of Leavitt's lifelong friends was the American explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan, with whom Leavitt regularly corresponded.
Among the manuscripts owned and collected by Leavitt, who turned to book collecting after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, was an original Shakespeare First Folio, as well as the original manuscript of D. H. Lawrence's "Sons and Lovers", written in Lawrence's own hand.
Leavitt was married to the former Elizabeth Burns Purman, who was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Dr. James Jackson Purman and Mary Witherow Purman of Washington, D.C. Dr Purman was the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for gallantry in the battle of Gettysburg. Brooks Leavitt and his wife lived in Manhattan and at their second home in Leavitt's birthplace of Wilton, Maine, where the couple's home was designed by the Maine architect John Calvin Stevens. The couple had no children. Brooks Leavitt served as an overseer of Bowdoin College, and subsequently donated manuscripts to the Bowdoin Library by alumni Nathaniel Hawthorne, Franklin Pierce, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

MS Augustus

MS "Augustus" was a combined ocean liner and cruise ship built in 1927 for Navigazione Generale Italiana. The ship was later transferred to the new Italian Line after the merger of Navigazione Generale Italiana. Her sister ship was SS "Roma"
History.
Following the end of World War I, many shipping companies were planning to build new liners once they had enough money. Navigazione Generale Italiana decided to build two new liners of over 30,000 gross registered tons for post war service. The first ship was "Roma" which was launched in 1926. The second ship was launched in December 1926 at the Ansaldo Shipyard and was christened "Augustus" by Edda Mussolini (daughter of dictator Benito Mussolini). She was fitted out and made her maiden voyage on November 10, 1927. Her interior was decorated in the Baroque style. She was the largest diesel-engined passenger ship of her time, whereas her sister was equipped with geared steam turbines. The "Augustus" was c. 215 meters long and was designed to carry 1,675 passengers. 
She operated on the South American service while her sister ran the North Atlantic service. The "Augustus" could reportedly reach South America from Italy in five days at an average speed of 22 knots. In 1932, Navigazione Generale Italiana was forced by Mussolini to merge with other Italian shipping companies to form the Italia Line. Because of this, the funnels of the "Augustus" were repainted in Italia Line colours. In 1933, she began to carry out 129-day world cruises after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. She carried many passengers from New York to a number of ports around the world and back to New York in 129 days. 
Conversion to aircraft carrier.
At the outbreak of World War II the "Augustus" and the "Roma" were laid up but both ships were subsequently taken over by the Italian Navy. Like her sister, the "Augustus" was converted into an aircraft carrier and renamed "Falco" and later "Sparviero". In 1944, both ships were taken over by the German troops but on September 25 of that year she was scuttled, in order to blockade Genoa habour from the Allies. After the war she was raised and scrapped in 1946.

RS-102,221 is a drug developed by Hoffmann–La Roche, which was one of the first compounds discovered that acts as a potent and selective antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, with around 100x selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. It has anxiolytic effects in animal studies, increases the effectiveness of SSRI antidepressants, and shows a complex interaction with cocaine, increasing some effects but decreasing others, reflecting a role for the 5-HT2C receptor in regulation of the dopamine signalling system in the brain.

<doc id="20565729" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20565729" title="St. John's Priory, Viborg">
St. John's Priory, Viborg

St. John's Priory, Viborg (), was a monastery of the Knights Hospitaller in Viborg, Denmark.
History.
The principal abbey of the Knights of St. John, otherwise known as the Knights Hospitallers, at Antvorskov established several small houses in towns throughout Denmark in the late 13th century, one of them at Viborg. Apparently the first small monastic house ("Johannitterbo") was built at Viborg at St. Ib's Church, which had been given to Antvorskov Abbey. Eleven years later the priory, with its church rededicated to Saint John () was founded nearby in 1285 by the Count of Everstein, who gave a property in Viborg to the Order of the Knights of St John of Malta, or Hospitallers. His widow Mariana also gave additional income property to the priory to fund its operations, especially the hospital. Subsequently, confusion has arisen between St. John's parish church and St. John's Priory church.
St. John's Priory church.
The church formed the north range of a quadrangular abbey complex with refectory, dormitory, kitchens, guest house, and cellars. The church was 88 cubits long and 55 cubits wide, an and was described by an observer as "grand". By 1527 a free-standing hospital ("Sct. Hans Hospital") had been added to the complex. In 1458 a new larger building was constructed on the other side of St. Ib's Street.
St. John's Priory played a significant part in the Reformation in Denmark. Reform-minded Danes who had been to Germany and heard Luther or his ideas brought them back to Denmark in the mid 1520s. Among them was Hans Tausen, a Hospitaller who had studied in Germany and come back determined to spread the truth as he saw it to the people of Denmark. On Good Friday 1525 he preached Luther's ideas to the congregation at Antvorskov Abbey on Zealand, the headquarters of the Hospitallers in Scandinavia. The head of the order was scandalized by the rebellious monk and sent him to St. John's Priory in Viborg to contemplate his errors under the watchful eye of Prior Peder Jensen. Tausen eventually received permission to teach in the priory church and soon had a loyal and ardent following. His superior at St. John's protected him from the Bishop of Viborg who was prepared to arrest Tausen and put him on trial. But his ideas were too radical and he was expelled from his order and went to live with the Mayor of Viborg.
Tausen continued to preach, and the crowds who came to hear him grew so large that the prior was forced to let Tausen leave the priory. Tausen continued to preach to enormous crowds in the open. Danish weather is regularly damp and dreary and the mayor requested that Tausen be permitted to hold services in the priory church. In 1528 Bishop Jørgen Friis tried to have Tausen arrested by force but the crowds formed a cordon around him and chased away the bishop's men. They forced their way into the much larger Franciscan church to accommodate the growing numbers of people who wanted to hear Tausen and other Lutheran preachers. Less than a year later, Viborg had become mostly Lutheran and all Roman Catholic religious houses were closed. For a time Viborg became the center of the Reformation in Denmark. Monks either removed their habits and joined the reformers, or left the country.
After the Reformation.
After the Reformation, the citizens of Viborg applied to King Christian III to decommission some of the town's several churches which were too costly to maintain. All churches, religious institutions, and the properties which they owned reverted to the crown in 1536. The antipathy of Viborg's Lutheran citizens against the monastery churches for their connection to the forcible attempt to suppress Hans Tausen and their fervent desire to rid themselves of Catholic custom and institutions explain why the "grand" church was chosen to be secularized. The crown gave the priory to the city of Viborg, which converted the buildings to other uses. In 1552 the priory became the location of the local court. In 1578 the court was relocated and the church was demolished and the materials used for restoration of the cathedral and the bishop's residence in Viborg.

Robert William Cole

Robert William Cole (1869-1937) was a British photographer and author who wrote early science fiction and future war fiction. Cole's works, mostly out of print and very obscure, can be found at the British Library. They include the following:
The expanding Anglo-Saxon Empire of Earth collides with a similar empire based on Kairet, a planet of Sirius. Both empires have forgotten spiritual and philosophical values, and are driven largely by greed. Commercial rivalries soon escalate to a devastating interstellar war which results in the destruction of most of the Terran fleet, the invasion of Earth, and other disasters. The book is notable for its depiction of technology including antigravity, interplanetary radio, television, various forms of death ray, industrial transmutation, etc. A scholarly edition prepared by Richard Bleiler is available from the English publishers Pickering & Chatto as part of their "Political Future Fiction" series.
Germany, France, and Russia go to war with Britain (the French under duress, the others willingly), destroy the British fleet, and invade southern England. Britain is nearly defeated and as profiteering, government bungling and the acts of German agents bring the country close to revolution, a heroic general is called upon to lead the country to victory. With the aid of the Japanese navy (the Japanese remembering Britain as allies from their war with Russia) the General engages the German fleet at the last moment. France switches sides just before the battle, and the enemy fleet is turned away.

Teseida

Teseida (full title: "Teseida delle Nozze d’Emilia", or "The Theseid, Concerning the Nuptials of Emily") is a long epic poem written by Giovanni Boccaccio c.1340–41. Running to almost 10,000 lines divided into twelve books, its notional subject is the career and rule of the ancient Greek hero Theseus (Teseo), although the majority of the epic tells the story of the rivalry of Palemone and Arcita for the love of Emilia. It is the main source of "The Knight's Tale" in Geoffrey Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales", and therefore is the original source of "Two Noble Kinsmen" a collaboration by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. The exact sources of Boccaccio's knowledge about the ancient Greek world are unknown, but is likely that he gained the knowledge through his close friendship with Paolo de Perugia, a medieval collector of ancient myths and tales.
Jeanne de la Font gained fame in the sixteenth century by writing a French verse adaption of "Teseida".
Synopsis.
Book I: Teseo (Theseus) launches an expedition into Scythia, the land of the Amazons. There his expedition is victorious against the warrior women and marries their queen, Ipolita (Hippolyta).
Book II: Returning home to Athens with Ipolita, he encounters on the road a group of women from Thebes. They are the widows of nobles and heroes defeated by the new ruler there, Creon, who has refused to let the bodies of the vanquished be buried. At their entreaty, Teseo reroutes his army to Thebes (sending Ipolita on to Athens under guard) and there does battle against Creon. Teseo is victorious again. In the aftermath, Teseo's soldiers find two cousins nearly dead on the battlefield. They are Palemone and Arcita, who belong to the Theban royal family. So Teseo orders them taken with him to Athens to be imprisoned for life.
Book III: From out of the window of their shared prison cell, both men spy Ipolita’s younger sister, Emilia, and are instantly smitten. But neither has any hope of pursuing the object of his ardor. However, at the intercession of Peritoo, a friend of Teseo, Arctia is released from prison under the condition that he will leave Athens and never return.
Book IV: Both men are now beside themselves with love agony: Palemone because he remains in prison where he can see Emilia but can't reach her; Arcita because he can't even see Emilia, forced as he is to stay out of Athens on pain of death. But after years pass and he has become gaunt from his love agonies, Arcita looks very different from his previous appearance. So he decides to risk all by returning to Athens under that disguise, adopting the name Penteo. There he manages to secure a position in Teseo’s court and gradually gains prominence.
Book V: Still in prison, Palemone eventually learns of Arcita's return and becomes wildly jealous. This leads him to make a daring escape and then confront Arcita in a grove where Arcita frequently goes to sigh out this love. The two commence a duel to the death but are soon interrupted by Teseo who happens to be leading a hunting party through that very grove. Learning who the combatants are and the cause of their dispute, he decrees that the two must fight it out formally in the lists, the victor to win the hand of Emilia. He gives the two a year to scour the world and gather a hundred of the noblest knights each.
Book VI: A year later the opposing champions arrive and are described in detail, as is the arena specially built for the contest.
Book VII: Just before the morning of battle, the opposing lovers, as well as Emilia (who wants to remain single), pray to their respective deities. And each receives a positive sign that seems to contradict the signs received by the others. The battle is then prepared for.
Book VIII: The two opposing armies engage in a battle that is described in detail. But it soon comes down to a contest between the two lovers. Finally, Arcita gains the victory, doing so without killing Palemone.
Book IX: Arcita is accidentally injured. But he is still able to celebrate his victory and marry Emilia.
Book X: Then Arcita, after much suffering, dies from his wounds.
Book XI: He is given a hero's funeral that is described in elaborate detail.
Book XII: In the end, Teseo determines that Emilia and Palemone should marry, and this is done. Thus all the seemingly contradictory prophesies of the gods (given in Book VII) are fulfilled.

<doc id="20565816" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20565816" title="Oooh La La!">
Oooh La La!

Oooh La La! is the eighth album by the Crash Test Dummies, released 11 May 2010 on Deep Fried Records, distributed by MRI Records. The songs on the album are based around the Optigan and Omnichord toy instruments.
Background.
The seeds for Oooh La La! were first planted when Brad Roberts and producer Stewart Lerman (Antony & the Johnsons, The Roches) became infatuated with vintage analog musical toys, particularly one manufactured by the Mattel company called the Optigan (an acronym for "optical organ"). Using celluloid discs, the Optigan projects the sounds of other instruments with different sets of keys triggering chords and individual notes. The discs, with names like "Nashville," "Swing It!" and "Guitar Boogie," rotate to produce different arrays of sounds. The process is eerily similar to the digital sampling that is so common today, but the antiquated analog system produces quite a different effect. "Because we wrote using these discs, we were inspired to do things that we wouldn't have done," Roberts points out. "I don't write big band style, but all of a sudden I had this big band disc, so I'm writing in a genre that I normally wouldn't be writing in. I can't say enough about how great it is to write on these toys."
Release.
Brad Roberts originally stated that he planned to release the album as a digital-only release, since he couldn't afford the CD distribution costs (and he believed that CDs would be out of date by 2015). However, plans were later changed and Roberts signed a distribution deal with MRI Records, which distributed the album via Sony's RED Distribution division.
Reception.
The album received mainly positive reviews upon its release. Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and commented on the extremely upbeat nature of the album stating that "it’s hard to believe this is the same man who wrote songs like "At My Funeral" and "The Unforgiven Ones"". Mario Tarradell of "The Dallas Morning News" gave the album a "B" and praised the album's use of toy instruments as ingenious. Brad Wheeler of "The Globe and Mail" gave the album 2½ out of 4 stars describing the album as "all good fun, except for the skedaddling country-swing of "What I’m Famous For", where Roberts shows off the worst John Wayne imitation ever." Catherine P. Lewis of "The Washington Post" says that ""Oooh La La!" is not likely to add a second hit to the Dummies' legacy, but this quirky instrumentation certainly makes for a group that's enjoying itself." Jill Wilson of the "Winnipeg Free Press" gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and says that while the use of the Optigan is as gimmicky as it sounds, "fans of the band's early work may appreciate its offbeat qualities, not to mention Roberts' knack for appealing melodies and the album's orchestral feel." However, she also make a criticism that "Roberts too often pushes that mannered baritone of his into forced lows, as on the otherwise lovely '30s-tinged "Not Today Baby", which is reduced to novelty status by his vocal mugging"
However, the album also received some poor reviews. Graham Rockingham of "Metro Canada" gave the album 2½ out of 5 stars and, while he appreciated gentle folk rockers like "Songbird", he states that "the project quickly goes off course as the Dummies try to adapt their trademark sound to something approaching retro riverboat cabaret." Mike Allen, reviewing for Sputnikmusic, also gave the album 2½ out of 5 stars and states that "after getting past the ideal that Roberts brings a certain distinction to the music, his vocals grow tired." He specifically criticizes the songs "What I'm Famous For" and "Now You See Her" as examples of how disjointed the album is, with a lack of cohesiveness. However, he does praise Ellen Reid's contributions to the album, especially on "Heart of Stone" and "Put a Face".

Core (optical fiber)

[[Image:Singlemode fibre structure.svg|thumb|right|The structure of a typical single-mode fiber.

2. Cladding 125 µm dia.
3. Buffer 250 µm dia.
4. Jacket 400 µm dia.]]
The core of a conventional optical fiber is a cylinder of glass or plastic that runs along the fiber's length. The core is surrounded by a medium with a lower index of refraction, typically a cladding of a different glass, or plastic. Light travelling in the core reflects from the core-cladding boundary due to total internal reflection, as long as the angle between the light and the boundary is less than the critical angle. As a result, the fiber transmits all rays that enter the fiber with a sufficiently small angle to the fiber's axis. The limiting angle is called the acceptance angle, and the rays that are confined by the core/cladding boundary are called guided rays.
The core is characterized by its diameter or cross-sectional area. In most cases the core's cross-section should be circular, but the diameter is more rigorously defined as the average of the diameters of the smallest circle that can be circumscribed about the core-cladding boundary, and the largest circle that can be inscribed within the core-cladding boundary. This allows for deviations from circularity due to manufacturing variation.
Another commonly quoted statistic for core size is the mode field diameter. This is the diameter at which the intensity of light in the fiber falls to some specified fraction of maximum (usually 1/e2≈13.5%). For single-mode fiber, the mode field diameter is larger than the physical diameter of the core, because the light penetrates slightly into the cladding as an evanescent wave.

Laure Rièse

Laure Eva Rièse, O.Ont (1910 – 1996) was an academic at Victoria University, Toronto, author, poet and later a mature model.
Early days.
Rièse was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, the daughter of Frédéric Rièse and Laure Veuilleumier. She had a brother who was an architect. Rièse went to secondary school in Switzerland, and studied arts and literature at the Sorbonne in Paris before moving to Toronto in 1928 at the age of 18.
Academic career.
In Toronto, she became the don of Victoria University, Toronto's French house as well as teaching French while studying at the University. Rièse obtained three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in 1933, an M.A. in 1935 and was the first female faculty member to obtain a Ph.D. from the university in 1946. Rièse was a French professor in Victoria University's French Faculty, teaching courses about French-Canadian authors and Quebec's place in la francophonie. Being a female professor at an institution such as the University of Toronto in the 1930s was exceptional; however she had to do different things because she was a woman and almost the same age as her students, at least at first. It is important to realize that although she wore more masculine clothing, she never thought of herself as masculine; she just found it easier to wear 'boyish' clothing than 'girlish' clothing.
Students' comments.
Former students of hers interviewed in a documentary claimed that she was a very strict teacher. Margaret Bond, who was in Rièse's French class in 1947, said that because she had a seating plan and knew everyone, students were motivated to keep up in her class. Another student of hers in 1949 by the name of Roy Shatz spoke about how she looked fierce but if you volunteered to answer questions before being prompted she would be less so. Other comments mentioned that if students were late she would glare at them, and they would never be late again. There is also the story of students staying outside of the classroom door to avoid her glare while still being able to hear the lessons. Rièse retired from teaching at University of Toronto in 1976, though she never truly left Victoria, the university granting her an office even after her retirement.
Modeling career.
After Rièse's retirement from Victoria, she became a mature model, posing in advertising campaigns across Canada. The most noted ones are a campaign that appeared on Toronto Transit Commission bus stops which had Rièse posing with an elder gentleman, whom she knew nothing about other than his name, an advertisement for the Bank of Montreal and a makeup advertisement in Quebec. Rièse really enjoyed being a model; she believes the reason for this was that she always wanted to be an actor, as was evident in her great support for drama and the arts in Toronto.
Honours.
She was an active member of the community, participating in numerous organizations such as the "Alliance Française de Toronto", where she was honorary president, and the "Canadian Suisse Cultural Association", where she was chair. She published many articles and poetry anthologies and received many awards from various countries, including the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur in France (1971), the Officier d'Académie (1946), the Officier d'Instruction Publique, Officer of the Order of Canada, and Dame of the Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem.
Rièse also travelled all over Europe as well as to more remote places such as India, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, and the Himalayas, though she travelled most to France. Rièse had a school in Toronto's French public system named after her, and visited it often. Parents of the children there thought of her as a grandparent figure to their kids, especially those that had immigrated and had no other family in Canada. They called her "Tante Laure". Rièse died in Toronto in 1996.

Early numeracy is a branch of numeracy that aims to enhance numeracy learning for younger learners, particularly those at-risk in the area of mathematics. Usually the mathematical learning begins with simply learning the digits, being 1-10. This is done because it acts as an entry way to the expansion of counting. One can keep track of the digits using any of the phalanges

Ghost Adventures

Ghost Adventures is an American television series about the paranormal that premiered on October 17, 2008, on the Travel Channel. Produced by MY-Tupelo Entertainment, (a merger of MY Entertainment and Tupelo-Honey Productions), the program follows ghost hunters Zak Bagans, Nick Groff, and Aaron Goodwin as they investigate locations that are reported to be haunted. The show is introduced and narrated by Zak Bagans.
Origin.
"Ghost Adventures" began as an independent film, produced in a documentary style. It was filmed in 2004 and produced by 4Reel Productions in 2006. The Syfy Channel premiered 4Reel's "Ghost Adventures" on July 25, 2007. The documentary centered on the trio's investigation of alleged paranormal activity in and around Virginia City, Nevada. The crew returned there during the series' fifth season. The film also featured the Goldfield Hotel in Goldfield, Nevada, where the crew later returned to during the series' fourth and seventh seasons and caught more substantial evidence.
Summary.
Zak Bagans, Nick Groff, and Aaron Goodwin investigate reportedly haunted locations, hoping to collect visual or auditory evidence of paranormal activity. Each episode begins with the trio touring the investigation site with its owners or caretakers. These introductions typically include Zak's voice-overs of the site's history as well as interviews with people who claim to have witnessed paranormal phenomena there. On the basis of these interviews, the crew place X's with black or gray tape at the sites of some serious alleged paranormal activity. They later return to these spots in order to set up static night-vision cameras to try and film it happening.
After completing the walk-through they discuss their strategy, then lock themselves in the location overnight, which they believe will prevent "audio contamination". They use a variety of equipment, including digital thermometers, electromagnetic field (EMF) meters, handheld digital video cameras, audio recorders, the Ovilus device, point of view cameras, and infrared night-vision cameras in an effort to capture evidence of ghosts. The members sometimes place objects and shout verbal taunts they believe ghosts might move or respond to.
At the end of the episode, they analyze their audio, photographs, and video footage, often with the assistance of alleged paranormal experts, and present anything they feel is "unexplained phenomena" to the audience.
During the series, the crew claims to have captured and experienced various Fortean phenomena, which they say include simultaneous equipment malfunctions such as battery drain, voltage spikes, fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, sudden changes in temperature (such as cold spots), unexplained noises, electronic voice phenomena (EVP), and apparitions.
The crew also claim to have recorded spirit possessions on video. Bagans believes that he was possessed at the Preston School of Industry and at Poveglia Island in Italy. Groff claims that he was overtaken by a "dark energy" at the Moon River Brewing Company. Goodwin claims he was "under the influence of a dark spirit" at Bobby Mackey's Music World and Winchester Mystery House.
Cast and crew.
The permanent members of the cast and crew are Zak Bagans, Nick Groff, and Aaron Goodwin.
Zak Bagans.
Zachary Alexander Bagans is an American executive producer, director, writer,and lead investigator/co-founder of the Ghost Adventures Crew (G.A.C.) organization. Bagans was born on April 5, 1977 in Washington D.C and states he grew up in Las Vegas,but he assuredly did not. He graduated Glenbard West High School in Glen Ellyn, Illinois in 1995. Bagans attended the Motion Picture Institute in Michigan. Following graduation from MPI, he moved to Las Vegas, aspiring to film documentaries. After arriving in Las Vegas, he found work as a wedding disc jockey. A former skeptic, Bagans says that his passion for investigating the "paranormal" resulted from what he describes as "a face-to-face encounter with the spirit of a suicidal woman", in his former apartment building in Trenton, Michigan.
Bagans has been criticized by some paranormal enthusiasts for the aggressive and confrontational methods he uses during "investigations". In a June 2009 interview with "Paranormal Underground" magazine, he responded, "I don't want the public perceiving us as the taunting, provocative "ghost" hunters. We do that only to the bad "spirits" who we know are attacking the living. Bad spirits fear my biceps." Bagans has also been known for wearing gasmasks due to his respiratory problems and for attempting to use MMA moves in order to subdue "ghosts."
In 2011, Bagans hosted "Paranormal Challenge", a concurrent spin-off program also on the Travel Channel, which also starred radio personality Dave Schrader. In 2011, Zak Bagans narrated and hosted a Travel Channel special called "Ultimate Travel: Legends of the Park." The show was about America's National Parks and how they are haunted.
Bagans wrote a book with author Kelly Crigger titled "Dark World: Into the Shadows with the Lead Investigator of the Ghost Adventures Crew" (Victory Belt, 2011). On September 23, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list at number 18.
In 2012, Bagans appeared in two music collaborations with Lords of Acid on the song "Paranormal Energy" and on an album called "Necrofusion" with Praga Khan. Bagans produced "Paranormal Paparazzi", a reality show that premiered on September 28 but starred entertainment pundit Aaron Sagers.
Nick Groff.
Nicholas Groff (born April 19, 1980) is a co-investigator and executive producer of Ghost Adventures, as well as an editor and cameraman for the show. Groff was executive producer for a show on the Travel Channel called "Vegas Stripped", a behind-the-scenes look at the operations of the South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa in Las Vegas, NV.
Born in San Jose, California, Groff grew up in New England. He graduated from Pelham High School in New Hampshire and later studied film at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he met Aaron Goodwin. At the age of eight he fell out of a tree in the yard of his family's home in Salem, New Hampshire, which Groff described as "a near-death experience". Two years later, while at home alone, he says he saw a ghostly black figure. In a 2012 interview, Groff questioned, "Was it my imagination? Or was it something from my accident that made me more open to that world?"
Groff befriended Bagans during Groff's wedding in Las Vegas. Groff claims he was possessed by an entity at the Moon River Brewing Company in Savannah, Georgia and says it was one of his "most life-changing experiences". According to Groff, an encounter with a female spirit at the Linda Vista Community Hospital in East Los Angeles, California gave him insights into life after death. Groff was allegedly possessed in Natchez, Mississippi during the investigation of King's Tavern.
Groff released an album entitled "The Other Side". The lyrics recall Groff's spiritual journey. He also has a clothing line named "Phantom Collection". 
As of 2012, he and his wife Veronique reside in New Hampshire and Massachusetts with their daughter, Annabelle.
Aaron Goodwin.
Aaron Goodwin (born April 1, 1976) is an equipment technician, camera operator, and co-investigator of Ghost Adventures. Originally from Portland, Oregon, as of 2012 he resides in Las Vegas.
Before joining Bagans and Groff, Goodwin had worked as a camera operator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and several behind-the-scenes film premieres in Las Vegas. Goodwin says that prior to his experiences in Virginia City, Nevada, he "never really thought twice about ghosts." Goodwin is often left alone in the alleged "hotspots" during lockdowns to act as bait for supposed paranormal "entities".
Goodwin sells a line of clothing bearing the label "Big Steppin".
Recurring.
The following people have regularly appeared in the show as part of the GAC:
Notable guests.
"Ghost Adventures" has involved celebrities who have participated in the investigations or appeared in the episodes as eyewitnesses:
Reception.
The 2004 documentary film "Ghost Adventures" received several awards, including the 2006 Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival (NYIIFVF). Seasons 1 and 2 were released on DVD on August 18, 2009.
Occasionally conducting public investigations with fans and paranormal enthusiasts, the trio has appeared on "Maury", "Fox 19 News", NBC's "Today", and TV Guide Network's "Hollywood 411".
In 2009, the series won three International Paranormal Acknowledgement (IPA) Awards.
In 2010, the program won two Spooktalkular Parawards.
Controversy.
In the October 30, 2009 Halloween special "Ghost Adventures Live at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum", controversy arose when Robert Bess, inventor of the so-called Parabot Containment Chamber (said to attract and empower spirits using energy, giving them form), claims to have had an EMF meter knocked violently out of his hand. However, upon investigation of the video, it was found that he had actually thrown it. On the November 6, 2009 follow-up "Ghost Adventures Live: Post Mortem", hosts Bagans and Groff reviewed the video and concluded they couldn't claim any paranormal explanation for the incident.<ref name=post/ref />

Xerocomus subtomentosus

Xerocomus subtomentosus, commonly known as suede bolete, brown and yellow bolet, boring brown bolete or yellow-cracked bolete, is a species of edible mushroom in the family Boletaceae. It occurs in forests throughout Eurasia, North America and Australia and forms a mycorrhizal relationship with a wide range of hardwood and conifer trees.
Taxonomy.
"Xerocomus subtomentosus" was first described in 1753 by the father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus as "Boletus subtomentosus". The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant that the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Linnaeus' work preceded this date. It was thus written "Boletus subtomentosus" L.:Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the "Species Plantarum". Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. 
French mycologist Lucien Quélet had classified a number of "Boletus" species in the genus "Xerocomus", with "Xerocomus subtomentosus" made the type species. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek "Xeros" "dry" and "kome" "hair", and refers to the velvety surface of the cap. This classification was disputed with many authorities not recognising the genus, however genetic analysis published in 2013 confirms the distinctness of this species and its close relatives from "Boletus" sensu stricto. "Xerocomus subtomentosus" and relatives, including "Phylloporus pelletieri" form a clade known informally as the "xerocomus" clade within a larger group (informally called hypoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the "Aureoboletus" and "Hemileccinum" clades, as well as species currently designated "Boletus" (though they are not closely related to "Boletus edulis") and three species currently designated "Boletellus" (though they are unlikely to be close relatives of the type species, "Boletellus ananas"). The clade containing the hypoboletus group and the "Royoungia" clade is sister to the anaxoboletus group (containing the genera "Tylopilus" sensu stricto, "Strobilomyces", "Xanthoconium", "Porphyrellus", "Xerocomellus", "Boletus" sensu stricto, and species that require new generic names (e.g., "Boletus badius") and the leccinoid group (comprising the genera "Leccinellum", "Leccinum", "Spongiforma", and the species "Retiboletus griseus"). 
Its specific name "subtomentosus" is Latin "finely haired", referring to its cap. Mushroom author David Arora nicknamed the mushroom the "boring brown bolete" from its lack of taste and appeal. Other vernacular names include "yellow-cracked bolete", "suede bolete", and "brown and yellow bolete".
Description.
The pale olive or tan cap is initially convex before flattening, and measures or sometimes up to in diameter with a velvety tan surface. Occasionally the cap slits revealing yellow flesh beneath. The skin of the cap is very hard to remove. The pores underneath the cap are yellow, and bruise blue or green before fading somewhat. The stipe lacks a ring and is up to tall by wide. The spore print is olive-brown. A drop of ammonium hydroxide on the cap instantly produces a mahogany red reaction, which distinguishes it from some other similar species of the genus. The flesh is white and has little taste or smell.
Similar species.
The rare European species "Xerocomus silwoodensis", described as new to science in 2007, is similar in appearance to "X. subtomentosus". It can be distinguished from the latter in the field by the darker reddish-brown tones of the cap and its preference for associating with "Populus" trees.
Distribution and habitat.
"Xerocomus subtomentosus" occurs in autumn in forests throughout Eurasia, North America and Australia and forming a mycorrhizal relationship with a wide range of hardwood and conifer trees. It is associated with bilberry and other evergreen shrubs of the Ericaceae.
Edibility.
"Xerocomus subtomentosus" is edible, although not highly regarded. Its mild taste makes it suitable for mixed mushroom dishes. An elemental analysis of specimens collected from Notec Forest in western Poland determined the mushrooms to have abundant amounts of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, with mean values of 46000, 8400, and 1100 milligramme/kilogramme dry weight, respectively, in the caps. The levels of the toxic metals cadmium, mercury, and lead in the mushrooms "did not pose a threat to a consumer's health".

Gulf Coast Civic Works Act

The Gulf Coast Civic Works Bill was a bill introduced in the US Congress in 2007 as HR 4048, intended to establish a regional authority to fund resident-led recovery projects. It died in committee and was reintroduced in edited form in 2009, again dying in committee.
The bill was advocated by a non-partisan partnership of community, faith, student, labor and human rights organizations, known as the Gulf Coast Civic Works Campaign or Project. This partnership started from the ideas of San Jose State University (SJSU) students Rochelle Smarr and Victor Ly to garner national support for rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina.
Purposes.
HR 4048 was to create 100,000 good jobs and training opportunities for local and displaced workers to rebuild infrastructure and restore the environment. The Bill empowers residents to realize their right to return with dignity and safety, revitalizes the local workforce, and helps create more sustainable communities.
If passed, it would do the following:
Rebuilds Vital Public Infrastructure and Restores the Environment
Creates Jobs and Provides Job Training
Takes Action to Jumpstart Recovery
Spurs Sustainable Community Development
Requires Accountability
History in U.S. Congress.
The "Gulf Coast Civic Works Act" was originally introduced in 2007 to the 110th session of the United States Congress as H.R. 4048 by California Representative Zoe Lofgren. H.R. 4048 called for the establishment of a Gulf Coast Authority to administer the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions on . As the Bill was not passed within the 110th session of Congress, it was "cleared from the books." 
On , the "Gulf Coast Civic Works Act" was re-introduced to 111th session of Congress as HR 2269. California Representative Zoe Lofgren is again listed as the main Bill sponsor. H.R. 2269 is an edited version of H.R. 4048 that proposes the establishment of a Gulf Coast Civic Works Commission within the Department of Homeland Security as well as an Office of Federal Coordinator of Gulf Coast Rebuilding to regulate the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project. On the Bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.
Public Supporters.
Public officials from multiple U.S. states supported the project and act:
"I was delighted to hear about Louisiana Winter. I want to thank you all for your efforts to get the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project passed. I am pleased to hear about the strong response from university students signing up to support Louisiana Winter."
-- Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, Louisiana
"My father-in-law, Sargent Shriver, always told me that serving others was the most gratifying thing anyone can do. During this week, each of you will come to realize the truthfulness of his wisdom. I commend your involvement in this project and your desire to better the lives of your fellow Americans. You are living proof that our country’s future rests in very capable and very
charitable hands."
-- Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, California
"The areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina must be a priority for all Americans—in Congress and throughout the United States. It is our moral obligation to acknowledge that there have always been two America’s here in the United States; and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita lifted the curtain on the connection of race and poverty... I am personally vested in eradicating the poverty across this country-particularly in the Gulf Coast and support increasing funding and job opportunities for our brothers and sisters trying to rebuild their lives."
-- Congresswoman Barbara Lee, California
"Today's call to action serves as a critical resurgence of attention, compassion, and resources directed toward the residents and displaced of the Gulf Coast. The Louisiana Winter student volunteers will bring a sense of hope and new energy to the rebuilding efforts. There is so much that remains to be done in housing, employment, health care, and education. Only a national effort, fueled by the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project and the employment of tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents, can bring about the healing and reconstruction of these vital communities. I am very proud of our San Jose State students who will be participating in Louisiana Winter week."
-- Assemblywoman Sally Lieber, Speaker pro Tempore, California State Assembly
"Mississippians believe that we have worked diligently to put our lives and homes back together following Hurricane Katrina. The volunteers all agree. Now we have the opportunity to prove that on a national scale. The Gulf Coast Civic Works Project can help us remind others that there is still much work to be done and make our area whole again and that we still need the support and volunteerism of others."
-- Brian Carriere, Gulfport City Council President
"The Gulf Coast Civic Works Project presents a common sense solution that's as bold and broad as the problem it's trying to solve. In addition to being more efficient than the approaches for rebuilding currently being considered, it represents an investment in the people of the Gulf--not large corporations--and most importantly, it gives survivors the power to rebuild their homes and their lives. ColorOfChange.org is proud to be a supporter of the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project." 
-- James Rucker, Director of Color Of Change

The Circus Starring Britney Spears

The Circus Starring Britney Spears was the seventh concert tour by American singer Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, "Circus" (2008). Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after Spears released her fifth studio album "Blackout"; however, it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers Dean and Dan Caten created the costumes. A giant cylinder screen was set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums "In the Zone", "Blackout" and "Circus". Spears announced she would tour Australia for the first time in June 2009.
The Circus Starring Britney Spears was described as a "pop extravaganza". It was divided into five segments. "The Circus" featured a metamorphosis of
Spears from as a ringmaster to a slave, while being surrounded by different performers. "House of Fun (Anything Goes)" displayed a series of upbeat numbers with different themes, including magic and military. It ended with a Bollywood-inspired performance and a ballad in which Spears performed while floating on a giant umbrella. "Freakshow/Peepshow" featured a video interlude set to heavy metal music, and continued with dark and sexual performances. "Electro Circ" displayed energetic dance routines, and the encore consisted of a video montage of Spears's music videos and a police-themed performance. Some changes were made to the show throughout the tour. Several songs were remixed; Spears also performed "Mannequin" in selected European shows and covers of Duffy and Alanis Morissette in some North American dates.
The Circus Starring Britney Spears generated positive to mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed it as an entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8 million. A great number of tickets were sold within a week of the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans had walked out during the performances which was later proven to be false. 
Background.
On September 9, 2007, Spears performed "Gimme More", the lead single from her fifth studio album "Blackout" (2007) at the MTV Video Music Awards. Her last live performance had been during The M+M's Tour in May of the same year. Her singing, her dancing and even her wardrobe were all commented on extensively, and it was considered hurtful for her career. In October 2007, it was reported that Spears was planning to go on tour to promote the album and was holding open dance auditions, but this was later denied by Jive Records. In February 2008, similar reports surfaced that Spears had already rehearsed in private for a month at Millennium Dance Complex in Los Angeles, California, and would be leaving to Europe during the following weeks for a worldwide tour. However, it was finally cancelled due to unknown reasons. In September 2008, after New York City radio station Z100 premiered her single from "Circus", "Womanizer", Spears made a surprise appearance on the show and announced she would be going on a worldwide tour during 2009 to support her sixth studio album, "Circus" (2008). The concert promoter was AEG Live. Former director of the tour, Australian choreographer Wade Robson, said that the tour would visit the United States, the United Kingdom, and would also reach Australia.
After her live performances on "Good Morning America" on December 2, 2008, Spears officially announced a first leg of twenty-five dates in the US and two dates in the UK, with the tour launching on March 3, 2009, in New Orleans. The Pussycat Dolls were selected in October 2008 as the opening act of the first North American leg. Spears's manager Larry Rudolph claimed that the show would "blow people's minds and promises to show Britney's fans something they will never forget." He later added, "she goes full–speed the whole show — about an hour and a half. It's pretty intense. This is a full–blown, full–out Britney Spears show. It is a pop extravaganza. It is everything everybody expects from her — and more!" On April 28, 2009, eight European dates were added. The following day, four more dates were announced in Russia, Poland and Germany. On June 9, 2009, Spears announced that she would tour Australia for the first time in November. Six dates were initially announced. Spears stated, "I've wanted to tour Australia for quite some time and now it's finally happening. My Circus tour is the best show I have ever created and I can't wait to perform it for all of my Australian fans. See you guys soon!"
The following day, it was announced on her official website that she would return to North America for a second leg, visiting twenty cities. The Circus Starring Britney Spears was also rumored to reach South America, however, Spears's manager Adam Leber denied this despite their efforts to do so.
Development.
In October 2008, Spears hired Wade Robson, who had previously worked as director for her Dream Within a Dream Tour, to direct the tour; he announced that rehearsals would start in January. His wife, Amanda Robson, was also hired as co-creative director. Andre Fuentes was chosen as the lead choreographer. However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by Visual Light, conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10 million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers. There is also an astounding 3D preview of the stage and video screens in the software so you can control or re-program the show without being inside the arena bowl".
The sound was provided by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, "and Solotech were asked to come up with a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [Spears expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.
Spears explained that since she did not tour to promote "Blackout", she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from "Circus", six songs from "Blackout" and five songs from "In the Zone" (2003); other parts of the setlist consist of a medley of "Breathe on Me" and "Touch of My Hand", both from "In the Zone"; and a remix of "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). "Everytime" was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance — and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like clowns, jugglers and trapeze artists in a more provocative way. They commented that,
"We are enormous fans of Britney, and have been waiting for the perfect moment to collaborate with her. It's going to be wild. We wanted to create something much more provoking and indecent ... something animalistic and primal. We are confident that this tour partnership, an autobiographical tribute for one who has always been in the spotlight: scrutinized, watched, imitated, photographed, criticized and loved, will be an enormous success".
The costumes of the first segment were selected to show a metamorphosis. The cheetah headdress represented an animal. The jacket and whip represented both a ringmaster and a lion tamer. She took the headdress off at the end of the first song to reveal a Swarovski-crystal corset, fishnets, and boots and entered the cage to represent a slave. The wardrobe for the song "Mannequin" included black jeans from True Religion and a yellow tank top with rhinestones designed by Spears herself. Spears's outfits had a duplicate set in case of any problem and were numbered in sequence. The total number of costumes was approximately 350, kept in order by six full–time women. The wardrobe was also revealed to have $150,000 worth of Swaroski crystals.
Concert synopsis.
The show was mainly divided into four acts with different themes: "The Circus", "House of Fun (Anything Goes)", "Freakshow-Peepshow", "Electro Circ" and ended with the encore. It began with "Welcome to the Circus", a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I. In the middle of the video, the cylinder screen started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears descended from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing the headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. She started with a performance of "Circus", which featured acrobats taking the stage and spinned on giant rings in the air. The song ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal the Swaroski-crystal corset and running into the center of the main stage, as she was surrounded by jets of smoke. She entered a golden cage, where she performed "Piece of Me", dancing and attempting to escape from her dancers. A brief interlude followed, featuring a performance by acrobats twirling from suspended fabric, simulating a thunderstorm. before Spears went into "Radar" which featured her pole dancing on each of the stage's rings. The first intermezzo showcased her dancers doing a martial arts inspired dance to the LAZRtag remix of "Gimme More". In the next section, Ed Alonzo took the stage and Spears played her assistant in "Ooh Ooh Baby" entering a box and being sawed in half. After she came out, she entered another box in the middle of the stage and the performance ended with Alonzo dropping the curtains and showing that Spears had escaped from it, while the top of the box exploded in a shower of sparks. At the same time, Spears reappeared with four female dancers in one of the satellite stages, dancing to "Hot as Ice". The next song was the Co-Ed Remix of "Boys", which Spears performed wearing a military costume, while surrounded by her dancers, some of them riding bicycles. At the end of the song she performed a military drill with her male dancers before moving into "If U Seek Amy", which featured her pushing them with a giant pink mallet, in a similar way to Whac-a-Mole. After a brief interlude, she returned to continue the act with a Bollywood-inspired remix of "Me Against the Music". She briefly talked with the audience before she sat on a giant umbrella and was lifted into the air to perform "Everytime".
The show continued with a video interlude featuring Marilyn Manson's cover of "Sweet Dreams", showing Spears in a classically decadent party-setting, in which everyone except her was wearing masks. A distorted voice welcomed spectators to the third act and Spears appeared onstage to perform "Freakshow" and "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)". A video spoofing late-night chat lines featuring "Britney's Hotline" played, while clowns took a person from the audience and goofed around with them. Spears returned to perform "Breathe on Me", dancing on a giant picture frame, and "Touch of My Hand", in which she sported a blindfold while being lifted on the air sitting in the backs of two aerialists. In the fourth section, there was a band interlude, and Spears appeared on stage to perform "Do Somethin'", with a gun that shot sparks in her hand. This was followed by a remix of "I'm a Slave 4 U", in which she was raised on a platform as a ring of fire started below her. In the "Heartbeat" interlude, the dancers showcased their individual moves. Spears performed "Toxic" with moving jungle gyms and surrounded by green sci-fi lightning effects. The act ended with Spears and her dancers performing a remix of "...Baby One More Time". After a brief pause, the encore began with the "Break the Ice" video interlude, which included various clips of Spears's music videos. Spears returned for a performance of "Womanizer" dressed as a policewoman. Spears and the dancers bowed to each side of the arena and left with "Circus" playing in the background. Some changes were made to the setlist throughout the tour. During opening night in New Orleans, Spears was supposed to perform a cover of Duffy's "I'm Scared" after "Everytime". However, the lyric sheet went missing onstage and she started performing from below the stage, leaving two backup singers in the main stage. It was later dropped from the show. "Mannequin" was added on the second Paris date and performed after "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", with a brief lightshow introduction. The song was performed until July 26, 2009. A cover of "You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette was performed on select shows during the second North American leg, starting on September 5, 2009. In addition, "Piece of Me", "Radar", "Ooh Ooh Baby", "Do Somethin'", "I'm a Slave 4 U", "...Baby One More Time" and "Womanizer" were remixed at the beginning of the European leg.
Critical reception.
After Spears's premiere performance, the tour received mixed to positive reviews from several critics. Stacey Plaisance of the Associated Press commented that the tour was
"another strong step in the right direction" and that Spears delivered a "a tightly choreographed, if perfunctory performance". Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" stated, "despite that first-night stumble and several numbers in which her dancing was no more than adequate, Spears can safely call this performance a success". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" said that "show was less a concert than a Las Vegas-style revue of intimidating complexity. Throughout, though she spoke little, Ms. Spears appeared radiant and unfettered, often smiling and never uncommitted". Dixie Reid of "The Sacramento Bee" commented that the show was "a mesmerizingly big production with entertaining videos (including the infamous Spears-Madonna kiss), confetti, sparklers and even a stilt-walker. Who could ask for more? Everyone seemed to have a good time at the circus". Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" said Spears is "the queen of production line pop and reclaims that diamanté crown with the most perfectly plastic pop show ever staged".
"People" writer Chuck Arnold wrote that Spears "never really hit her old stride [..] there was a lot more strutting than real choreographic feats from name=people/> Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [... It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of "Toronto Sun" gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was "so much was going on – there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc. – there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [..] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". "The Hollywood Reporter"'s Craig Rosen claimed that "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of "St. Petersburg Times" summed up all the reviews by stating, "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [..] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".
Commercial response.
A week after The Circus Britney Spears was announced, 400,000 tickets were purchased for the North American shows, which prompted promoters to add seven more dates in Los Angeles, Toronto, New Jersey, Chicago, Long Island, Anaheim and Montreal. Due to demand in the UK, six more shows were added to the initial two, selling more than 100,000 tickets in a week. Spears performance at the American Airlines Arena broke the attendance record previously held by Celine Dion, with a crowd of 18,644 people. The first North American leg, which was sold out, resulted in an average of 20,498 tickets per show and a gross of $61.6 million, becoming the highest grossing tour of the first semester of 2009 in the continent. In addition, the tour grossed $13 million from the London, Manchester and Dublin shows, with a total gross of $74.6 million, ranking as the third highest grossing tour worldwide. The Copenhagen show at Parken gathered 40,000 people, Spears's largest audience since her 2002 concerts in Mexico City.
The second North American leg was also sold out, with a gross of $21.4 million and it was reported that the tour had grossed $94 million. Her first three shows in Melbourne were also sold out. The four shows at Acer Arena in Sydney sold 66,247 tickets, making Spears the highest selling act ever in the arena. The tour was ranked at number seven on "Billboard"'s Top 25 Tours of 2009, with a previously reported gross of $94 million. However, only 70 of the 97 shows were counted. The Circus Starring Britney Spears also made Spears rank at number twenty one on the Top Touring Artists of the Decade, becoming the youngest artist in the list and also the fourth female artist, behind Madonna, Celine Dion and Cher. The tour was also ranked as the fourth highest grossing tour of the year in North America, becoming the highest grossing tour of the year by a solo artist. In February 2010, Pollstar released their Top 50 Worldwide Concert Tours of 2009. The tour ranked as the fifth highest-grossing tour, worldwide, of the year, with a gross of $131.8 million. In May 2010, "Hollyscoop" ranked the tour at the fifth position in their 15 Most Profitable Female Tours Ever list.
Australian leg controversies.
Before the first of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was considering to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, "Let's be clear – live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, "The Advertiser" writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently "disappointed" and "outraged" regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing. Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying,
"It's the biggest lie I've ever heard. I'm so angry. We can take heat if there's something wrong and people can review shows badly – that's something you have to live with – but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, to be part of the Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".
Spears's manager Adam Leber responded in his Twitter account, saying, "It's unfortunate that one journalist in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted a list of positive reviews from a number of fans. Burswood Dome also issued a statament reading, "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert". Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, "I hear there is a lot of controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".
Broadcast and recordings.
During the tour there were many speculations that the shows in Las Vegas on September 26, 27, 2009 would be recorded in 3D. Professional footage also surfaced online of the Copenhagen show. On November 12, 2009 Britney's manager, Adam Leber, posted on his Twitter account that there were "...No plans for a Circus Tour DVD at the moment." On June 26, 2012 rumours arose on celebrity blogger Perez Hilton's website stating that there was a DVD to be released after what appeared to be a trailer of unseen concert footage surfaced online. Despite this, no official DVD or recording has been released of the concert tour.

Arcades (Milton)

"Arcades" is a masque written by John Milton and performed on 4 May 1634. The piece was written to celebrate the character of Alice Spencer, the Countess Dowager of Darby, widow of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, during her 75th birthday. The masque distinguishes Spencer as having a greater far superior to other noble women by titling Spencer as queen of a metaphorical Arcadia that is far superior than any other realm. The piece served as a basis for Milton's later masque, "Comus". 
Background.
Spencer's family invited Milton to write a masque for a celebration to honour her on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634. This arrangement was made possible through the intervention of Henry Lawes, the Earl's music tutor for his children, and friend to Milton's father. Milton wrote "Arcades" and the piece was performed at the Harefield estate. This masque established many themes and ideas later developed in his other masque, "Comus".
Masque.
The masque begins by praising the countess and describes her in royal terms during the first song:
Genius continues this idea and emphasizes that she was:
According to Genius, sirens, similar to the muses, create a music that fills the senses:
Genius describes how he, unlike mortals, is able to hear the song of the sirens and the song compelled him to an innocent rapture along with the Fates who are also seduced by the siren song:
Her magnificence is further distinguished from any others during the second song:
This is compounded by the third song declaring that other queens are below her status and concluding the masque:
Themes.
"Arcades" sought to draw upon pastoral elements and mocked the pastoral Caroline traditions of Henrietta Maria of France. Instead of following traditional themes inherent in the genre that welcome guests, the guest characters in the masque seek to praise the Countess who is guided by the spirit Genius. Genius is not a unique figure in Miltonic poetry and he is similar to a demon or Thyrsis in "Comus" because he relies on divine music for an earthly purpose. 
The masque portrays a powerful female character at the centre of the plot. Although he does not say that she is part of the surrounding social context, especially one that could be seen in a negative light, she does have direct connections to classical female divinities, such as Cybele and Latona, who have established divine families. The female figure is not only a mother of her family; she is also mother of a greater version of Arcady. In her position, the people and spirits of the land honour her for her greatness.

Latif Karimov

Latif Huseyn oglu Karimov () (17 November 1906, Shusha – 1991, Baku) was an Azerbaijani carpet designer known for his contributions to a variety of artistic fields.
Early life.
Latif Karimov was born in Shusha (then part of Russian Empire, now in Azerbaijan). His father Mashadi Huseyn was a hatter and his mother Telli was a carpet-weaver. In 1910, the family moved to Mashhad, Iran, and settled in the Karabakhi quarter of the city. After graduating from the local madrasah at age 14, Latif Karimov started working at a carpet shop and learning the art of carpet weaving following his mother's footsteps. He travelled extensively throughout Iran excelling in this craft. Alongside, Karimov had a variety of interests ranging from boxing to literature and performing arts. The Soviet Consulate in Tehran invited him to become a member of the Russian cultural club, where he later directed and acted in plays by Uzeyir Hajibeyov and established an Azeri choir.
Beginning in the late 1920s, Karimov participated in social movements demanding on behalf of weavers of Mashhad an eight-hour working day and improvement of working conditions. In 1929 he was sent on an official mission to Afghanistan to promote theatrical arts. However Karimov returned to Iran two months later not being able to endure the harsh living conditions of Afghanistan. On that year he obtained Soviet citizenship, and the government of Iran, suspicious of his social involvement, offered him an option of moving to the Soviet Union, which Karimov accepted.
Soviet period.
Latif Karimov settled in his native Shusha and married Shovkat, a young local carpet-weaver. He was appointed import instructor to a carpet factory. In addition, he founded and conducted courses in carpet weaving introducing Iranian techniques that were not known to the Karabakh weavers. For students who were illiterate and could not take notes, he composed "goshmas" (Azeri poetic genre) to get them to remember weaving procedures. He later set up similar courses in Quba and Baku.
In addition to carpets, Karimov successfully designed jewellery, wood carvings, china and fabric patterns, and decorated the interior of buildings. In 1937, he was hired to design the Azeri hall of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition together with Rustam Mustafayev. In the 1940s while he was decorating the interior of the Nizami Museum, the Great Patriotic War broke out, and Karimov was hired as to the Azerbaijan State Radio as an Iranian news edition broadcaster.
In 1945 he was appointed head of the Department of Fine Arts at the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan Institute of the Arts. Between 1947 and 1977 he compiled the Dictionary of Oriental Music. In 1950 he received the Stalin Prize, the highest ranking award in the Soviet Union. In 1954 he organised his first personal exhibition which featured carpets, architectural ornaments, wood carvings, china vases, jewellery, graphic items, etc. Between 1961 and 1983 he published a three-volume book on the history, development and structure of over 1300 Azeri carpet pattern elements. His efforts and enthusiasm led to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum in 1967, first one of this kind in the world.
The Azerbaijan Carpet Museum was named in his honour in 1991.

Suillus variegatus

Suillus variegatus, commonly called the velvet bolete or variegated bolete, is a species of edible mushroom in the genus "Suillus". Like all bolete-like species it has tubes, and pores, instead of gills under its cap. The mushroom forms a mycorrhizal relationship with pine and occurs in North America and Eurasia.
Description.
The cap is 6 – 13 cm in diameter. It is rusty to tawny, or ochraceous, and has a velvety or downy feel when young. As it matures the surface becomes smoother, even greasy, and tacky in wet periods. The stem is ochre, more yellow towards the top, and may be flushed with rust at the base. It is sometimes slightly bulbous. The flesh is pale lemon, and may turn very slightly blue on cutting. The pores are ochre, becoming more cinnamon later, and the spore print is walnut brown. Said to smell like an ‘Earth ball’ fungus ("Scleroderma").
Distribution and habitat.
"S. variegatus" appears frequently with, and is mycorrhizal with two needle pine trees in late summer. It is often found with heathers, and other acid loving plants, on sandy soils. It is widespread in Europe, nearer parts of Asia, and North America.
Edibility.
"Suillus variegatus" is edible, but is said to smell unpleasant, with a somewhat metallic taste.

Lars Petter Nordhaug (born 14 May 1984) is a Norwegian professional road bicycle racer for UCI ProTour team .
Career.
Early career.
Nordhaug started his career as a mountain biker, but after finishing 5th in the 2004 Norwegian National Road Racing Championship, his focus changed towards road bicycle racing. His breakthrough came two years later, in 2006, when he won the National Road Racing Championship. This year was his breakout year, also winning Birkebeinerrittet, a Norwegian long-distance mountain-bike cycling race.
In August 2009, Nordhaug scored a second overall finish on the Tour of Ireland while riding for UCI Continental team . This race was a three stage event classified as 2.1. His victory in the undulating last stage carried him to that placing, after he got the best of breakaway companion Russell Downing, who won the general classification.
Team Sky: 2010–12.
After a week of rumours, it was announced on 10 September 2009 that Nordhaug would be joining from the 2010 season, along with fellow Norwegians Edvald Boasson Hagen and Kurt Asle Arvesen. Nordhaug spent the 2010 and 2011 seasons working mainly as a domestique, riding the Ardennes classics and the 2011 Giro d'Italia. He signed a new contract with Sky at the end of 2011.
Nordhaug took his first victory for Sky at the 2012 Trofeo Deia, the third race at the Challenge Mallorca. He shook off the last contenders on the last difficulty of the day, before descending solo and crossing the line in Deia, registering his first victory since 2009. He also rode a good Critérium International event in Corsica, finishing fourth overall behind a strong podium composed of Cadel Evans (), Pierrick Fedrigo () and his teammate Michael Rogers. Nordhaug led Sky at the Tour of the Basque Country, where he came sixth overall. His promising early season form saw him take a prominent role in the team's Ardennes classics squad. Nordhaug was well placed in the closing stages of the Amstel Gold Race but crashed out in the final of the finishing climb, the Cauberg, after clashing wheels with 's Damiano Cunego.
In August, Nordhaug announced that he would leave at the end of the 2012 season, and would join on a two-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. As a result of his decision, Nordhaug was not selected for the Vuelta a España and instead rode the Danmark Rundt, where he won the third stage, to take the overall lead in the race. He took his biggest career victory to date at the 2012 Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, winning a sprint from a group of four riders after his solo attack was caught in the closing stages of the race.

No.1 Senior High School of Ürümqi

The No.1 Senior High School of Ürümqi (, ), literally Ürümqi No.1 High School, colloquially abbreviated as "乌鲁木齐一中" or "乌市一中", sometimes called No.1 Middle School of Urumqi, is a prestigious public high school in Ürümqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, under the jurisdiction of the Urumqi Municipal Education Bureau. Founded in 1891 during the Qing Dynasty, it is the oldest school in Xinjiang.
Located in the downtown Bei Men (北门) at Jiankang Road (健康路) and North Jiefang Road (解放北路) in Tianshan District, Urumqi, the school is the accredited top-ranking high school in Urumqi city and in Xinjiang, and is considered a typical instance of local secondary education. All of the courses are in Chinese. The students are predominantly Han Chinese, with other ethnic groups including Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongol, etc.
History.
The institutional predecessor, known as Bo Da Academy of Sinkiang ()(lit. "Sinkiang Academy of Erudition"), of the high school was founded on August 14, 1891 by the then Qing Dynasty, when it was 20 years before the establishment of the Republic of China.
In the early ROC period, many well-educated Chinese intellectuals and political figures, converged on the school to pursue their studies in Xinjiang. The former school president Yu Xiusong () (in office in 1936), came around and taught in the school as the then leader of the CPC Shanghai Leading Group and one of the founding members of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC). In 1938, Li Yunyang (), one of the CPC members dispatched by the Central Politburo, became president of the school. Other major figures, such as the revolutionary martyr Lin Jilu, along with Shen Yanbing (writer), Zhao Dan (artist), have lectured in the school. These people who had intensive revolutionary backgrounds affected the students deeply in their minds, bringing in Marxist ideology. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, some of them also contrived to enlighten the students and the young generation and propagandized ideological guidance in an effort to help the country. Their efforts contributed to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and created a hopeful atmosphere among the youths. 
By 1953, the State Education Commission labelled the school as the sole key middle school in Xinjiang. However, the Cultural Revolution inflicted heavy losses upon it; almost all stored books in its library totaling approximately 40,000 were rifled during that time. With the resumption of the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE, or CEE) in the late 1970s right after the Cultural Revolution, the school had been achieving progressive success in CEE results of the students. In 1982, it was labelled once more in the first list of the country's best-run key schools. Since 1995, the school has permanently ranked at the top places by CEE evaluation. Through the public assessment, it was chosen as a city-level unit of spiritual civilization in the year 1995, and sequentially as the autonomous region-level one in the end of the same year. Over the nearest past four years, the school's rate of matriculation (ROM) to college reached over 99% steadily. The high school consolidated its top rank in Xinjiang high schools exposed by the CEE result.
In 2004, a civil North School of the No.1 Senior High School of Urumqi (乌鲁木齐市第一中学北校) was founded by the school authorities and their collaborative company known as Xinjiang Jun Fa Industrial & Investment Co. Ltd (新疆俊发实业投资有限责任公司).
Facilities.
The school is currently composed of the Teaching Building (Yifu Building) (逸夫教学楼), Gymnastics-Art Integrated Building (体育艺术综合楼) and the Science Building (科学馆). General programming construction was completed in 2002, and at the same time the school systematically revamped the teaching equipment, experimental apparatus and basic facilities. The GA Integrated Building was built in 2005. It has 34 so-called Special Classrooms, including Telecasting Room, Learning Room, Room of Celestial Phenomena and Computer Rooms. School buildings also contain auditoriums, a studio and Chamber for Academic Report (学术报告厅) used for conferences. In addition, there is a plastic field underground and overground (for basketball and track and field), a basketball gymnasium and rooms for fine arts and music education. 
The school administration had been highly concerned about the audiovisual means conducive to multimedia education. In 2007, the school leadership invited tenders. Eventually, it chose Anliang Technology Co., Ltd (安良科技公司) for the operation of the multimedia installment around every corner in the school. All the classrooms were fit with computer systems and projectors. The computers are embedded in the platform desks and are linked to the entire school's networks. Bidirectional closed-circuit television (CCTV) system is available. As every classroom is accessible to Internet, it has proved to be very convenient when such demand exists during some classes. The school has operated its own campus website since 2005, on which it can release campus news and issue circulars to the public.
The Science Building (sometimes referred to as the Experiment Building), built in 1989, is the oldest existing building still in use at present. It contains the school library, laboratories, the biological specimen room and computer rooms. From July to August 2007, the Science Building was extensively renovated, with a budget of 1,760,000 yuan. With a variety of experimental instruments in the Science Building, the school is capable of fulfilling all required experimental curricula in physics, chemistry and biology. It has procured many latest and advanced instruments, such as new-styled microscopes, EMD timers, and multitesters.
Library.
The school library is set in the Science Building and has over 90,000 books in store, offering thousands of magazines and newspapers in nearly 520 kinds. The former school library was the oldest high school library in Xinjiang. According to the school chronicles, the library had 5,641 books in 1931, making one of the most famous in the province (Xinjiang was formerly a province during ROC period). In 1966, the number of stored books turned 40,000; however, the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) made an end to it, all its stored books having been looted.
In the late 1970s, the library was reestablished and underwent massive development during the 1980s. The present school library was built in 1989. The library currently occupies 802.12 m2 in area, with 195 seats in the reading room, available for 2 classes at the same time. It provides Senior 3 students with a room for individual study (RIS)(自习室). Three librarians are in charge of the library.
General Library Integrated System (GLIS) was adopted and put into service in September 2004. The library opens to all students during school time, and periodically, different classes commence their reading lessons in the library's reading room. Every student in the school has been given a bar-coded card for borrowing books, able to be recognized by computer. The school authorities spent 80,000 yuan annually for the library on the purchase of approximately 2,000 books, 60 kinds of newspapers and copies of magazines in 500 kinds.
Daily maintenance.
In order to lighten the burden on students in daily maintenance and to enhance security of the whole campus, the school employed a group of cleaners as well as security guards from Xinjiang Baihuacun Estate Management Company Limited (新疆百花村物业有限公司) in 2004, making it one of the few schools with such high level of criteria. The act is believed to reduce the labor intensity of students, whose de facto sanitary work is thus limited within the classrooms. School cleaners are responsible for the whole school except internal classrooms (public classrooms and auditoria excluded).
School administration.
The administrative group (行政组) of the No.1 Senior High School of Urumqi is divided into General Office (办公室), Pedagogy Office (教学处), Teaching and Research Office (教研处), Student Office (学生处), General Affairs Office (总务处) and Financial Office (财务室). Each office is normally in the charge of a director (主任) and a vice-director (副主任). The offices are mainly located in the Teaching Building and the Gymnastics-Art Integrated Building.

Teachers and staff.
The No.1 Senior High School, with a group of high-qualified teachers, performs eminently in teaching and schooling to cultivate all-around students. The school has 8 (de facto 4 at present) special-class teachers (特级教师) and 77 high-class teachers (高级教师). Many of them give lessons and coach students in curricula for the College Entrance Exams (CEE) and for the national academic contests. The school has already raised the standard of employment, employing personnel with master's degrees or higher qualifications. English teachers are routinely sent abroad to attend further studies.
Averagely 20 theses by the school teachers are issued on the national publications, and their authors regularly win prizes every year. In addition, it is estimated that around 15 incumbent teachers are affiliated to different local academic associations, which are at the city level and the province level (autonomous region level). Some of these teachers undertake association assignments, or permanently assume office in the associations, such as Urumqi Chemistry Society (乌鲁木齐市化学学会), Xinjiang Physics Society (新疆物理学会), and Xinjiang Education Association (新疆教育学会).
Students.
The school mainly enrolls junior middle school graduates of junior high schools in Urumqi, and a few excellent students from the other parts in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The top 120 students who passed its self-standardized difficult science-oriented tests will form two Scientific Strong-point Classes (理科特长班). Other students who are not adept at studies but have conspicuous abilities in athletics, basketball or fine arts can be also admissible if they pass the selective tests.
Statistics indicates that the school ranked 6th in 2006, and 2nd in 2008 on a nationwide ranking list by number of the number-one scholars (#1 scholar or No.1 scholar) () graduates in the College Entrance Examination (CEE) every year. As of 2008, it had totally developed 10 number-one scholar graduates.
In 2007, 31 students of the 2007 graduates of the No.1 Senior High School are set to be exempted from standardized exams (保送), or to be admitted 10 or 20 scores lower than the standard to different universities, 13 among whom passed the assessments conducted by the universities, known as the Independent Recruitment Tests (IRT) (自主招生考试). In 2008, 53 students of the to-be-graduates acquired the same privileges.
Curricula.
The school provides three types of curricula: basic curricula, outreach curricula (electives) and practice curricula, though it is still a constitutionally CEE/contest-centered school similar to most other ordinary and key senior high schools in China. Coaching for contests (竞赛辅导) is commonly carried out in the Scientific Strong-point Classes (SS Classes) (理科特长班), as SS Classes are specially set to major in the academic contests in the first 2 school years.
Electives.

Endowment.
Though a public school, the No.1 Senior High School has received plenty of endowments of mainly educational instruments and others. Sir Run Run Shaw (邵逸夫), a Hong Kong media mogul and philanthropist, donated a building (presently as the main building) in 2001.
It was also endowed with many teaching and experimental instruments, such as desks, chairs, microscopes, vernier calipers, and multitesters from the Official Development Assistance Japan. This was the sequence to the Japan's 3rd Program of Secondary Education Equipment for Minority Areas in the People's Republic of China (第三次少数民族地区中学教育器材装备计划) launched by ODA Japan in 1999; the No.1 Senior High School was one of those to have been endowed, while the equipment was put into service in 2000.

Nimi went away without replying. Sage Vashistha got impression that King Nimi has assented to wait for him.
Sage Vasishtha conducted Lord Indra's Yagya and rushed to preside at King Nimi's Yagya only to find that the Yagya was already being conducted. Sage Vasishtha got angry and cursed King Nimi that "he would cease to live in corporal form". Thus, King Nimi was left without his body. After the Yagya was conducted successfully, the priests asked the Gods to return King Nimi in his corporal form. However, King Nimi declined to go back in his body but requested that he be allowed to live in eyes of all beings. Gods assented to his desire and gave him form of eyelashes, which is present in all beings.
The Sanskrit word for eyelashes is Nimi.

Claude-Ernest Ndalla

Claude-Ernest Ndalla (born 25 May 1937) is a Congolese politician. First coming to prominence as a radical youth leader in 1960s Congo-Brazzaville, he was one of the leading members of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the period immediately following its founding in 1969, but after a few years his career fell into a long decline due to factional struggles within the PCT. Later, he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Youth Redeployment and Sports from 1997 to 1999, and he has been a Special Adviser to President Denis Sassou Nguesso since 2003.
Political career in the 1960s and 1970s.
Ndalla was born in Brazzaville in 1937 and studied mathematics at the University of Toulouse in France. At Toulouse, he was known for his appetite and was nicknamed "Graille", or crow. Back in Congo-Brazzaville, he quickly attained a prominent place in the radicalized political scene of the period that followed the August 1963 ouster of Fulbert Youlou, and he started a magazine, "Dipanda".
In 1964, Ndalla was included on the executive committee of the Youth of the National Movement of the Revolution (JMNR), the radical youth wing of the ruling National Movement of the Revolution (MNR), and he acquired a reputation as a radical leftist and ideologue. On 6 April 1965, President Alphonse Massemba-Débat appointed Ndalla as Secretary of State at the Presidency in charge of Youth and Civic Education. However, Massemba-Débat dismissed Ndalla from that post in December 1965. In light of Ndalla's prominent identification with the JMNR, his dismissal indicated that the JMNR had lost some influence, but Ambroise Noumazalaye—a strong advocate for the JMNR—was appointed as Prime Minister in April 1966.
Ndalla was the Director of Congolese Radio and Television Broadcasting from 1967 to 1969, and he was appointed as Ambassador to the People's Republic of China in 1969; in the latter post, he was also assigned responsibility for relations with North Vietnam and North Korea. He arrived in Beijing on 24 April 1969 and was received by the Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Lin Biao at Tiananmen Square on 1 May 1969. He held a reception in Beijing on 15 August 1969 to mark the sixth anniversary of the revolution; various high-ranking Chinese officials, including Premier Zhou Enlai, attended.
Along with various other prominent politicians, including Massemba-Débat and Pascal Lissouba, Ndalla was put on trial by President Marien Ngouabi in 1969 for involvement in the murder of government officials, but he was acquitted on 21 November 1969. He then spent a few weeks at his diplomatic post in Beijing before returning home.
In December 1969, a new ruling Marxist-Leninist ruling party was created under President Ngouabi: the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). Ndalla was one of the party's founding members; he was included in the PCT's original Political Bureau and was designated as First Secretary in charge of Organization, in which capacity he was responsible for managing internal organizational matters. Ndalla represented the far-left faction of the PCT, and his designation as First Secretary bolstered the far-left while positioning him as "Ngouabi's principal rival", as he was effectively the second-ranking figure in the PCT regime. Despite his clear affinity for China and Maoism, Ndalla led a Congolese delegation that visited the Soviet Union in June 1970.
Student protests and a strike led Ngouabi to sideline the PCT's radical leftist leaders, who were associated with Maoism, in November 1971. Ndalla and another high-ranking radical, Ange Diawara, were among those affected by Ngouabi's move. Diawara then led an unsuccessful left-wing coup attempt against Ngouabi on 22 February 1972. Ndalla and the others who supported a far-left, pro-Chinese political line were known as the 22 February Movement (M-22). Implicated in the plot, Ndalla was tried along with 177 others and sentenced to life in prison on 25 March 1972. President Ngouabi later released him as part of an amnesty, along with others from the M-22, in September 1975. Following his release, Ndalla faced difficulties and it took him some time to find work.
President Ngouabi was assassinated under mysterious circumstances in March 1977. Various prominent political figures suspected of disloyalty were immediately brought before a military tribunal and tried for complicity in the assassination. Massemba-Débat was executed, while Ndalla and Lissouba were among those sentenced to life in prison.
Political career from the 1980s to the 1990s.
Under Denis Sassou Nguesso, the M-22 was partially rehabilitated and regained influence beginning in 1980, to the point that some M-22 figures were considered part of "the backbone" of the PCT regime. By that time, the M-22 was considerably less radical, although still ideologically Marxist. Like the PCT in general, the M-22 was "clearly dominated by northerners", and it was the northern M-22 leaders, rather than southerners like Ndalla, who most clearly benefited from Sassou Nguesso's favor.
Ndalla was arrested prior to a PCT party congress in 1984. At the time, Sassou Nguesso was trying to assert his authority in the PCT leadership against a hard-line, pro-Soviet faction led by François-Xavier Katali, and it was believed that Sassou Nguesso wanted to prevent Ndalla from encouraging other M-22 southerners to support Katali's faction. The arrest of Ndalla was part of a series of successful moves by Sassou Nguesso in 1984, culminating in his victory over the Katali faction at the party congress.
While in detention, Ndalla was recorded on video saying that Jean-Pierre Thystère Tchicaya, a key figure in the PCT regime, had orchestrated bomb attacks that occurred in Brazzaville in 1982. Those bomb attacks killed nine people and wounded 92 others. Sassou Nguesso used Ndalla's claim as evidence when he launched a sudden attack on Thystère Tchicaya at the 1984 congress. Although Ndalla told a party commission sent to investigate the matter that his incriminating statements were untrue and that he had only made them to avoid being tortured, Thystère Tchicaya was removed from the PCT leadership on the basis of Ndalla's claim.
Ndalla was tried before the Revolutionary Court of Justice for his alleged role in the 1982 bomb attacks and was sentenced to death in August 1986. Ndalla had no right to appeal the decision, which was criticized by international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights on the grounds that the trial was unfair and the evidence of guilt was insufficient. The death sentence was never carried out, however, and Sassou Nguesso commuted Ndalla's sentence to life imprisonment with hard labor as a gesture of clemency to mark the 25th anniversary of the 1963 revolution in August 1988.
Two years later, on the 27th anniversary of the revolution, Sassou Nguesso granted Ndalla and other political prisoners an amnesty on 14 August 1990; he was accordingly released from prison on 15 August. By that time, Sassou Nguesso and the PCT regime were struggling to maintain control of the country amidst increasingly vocal demands for democratic reform, and Ndalla wasted no time in returning to the political stage by adding his voice to those calling for reform. As a delegate to the February–June 1991 Sovereign National Conference, Ndalla criticized the record of the PCT regime.
Political career since the 1990s.
Ndalla was associated with opposition leader Bernard Kolélas and his party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), during the 1990s, and he helped to recruit fighters for the Ninja militia loyal to Kolélas. During the June–October 1997 civil war, Ndalla objected to the MCDDI's moves toward an alliance with President Pascal Lissouba and defected to the side of Denis Sassou Nguesso and his rebel Cobra militia.
The civil war ended in victory for the Cobras on 15 October 1997; Lissouba and Kolélas were ousted and Sassou Nguesso regained control of the country. When Sassou Nguesso formed a government on 2 November 1997, he appointed Ndalla as Minister of Youth Redeployment and Sports, in charge of Civic Instruction. He was not included in the next government, appointed on 12 January 1999; subsequently he was appointed as Political Delegate of the Head of State, in which capacity he acted as Sassou Nguesso's representative.
Ndalla strongly backed Sassou Nguesso when the latter stood as a candidate for the March 2002 presidential election. He was present for the launch of the support committee for Sassou Nguesso's candidacy on 6 February 2002, and on that occasion he elaborated his view that Sassou Nguesso was "a symbol of hope, peace and freedom" by symbolically assigning a positive characteristic to each letter of the name "Sassou", in French: "S is for security ("sécurité"), A is for joy ("allégresse"), S is for concern for others ("souci des autres"), S is for the salvage of the property of the people of Mfilou ("sauvetage des biens des gens de Mfilou"), O is for organizer of peace ("organisateur de la paix"), and U is for national unity ("unité nationale")". Ndalla subsequently worked on Sassou Nguesso's campaign as head of the coordination of the support committee for the Mfilou district of Brazzaville.
In his capacity as Political Delegate of the Head of State, Ndalla presided over a meeting of the Youth Committee for Peace in the Pool on 24–28 April 2002. The meeting called on the security forces to show restraint in the Pool Region while also urging Ninja rebels to disarm. He was present at the Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum for a ceremony at which the eternal flame commemorating Ngouabi, which had been extinguished during the 1997 war, was rekindled on 11 November 2002. 
On 30 January 2003, Sassou Nguesso appointed Ndalla as a Special Adviser to the President. Ndalla accompanied Claude-Alphonse Nsilou, the Minister of Urban Affairs, during the latter's campaign for a seat in the June 2007 parliamentary election, calling on the people of Bacongo's second constituency to give Nsilou a majority in the first round of voting. 
Speaking in mid-2007, Ndalla expressed dismay regarding the poor state of Congo-Brazzaville's prison conditions and said that the system needed more money. He also noted that the prisons could cause increased criminalization among inmates, making them more dangerous to society upon release.
On 1 October 2008, Ndalla participated in the founding of the Convention for the Rebirth of Congo (CRC), a pro-Sassou Nguesso political grouping that was created through an agreement signed by five parties, eight associations, and nine individuals. Gabriel Bokilo was designated as President of the CRC, while Ndalla became its First Vice-President. In Bokilo's absence, Ndalla chaired an ordinary session of the CRC National Coordination on 15 November 2008.
At a forum for peace in Congo-Brazzaville, held in Paris in April 2009, Ndalla gave a presentation on "the major political currents in Congo from 1956 to the present day". Drawing on decades of political experience, Ndalla argued in his presentation that democracy had to be developed gradually and consolidated through peace.
In an October 2009 presidential decree, Sassou Nguesso barred top officials from travelling abroad for the remainder of 2009 except in cases of urgency. Speaking to the BBC, Ndalla explained that some officials were taking needless and expensive trips outside the country, sometimes merely for their own pleasure. He said that henceforth travel plans would have to be reviewed and they would be allowed only if they were considered to be worthwhile.
Poetry.
Ndalla began writing poetry when he was 12 years old and published several collections of poetry later in life. A dedication ceremony for his works was held on 9 March 2006 in the presence of various literary and academic features, including the foremost Congolese poet, Jean-Baptiste Tati-Loutard.
Awards and honors.
As a former Minister of Sports, Ndalla was awarded an honorary medal by the Supreme Council of Sport in Africa in December 2007.

Cannabis in the United States

The use, sale and possession of cannabis (marijuana) in the United States is still illegal under federal law. 
However, some states have created exemptions for medical cannabis use, as well as decriminalized non-medical cannabis use. In two states, Colorado and Washington, the sale and possession of marijuana is legal for both medical and non-medical use. Multiple efforts to reschedule cannabis under the Act have failed, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled in "United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative" and "Gonzales v. Raich" that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis. Also, if the cannabis is called "medical cannabis" the federal law still has priority.
History.
Under federal law, it is illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana, since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, claiming it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use. Some states and local governments have established laws attempting to decriminalize cannabis, which has reduced the number of "simple possession" offenders sent to jail, since federal enforcement agents rarely target individuals directly for such relatively minor offenses. Other state and local governments ask law enforcement agencies to limit enforcement of drug laws with respect to cannabis, however under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws. In most cases, the absence of a state law does not present a preemption conflict with a federal law.
In 2002, Nevada voters defeated a ballot question which would legalize up to 3 ounces (85 g) for adults 21 and older, 39% for and 61% against. In 2006, a similar Nevada ballot initiative, which would have legalized and regulated the cultivation, distribution, and possession of up to 1 ounce (28 g) of marijuana by adults 21 and older, was defeated 44% for and 56% against. In 2006, South Dakota voters defeated Measure 4, voting 48% for and 52% against. Measure 4 was to allow the use of medical marijuana by patients deemed by their physicians to benefit from its use, and was to be regulated by state-issued ID cards and protection of legitimate medical distributors.
In July 2009, Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, clarified the federal government's position when he stated that "marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit" and that "legalization is not in the president's vocabulary, and it's not in mine." However, a January 2010 settlement between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) provides an example confirming the administration policy as communicated by Attorney General Holder, as WAMM reached an agreement to re-open after being shut down by the federal government in 2002.
On November 6, 2012, voters in Colorado and Washington approved measures that legalize non-medical use of cannabis—the first states in the nation to do so.
After the election in 2012, the Office of National Drug Control Policy of the Obama administration stated that it "steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs because legalization would increase the availability and use of illicit drugs, and pose significant health and safety risks". In February 2014, the administration issued guidelines to banks for conducting transactions with legal marijuana sellers so these new businesses can stash away savings, make payroll, and pay taxes like any other enterprise.
According to a 2013 survey by Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans are in favor of complete or partial legalization of cannabis. The survey showed 52% of respondents support cannabis legalization and 45% do not. College graduates' support increased from 39% to 52% in just three years, the support of self-identified conservative republicans (a group not traditionally supportive of cannabis legalization) has increased to nearly 30%, and bipartisan support has increased across the board. Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.R.1523 "Respect State Marijuana Laws" on April 12, 2013 with 11 cosponsors of both major political parties.
The National Center for Natural Products Research in Oxford, Mississippi is the only facility in the United States that is federally licensed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to cultivate cannabis for scientific research. The Center is part of the School of Pharmacy at the University of Mississippi.
Usage.
Roger Roffman, a professor of social work at the University of Washington, asserted in July 2009 that "approximately 3.6 million Americans are daily or near daily users." Peter Reuter, a professor at the School of Public Policy and the Department of Criminology at the University of Maryland, College Park, said that "experimenting with marijuana has long been a normal part of growing up in the U.S.; about half of the population born since 1960 has tried the drug by age 21." A World Health Organization survey found that the United States is the world’s leading per capita marijuana consumer. The 2007 National Survey on Drug Use & Health prepared by the U.S. Department of Human Health and Services indicated that 14.4 million U.S. citizens over the age of 12 had used marijuana within a month. The 2008 survey found that 35 million Americans were willing to tell government representatives that they had used marijuana in the past year.
According to the 2001 "National Survey on Drug Use and Health" by SAMHSA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 41.9% (just over 2 out of every 5) of all Americans 12 or older have used cannabis at some point in their lives, while 11.5% (about 1 in 9) reported using it "this year."
In 2009, according to a Zogby poll and an ABC News/Washington Post poll, between 46% and 56% of US voters would support legalization
Legality.
Federal.
Under federal law, it is illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana, since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, claiming it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use.
The Federal government has criminalized marijuana under the Interstate Commerce Clause, and the application of these laws to intrastate commerce were addressed squarely by the United States Supreme Court in "Gonzales v. Raich", 352 F. 3d 1222 in 2005.
In January 2009, President Barack Obama's transition team organized a poll to clarify some of the top issues the American public want to have his administration look into, and two of the top ten ideas were to legalize the use of cannabis.
In July 2009, Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, further clarified the federal government's position when he stated that "marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit" and that "legalization is not in the president's vocabulary, and it's not in mine." However, a January 2010 settlement between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) provides an example confirming the administration policy as communicated by Attorney General Holder, as WAMM successfully reached an agreement to re-open after being shut down by the federal government in 2002.
On August 28, 2013, The United States government announced that they would no longer actively pursue marijuana offenses taken place in those states that have legalized the small consumption and possession of marijuana. The Drug Enforcement Agency will only become involved if the offense involve violence or firearms, the proceeds go to gangs and cartels, or when marijuana is distributed to those states where it is illegal.
State.
20 US states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of marijuana, and 14 states have taken steps to decriminalize it to some degree. This movement sought to make simple possession of cannabis punishable by only confiscation or a fine, rather than prison. In the past several years, the movement had started to have some successes.
Some states and local governments have established laws attempting to decriminalize cannabis, which has reduced the number of "simple possession" offenders sent to jail, since federal enforcement agents rarely target individuals directly for such relatively minor offenses. Other state and local governments ask law enforcement agencies to limit enforcement of drug laws with respect to cannabis, however under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws. In most cases, the absence of a state law does not present a preemption conflict with a federal law.
Alaska.
In Alaska, cannabis was decidedly legal (under state, but not federal, law) for in-home, personal use under the "Ravin v. State" ruling of 1975. This ruling allowed up to two ounces (57 g) of cannabis and cultivation of fewer than 25 plants for these purposes. A 1991 voter ballot initiative recriminalized marijuana possession, but when that law was eventually challenged in 2004, the Alaska courts upheld the "Ravin" ruling, saying the popular vote could not trump the state constitution. In response to former Governor Frank Murkowski's successive attempt to re-criminalize cannabis, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the state. On July 17, 2006, Superior Court Judge Patricia Collins awarded the Case Summary judgment to the ACLU. In her ruling, she said "No specific argument has been advanced in this case that possession of more than 1 ounce (28 g) of cannabis, even within the privacy of the home, is constitutionally protected conduct under Ravin or that any plaintiff or ACLU of Alaska member actually possesses more than 1 ounce (28 g) of cannabis in their homes." This does not mean that the legal possession threshold has been reduced to one ounce, as this was a mere case summary review filed by the ACLU, not a full case. Reinforcing "Ravin", Collins wrote "A lower court cannot reverse the State Supreme Court's 1975 decision in Ravin v. State" and "Unless and until the Supreme Court directs otherwise, "Ravin" is the law in this state and this court is duty bound to follow that law". The law regarding possession of cannabis has not changed in Alaska, and the Supreme Court has declined to review the case, therefore the law still stands at 4 ounces (113 g). However, federal prosecutions under the CSA can be brought in Federal Court, and federal courts applying federal law are not bound by state court precedent. As such, federal courts in Alaska will recognize that possession of any quantity of marijuana remains illegal in Alaska under federal law.
It should be emphasized that legal possession of cannabis is strictly noncommercial. The maximum legal limit is up to or 25 plants owned for personal use by adults in the privacy of their homes. Possessing more than or more than 25 or cannabis plants is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in jail and a fine of up to $50,000. Possession of any amount cannabis within of a school or a recreation center is also a felony punishable by 5 years jail time and a fine of up to $50,000; but if possession is noncommercial and the offender is in their a private residence, an affirmative defense may be raised in court.
Possession of marijuana for Commercial reasons regardless of the amount is prohibited by law. Sale of less than 1oz is considered a misdemeanor punishable by one year jail time and a fine of up to $5000. Sale of more than one ounce of cannabis is a felony punishable by 5 years in prison and $50,000 fine. Furthermore, Alaskans cannot maintain any buildings or structures whose sole purpose is to house and or distribute marijuana plant.
A petition of 45,000 signatures, originating from a marijuana regulation campaign was submitted to the Alaska Department of Elections on January 8, 2014. The campaign exceeded the required amount of 30,000 signatures from 30 of Alaska’s 40 voting districts to qualify. If the signatures are found to meet state regulations, the measure will appear on the August 19 primary election ballot. An 8 page act regarding the regulation of marijuana sales was drafted by both Alaska and Colorado citizens, based largely on the language used in Colorado's law.
California.
In California state law, Marijuana is defined as "all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or its resin." (H&SC 11018). As of January 1, 2011, possession of or less of marijuana is an infraction, punishable by a maximum $100 fine (plus fees) with no criminal record under Ca Health & Safety Code 11357b. (Prior to 2011, possession of or less of marijuana was a misdemeanor, but convictions under this section are expunged from the record after two years under Health and Safety Code Sections 11361.5 and 11361.7.)
Possession of larger amounts of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to $500 and six months in jail under Health & Safety Code 11357c. Possession of hashish or concentrated cannabis is an optional misdemeanor or felony ("wobbler") under Health & Safety Code 11357a. However, under Prop. 36 first- and second- time possession-only offenders may demand a treatment program instead of jail. Upon successful completion of the program, their conviction is erased. Possession (and personal use cultivation) offenders can also avoid conviction by making a preguilty plea under Penal Code 1000, in which case their charges are dismissed upon successful completion of a diversion program.
Sale, transportation or distribution of marijuana is a felony under Health and Safety Code Sections 11360. Transporting or giving away one ounce or less is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum $100 fine. Sale or distribution to minors is a felony under Health and Safety Code 11361. Possession with intent to sell any amount of marijuana is a felony under Health and Safety Code 11359.
Cultivation of any amount of marijuana is a felony under Health and Safety Code 11358. People who grow for personal use are eligible for diversion under Penal Code 1000 so long as there is no evidence of intent to sell. There are no fixed plant number limits to personal use cultivation.
It is illegal to drive while under the influence of marijuana (or alcohol or any other drug) by Vehicle Code 23152. "Under the influence" is not specifically defined in the statute, but is interpreted to imply some degree of impairment. Therefore the mere fact of having taken a toke of marijuana does not necessarily mean one is DUI. Drivers found in possession of less than of marijuana in their vehicle are liable for a maximum $100 misdemeanor fine under Vehicle Code 23222 (larger amounts are punishable under H&SC 11357(a) and 11359). Any person under the age of 21 convicted marijuana related offences will face a 12-month drivers license suspension, regardless of whether the offense was driving-related. Unlike federal law, California law requires a conviction for forfeiture of property involved in a drug crime. Vehicles may be forfeited only if 10 pounds or more of marijuana is involved. Health and Safety Code 11470.
Medical patients and their designated primary caregivers may legally possess and cultivate (but not distribute or sell) marijuana under Health and Safety Code 11362.5 (Prop 215) if they have a physician's recommendation or approval. Medical marijuana patients are not protected while on federal park land or forest land in California. CalNORML has received reports of campers and those driving through federal land who are searched, charged with federal possession statutes, and had the marijuana they had obtained under a state medical recommendation confiscated. A California medical recommendation is not a defense in federal court to these charges.
Colorado.
In 1975, Colorado passed a law which made possession of one ounce or less of the cannabis plant a second degree petty offense only punishable by a fine of 100 dollars. Thirty years later, in 2005, the city of Denver passed another law which allowed adults over 21 years to possess up to one ounce of marijuana without penalty in the city.
But the state still imposed penalties for use and possession of marijuana.
In November 2012, the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a ballot initiative campaign backed by the Marijuana Policy Project, successfully passed Amendment 64, making Colorado the only place in the world to have legalized the possession, use, production, distribution, and personal cultivation of marijuana (In the state of Washington non medical cultivation is still illegal). The Marijuana Policy Project also played a lead role in drafting and campaigning for the historic initiative. The amendment gained bipartisan support, with Coloradans voting for legalization at a higher rate than for President Obama. Arrangements for sale, packaging, advertising and taxation are now under discussion.
It will remain illegal to be found driving under the influence of marijuana, while legal possession will be limited to over-21s only and quantities regulated. Growing up to six plants will be legal, while it will also be legal to give away small quantities.
Connecticut.
On June 30, 2011, Gov. Dan Malloy of Connecticut signed legislation into law decriminalizing the possession of small, personal use amounts of marijuana by adults. The new law, Senate Bill 1014, took effect on July 1.
Senate Bill 1014 reduces the penalties for the adult possession of up to one-half ounce of marijuana from a criminal misdemeanor (formerly punishable by one year in jail and a $1,000 fine) to a non-criminal infraction, punishable by a $150 fine, no arrest or jail time, and no criminal record. The new law similarly reduces penalties for the possession of marijuana paraphernalia.
Possession of larger amounts of marijuana is still illegal and punishable by imprisonment and monetary fines. A subsequent offense of possession of one-half ounce of marijuana is still a non- criminal infraction but the fine rises to $200–$500.
First offense of possessing one-half to four ounces is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and $1,000 in fine. A subsequent offense becomes a felony punishable by up to 5 years incarceration and $3,000 fine.
First offense of possession of 4 ounces or more is a felony punishable by 5 years imprisonment and $2,000 fine. Subsequent offenses are punishable by 10 years in jail and a fine of $5,000.
The minimum mandatory sentence for possession of marijuana within 1,500 feet of a school is 2 years’ incarceration (without monetary fine) that runs consecutively with any other sentence.
Selling any amount of marijuana is completely illegal and a felony punishable by no less than 7 years in jail and $25,000 in fine. Selling to minors and possessing within 1,500 feet of a school or day care are both felonies which adds 3 years imprisonment to any other sentence imposed. There’s no monetary fine imposed.
On June 1, 2012, Governor Dan Malloy signed House Bill No. 5389, which allows the use of cannabis for certain "debilitating medical conditions."
District of Columbia.
On March 4, 2014, the Council of the District of Columbia voted 10-1 in favor of decriminalizing the recreational use of marijuana, replacing jail time for most offenses of private consumption with civil fines. The bill establishes a $25 penalty for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana, and it labels public consumption a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of $500 and up to six months in jail.
Maine.
Possession of less than is a civil violation, punishable by a fine of $200–400. Possession of or more is considered evidence of intent to distribute and is punished as such. Possession of a usable amount of marijuana is lawful if at the time of the possession the person has an authenticated copy of a medical record demonstrating that the person has a physician's recommendation. Possession of greater than one pound of marijuana is considered trafficking and is punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.
Cultivation of five plants or less of marijuana is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. For greater than five plants, the penalties increase to up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000. For greater than 100 plants the possible punishment is up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. For any amount of plants greater than 500, the penalties increase to up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000.
The penalty for sale of marijuana is up to one year in jail and a fine up to $2,000. The penalties increase to up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 if the sale was made to a minor or if it occurred within of a school or on a school bus.
Possession and personal use of paraphernalia is a civil violation punishable by a fine of $200. The sale of paraphernalia is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of up to $1,000, unless the sale was to a minor, in which case the penalty increases to up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000. Upon conviction, the court may suspend or revoke the professional license of the offender.
In November 2013 Portland became the first city on the East Coast to legalize marijuana as voters passed an ordinance allowing adults to possess small amounts of the drug. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law, and is legal only for medical use under state law. Portland’s ordinance does not set up any legal way to obtain marijuana.
Maryland.
Possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana in Maryland is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and 90 days in jail.
In March 2013, Maryland state senate passed a bill (Senate Bill 297) to be considered by the house of delegates regarding the decriminalization of the possession or marijuana. The bill aimed to make the penalties for possession of less than ten grams of marijuana a civil offense punishable by up to a $100 fine with no time in jail. This Bill was denied on the 19 March however a bill to allow academic research studies of medical marijuana was passed.
A proposed bill that would remove all criminal and civil penalties for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana, allow the personal cultivation of up to 6 marijuana plants by those over the age of 21 and create a system of retail marijuana stores, cultivation facilities, and marijuana product manufacturers is due to be introduced into legislation in early 2014.
Massachusetts.
In 2008, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot initiative to decriminalize a possession of up to an ounce of marijuana, and in 2009, ALM GL ch. 94C, § 32L was enacted into law, making possession of up to one ounce of marijuana a civil offense punishable by a penalty of $100 and forfeiting the drug. There are no other forms of civil or criminal punishments for offenders who are over 18 years of age. Minors are subjected to the same civil penalties as long as they complete the required drug awareness program and community service in accordance with section 32M of the same law. The civil punishment is increased to up to $1,000 if the offender fails to complete the drug awareness program and community service within one year of offense, at which point both the offender and parents are "severally" liable to pay the fine. The law is complicated by the fact that Massachusetts citizens are not legally required to identify themselves when cited with civil infractions. This makes it logistically impossible to enforce the fine.
In 2012, Massachusetts voters approved another ballot initiative to legalize possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes. The law puts medical marijuana under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Public Health, which is charged with setting up registration for patients and dispensaries and monitoring the business. Under the law, patients are allowed to possess a sixty-day supply (to be defined by the DPH) and appoint a representative to facilitate their use if they are incapable. The DPH is required to register at least one dispensary per county with a state-wide limit of 35.
Possession of more than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor resulting into a $500 fine and up to six months' imprisonment with probation, after which records are sealed. Subsequent offenses are subjected to the same punishments but records are not sealed after probation.
The sale of less than 50 pounds of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison with probation and a $5,000 fine. Subsequent offenders are subjected to up to 2½ years in prison without probation and a fine of $1,000–$10,000. Selling of more than 50 pounds is a felony punishable by 2½–15 years incarceration atop the minimum mandatory sentence(MMS). The MMS for selling up to 100 lbs is one year incarceration plus a fine of $500–$10,000. The MMS for selling 100–2000 lbs of marijuana is 3–15 years in prison and a fine of $2,500–$25,000. The MMS for selling 2000–10,000 lbs of marijuana is 5–15 years plus a fine of $5,000–$50,000 and that of selling more than 10,000 lbs of marijuana is 10–15 years incarceration plus up to $200,000 in fine. Selling marijuana within 1,000 feet of a school or 100 feet of a park is also a felony punishable by two years imprisonment in addition to the MMS and a fine of $1,000–$1,000.
Michigan.
In the November election of 2008, more than 60% of Michigan voters supported Proposal 1, and Michigan thereby became the thirteenth state to legalize medical cannabis. On 4 December 2008, the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act was enacted, allowing patients with debilitating medical conditions such as HIV, cancer, and Hepatitis C to legally possess and use cannabis. The patient can have up to two and a half ounces of usable cannabis, and twelve plants kept in an enclosed and locked facility.
Recreational use of marijuana has not been decriminalized in the state of Michigan. Possession of any amounts of the plant is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year incarceration and a $2,000 fine, while actual using is punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine. If possession is in a public park, the sentence is at most 2 years and a $2,000 fine. Distributing marijuana without remuneration is a misdemeanor punishable by at most one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Additionally in the November 2012 election, the cities of Detroit and Flint decriminalized cannabis possession of an ounce or less for persons 21 years and older. Ypsilanti, Michigan passed an ordinance to make cannabis the lowest priority for law enforcement activity.
The sale and cultivation of cannabis is a felony punishable by up to 4–15 years imprisonment and $20,000-$10,000,000 in fines depending on the number of plants grown and the amount of usable cannabis sold.
Missouri.
Mayor of St. Louis, Francis Slay posted an informal poll on his mayoral website in January 2014, asking his constituents whether or not they were in favour of the legalisation of recreational marijuana and by extension whether the citizens believe that Missouri ought to follow Colorado. The published results stated that over 90% of the people who voted were in favour of the implementation of legalised recreational usage of marijuana, and 70% supporting taxation upon its sale. 30% of those who supported this movement stating they had used the drug in the past week.
New Hampshire.
Currently, under New Hampshire state law, it is considered a misdemeanour to possess any amount of marijuana, subject to incarceration of up to 1 year and a maximum fine of $2000.
On the 15 January 2014 New Hampshire’s legislature voted 170 to 162 in favor of 'House Bill 492', based on Colorado Amendment 64, which seeks to legalize under state law the personal use of up to one ounce of marijuana by persons 21 years of age or older and establish regulations for the retail production and sale of cannabis. The vote to approve the bill is the first time a chamber of a state legislature has ever approved of legislation to legalize and regulate marijuana for all adults. Tax issues pertaining to the bill are yet to be debated and a second House floor vote is expected in early 2014.
New York.
In 1977, the state of New York also passed a law which decriminalized marijuana to a large extent. Possession of or less of marijuana, first offense, is a civil citation with a fine of $100 and the fine is increased to $200 for second offense. A third offense is a misdemeanor and the offender may get 5 days in jail and or pay $250 in fine. Possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana is also a misdemeanor punishable by 3 months in jail and $500 in fines. Possession of of marijuana is a class A misdemeanor that may be punishable by 1 year in jail or a $1000 fine or both.
Possession of up to of marijuana is a class E felony punishable by 1–4 years in jail and a fine of $5000. Repeat offenders are mandated 6 months in jail plus a $5000 fine and/or an additional 3–4 years in jail.
Possession of up to of marijuana is a class D felony which is punishable by up to 15 years in jail and/or a fine of $5000 and second offenders must be incarcerated for at least 6 months. Possession of more than is a class A felony also punishable by up to 15 years in jail and/or $5000 fine.
Selling or cultivation
The selling of marijuana or cultivation of cannabis can be punished by prison sentences and fines which can vary with nature of the offence.
Oregon.
In 1973, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize cannabis. Possession of 28.35 grams (1 ounce) or less is a violation (not a crime) punishable by a $500 to $1,000 fine. Possession of 1 ounce to 110 grams is punishable by 10 years in prison, and possession of more than 110 grams is a felony with punishment depending on the defendant's prior record.
Washington.
In November 2012 Initiative 502 passed by Washington voters with 55.7% voting for the measure, and 44.3% against. This initiative will allow adults over the age of 21 to legally possess up to of marijuana, of marijuana infused product in solid form, of marijuana infused product in liquid form or any combination of all three and to legally consume marijuana, and marijuana infused products.
Prior to the passage of I-502, the city of Seattle had passed Initiative 75, which directed the Seattle Police Department to make marijuana possession its lowest priority. Tacoma passed a similar initiative in 2011.
Wisconsin.
The possession, sale and usage of marijuana in Wisconsin is currently illegal under state law.
A unanimous resolution gave the voters of Dane County the ability to vote on the legalisation of the drug in any context. The Dane County Board have stated that the ballot will be held in April 2014.
Crime.
There have been over eight million cannabis arrests in the United States since 1993, including 786,545 arrests in 2005. About 88% of all marijuana arrests are for possession - not manufacture or distribution.
Although large-scale marijuana growing operations are frequently targeted by police in raids to attack the supply side and discourage the spread and marketing of the plant, the great majority of those arrested for cannabis are there for possession alone. However, in 1997, the vast majority of inmates in state prisons for marijuana related convictions were convicted of offenses other than simple possession.
According to the most recent Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Report, police arrested 847,864 persons for marijuana violations in 2008. Of those charged with marijuana violations, 754,224 were charged with possession only. The remaining 93,640 individuals were charged with "sale/manufacture," a category that does not differentiate for cultivation offenses, even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use. Marijuana arrests now comprise about one-half (49.8 percent) of all drug arrests reported in the United States.
Political support.
The Libertarian Party and the Green Party support the full legalization of marijuana. The United States Marijuana Party also has local chapters in 29 states but there are many state-level parties as well. Members associated with the US Marijuana Party have run for office, including Edward Forchion (for multiple offices) and candidates from the Marijuana Reform Party (for governor).

Dothideales

Dothideales are an order of bitunicate fungi consisting mainly of saprobic or plant parasitic species.
Description.
Taxa in this order are characterized by the absence of a hamathecium (defined as hyphae or other tissues between asci) in a locule, and formation of ovoid to cylindrical fisstunicate asci (asci that have two wall layers that split at maturity in a Jack-in-the-box-like fashion), usually in bundles or cluster called fascicles. During development, the asci push through the stromatic tissue, creating the locules.
Classification.
Until 2001, this order was thought to contain five families: Botryosphaeriaceae, Coccoidiaceae, Doditheaceae, Dothioraceae, and the Planistromellaceae. Several molecular phylogenetic studies since that time have resulted in an organization restructuring of classification. In the most recent revision of Ascomycota classification (December 31, 2007) the Dothideales contains two families, the Dothidiaceae and the Dothioraceae. The Botryosphaeriaceae (order Botryosphaeriales) and the Planistromellaceae have been moved to order and family "incertae sedis", respectively, pending the acquisition and analysis of additional molecular data.

Sonny, Please is a 2006 album by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. It was released on the Doxy label and features performances by Rollins, Clifton Anderson, Bobby Broom, Bob Cranshaw, Steve Jordan, Kimati Dinizulu, and Joe Corsello. 
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Jeff Tamarkin awarded the album 3.5 stars stating "Most of his playing here is relatively easygoing. Rollins still enjoys taking it to the limit, just not as often as he once did. He doesn't need to, though; with nothing left to prove, he can afford to stand back and just enjoy being Sonny Rollins.".

Balance (advertisement)

Balance was a 1989 television advertisement for the Lexus LS 400, which also introduced the luxury car make Lexus to television audiences. It was created by Team One, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi. The ad was designed to promote the engineering attributes of the flagship Lexus sedan. The advertisement received several awards and was emulated by later versions.
Synopsis.
The advertisement showed the Lexus LS 400 on rollers, with a set of champagne glasses stacked on its hood. The LS400 engine and drivetrain were required to quickly accelerate from stop and shift through all the gears to reach the equivalent top speed of over per hour. Despite the quick shifts and the fast speed, the LS 400 engine produces no vibrations to upset the champagne glass pyramid, and not one drop of liquid is spilled. The narration reads, "After years of intense work, Lexus is ready to celebrate...because even at the equivalent of 145 miles per hour, the Lexus LS 400 is designed to stir the soul...and not much else."
Reception.
The Team One advertising campaign for the Lexus launch, including the "Balance" ad, received a number of advertising awards. Industry publication "Adweek" named the "Balance" ad one of its Best Spots of 1990, as listed in a retrospective. The Belding Awards, presented by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles, recognized Team One for their early Lexus campaign. The "Balance" ad was also challenged by consumer advocate David Horowitz, on his "Fight Back! With David Horowitz" television program, who suggested that Lexus had staged the advertisement in some way unseen to the audience. In response, Lexus produced a third-party verification videotape, and performed a live, public demonstration of the same feat—showing that indeed the LS 400 could perform as promised. The stacking of champagne glasses was also used for the formal introduction of the LS 400 at Pebble Beach. In factory, Lexus models use a similar wine glass test.
Later versions.
Several car manufacturers referenced the "Balance" ad in subsequent commercials. In separate instances, Nissan and BMW mentioned the champagne glasses test in their ads. The Nissan ads, designed for the debut of the Nissan Altima in 1993, duplicated the Lexus displays of champagne glasses and ball bearings. Nissan then stacked champagne glasses on the hood of its less-expensive Altima, showing a similar level of precision. The BMW ads mocked the champagne glasses test as an unnecessary indicator of performance. In the late 1990s, Lexus added advertisements that focused on fun and entertainment, in addition to engineering precision. The earlier ads were seen as a highly rational appeal. In 2006, Lexus referenced "Balance" with a new ad for the fourth-generation Lexus LS 460. Titled "Pyramid", the ad depicted a driver parking a car between two stacks of champagne glasses using the Advanced Parking Guidance System, a new Lexus automatic parking feature.

Baccharis vanessae

Baccharis vanessae is a rare species of baccharis known by the common name Encinitas baccharis. It is endemic to San Diego County, California, where it is a member of the chaparral flora, especially among Torrey pines. It is a federally listed threatened species. Despite its name it is no longer present in Encinitas, but it is known from other parts of the county from the coastline to the mountains. There are perhaps 15 populations remaining, for a total of about 2000 individuals. Half the remaining occurrences are on land which may be cleared for development.
Description.
"Baccharis vanessae" is a sticky, glandular shrub producing dense, branching, erect stems approaching 2 meters in maximum height. The leaves are linear and up to long. This dioecious shrub produces male and female flower heads on different individuals. The fruit is an achene with a pappus up to a centimeter long. 
Conservation.
Habitat destruction is a threat to the species. Fire suppression in the fire-prone chaparral habitat threaten those plants occurring near residential areas. Introduced species of plants have altered the local plant community. Some of the populations are very small, made up of just a few individuals, reducing their genetic viability.

Austin Aztex

Austin Aztex is a soccer team based in Austin, Texas, United States. Founded in 2011, the team currently plays in the USL's Premier Development League, the fourth tier of the United States soccer pyramid. They play their home games at the 6,500-seat House Park just north of downtown Austin. This is the second team to carry the name Austin Aztex, the first having been founded in 2008 and relocated in 2010.
History.
Rebirth of the Aztex.
The present incarnation of the Austin Aztex was founded by David Markley, who was a minority owner of the previous Austin Aztex. The previous team's majority owners moved the organization to Orlando, Florida at the end of the 2010 season. That team was renamed Orlando City S.C.
In September 2011, Markley announced plans to create a new Austin Aztex team which would compete in the USL Premier Development League beginning in the 2012 season. The new Aztex played their first game on May 5, 2012 at Woodforest Bank Stadium, home of the Texas Dutch Lions, and defeated the hosts 4-0. The first Aztex goal was scored by midfielder Tony Rocha on a free kick in the 6th minute of play. The Aztex's first home game was played on May 19, 2012 against the El Paso Patriots before a crowd of 2,507. The Aztex rose to the occasion with a 6-1 win, with Kristopher Tyrpak providing three of the Aztex's six goals.
The reborn Aztex finished their first season with 9 wins, 5 losses, and 2 draws. They won their first playoff game against the Ocala Stampede but fell to Orlando City U-23's in the Southern Conference final.
Championship Season.
The Aztex enjoyed great success in the 2013 PDL season, topping the Mid-South Division with an 11-2-1 record and going on to become champions of the PDL's Southern Conference. The 2013 PDL championships were held at House Park in Austin. The Aztex defeated Eastern Conference champions Ocean City Nor'easters 1-0 in the semifinal, earning the right to face Central Conference champions Thunder Bay Chill in the final.

Van Gogh (1991 film)

Van Gogh is a 1991 film written and directed by Maurice Pialat. It stars Jacques Dutronc in the role of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, for which he won the 1992 César Award for Best Actor. Set in 1890, the film follows the last 67 days of Van Gogh's life and explores his relationships with his brother Theo, his physician Paul Gachet (most famous as the subject of Van Gogh's painting, "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"), and the women in his life, including Gachet's daughter, Marguerite. 
The film was entered into the 1991 Cannes Film Festival.
Approach to biography.
The film is noted for its anti-melodramatic and unsensationalistic approach to Van Gogh's life. For this reason is often contrasted with Vincente Minnelli's Van Gogh film "Lust for Life". Very little time is devoted to Van Gogh's art and work, with the bulk of the 158-minute running time occupied by the artist's often difficult personal relationships and declining mental state. The film omits any references to many of the most famous incidents in Van Gogh's life (including his attempt to cut off his ear in 1888) in favor of concentrating on the social dynamics of the late 19th century.
Writing in "The Washington Post", critic Desson Howe explains: "In the movie, you don't see Van Gogh (Jacques Dutronc) complete the final brush stroke of a masterpiece, then call up old Gauguin for a celebratory absinthe. You do see a thin, stringy man, suffering from headaches, enjoying whores and moping around irascibly. "Van Gogh" denies you familiar highlights, keeps you from his working elbow and avoids the Ear Thing. But it shows you the quotidian stuff in between. This is the story of an artist being human, carrying canvases out or lugging them back in – their famous images intentionally out of sight."

Geislinger Steige

The Geislinger Steige ("Geislingen climb") is an old trade route over the low mountain range of the Swabian Jura in southern Germany. It links Geislingen an der Steige with Amstetten and is one of the most famous ascents in the Jura. The name "Geislinger Steige" refers both to:
The ramp is 5.6 km long and climbs a height of 112 m. It has an incline of 1:44.5, which is 22.5 ‰ or 2.25%. The curve radius in places is less than 300 m, with a minimum of 278 m. This section of the line is therefore built in accordance with the standards for mountain railways.
Planning and Construction.
With the passing of the "law affecting the construction of railways" in 1843, the decision was effectively made to build a line from Heilbronn – at that time the final destination for shipping on the river Neckar - to Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, the first railway line in Württemberg. The biggest difficulty to the construction was the unfavourable topography, because the Swabian Jura had to be crossed between Geislingen and Ulm. After various options had been investigated and discarded, it was finally decided to build a short, steep ramp at Geislingen: the Geislinger Steige.
The construction of the railway ramp was entrusted to senior engineer ("Oberingenieur") Michael Knoll and master builder ("Oberbaurat") Karl von Etzel, who had gained experience on the "Brennerbahn" through (South) Tyrol. Construction begain in 1847 and the ramp was opened in 1850, around 3,000 workers having been employed. Closely linked to the building of the ramp is the firm of WMF (Württemberg Metal Factory) at Geislingen an der Steige.
Operations.
Its operation was a challenge for the Royal Württemberg State Railways (K.W.St.E.) as well as the Deutsche Reichsbahn and Deutsche Bundesbahn. In the steam locomotive age every train, even the Orient-Express, had to be assisted. As a result the railway stations at Geislingen (Steige) and Amstetten are correspondingly large.
For the banking locomotives on stand-by duty there was a depot ("Bahnbetriebswerk") with the necessary facilities.
In 1933 the line was electrified by the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft. Electric locomotives were considerably more powerful than steam locomotives. That meant banking duties were reduced. For the remaining work locomotives of DRG Class E 93 (later 193) and DRB Class E 94 (194) were employed. Amongst others, they relieved the steam locomotives of DRG Class 59.
In the Deutsche Bundesbahn era the trains were mainly hauled by standard electrics, the so-called "Einheits-Elektrolokomotiven" including the DB Class 103.
In February 1975 the so-called "Gleiswechselbetrieb" between Geislingen (Steige) and Amstetten was introduced. This means that both tracks can be used in either direction and enables, for example, slower trains to change tracks to allow faster trains to overtake. In March 1986 this was also brought in between Geislingen West and Geislingen (Steige). In 1987 Class 140s (temporarily) and 150s replaced the Class 194s as pusher locomotives. The Class 150s have since been retired. Since 1991 banking duties have largely been done away with on passenger trains as a result of the introduction of the ICEs and more powerful locomotives (e. g. DBAG Class 101, DB Class 120). As before the InterRegioExpress (IRE) runs every two hours, which during the week is run four times a day with a Sprinter with two Class 218 diesel locomotives; the rest of the time with Class 146.2, from Lindau to Stuttgart and back. By hooking the banking engines up front and back, the least time is lost for passengers on the Geislinger Steige. As before, however, heavy goods trains are pushed. For Railion trains (formerly DB Cargo) there are two DB Class 151 engines at Geislingen. Since increasingly private railway companies in Germany are transporting freight, private banking engines may also be encountered on the Geislinger Steige (e. g. Class 66 of the "Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln" (HGK).
Future.
The top speed on the ramp is 70 km/h. Trains with uncoupled banking engines climb the ramp at 60 km/h. In order to get rid of the bottleneck at Geislinger Steige a new high-speed line is being planned: the Wendlingen–Ulm high-speed railway, for speeds up to 250 km/h. It is intended to get round the height difference at Geislingen using two tunnels, each 8 km long. The still-outstanding financial risk cover was sorted out in July 2007. On the down side, plans for other sections of the new line have still not been finalised.
Due to the steepness of the new line heavy trains will not be permitted to use it. As a result pusher services on the Geislinger Steige, which have been going for 150 years, will continue to be needed.

Kuloy

Kuloy () is an urban locality (a work settlement) in Velsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, located on the Kuloy River, from Arkhangelsk and from Velsk, the administrative center of the district. Area: ~. Population: 
History.
The history of the settlement goes back to August 25, 1942, when Kuloy railway station of the North Pechora Railway was opened. The station was necessary to access the work camp building the railway. The railway was built using forced labor by political prisoners, causing many deaths due to low safety and general health of workers. There were four men and one women work camp in Kuloy.
Work conditions were extremely severe. The workers had to build their own ovens, get warm by standing near cast iron and write letters for their friends and family on pieces of newspapers. They made the ink to write by mixing coal residue with kerosene. In 1944, barracks were built to be used as dormitories for workers. Working on the railway was deemed voluntary, but the discipline and surveillance was organized by the military.
Status of urban-type settlement was granted to Kuloy on March 20, 1945.
In 2004, near the village of Priluki, located from Kuloy, a graveyard of political prisoners of Sevdvinlag was found. The deceased were people who died at the infirmary, located away.
People used to live and work under harsh conditions. At that time there were no seniors or children inhabiting Kuloy. As late as August 1944, a kindergarten and the first grade of an elementary school were opened in Kuloy. After the end of the World War II, people started to move the new settlement. New houses, cantinas, and shops were built. People worked and the settlement grew.
Economy and transportation.
A station of Northern Railway's Moscow–Kotlas–Vorkuta line is located in Kuloy, providing jobs for a large part of the working population. These include train operators, maintenance and station personnel, workers at the railroad depot and communications personnel. Kuloy is served by a 272 km long road between Konosha and Kizema. The settlement also contains two general education schools and a children's music and art school.
Oktyabrsky–Velsk auto route is located in from the settlement.
Sports.
Sports are well represented in Kuloy. In 2006, the local football team "Lokomotiv" () won the Velsky District championship. Aside from football, the settlement also has a chess club, a beach volleyball playground, and an ice rink. Locals enjoy wandering in the woods surrounding the town.

Harry Womack

Harris "Harry" Womack (June 25, 1945 – March 9, 1974) was an American singer and musician, most notable for his tenure as a member of the family R&B quintet, The Valentinos.
Biography.
Early life.
Harris "Harry" Womack grew up the fourth of five sons to Friendly and Naomi Womack in Cleveland's east side. Raised as Baptist, all five brothers began singing together when Harry was seven, forming The Womack Brothers. Like his brothers Bobby and Cecil, Harry took up instruments, playing bass guitar before reaching his teenage years. Along with brothers Cecil and Curtis, Harry was a tenor vocalist while Bobby and Friendly, Jr. were baritones. In 1960, when he was fifteen, Sam Cooke signed the act to his SAR Records label, having told the brothers – and their father – that he was willing to work with them. Friendly Womack made Sam Cooke promise him that the brothers would continue to sing gospel and not what he referred to as "the devil's music".
Career.
Following two gospel releases with SAR, Sam Cooke suggested the group change their sound and name. In 1962, Cooke renamed them "The Valentinos" and produced and arranged the group's first major hit, "Looking for a Love", which was led by Bobby. The record became a hit and landed them an opening spot on James Brown's Revue. Following several modestly successful R&B releases, the Valentinos' next hit, "It's All Over Now", was released in 1964. While successful on the R&B chart, the song became internationally successful after The Rolling Stones covered it.
Following Cooke's death at a L.A. motel in December 1964, SAR folded and Bobby Womack, now married to Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara, left the group for a solo career. The Valentinos briefly disbanded before regrouping as a quartet in 1966, signing with Chess Records where they recorded the Northern Soul hit, "Sweeter than the Day Before". However, the group got dropped from Chess after only two singles and Cecil Womack followed Bobby out of the group after he married Mary Wells. In 1968, the remaining trio of Harry, Curtis and Friendly Jr. signed with Jubilee Records where they recorded the Cecil-composed "Two Lovers History" before being dropped in 1970.
In 1971, Harry started accompanying brother Bobby after Bobby began his successful solo career after several years in limbo due to the scandal surrounding his marriage to Barbara Cooke, playing bass in his band. He and the other Valentinos and Cecil Womack contributed background vocals to Bobby's solo records starting with the 1970 release, "My Prescription". Harry and the brothers were promptly featured in the background of Bobby's breakthrough hit, "That's the Way I Feel About Cha" as well as "Woman's Gotta Have It" from 1972. In late 1973, Harry and his brothers backed Bobby again on a remake of "Lookin' for a Love". Prior to that, the Valentinos emerged with a minor R&B hit of Bobby's "I Can Understand It", its success landing them a performing spot on the hit dance show, "Soul Train".
Bobby later described his brother as "bohemian" and "carefree". Though it was assumed that Bobby's 1973 hit, "Harry Hippie", was about him, Bobby later said that it was just a song given to him by his collaborator and friend, country singer-songwriter Jim Ford. Nonetheless, during performances of the song, Harry would do dance numbers, which caused laughter among audience members and Bobby himself. Harry's last professional recording was singing background on Bobby's album, "Lookin' for a Love Again", released in January 1974. The title track would find success for a third time after its release.
Death.
Noting that Harry was going through personal problems with his girlfriend, Bobby advised Harry to stay at his home for a time while he went out on a promotional tour for his new album. On the night of March 9, 1974, Womack and his girlfriend at the time began arguing after the woman claimed she had found another woman's undergarments in a room Womack was occupying at his brother Bobby's house. Womack was shot to death by the girlfriend. The undergarments later turned out to be from a girlfriend of Bobby's. He was 28 years old.
Friendly Womack, Jr., Bobby's and Harry's eldest brother, was the first to tell Bobby the news of Harry's death while Bobby was doing a radio interview. Bobby said he was devastated by the news. After burying him, he sent his parents to live close to them in Los Angeles just in case any of them would face similar tragedies. Though not written about him, Bobby to this day performs "Harry Hippie" as a tribute to Harry. A week after Harry's death, his last recording as a background vocalist, "Lookin' for a Love", reached number-one on the R&B chart and number ten on the pop chart, later selling two million copies.

Woodland Public Library

The Woodland Public Library is the oldest, and one of the last functioning Carnegie-funded libraries in California. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a contributing property of the Downtown Woodland Historic District.
History.
Woodland's library history began with ice-cream socials and book donations from community members, led by the woman in the community in 1874. In 1891 a $500 donation helped the community's efforts and led to the establishment of a free public library held in a small area in City Hall. In 1903 a grant from Andrew Carnegie was received in the amount of $10,000 for the construction of a public library. Dodge & Dolliver of San Francisco (whose work included the San Mateo County Courthouse and St. John's Presbyterian Church in San Francisco) was to design the first phase of the library. Dodge & Dolliver designed the building based on Mission Revival architecture even though James Bertram, Carnegie's personal secretary, objected to their choice. William Henry Curson, the contractor for the Woodland Opera House, was the contractor for the job.
Between 1915 and 1979 an agreement was made between the Yolo County Library System and the City Library. The two organizations shared the same building for administrative operations but the Yolo County Library had a separate service establishment. This led to Carnegie donating $12,000 in 1915 to expand the building. A west wing was added, designed by W.H. Weeks, with an entrance on Court Street with a sign that said "County Library" while the original entrance on First Street said "City Library".
In 1927-1929 another expansion occurred, and in 1985 voters approved a $2.5 million expansion that included the construction of the Leake Room and the interior courtyard. When the additions were completed in 1988, the building was twice as large.

Jona Lendering

Jona Lendering (born 29 October 1964 in Beneden-Leeuwen, Gelderland) is a Dutch historian and the author of books on antiquity, Dutch history and modern management. He studied masters in arts (MA) level history at Leiden University and Mediterranean culture at the Amsterdam Free University, taught history at the Free University, and worked as an archivist employed by the Dutch government, before becoming one of the founders of the history school Livius Onderwijs.
Career and works.
Lendering's biography of Alexander the Great ("Alexander de Grote") attempted to make greater use than earlier scholars of Persian and Babylonian sources. For example, he argued from Babylonian astronomical diaries that Darius III of Persia was deserted by his troops when he faced Alexander at the Battle of Gaugamela, rather than personally leading the retreat as reported by Greek sources. His work, "Alexander de Grote. De ondergang van het Perzische rijk" was described by "Bryn Mawr Classical Review" contributor Jan P. Stronk from the University of Amsterdam, as "clear and compelling" and "manifestly written for the general public"-and although not sharing Lendering's love for psychological profiles, Lendering's work may be regarded as an incentive for serious scholars looking to expand their knowledge of new sources of ancient history.
In a passage cited by one commentator as characteristic of recent unsympathetic interpretations of Alexander, Lendering argued that Alexander's respectful treatment of Darius' family was not just an act of chivalry but also a claim to be the "new king". "Quality Non-Fiction from Holland" called "Alexander de Grote" "fascinating" and highlighted Lendering's attention to non-Western evidence. However, ancient historian Jan P. Stronk thought it clear from Lendering's book that these sources could at best illuminate specific details of Alexander's life.
Lendering's interest in using western sources in combination with eastern sources can also be discerned in his book on ancient Rome ("Stad in marmer"), in which he quoted hitherto neglected Talmudic sources, and especially in his book on the legacy of Babylon and the world of Islam to Medieval Europe, "Vergeten erfenis".
In the "Bryn Mawr Classical Review", Lendering's review of Kaveh Farrokh "Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War" was criticized as being "marred by a series of overt inaccuracies, misconceptions and mistakes with respect to the domain of ancient Iranian studies." Lendering was also described by the authors of the response as displaying "a consistent pattern of ignoring seminal works, journal publications, and research that contradict his points of view."
In 2010, Lendering and Arjen Bosman published "De rand van het Rijk: de Romeinen en de Lage Landen."
Livius.org.
Since 1996, Lendering has maintained "Livius", a website containing numerous articles on ancient history. The site is divided into sections on specific regions – Anatolia, Persia, Greece, etc. – and an individual selection of topics is treated for each of these. The Mesopotamian section contains the recently discovered "Babylonian Chronicles of the Hellenistic Period".
Livius Onderwijs.
Livius Onderwijs is an association of teachers interested in ancient Mediterranean societies. ("Onderwijs" is Dutch for "education".) The association is based in Amsterdam and among other services offers a series of lectures there and elsewhere. It was founded in 2005 by Lendering and Marco Prins.
Award.
After the publication of Lendering's "Spijkers op laag water", a book highly critical about the shortcomings of modern classicists, archaeologists, and historians, the research school of Dutch classicists and historians awarded him their annual "Oikos publieksprijs", recognizing Lendering's contributions to explaining Antiquity to a larger audience.
Selected works.
Lendering is a regular contributor to "Ancient Warfare"; his books have been translated into Turkish.

Holy Trinity Church, Wysall

Holy Trinity Church, Wysall is a parish church in the Church of England in Wysall. 
History.
Wysall Church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, enjoys a prominent position towards the south end of the village on a bluff. The origins of the church are medieval, with some parts of the building dating back to the 13th century. 
The church is visible for many miles and consists of a tower with spire, south porch, nave with south aisle and chancel. The graveyard has a near circular boundary wall. The tower, with embattlements, displays signs of gothic architecture of the decorated period dating it around the late 13th to 14th century. The lower part of the tower has a window of perpendicular style suggesting late 14th century though, as is often the case, there are features of the north wall that are Early English work predating the tower by a hundred years or so. There is evidence of a high pitched roof traced on the tower. The south porch was restored in the late 19th century and other work to maintain this excellent early church in good condition is evident. The windows are well worth note. Wysall gives us an example of late Decorated work of a beautiful and simple kind. A carefully researched and prepared account of Wysall church can be found in the Thoroton Society Transactions.
Inside ornamental dedications to the families of Sacheverell and Armstrong, amongst other important families. Some original oak pews and the pulpit have survived the restoration though demoted to the West end. The roof of the chancel is very early and well worth note. The church is involved in local affairs within an excellent web site..
White's Directory of Nottinghamshire in 1853 gives the following description:
The church ... has some ancient monuments of the Armstrong family, and former vicars of this parish. The vicarage has been augmented with Queen Anne's Bounty, and is valued in the King's books at £4 11s 0½d. Sir Robert H. Bromley is the patron, purchased in 1837 of Earl of Gosford, and the Rev. Thomas P. Dodson the incumbent.

Donald Markwell

"For the Montgomery, Alabama, talk radio personality, Don Markwell, see Don Markwell "
Professor Donald John 'Don' Markwell (born 19 April 1959, in Quilpie, Queensland, Australia) is an Australian social scientist and educational leader. He has been Executive Director of the Menzies Research Centre since 2012.
Writings.
Markwell's academic works include contributions to international relations, political science, the history of economic thought, public law, and education. They address such questions as how to promote order and peace in the international society of states, the role of conventions in constitutional systems, and the best education for the 21st century.
His "John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace" was widely cited in the Keynesian revival of 2008 for its emphasis on international economic cooperation (including the international coordination of economic policies and the development of international economic institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank) and on economic causes of war and economic means to promote peace. It was also cited in a 2013 controversy for rebutting the claim of Niall Ferguson that the ideas in Keynes's "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" (1919) were significantly influenced by Keynes's attraction to a German, Carl Melchior.
"John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace" is one of a number of Markwell's publications on John Maynard Keynes, and on idealism (international relations) (especially interwar idealists, such as Sir Alfred Zimmern, who sought to promote the 'rule of law' in international society, Florence Stawell (known as Melian Stawell), and Keynes, who sought economic means to promote peace; and a generation earlier, Cecil Rhodes, who aimed to promote peace through international scholarships). Markwell's contributions to international relations are in the tradition of Hedley Bull, adding an emphasis on economic determinants of order in the international society of states.
Markwell's writings in political science and public law have been especially concerned with constitutional issues, including federalism, constitutional conventions in the Westminster system, and the monarchy and republicanism in Commonwealth countries, including the reserve powers. He uncovered the extensive history of consultations of judges of the High Court of Australia (such as Sir Samuel Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton) by Governor-Generals of Australia. He worked closely with the former Governor-General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowen, in the writing of "A public life: the memoirs of Zelman Cowen".
In 1984, he co-edited with George Brandis and Tom Harley a collection of essays, "Liberals face the future: essays on Australian liberalism". In 2013, he has co-edited with Rachael Thompson and Julian Leeser a further collection of essays, "State of the Nation: aspects of Australian public policy", with critiques of Australian public policy since 2007 by 15 non-partisan experts.
Markwell's "A large and liberal education': higher education for the 21st century"reflects his advocacy of broad undergraduate education (liberal education), improving teaching and learning in universities, equity and access, the value of collegiate education [http://collegiateway.org/news/2008-markwell-naauc] and student engagement, and the importance of educational philanthropy.
Its sequel, "'Instincts to lead': on leadership, peace, and education", based on Markwell's speeches and writings on those topics as Warden of Rhodes House, Oxford, and as Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education) at the University of Western Australia, will be published in August 2013. (The title is drawn from Cecil Rhodes saying in his Will that he wanted as Rhodes Scholars young people with 'instincts to lead'.)
Career.
Rhodes Scholar for Queensland for 1981, Markwell was educated at the University of Queensland, University of Oxford, and Princeton University, studying economics, law, and international relations. He was Fellow and Tutor in Politics at Merton College, University of Oxford, from 1986 to 1997; Warden (president) of Trinity College (University of Melbourne) from 1997 to 2007; Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education) of the University of Western Australia from 2007 to 2009; and Warden of Rhodes House, Oxford, from 2009 to 2012 (in succession to Sir Colin Lucas).
In 2007-2009, Markwell led a curriculum review at the University of Western Australia which proposed significant curriculum reform,
As Warden of Rhodes House from 2009 to 2012, Markwell expanded activities for Rhodes Scholars in Oxford; expanded alumni communications, events, and consultation; initiated governance reform; and raised significant funds to support the Rhodes Scholarships. He is credited with helping to initiate the review of undergraduate women's leadership at Princeton University chaired by Nannerl O. Keohane,
In September 2012, it was announced that Markwell had decided to step down as Warden of Rhodes House to return to Australia, where his family live. The Chairman of the Rhodes Trust, Dr John Hood, paid tribute to 'the extraordinary energy and commitment Dr Markwell has brought to the advancement of the Rhodes Trust's affairs', and to the 'many notable accomplishments under his leadership'.
In October 2012, Markwell was appointed Executive Director of the Menzies Research Centre, a public policy think tank in Australia named for Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and associated with the Liberal Party of Australia. In this role, his activities include leadership in consultation for a 'New Colombo Plan' to encourage Australian university students to study abroad in Asia-Pacific universities, and co-editing "State of the Nation: aspects of Australian public policy", with critiques of Australian public policy since 2007 by 15 non-partisan experts.

St Peter and St Paul's Church, Widmerpool

St. Peter's Church, Widmerpool is a parish church in the Church of England in Widmerpool.
History.
It is uncertain how long there has stood a church on this site but "The Buildings of England, Nottinghamshire" makes reference to the later church emanating "From the original medieval structure" The Anglican parish register has records dating from 1539. Originally dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, the church is now formally known as St Peter's.
The church was rebuilt in 1832, with a gothic spire, but in 1836 it was struck by lightning, which threw down half of the spire, and broke all the glass in the windows. The remaining part of the spire was taken down, and it was finished by a tower, in which are three bells. The churchyard is ornamentally planted with evergreens.
The old church was in a poor state of repair and neglect when the Robertsons acquired the estate and was rebuilt in 1832. Unfortunately the handsome Gothic spire was struck by lightning some four years later, demolishing half of the spire and breaking all the glass windows. The remaining spire was then removed and the church rebuilt yet again at a cost of £10,000 in the period 1888-1895. This involved considerable financial help from the Robertson (Robinson) family. A tower replaced the spire and has three bells.
During the civil war two soldiers that were killed at the Battle of Willoughby Fields nearby were buried in the graveyard. There is a roll of honour, commemorating the two world wars, on the south wall. Inside is a plaque above the door to the vestry. To each side of the pillars inside of the south door are carved head ornaments, one of a lion and the other a bull. The graveyard is well kept and planted with evergreens. Close by is a large copse and nature reserve.
Parish Status.
The church is a part of a united benefice comprising:

Royal Arctic Line

Royal Arctic Line A/S (RAL) or Royal Arctic is a seabourne freight company in Greenland, wholly owned by the Greenland Home Rule Government. It was formed in 1993 and is headquartered in Nuuk.
History.
Royal Arctic Line A/S was spun off as a company separate from the Greenlandic conglomerate KNI in 1993. Like many Greenlandic companies, its operations derive from and carry on the traditions of the earlier Royal Greenland Trading Department.
Operations.
The company has a monopoly on all sea transport of cargo to, from, and within Greenland. Construction materials account for roughly a quarter of shipping to Greenland; fish makes up roughly half of shipping from Greenland; fish and beverages bottled at Nuuk (principally water and beer) account for most shipping within Greenland. 
Royal Arctic operates cargo routes among the Greenland settlements and between Nuuk and Aalborg in Denmark and manages 13 harbors in Greenland as well as the Greenlandic base harbour in Aalborg, which serves as the source for all European shipping to the island. Seabourne traffic from North America goes to Reykjavík aboard Eimskip, whence it is carried to Greenland aboard Royal Arctic.
In 2011, government concessions accounted for 76% of the company's income. The Transport Committee newly formed by Greenland Home Rule issued a report stating that liberalisation of the shipping market offers no benefits and the current concession is reasonable. It also began planning with RAL and stakeholders to expand the harbors in Nuuk and Sisimiut.
Divisions.
Linietrafik.
Royal Arctic Linietrafik operates the company's fleet, currently consisting of ten ships six container ships and four "settlement ships" with five more under construction.
The three largest ships the "Naja Arctica" (782 TEU), "Nuka Arctica" (782 TEU), and "Mary Arctica" (588 TEU) are principally used for the Aalborg route. The "Irena Arctica" (424 TEU), "Arina Arctica" (283 TEU), and "Pajuttaat" are used within Greenland and have equipment for unloading in cities without harbors. All these container ships are double-hauled and built with high freeboards and the highest ice ratings: the "Mary Arctica" has even been chartered for Antarctic service. The settlement ships "Angaju Ittuk", "Anguteq Ittuk", "Aqqaluk Ittuk", and "Johanna Kristina" are all older and smaller (220–320 m³) and used for supplying the smaller ports. In 2011, the ships had an average on-time rate of 72%.
One of the new ships is considered "Mary"-class and will have a capacity of 606 TEU. Of the four others, two will have 108-TEU and two will have 360-TEU capacity.
Havneservice.
Royal Arctic Havneservice operates the company's harbour operations and nearby lighthouses.
Some other towns such Qaanaaq, Ittoqqortoormiit, and Qeqertarsuaq in Greenland and Reykjavík in Iceland are served very infrequently.
Subsidiaries.
Bygdeservice.
Royal Arctic Bygdeservice A/S ("Settlement Service") is a wholly owned subsidiary based in Nuuk. It operates under contract from the Home Rule Government and provides fortnightly supplies to ice-free ports. It subcontracts its weekly passenger duties to Arctic Umiaq. In 2011, Royal Arctic Bygdeservice received a 20-year contract extension. Five new ships have been contracted from P+S Werften in Germany to provide the increased tonnage, financed via loans from a German bank.
Logistics.
Royal Arctic Logistics A/S is a wholly owned subsidiary based in Aalborg. It operates the Aalborg harbour and the forwarding business between Greenland and Denmark. Its subsidiaries include the Aalborg Stevedore Company A/S (67%), Nordjysk Kombi Terminal A/S (50%), and Aalborg Toldoplag A/S (40%).
Tankers.
Royal Arctic Tankers A/S is a wholly owned subsidiary based in Nuuk. It was formerly owned jointly with Herning Shipping A/S, but Herning's interest was bought out in January 2012. It operates the MV "Pajuttaat".
Arctic Umiaq.
Arctic Umiaq Line A/S is owned jointly (50% each) with Air Greenland and based in Nuuk. Its 2011 operating loss of DKK 8.1 million was made good via a loss guarantee from Greenland Home Rule, and the company has secured an agreement for further loss guarantees through 2016.
Arctic Base Supply.
Arctic Base Supply A/S is owned jointly (50% each) with Danbor and based in Nuuk. It provides logistical support for offshore oil and gas exploration and, in 2011, assisted Cairn Energy in its work at Nuuk and Aasiaat. No activity is expected in 2012, however.
Ejendomsselskabet Suliffik.
Ejendomsselskabet Suliffik A/S ("Suliffik Property Co.") is a subsidiary (30.3%) owned jointly with Royal Greenland (30.3%) and TELE Greenland (39%).

Bahia dissecta is a synonym for "Amauriopsis dissecta", a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common names (ragleaf) bahia and yellow ragweed. It is native to the southwestern United States as far north as Wyoming, as well as northern Mexico. It can be found in several habitat types, from dry mountain slopes to roadsides. This is an annual or biennial herb producing a spindly, branching, erect stem variable in height from 20 centimeters to well over one meter. The stems are reddish and generally glandular. The small leaves are mostly located toward the base of the stem and are finely divided into linear lobes. The spreading inflorescence produces several flower heads, each lined with hairy, glandular phyllaries. Each head has a fringe of rounded yellow ray florets about half a centimeter long and a center of yellow disc florets. The fruit is a dark-colored achene 3 or 4 millimeters long. If there is any pappus it is small and scale-like.

BW-723C86

BW-723C86 is a tryptamine derivative drug which acts as a 5-HT2B receptor agonist. It has anxiolytic effects in animal studies, and is also used for investigating the function of the 5-HT2B receptor in a range of other tissues. 
BW-723C86 is actually a mixed 5-HT2B / 5-HT2C agonist, and while it has good selectivity over 5-HT2A and other serotonin receptor subtypes, it has only around 3x selectivity for 2B over 2C and so is much less selective than most research ligands, but no superior 5-HT2B agonist was available until the potent and selective 5-HT2B activity of 6-APB was discovered in 2012. Highly selective 5-HT2C antagonists are available however, and so a combination of BW-723C86 with a selective 5-HT2C antagonist allows 5-HT2B mediated responses to be studied in isolation.

EuroPsy

The EuroPsy is a European standard of education and training that enables individual psychologists to be recognised as having a European-level qualification in psychology. It is based on six-years of education and training in psychology, including a year of supervised practice. EuroPsy was developed in order to set a quality benchmark of education and practice in psychology, and therefore to protect the public, and to improve mobility for psychologists between countries in Europe. EuroPsy is based on EuroPsyT “A framework for education and training of psychologists in Europe” which was accepted by the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) in 2001.
Psychologists reaching the EuroPsy standard are recorded in the Register of European Psychologists, which distinguishes three broad professional contexts (and a fourth category for those who do not fit the others): education, clinical & health, organisation & work.
The EuroPsy completed piloting in late 2008 (in Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) and will be launched in July 2009 at the EFPA General Assembly in Oslo, which takes place after the European Congress of Psychology.

Laurence Gomme

Sir (George) Laurence Gomme, FSA (December 18, 1853–February 23, 1916) was a public servant and leading British folklorist. He helped found both the Victoria County History and the Folklore Society. He also had an interest in old buildings and persuaded the London County Council to take up the blue plaque commemorative scheme.
Life.
Gomme was born in the London district of Stepney, the second of ten children of William Laurence Gomme (1828–1887), an engineer, and his wife Mary (1831–1921). He attended the City of London School to the age of sixteen, when he started work, first with a railway company, then with the Fulham board of works, finally, in 1873, with the Metropolitan Board of Works: he remained with it and its successor, the London County Council, until his retirement in 1914. His position as statistical officer, from 1893, and then as clerk to the council, from 1900, gave him a major role in policy and administration.
His interests included folklore and history. The former he shared with his wife Alice Bertha Gomme, born Alice Merck (1853–1938), whom he married on March 31, 1875. The couple had seven sons, including Arthur Allan Gomme, a librarian and historian of technology, and Arnold Wycombe Gomme, a noted classical scholar. Both Gomme and his wife were founder members of the Folklore Society in 1878; and Gomme went on to be its honorary secretary, director and president. Gomme wrote many books and articles on folklore, including "Primitive Folk Moots" (1880), "Folklore Relics of Early Village Life" (1883), "Ethnology in Folklore" (1892) and "Folklore as a Historical Science" (1908). His work in the field is now generally regarded as too dependent on a survivals theory, which tried to trace folk customs back to earlier stages of civilisation; but it retains value as a collection. His historical writings show a particular interest in the history of London, in books such as "The Making of London" (1912). Alongside his own works, his contribution to history includes the "Victoria County History" project, of which he was one of the founders. He also had a passion for old buildings and used his council position to protect threatened buildings and to advance the Survey of London, for which he also contributed historical material. Another overlap of his historical and professional interests was the blue plaque commemorative scheme, which he persuaded the council to take on in 1901: the 800th blue plaque to be awarded would later mark his own London residence in 24 Dorset Square. 
He was knighted in 1911. Not long afterwards, in 1914, ill health caused him to retire early; and he died of pernicious anemia on February 23, 1916 at his country home in Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire.

Mount Porndon

Mount Porndon is a 278 metre high volcano located 13 kilometres southeast of Camperdown in western Victoria, Australia. 
Mount Porndon is on private land. There is a fire tower on the summit. It is a composite volcano of scoria resting on lava disc and tuff. The area around Mount Porndon is known as the stony rises. Early settlers use the abundance of rock to build stone fences.
Description.
Mount Porndon is the central higher part of a volcanic complex including lava flows, tuff deposits and scoria cones and craters. The site covers a broad area including the major elements of volcanic sequence. A number of basalt lava flows extend from Mount Porndon forming rough stony rises, some of which reach Lake Corangamite. The younger of these flows formed an irregular lava disc roughly 3 km in diameter with a distinct and almost continuous perimeter in places forming a rocky wall 10 to 15 meters high. The stony rise flows have been dated at 300,000 years.
Overlying the lava disc is a thin layer of tuff. The main hills and cones were built from scoria eruptions which succeeded the phreatomagmatic stage after groundwater had been depleted. Small lava flows from some vents beneath the scoria are the last eruptive activity. The central cone of Mount Porndon has a crater 15 m deep and open to the west.

Dundee cake

Dundee cake is a famous traditional Scottish fruit cake with a rich flavour.
The cake is often made with currants, sultanas and almonds; sometimes, fruit peel may be added to it. The cake originated in nineteenth-century Scotland, and was originally made as a mass-produced cake by the marmalade company called Keiller's. Keiller's marmalade company first produced the cake commercially and have been claimed to be the originators of the term "Dundee cake". However, similar fruit cakes were produced across Scotland. A popular story is that Mary Queen of Scots did not like cherries in her cakes, so the cake was first made for her, as a fruit cake that used almonds and not cherries. The top of the cake is typically decorated with concentric circles of almonds. Today, the cakes are often sold in supermarkets throughout the United Kingdom.

Alexander Cannon (psychiatrist)

Alexander Cannon (1896–1963) was a British psychiatrist, occultist, hypnotist and author. He became well known in the 1930s for his occult writings, and more recently for his alleged influence on King Edward VIII shortly before his abdication.
Early life and career.
He was born in Leeds, England, and educated at Leeds, London, Vienna, Hong Kong, and several other universities, eventually receiving both an M.D. and Ph.D. Later he trained in various Eastern spiritual disciplines, acquiring or claiming such titles as "Kushog Yogi of Northern Thibet" and "Master-The-Fifth of the Great White Lodge of the Himalayas." 
In Hong Kong in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he became vice president of the Hong Kong Medical Society, medical officer in charge of prisons, head of the Department of Morbid Anatomy at the University of Hong Kong, and psychiatrist and medical jurist to the High Court of Justice. He also served as British Consul and Port Medical Officer in Canton (Guangzhou). He studied occultism and yoga and travelled in India, China and Tibet. In his book "The Invisible Influence" (1933), he claimed that during his travels he was levitated over a chasm in Tibet, together with his porters and luggage. The book was structured as a conversation between Cannon and a series of mystics, yogis, and other sages, and includes anecdotes of crystal gazing, levitation, hypnotism, distant-touching, and other supposed phenomena.
After his return to England, Cannon served as psychiatrist and research scientist at Colney Hatch Mental Hospital. After learning of his book, London County Council dismissed him on the grounds that he was unfit to practice in charge of a mental hospital, but he was reinstated after bringing action for wrongful dismissal. He then set up in private practice as a consultant in Harley Street, London, where he used hypnotherapy and psychic mediums in diagnosis. He became well known for prescribing exotic remedies such as electrotherapy and Tibetan hypnosis techniques as treatments for stress, alcoholism, sex and confidence problems.
Influence on King Edward VIII.
According to recent research, during this period King Edward VIII consulted Cannon, and received hypnotic treatment from him for a drink problem. This was drawn to the attention of Dr Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Two days before the King's abdication in December 1936, Lang wrote to another Harley Street doctor, William Brown, that he had been "informed by a credible person that a certain Dr Cannon... has been recently attending the King... Would you kindly tell me whether you think this Dr Cannon is a really trustworthy person? He seems from the accounts I have received to be one who encourages somewhat dangerous methods of treatment." Archived letters suggest that it was believed that Cannon—then known as "the Yorkshire Yogi"—was having an adverse influence on the King. Piers Compton, former literary editor of the Catholic newspaper "The Universe", stated that he had been told that King Edward was in the grip of "the leader of black magic in England", who had been called in to treat him for drunkenness. However, Edward's biographer Philip Ziegler considered it more likely that the treatment may have been for a sexual problem.
Later life.
By the late 1930s, Cannon's London clinic, where he billed himself as "His Excellency Sir Dr Alexander Cannon", had become highly lucrative. He continued to work and publish. In 1938, in his book "Sleeping Through Space", he gave directions for bringing the dead back to life: "a severe kick with the knee between the shoulder blades" at the same time shouting in [the left ear "Oye," "Oye," "Oye." He added: "It is rarely necessary to repeat the operation before life is again resumed, but this can be repeated up to seven times in long-standing cases."
In 1939 Cannon left London and established the Isle of Man Clinic for Nervous Diseases. On the Isle of Man, he was a friend of Captain George Drummond, a Nazi sympathiser who had entertained Edward VIII before he became king and was interned in his mansion on his island during the war. Cannon was himself suspected of being a Nazi sympathiser and German spy, his telephone conversations with Drummond were recorded by MI5, and he was forced out of his home. However, MI5 concluded that he was a "quack and compulsive liar" rather than a spy. 
When the war ended, Cannon began to produce live magic shows using two assistants, Joyce and Rhonda Deronda (born Joyce and Eleanor Robson), who helped with performances. One act involved putting Rhonda into a hypnotic trance to diagnose physical and psychological problems, as she glared at the patient. Some of his apparently magical techniques were exposed in 1952 by David Norris. 
Cannon was a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and The Magic Circle, and was Chairman of the Magicians of Mann. He created 'The Enchanted Hall', a small theatre at his home, Laureston Mansion House in Douglas. A number of tape recordings made by Cannon are on loan to the Manx Museum and National Trust. 
He also claimed to have invented the lie detector and black light. He died in March, 1963, on the Isle of Man.

Public transport in Bratislava

Public transport in Bratislava is the biggest public transport network in Slovakia. It is managed by Dopravný podnik Bratislava, a city-owned company. The transport system is known as "Mestská hromadná doprava" (MHD, Municipal Mass Transit). The history of public transportation in Bratislava began in 1895, with the opening of the first tram route. Public transport in Bratislava is paid and travellers are obliged to buy their tickets before entering the vehicle. Revenue from tickets cover approximately 40% of expenses, 60% is paid by city.
History.
At the end of the 19th century, Bratislava (then Pressburg/Pozsony) was still suffering after losing the status as the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary. Now being a provincial city of political and economical mid-importance its development lagged behind its European neighbours. The main means of transport at this time was horse-driven and later steam-powered railways.
In the year 1868, omnibuses appeared in the city, but they could not meet the demands for transport at their chosen routes.
On 23 March 1881 an engineer from Vienna, Nicolaus Markovits, submitted the project documentation for a city horse-driven railway in Bratislava to the directorship of King's Hungarian state railways. Its path was from the Danube riverbank through the city to the Austrian state railway station. It was supposed to be connected to the Bratislava – Trnava wagonway, belonging to the King's Hungarian state railways.
In the 1990s, transport jams became a routine occurrence in Bratislava, affecting public transport vehicles which became stuck at places like Patrónka or Prístavný most. A major contributing factor was the lack of an inner circle, which today consists of parts of motorways D1 and D2 in Bratislava. While its two crucial points, bridges over river Danube, Prístavný most and Lafranconi bridge partially opened in 1983 and 1990 respectively, it was not until 2002 that Prievoz viaduct on motorway D1 opened, the D1 part Viedenská – Prístavný most was finished in 2005 and the Sitina Tunnel finished the ring in 2007.
Description.
The system uses three main types of vehicles: buses, trams and trolleybuses. Buses cover almost the entire city and go to the most remote boroughs and areas, with 70 daily routes, 20 night routes and other routes on certain occasions.
Trams.
Today, trams (streetcars) cover heavily-used commuter routes, except for the biggest borough, Petržalka. Trams in Bratislava have 1 000 mm gauge (so called metre gauge) with one-way current of 600 V (originally 550 V). All trams driving in the city since 1895 are electric; there were never any horse-driven or steam-powered trams in Bratislava. The city's tram network belongs among the oldest continually operated tram systems that is still functional to this day. The length of tram rails in the city is . There are 152 tram stops served by 8 lines, numbered 2 to 9. The maximum speed for trams in Bratislava is restricted by an internal order to 50 km/h, although this speed is lower in some parts of the network.
Trolleybuses.
Today, trolleybuses serve as a complementary means of transport in the Slovak capital, with 13 routes. The first trolleybus service in Bratislava was established July 19, 1909, being the second oldest such system in the country after the one in High Tatras. This first line was headed from the Roth bullet factory on Pražská Street to Vydrica Valley. Its total length was and it was served by seven vehicles. Due to technical and financial difficulties, the service on this line was terminated after six years, in 1915. In the period between the world wars, Bratislava was left without a trolleybus system. First talks about its restoration emerged only right before the Second World War.
Trolleybuses returned to the city on 31 July 1941. Line M connected Slovak National Theatre and the Bratislava hlavná stanica. In 1951, the first Škoda 7Tr trolleybuses appeared. In 1953, trolleybuses reached Trnavské mýto, two years later Šafárikovo námestie. Most of the current trolleybus network infrastructure was built before 1960. Afterwards, buses started to be preferred in Bratislava. Many trolleybus lines were shortened or cancelled altogether. After the 1970s energy crisis, the importance of trolleybuses increased somewhat. New lines were built and new vehicles were bought. Since 1982, the iconic Škoda 14Tr appeared in the city. Between 1960 and 1990 there were approximately 10 lines (No. 210 – No. 220).
During the 1990s, Škoda 15Tr trolleybuses appeared, and replaced the Škoda Sanos vehicles. In 1999, a new line to "Národný ústav srdcových chorôb" (NÚSCH) and "Národný onkologický ústav" was opened. The last line to date was built in 2006 from Molecova to Kuklovská in Dlhé diely. This line is not connected to the rest of the city network and it is being serviced by Škoda 25Tr trolleybuses with hybrid electric-diesel engines.
Ticketing.
Since 2002, Bratislava is divided into three zones (two from 2000 until 2002; in Slovak "tarifné pásmo"). Zones only affects travelcards, one-time tickets are valid on all services irrespective of route.
Availability of travelcards based on zone validity was/is following:
No travelcards are available for zone 3, since this is located out of Bratislava borders and have different sources of financing. As of 1 August 2011, all travelcards will be sold valid for both zone 1 and 2, however, zones will remain to legally exist since they are needed for travelcards purchased on or before 31 of July 2011. Zone-based tickets are also planned to be reintroduced once Bratislavská integrovaná doprava, this time only affecting passengers traveling from other village or town and using one-time ticket. Special fares apply to routes 801 (to Rajka, Hungary) and 901 (to Hainburg, Austria). 801 accepts the standard fare as long as the passenger doesn't leave Bratislava, 901 does not accept domestic passengers and therefore does not accept standard fare on any part of its route.
Tickets and travelcards for up to 7 days are sold only in some newsstands, railway stations and other partners, there are also ticket vending machines. All tickets and travelcards are sold at DPB offices. Drivers do not sell tickes (except international lines 801 and 901). There is special fare for night services, however, travelcards will be accepted after 1 August 2011 (until 31 July they are only accepted with night surcharge). Tickets for 70 minutes or 24 hours can be bought via SMS (Slovak mobile operators only), travelcards for 30, 90 or 365 days can be bought online at www.dpb.sk if customer owns RFID card issued by DPB or ZSSK or ISIC card with RFID chip personalized to use in DPB. There is extra charge for 70 minutes ticket bought via SMS, no extra is charged for SMS ticket for 24 hours and travelcards bought over the Internet.
Drivers usually do not check tickets (although they are allowed to do so based on their decision), tickets are checked randomly by ticket inspectors (). The penalty for travelling without valid ticket between 2009 and July 2011 is 50 EUR (lowered to 40 EUR when paid within 5 workdays). In 2007, Dopravný podnik Bratislava collected 55 million Slovak crowns per year on fees collected from "black travelers".
Since most of the funds needed to operate the public transport system in Bratislava come from taxes, coupled with the fact that the cost of the ticket system itself is substantial, there have been proposals from economics experts to abolish the ticket system altogether and cover the rest with taxes and advertisement income. The most well-known of these proposals comes from Richard Sulík, current leader of the political party Freedom and Solidarity. He estimated the yearly sum needed from added taxation to 400 million Slovak crowns that he proposed to obtain by raising the real estate tax by 30%. At least one Mayor of Bratislava electoral candidate ran on a platform of providing public transport for free based on the concept of Sulík.
A 10% discount on travelcards for 30 or more days is offered to owners of Bratislavská mestská karta – Maestro PayPass card issued only to residents of Bratislava. Bratislavská mestská karta is also used to hold travelcard on its RFID chip - since there is no photo on it, passenger is required to present his ID with card to verify that he is owner of travelcard.
Bratislava integrated transport (BID).
Bratislava Integrated Transport ("Bratislavská integrovaná doprava") is planned transportation system linking trains, suburban buses and intra-city transportation. All these modes should accept same tickets (based on zone validity) and also should be more connected (for example, suburban buses would wait few minutes for delayed trains so passengers can change). One of ideas is to move people from buses to trains by providing better connecting buses to trains, but BID also aims to get people from cars and lower congestion. Project is heavy delayed after failing to launch in March 2008, in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
At this moment, several project are or were running as testing phase of BID:
- Passengers with travelcards for 30 or more days can pay surcharge of 1,66 EUR per month (0,83 EUR for passengers with discounted tickets) which allows them to ride trains within city borders of Bratislava without any limits. In addition, these customers can use suburban buses operated by Slovak Lines Regio between stops "Bratislava, Autobusová stanica Mlynské nivy" (central bus station), "Bratislava, Záhorská Bystrica, Krče" and all intermediate stops.
- Route 630 to Chorvátsky Grob is example of typical BID line: It has number, share fares with intra-city transportation (although in slightly different way than in final project of BID) and doesn't run to city centre, but only to first large terminal in Bratislava where changes to other modes of transportation (trams and buses) are available. In addition, it terminates next to large shopping center. These services are donated by Chorvátsky Grob.
- In past, train service were running between Bratislava-Predmestie and Bratislava-Východné stations. Trains had line number 155 and accepted all intra-city transportation tickets. Service was originally launched at 8 September 2006 as replacement for buses due to renovation of railway crossing. It was partly donated by ŽSR (Železnice Slovenskej republiky, owner of infrastructure) by not charging ZSSK (train operator) for using railway and stations as compensation for blocking buses from operation between Vychodne and trams Raca. All other expenses were covered by DPB which also kept whole fare incomes. After completion of works and reintroducing buses between Vychodne and Raca, service continued to operate (without donation from ŽSR), however they were reduced to peak times. While these trains were popular, service was terminated and restored few times due to financing issues. Route does not operate since 2 April 2007, but boroughs of Raca, Vajnory still demands its restoration. There are also proposals to extend line to city center, while Vrakuňa borough demanded extension to station Podunajské Biskupice. These plans are unlikely to be applied in near future due to high charge for using railways, which is one of highest in Europe.

Velocette MSS

The Velocette MSS is a motorcycle made by Velocette. It was fast, reliable and economical but could not compete against a new range of British twin-cylinder motorcycles. Production ended in 1968.
Development.
It was launched in 1935 as a 500cc sports version. World War II halted production which did not resume until 1954. The new MSS was a much more modern machine with the same frame as the Velocette MAC and was fitted with sidecar lugs and had optional panniers to appeal to the touring market. Buyers started tuning the MSS for speed, however, and the factory responded by producing the sports Velocette Venom model. In 1955 a scrambles version was also produced.
Racing history.
Burt Munro from New Zealand, featured in the film "The World's Fastest Indian" raced a heavily modified 1936 Velocette MSS. Racing preparation included making special pistons, changing the frame and increasing engine capacity to 650 cc. His top speed record on this motorcycle was with a 1/4 mile time of 12.31 seconds.

Rinku Singh

Rinku Singh (born August 8, 1988 in Lucknow, India) is a left-handed baseball pitcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization.
Early Life in Bhadohi.
Singh's family grew up in poverty; his father, a truck driver for 35 years, earned roughly $25 per week. Of the family's seven children, two of the four boys serve in the Indian military. Another earned a scholarship to a sports school. A former javelin thrower and cricket player, Singh was accepted to a sports school but did not attend, and was considered lazy by his family and village of Holepur, India.
"Million Dollar Arm".
In early 2008, Singh entered an Indian reality television show, "The Million Dollar Arm". The contest was created by American sports agent J.B. Bernstein to find the individual in the country who could throw the fastest and most accurate baseball. Having never heard of baseball before, Singh won the contest out of over 37,000 participants after throwing 88 miles per hour. The grand prize for the contest was $100,000.
After winning the contest, Singh and runner-up Dinesh Patel travelled to Los Angeles where they trained with University of Southern California pitching coach Tom House, who trained pitchers such as Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson. On their first day in the United States the two attended their first baseball game at Southern California. They continued to learn the game from House and Bernstein, as well as learning English.
Professional Baseball Career.
Singh, along with Patel, tried out in front of scouts from 20 Major League Baseball teams in November 2008, and Singh's pitches reached . Reports from Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Joe Ferrone and Sean Campbell led to general manager Neal Huntington signing both to contracts with the organization. With the deal, the pair became the first Indians to sign American major league baseball contracts. The total signing bonus for the two was $8,000. After training, the two returned to visit their families in India before entering Pirates training camp in Bradenton, Florida.
Singh, along with Dinesh Patel, began the 2009 baseball season with the Pirates' Gulf Coast League affiliate.
The 2009 GCL Pirates had nine players each from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, with the United States a distant third at six. There were the two highly publicized, pioneering Indian pitchers, Singh and Dinesh Patel, a second baseman named Henry Henry from Colombia, two players from Puerto Rico, and one each from Mexico, Panama, Australia, Canada and one of the first three players ever signed out of South Africa, Gift Ngoepe, while one of the Americans, Chris Aure, is from Alaska. "We eat together in the cafeteria, but sometimes we try each other's foods," Ngoepe says. "I listen to the Indians' music when I go past their rooms, and they listen to my music from Africa. We tell each other stories about our home countries. We do everything together." "Everybody's the same here, like family," Venezuelan infielder Elevys Gonzalez says.
On July 4, 2009, Singh became the first Indian to appear in a professional baseball game in the US. He pitched the seventh inning, while Dinesh Patel pitched the eighth inning. On July 13, 2009, Singh became the first Indian-born pitcher to win a professional baseball game in America, striking out the only batter he faced. He finished the season with a 1-2 record and a 5.84 ERA in 11 games, allowing just one run on three hits in his final six appearances. Singh went 2-0 with a 2.61 ERA over 13 games with the Pirates GCL affiliate in 2010. At the end of August, Singh was promoted to the Pirates Class A Short-Season affiliate, the State College Spikes. Singh played for the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League for the competition's inaugural 2010-11 season, going 1-0 with a 3.94 ERA in 16 innings pitched.
Singh opened the 2011 season in the Dominican Summer League. Singh pitched well in eight games spread over the DSL, Gulf Coast League and New York-Penn League, then joined the West Virginia Power of the South Atlantic League in July 2011. Singh returned to the Australian Baseball League for the 2011-12 season with the Adelaide Bite. He made the World All-Star team for the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game.
Film.
Patel and Singh's story is the basis for the upcoming Walt Disney Pictures sports film, "Million Dollar Arm", where Singh will be portrayed by Suraj Sharma.
In 2009, Columbia Pictures purchased the screen rights to the story of Singh and Patel. The project stalled and eventually producers Joe Roth and Mark Ciardi set the film up at Walt Disney Pictures. Upon acquiring "Million Dollar Arm", Disney hired Tom McCarthy to write the film. Jon Hamm will play J.B. Bernstein.

Dinesh Patel (born May 8, 1989 in Lucknow, India) is a right-handed baseball pitcher who played in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Along with Rinku Singh, he was the first Indian national ever to sign a contract with a major American sports club. Neither Patel nor Singh, had ever thrown a baseball before besting over 37,000 competitors in "The Million Dollar Arm", an Indian reality television show designed to find new baseball talent.
Early life.
Due to extreme poverty and inability to meet the expenses of raising a child, Patel's parents had left him to be reared by his maternal grandmother in Khanpur (village). At the age of 14, he started visiting Sampurnanand Sports Stadium in Sigra (Varanasi) where he met athletes and trained himself to throw the javelin. In 2004, he was selected for a regional sports hostel in Lucknow. Patel won a gold medal in javelin throw at the National School Games at Pune in 2006.
Professional Baseball Career.
Patel, along with Singh, tried out in front of scouts from 20 Major League Baseball teams in November 2008.

He had a successful, yet brief, 2009 season for the Pirates, picking up a victory on August 13 (exactly one month after his countryman Singh got his first, and only, win of the year) and finishing with a 1-0 record and 1.42 ERA, allowing two runs (one earned) on six hits in 6.1 innings. Patel's 2010 season was less successful, with an 8.59 ERA in 7 innings, over nine games; he was released in December 2010.
After Baseball.
Patel taught school children baseball in Delhi for two days and in 2011, he helped his village boys prepare for the second season of the Million Dollar Arm talent hunt for about two months. He didn’t charge any money. When Patel returned to India he also went back to school because he dropped out of school when he got picked through Million Dollar Arm. In 2012, Patel said he was practicing javelin throw "seriously". Patel participated at the national athletics championship in Kolkata in 2011 and the Federation Cup athletics championship in April 2012. In 2012, Patel said, "My family's economical and emotional conditions have improved. I could renovate home in the village and my sister's wedding was arranged with the money that I sent home. My family gathered self esteem and respect in society. It is always good to see your near and dear ones happy.".

Debbie Yow

Deborah A. "Debbie" Yow (born September 1, 1950) is an American college sports administrator and former college basketball coach. She is currently the director of athletics at North Carolina State University, and formerly held the same position at the University of Maryland and Saint Louis University. She previously served as the head coach of the women's basketball teams of the University of Kentucky, Oral Roberts University, and the University of Florida.
Early life.
A native of Gibsonville, North Carolina, Yow attended East Carolina University. She then attended Elon University, where she played basketball and studied English. Yow married and later divorced Lynn Nance, a collegiate men's basketball coach. In 1983, Yow was re-married to Dr. William Bowden, a university administrator, while she was coaching at Oral Roberts University.
Women's basketball coach.
Yow coached women's basketball at the University of Kentucky and Oral Roberts University, and also served as the women's basketball coach at the University of Florida where she took these three previously unranked teams into the top 20 national rankings. On January 10, 1985, she and the Gators won Yow's 150th career victory. After that season, Yow accepted a promotion in Gator athletics as an administrator and fundraiser. She averaged 20 wins per season over eight years as a head coach.
Athletic director.
Saint Louis.
After coaching, Yow also served as an associate athletic director at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. Saint Louis University hired Yow as its athletic director in August 1990. The media reported a strained relationship between her and the men's basketball coach Rich Grawer, which Yow denied. She fired Grawer after a 5–23 season and hired Charlie Spoonhour as his replacement. Spoonhour won the Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award for leading Saint Louis to the NCAA Tournament in the 1993–94 season and received a pay raise and contract extension through 2000. Yow remained at Saint Louis University for four years, until hired to the same position at the University of Maryland in August 1994.
Maryland.
At Maryland, Yow became the first female athletic director at any Atlantic Coast Conference school. Under Yow, the Maryland athletics department balanced its annual budgets, which had not been done in the previous decade and the department's debt was reduced from $51 million to $5.6 million. From 1994 to 2010, the school's athletic teams captured twenty national championships. Seventeen were in women's sports: women's lacrosse (8), field hockey (4), competitive cheer (4), and women's basketball (1). Three championships were claimed by two men's teams. Maryland men's basketball secured the 2002 title and men's soccer captured the 2005 and 2008 College Cups. "U.S. News & World Report" and "Sports Illustrated" ranked the Maryland athletics program in the nation's top 20 during Yow's tenure. In 2008, her salary was $365,925.00 according to public records.
Yow reportedly had a rocky relationship with Maryland men's basketball coach Gary Williams. In January 2009, the basketball team struggled early in its season, which led to Williams publicly trading barbs about recruiting with associate athletic director Kathy Worthington. In February, Yow issued a statement of support for Williams. During the 2009 row, John Feinstein wrote in "The Washington Post", "Debbie Yow didn't hire Gary Williams. She can't take any credit for the program he built nor should she take any of the blame for its recent struggles." He added, "Does get along with Debbie Yow? No, everyone knows that..."
Barry Gossett, the number one donor to Maryland athletics summarized the progress in Maryland athletics during Yow's tenure, "She inherited a difficult situation when she came in as far the debt and a lot of programs that were under-performing. She was able to make some necessary changes in staff, and she has really put a new face on the athletic department. She accepted the challenge as the school improved its rankings across the board... She has done a great job." Head women's basketball coach Brenda Frese Championship coach in 2006 said, "I think the biggest strength for Debbie is that from top to bottom, she knows how to run a department and allows every unit and every coaching staff member to be successful." Football coach Ralph Friedgen called Yow's accomplishments as AD at Maryland, "unprecedented."
Yow said, "There are several things that I was really glad to get done toward the end of my tenture, and one of those was nominating coach Williams for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame..."
Mike Ashley observed, "Yow's sixteen years at the helm of the program represented the longest tenure for a Maryland athletic director since legendary Curley Byrd ran the program from 1915-1935 before coming university president."
North Carolina State.
On June 25, 2010, Yow accepted the job as athletic director at North Carolina State University. She was awarded a five-year contract with a $350,000 annual salary with a supplemental income of $100,000.
After the 2010-2011 basketball season, Sidney Lowe resigned as Wolfpack coach after failing to make the NCAA tournament in his five seasons as coach. In early April 2011, Yow hired former Alabama coach Mark Gottfried as the new coach. In his first season, Coach Gottfried led the Wolfpack back to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
On November 25, 2012, Tom O'Brien was terminated, and NC State was obligated to pay $1.2 million of non-state funds to O'Brien as his contract runs through the 2015 season. However, NC State ended up only having to pay O'Brien $200,000 after the buyout was renegotiated so he could become an assistant at Virginia.
On December 1, 2012, Dave Doeren was announced as the new head coach of the NC State Wolfpack football team, with an estimated total annual compensation package of $1.9 million. It was the seventh change of a head coach at NC State under Yow in a little over two years.
On May 31, 2013, NC State University was challenged by the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL over a scheduling conflict with the PNC arena. The school's basketball team, which shares the arena with the hockey team, whose parent company manages the arena and parking lot adjacent to Carter-Finley Stadium, held 129 dates for the 2013-2014 NCAA and NHL seasons, as is allowed in the facility-use contract, which needed to be cleared up the following day so the Hurricanes can turn in open dates to the NHL.
Personal life.
Her two sisters also have been employed in athletics. Kay Yow was head coach of the NC State women's basketball team, and Susan Yow is the current head coach of the Belmont Abbey Crusaders women's basketball team. Her cousin, Virgil Yow, served as head basketball coach at High Point University, where he allowed the first female to play on the men's team.

The Dixies were an Irish showband based in Cork city and which have performed and toured for over 40 years from its inception in 1954 until the late 1990s.
Formed in 1954 as "The Dixielanders" the band originally featured Joe McCarthy (drums), Sean Lucey (clarinet) and Theo Cahill (trombone). They soon changed the band's name to the Dixies and became one of the most popular Irish musical acts of the 1960s when showbands were the at their height in Ireland.
The band's line-up changed over the years but McCarthy, Lucey and Brendan O'Brien were among the longest serving. In 1964, the band signed with PYE Records. The band had their biggest hit in 1968 when their version of the Leapy Lee hit "Little Arrows" made No.1 in the Irish charts.
Brendan O'Brien and Joe Mac also formed a band, Stage Two, in the early 1970s. This was somewhat successful until O'Brien suffered a severe electric shock from a live microphone. The incident happened in The Stardust Ballroom, Grand Parade, Cork during a charity event in 1974. It left him with burns to his hands and caused severe thrombosis throughout his body.
The band finally went their own way in the late 1990s with the death of a number of members and others undertook solo careers.
For many years a sign with the legend "Welcome to Cork, Home of the Dixies" stood on the main N8 Dublin to Cork road on the outskirts of the city at Glanmire.

The Dutch House, Bristol

The Dutch House was a large timber-framed building situated at Nos 1 and 2, High St Bristol, England. It was a well-known local landmark until its destruction in 1940.
History.
The Dutch House (often given the prefix 'Old') was built as a private residence in 1676, and dominated the mediaeval crossroads of High St, Wine St, Broad St and Corn St in the heart of ancient Bristol.
The dominant part of the structure was No. 1 High St. This was of rectangular plan, two bays by one, and originally five stories tall; an attic storey was added later. This building had facades on both Wine St and High St. The Wine St façade was two bays wide and consisted of a square bay window to the full height of the original building (except the ground floor), with a flat façade to its right. The High St façade consisted of a bay window, narrower than that on the Wine St façade and with splayed sides, but similar in all other respects. Both facades were ornately carved.
The adjoining house at No.2 High St was incorporated into the premises at some point before 1860. This five-storey gabled house was considerably less ornate than No.1, consisting of full-width square bays to the first and second storeys, and a smaller square bay offset to the left on the third storey. The third storey bay was rebuilt at some point between 1847 and 1866 to make it symmetrical, and the façade of this building was changed by exposing and embellishing its frame to unify it with the rest of the building. 
The timber frame of the unified building was at some point reinforced with iron beams.
In 1810 the Dutch House became the Castle Bank, and subsequently had a succession of retail and office uses. By 1866, under the auspices of hatter Mr T.W.Tilly, it had gained fake battlements with cannon, a weather vane, a flagpole and a Grenadier Guardsman sign (now in the care of the City Museum). It seems likely that Mr Tilly was also responsible for altering the façade of No.2. 
The battlements, incongruous on a timber-framed building, had been removed by 1917.
In the early 1900s traffic engineers planned to demolish the building to ease the flow of traffic between High St and Wine St. These plans were dropped after the Lord Mayor used his casting vote against them, however the lower storey was cut back in 1908 to accommodate the pavement so that the junction could be eased.
The shop's final occupier was the Irish Linen and Hosiery Association.
The building was a well -loved landmark of the city and featured in pre-war guide books and in many photographs and postcards.
The name.
The name "The Dutch House" was used from about 1860, when T W Tilly took over the shop. It is thought that he may have given the building the name, and started the story that its timber frame was constructed in Holland and then brought over and assembled in England.
This story does not bear close scrutiny. Both of the original houses, though different in style, reflect the local vernacular; for example the High St facade of No.1 has many similarities with the surviving Llandoger Trow. 
Some of Bristol’s timber-framed buildings were however constructed in part from recycled ship’s timbers, so it is not completely out of the question that some of the timber frame may have come from a Dutch ship.
Destruction.
On Sunday, 24 November 1940 the Dutch House was badly damaged in an air raid which destroyed much of Bristol's pre-war shopping area. Photographs taken immediately after the raid show that much of the fabric of the building was intact and could possibly have been saved had there been a will to do so. However, on 27 November 1940 an army demolition team completed the destruction. According to an eye-witness account, the demolition took considerable effort.
The site where the building stood is now occupied by a link road connecting Broad Street to the short dual carriageway between High St and Wine St.

Valaji

Valaji or Valachi is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is a pentatonic scale ("audava" or "owdava" rāgam, which means "of 5"). It is a "janya" rāgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven "swaras" (musical notes). The equivalent of "Valaji" in Hindustani music is "Kalāvati".
Structure and Lakshana.
"Valaji" is a symmetric rāgam that does not contain "rishabham" or "madhyamam". It is a pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" rāgam in Carnatic music classification). Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
"Valaji" is considered a "janya" rāgam of "Chakravakam", the 16th "Melakarta" rāgam, though it can be derived from other melakarta rāgams, "Harikambhoji", "Vagadheeswari", "Ramapriya", "Vachaspati" or "Nasikabhooshani", by dropping both "rishabham" and "madhyamam". Since "Chakravakam" is lowest in ordinal number among these 6 "melakarta" scales, "Valaji" is associated with it.
Popular compositions.
"Valaji" is a pleasing scale, but has only a few compositions in classical music. It has been used to score film music as well. Here are some popular "kritis" composed in "Valaji".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Graha bhedam".
"Valaji's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields another pentatonic rāgam "Abhogi". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For more details and illustration of this concept refer "Graha bhedam on Abhogi".

English 31

English 31 is a voluntary association in France ("Association loi 1901") working in partnership with the "Éducation Nationale" and supported by its principal industrial partner, Airbus. It offers the teaching of English within the French school system to pupils who are fluent English speakers. Four to six hours of lessons a week are given by native English-speaking teachers with British teaching qualifications. The main aims are to develop reading and writing skills and an understanding of English-speaking culture.
Primary level education is offered at the École Primaire Paul Bert in Colomiers. Pupils from the age of five ("grande section") have two and a half hours per week. Those aged six to ten ("CP" to "CM2") have four hours weekly, working on reading and writing skills. 
Secondary education is organised in partnership with the Collège and Lycée Victor Hugo. Pupils at the collège have six hours a week of English literature and history in English. Pupils at the Lycée Victor Hugo prepare for the International Baccalauréat.
About.
The "Section Internationale" organises and delivers English lessons to children whose mother tongue is English, or who have proven spoken and written fluency in the language, and who are integrated into the French school system.
The broad aim is to maintain a child's proficiency in English while she or he progresses through the French educational system. The bilingual system also enables a pupil to re-integrate into an English-speaking educational system whenever necessary and at whatever level, or to continue within the French educational system up to university level.
Organisation.
The Section Internationale operates in the following schools, all in Colomiers:
At Nursery and Primary levels, pupils do not have to be registered full-time at Paul Bert. They may attend their local maternelle class or local elementary school, and come once per week to Paul Bert for their English lessons. A programme of English integrated into the weekly programme at Paul Bert exists at Primary level only. At secondary level, pupils must be registered full-time in the appropriate school in which English lessons are organised.
The lessons.
At primary level, in the integrated programme, four hours of lessons are provided per week, incorporated into the standard French Primary timetable (24 hours per week). In the weekly programme 2 ½ hours of English are provided per week on Wednesday afternoon. At collège level, six hours of lessons are provided per week, incorporated into the standard French collège timetable, taking place when French pupils learn English as a foreign language. At lycée level four hours of English are provided per week in Seconde and Première, incorporated into the standard French lycée timetable. This rises to six hours in Terminale if students decide to take the "Option Internationale du Baccalauréat" (OIB) in English.
French Beginners' class.
For children who do not speak French, a French beginners' class exists at primary school level only. This is known as the CLIN ("Classe d'initiation à langue française"). The class is run by the local education authority and was established at Paul Bert at the request of the British Section. It is the only class of its kind in the area. Newly arrived non-French-speaking pupils are placed in a normal class according to age, but are withdrawn from their class at moments during the week to attend lessons in the CLIN. The number of hours spent in the CLIN will depend upon the age and linguistic ability of the child. The process of integration follows a two-year programme.
Schools.
Lycée Victor Hugo.
The lycèe Victor Hugo, a state Lycée Polyvalent International opened in September 1984 and serves the community of Colomiers, a town of 34,000 inhabitants on the western edge of Toulouse. The school has a total of 2,000 pupils from the ages of fifteen to eighteen.
Among the pupils are English, American and German children whose parents work in the area. Many English-speaking parents are employed by Airbus; others work for local companies such as Honeywell, Thales, Alcatel and Siemens.
The German pupils attend their own school within the lycée, having all lessons in their mother tongue and eventually taking the Abitur, the German university entrance examination.
The English-speaking pupils are completely integrated into the French educational system and take the French Baccalauréat (see OIB Section). In order that they develop complete fluency in the language, English-speaking pupils have special lessons given by teachers of the Section Internationale of the lycée while their French colleagues have lessons in English as a foreign language.
Collége Victor Hugo.
Housed within the Lycée building, this "Collège d'Enseignement Secondaire" teaches pupils for the first four years of their secondary education. It is a small collège, having only 200 pupils in all. It specialises in English and German teaching. Section Internationale pupils receive six hours of English tuition per week.
For the rest of their programme they are taught by French teachers in classes of 27 with their French colleagues. The French, German and British teaching staff work in close co-operation, and trilingual programmes of study for all pupils also form part of the international education offered in this establishment. The programme is especially appropriate for pupils with an international bilingual background in education. At the end of the four-year cycle pupils transfer into the lycée.
The Programmes.
The programme of work is similar to that of schools in England and based upon the English National Curriculum until the end of Key Stage Four. All English-speaking pupils may join the scheme however, regardless of nationality. At the age of fifteen/sixteen, pupils are entered for English GCSE which are organised by the Edexcel (University of London). These qualifications provide proof of the successful candidate’s proficiency in English. In the final two years of the lycée, Section Internationale students follow the English and history/Geography programmes of the Option Internationale du Baccalauréat (OIB), which are jointly run by the Section Internationale’s sponsors and Education Nationale, the French national education authority.
Option Internationale Baccalauréat.
Not to be confused with the "Baccalauréat International
" (based in Switzerland), the OIB ("Option Internationale au Baccalauréat") is organised by the French "Education Nationale" and offers formal recognition at Baccalauréat level of the bilingual competence of the pupils. The OIB examination is administered via a 1901 Association whose members are the various Sections Internationales that offer the OIB as part of their curriculum. This Association is called ASIBA ("Association de Sections Internationales Britanniques et Anglophones").
Conditions of Entry.
Entry into the “Section Internationale – Britannique” at Collège and Lycée Victor Hugo rests with the school authorities. However, pupils who are selected by the school to follow the International (British) programme must belong to English 31. English 31's participation in the selection process is limited to an assessment of a pupil's ability to follow the programme.
Applications are submitted to Victor Hugo by 14 April. To judge ability in English, all applicants (for Victor Hugo and Sainte Therèse)are required to sit an entry test.
The test takes place in the Lycée/Collège Victor Hugo during May. The test is a two-hour test comprising a piece of extended writing (i.e. an essay) and a comprehension test.
Candidates do not have to be British or native English speakers but they have to have a level of spoken and written English which will allow them to benefit from the English programme delivered by the Section. Pupils whose mother tongue is not English are tested following application to the section. If they are considered to have the level required they will be admitted to the section subject to the availability of places within the appropriate English class and to the availability of places within the appropriate French class for those candidates applying for a full-time place at Paul Bert or Victor Hugo. 
Pupils are expected to make progress in English during the year. Assessment of progress is based upon results of standardised tests taken in March/April and upon the reports of the class teachers. If a pupil has not made satisfactory progress, parents will be requested to withdraw their child from the programme at the end of the school year. Weekly homework is set for the pupils and this is a compulsory part of the programme. Pupils who frequently fail to produce homework will be considered as not making satisfactory progress.

Paul Camille von Denis

Paul Camille Denis, later von Denis, (28 June 1796 – 3 September 1872) was an engineer, railway pioneer and participant in the Hambach Festival, the German political protest of 1832.
Denis was at Château des Saales in Montier-en-Der, in the Département of Haute-Marne, France. He grew up as a child of the Mainz city councillor, Peter Denis, and attended the Lyceum Louis le Grand in Paris. In 1814 and 1815 he studied at the École Polytechnique in Paris. After the conclusion of his studies he returned to the Palatinate to his father who had since settled at Neustadt.
Initially employed as a trainee by the Bavarian state - to which the Palatinate then belonged - from 3 March 1816 he worked as a construction overseer ("Baukondukteur") in Germersheim. In 1822 he became an engineering inspector at Speyer and, in 1826, was promoted to engineer, first class, at Zweibrücken. 
Here he came into close contact with the democratic opposition organised by Friedrich Schüler, Johann Georg August Wirth, Joseph Savoye and Ferdinand Geib. In a report from the state police to the Bavarian king he was described - incorrectly - as their boyhood friend and fellow student. The German Press and Fatherland Union ("Deutscher Preß- und Vaterlandsverein") of democrats was founded in 1832, in which the wealthy Paul Camille Denis was a major financial contributor. In his personal files for that year his wealth was stated at 300,000 Gulden. When in August 1832 the secretary of the "Preß- und Vaterlandsverein", Georg Eifler, was arrested, Paul Camille Denis put up 10,000 Gulden as bail. 
As a member of the Palatine state parliament he took part in the Hambach Festival. As a result the Bavarian General Commissioner, Field Marshal Carl Philipp von Wrede, transferred him to Rosenheim for exceeding his authority. On 1 August 1832 Paul Camille Denis signed the Kaiserslautern Protest against the Federal resolution of 28 June. This led to a charge of "denigration of the most high state authorities". Denis reacted to the charge and threatened transfer to the Isar area by taking unpaid leave on 7 November 1832 for a "technical training trip" to England and America.
On his return he built the first German railway line, the Bavarian Ludwig Railway between Nuremberg and Fürth which opened in 1835. This was followed by the construction of the Taunus Railway from Frankfurt am Main to Wiesbaden, opened in 1839-1840, and the Palatine Ludwig Railway in 1844–1849. Recognised as an expert in railway building he later took responsibility for the construction of the Palatine Maximilian Railway, the Homburg – Zweibrücken railway (1857), later part of the "Schwarzbachtalbahn (Pfalz)" and the "Bliestalbahn", as well as the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company from 1856 to 1861.
Now highly respected, he received the Knight's Cross of Philip the Magnanimous in 1852 from Grand Duke Ludwig III of Hesse and Rhine. In the same year he was raised to the peerage by the Bavarian king, Maximilian II, becoming Paul Camille "von" Denis.
In 1865 Paul Camille von Denis became the head of the planning commission for the Rhine bridge on the Mannheim–Ludwigshafen railway and shortly thereafter, in 1866, went into retirement of his own volition. He died in Bad Dürkheim and was buried in the family grave at the Helenen cemetery in Strasbourg.

Judith E. Retchin

. 
Judith E. Retchin is a superior court judge in the District of Columbia.
Early life and career.
Retchin grew up in West Babylon, New York. In 1970, she graduated from West Babylon Senior High School. In 1974, she received her B.A. from George Washington University. In 1978, she received her J.D. from Catholic University of America's Comumbus School of Law. She worked as a trial attorney for the Civil Aeronautics Board and joined the Anti-Trust division of the US Department of Justice in 1980.
Prosecutor.
In 1983, she was an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
Retchin was the prosecutor in the drugs trial of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry. She also presided over a D.C. court challenge to the district's handgun ban in 2002.
Judge.
President George H. W. Bush appointed Retchin to the bench of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia as an 
associate judge serving from July 1992 to December 2010, when she became a senior judge.
Jonathan Magbie case.
Mary Scott bitterly criticized Retchin, a former prosecutor, calling Retchin a murderer and demanding she be removed from the bench. In 2004 she presided over the trial of Jonathan Magbie, a quadriplegic man who had been arrested for possession of marijuana. Retchin sentenced Magbie, a first-time offender, to ten days in jail despite the prosecution advising that they did not want to send him to jail. Magbie, who required a ventilator to breathe at night (something the jail did not have), subsequently died four days into his sentence after being transferred to a hospital. The case provoked a series of op-ed pieces in the "Washington Post" by columnist Colbert I. King.
