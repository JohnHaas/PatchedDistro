Marijo Dodik

Marijo Dodik (born 18 February 1974 in Sarajevo) is a Bosnian Croat football striker currently playing for NK Mladost Mali Otok.
Dodik started his career at Željezničar Sarajevo before being picked up by the Belgian side Mechelen in 1995, where he spent two seasons in the Jupiler League and scored 20 goals in a total of 84 appearances. He spent the next season in Turkey's Sakaryaspor, before moving to Croatia and joining Slaven Belupo in 1998.
He spent his most successful years at Slaven, establishing himself as a first-team regular and the club's most prolific Prva HNL scorer with 75 goals in 228 appearances in a total of eight seasons between 1998 and 2007. During his time at Slaven he also netted 14 goals in 22 appearances in club's European campaigns in the Intertoto Cup, and holds the record for most goals scored by a player in a single Prva HNL game, scoring an incredible 6 goals against Varteks on 21 October 2000 in a 7–1 win.
In 2007, Slaven refused to renew his contract so he moved to Cibalia where he netted 5 goals in 28 appearances, and in 2008 he went on to Inter Zaprešić,where he played until 2009 and his retirement from professional football. Dodik continued, however, playing for lower-tier Croatian and Slovenian teams, such as NK Zelina, NK Sabarija Subotica Podravska, NK Rudar Trbovlje and NK Mladost Mali Otok.
Dodik also earned four caps for Bosnia-Herzegovina and scored one goal in a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein in 2001.

Huntly College

Huntly College is a state owned school located in the Waikato, New Zealand town of Huntly.
The wide variety of programmes available recognises the differing abilities and needs of those attending the school, and ensures that all students have the chance to succeed at their own level and in their chosen field.
Huntly College is a relatively small school, with a current roll of approximately 350 students. The roll peaked in the early 1980s with student numbers at that time in excess of 800. This number was associated with the development of the Huntly Power Station and the operation of several state owned coal mines. By 1991 the roll had dropped to around 500 students, and has continued to decline. The relatively small nature of the current roll allows the school to offer small class sizes. The ages range from Year 9 - Year 13.
The area is still home to its original inhabitants, the Tainui people, to whom the Waikato River and Taupiri Mountain are sacred. Huntly College roll is presently 72% Maori. Camps, trips, extra curricular activities (drama, dance, kapa haka) and participation in a range of sports are both enjoyed and encouraged by all. Huntly College is close to two major New Zealand cities, Hamilton 35 km to the south and Auckland, NZ's largest city (population in excess of one million), is approximately 90 km north. The college is also less than one hours drive to either the West or East coasts and are ideally situated for commuters.
The schools motto "ma te pono ka watea" is a Maori translation of "the truth shall set you free".
Huntly College has a sisterhood school in South Korea attending visits regularly from both schools.
The current principal is Mr Tim Foy, assisted by deputy principals Mrs Rosemary Curle and Mr G van Burren.

Alay Valley

The Alay Valley () is a broad, dry valley running east-west across most of southern Osh Province, Kyrgyzstan. (From the Russian spelling, pronunciation should probably be 'alai' rather than 'alay'). It is about 180km east-west and about 40km north-south and 2500-3500m in altitude. The north side is the Alay Mountains which slope down to the Ferghana Valley. The south side is the Trans-Alay Range along the Tajikistan border, with Lenin Peak, (7134m). The western 40km or so is more hills than valley. On the east there is the low Tongmurun pass and then more valley leading to the Irkestam border crossing to China. 
The Kyzyl-Suu (West) ('red river', Kyzyl-Suu (East) flows from Irkestam to Kashgar) drains the valley, flowing westward on the north side. It exits through the Karamyk pass and a gorge into Tajikistan, where, under the name of the Vakhsh River it flows southwest into the Amu Darya. Highway A371 runs along the valley. The western pass to Tajikistan is closed to foreigners, but the eastern pass to China is open. A371 intersects the M41 highway north to Osh at Sary-Tash. To the south, M41 (Pamir Highway) becomes very rough and leads to the 4,280m Kyzyl-Art pass to Murgab in Tajikistan, a route that requires considerable preparation and paper work.
One traveler says "with no jobs, a harsh winter climate, and poor conditions for agriculture, life is immensely tough here, and most of the adult male population have left to seek work elsewhere." 
Places in or near the valley : Irkestam, Nura, Sary-Tash, Achiktash, Lenin Peak, Sary-Mogol, Kashkasuu, Bordobo, Karakavak, Dzhaman-Kyrchin, Kyzyleshme, Daroot-Korgon, Chak, Dzharbashy, Karamyk.

Willoughby D. Miller

Willoughby D. Miller (1853-1907) was an American dentist and the first oral microbiologist.
Biography.
Willoughy D. Miller was born in Alexandria, Ohio, and studied mathematics and physics at the University of Michigan. He traveled to Edinburgh to continue his studies, but financial problems caused him to move to Berlin where he was assisted by an American dentist Frank Abbot. Miller later married Abbot's daughter, Caroline. Becoming interested in his father-in-law's profession, Miller returned to the United States to train as a dentist at the Pennsylvania Dental College. This college merged with the University of Pennsylvania Department of Dentistry in 1878, and Miller was one of the members of the first graduating class in 1879. In his later years he was appointed Dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, but he died prior to assuming the position. After graduating, Miller returned to Berlin where he worked at first in Abbot's dental office and pursued his interest in the emerging science of microbiology.
Miller worked during the golden age of microbiology. Pasteur had discovered that bacteria can ferment sugars into lactic acid, and another Frenchman, Emil Magitot, showed that fermentation of sugars could dissolve teeth in the laboratory. Bacteria had been observed inside carious dentin by Underwood and Miles in 1881, and these researchers also proposed that bacterial acids were necessary for removing the mineral of teeth. It was against this background that Miller developed his oral microbiological research, soon becoming appointed Professor of Operative Dentistry at the University of Berlin. He worked in the microbiological laboratory of Robert Koch in Berlin and began numerous research projects that introduced modern biological principles to dentistry. In 1890 Miller formulated the chemo-parasitic theory of caries (tooth decay). This theory held that caries is caused by acids produced by oral bacteria following fermentation of sugars. The principles of the chemo-parasitic theory were bolstered by the descriptions of bacterial plaque on tooth surfaces independently by GV Black and by JL Williams in 1898. The biomass of plaque helps localize acids at the tooth surface and prevent dilution by saliva. Miller thought that no single species of bacteria could cause caries. This idea was supplanted in the 1950s when the role of "Streptococcus" "mutans" as a primary pathogen in caries was established. More recent examination of the microbiology of carious lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing and high throughput DNA sequencing indicates that communities of diverse organisms may be more important than individual species.
A second major contribution of WD Miller was the focal infection theory. Miller proposed that oral microorganisms or their products have a role in the development of a variety of diseases in sites removed from the oral cavity, including brain abscesses, pulmonary diseases and gastric problems. Although Miller did not suggest removal of teeth to eliminate the focus of infection and advocated treating and filling root canals, the complete removal of teeth became accepted practice. As this rarely produced a positive health benefit, the concept of oral focal infection gradually lost credibility. However, in the 1980s epidemiological studies began to indicate an association between periodontal disease and coronary artery disease, and associations with other serious systemic conditions soon followed. It is now generally accepted that oral bacteria can gain access systemically and cause disease at remote sites, or cause a general perturbation of the immune system leading to disease. Once again Miller's contributions have been shown to be correct.

James Leon Williams

James Leon Williams (April 18, 1852 – February 23, 1932) was an American prosthodontist and a pioneer dental histologist. He discovered dental plaque.
Biography.
In 1785, Leon's great-grandfather, Jacob Williams, a U.S. Army captain during the American Revolution, settled in Maine. A native of Massachusetts, he had a son, Richard, around the year 1794. On May 25, 1829, Richard had a son, Calvin, who would be Leon's father.
Sometime around 1879, J. Leon Williams began a two-year apprenticeship by a Dr. Roberts in North Vassalboro, Maine and later began practicing in the same town. Williams later passed examinations for the DDS degree at the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery and the equivalent LDS degree in Ireland. He joined the Maine Dental Society and used the opportunity to borrow their microscope to study the histology and pathology of tooth enamel.
In the early 1880s, common crown and bridge techniques were not well known or widespread. Williams sought to make information on these techniques available to all dentists through the pages of "The Dental Cosmos". In 1885, he embarked on a journey to improve the state of dental prostheses by designing more aesthetic artificial teeth that better matched the overall facial dimensions of the patient. He convinced an American artificial tooth manufacturer to take up his cause and produce his designs, on the condition that other dentists would embrace the new forms.
Williams also practiced dentistry in London and was one of the founders of the International Association for Dental Research.
He also was the author of "The Home and Haunts of Shakespeare" and had an interest in anthropology, including the Piltdown Man.

Maria Romero Meneses

Blessed María Romero Meneses, (b. 13 January 1902 - 7 July 1977) was a Salesian Sister and Social Apostle of Costa Rica, beatified by Pope John Paul II on the 14 April 2002.
Early life.
Born in Granada, Nicaragua as one of eight children from a middle-class family. Her father was a government minister. As she was found to have a talent for art and music, her parents so to it that she was trained on the piano and the violin. Later, she went on to become a student at a Salesian Sisters' school although in 1914, when she was 12, she was stricken by a year long bout of paralyzing rheumatic fever. Her recovery was deemed to be miraculous and led to a total confidence in Our Lady, Help of Christians and to the vision of her Salesian vocation.
The Salesian Sisters.
As a result of what she felt a Marian miracle, Maria joined the Marian Association, "Daughters of Mary" on the 8 December 1915. In 1920, at age 18, María joined the Institute of the Daughters of Mary, Help of Christians. Her spiritual director Fr Emilio Bottari gave her a prophetic recommendation: "Even though difficult moments will come and you will feel torn to pieces, be faithful and strong in your vocation". For María, these words sustained her for the rest of her religious life. On 6 January 1929 in Nicaragua, María made her final profession. Her writings indicate that she attempted to live the religious life interior life after the example of Don Bosco.
In 1931 she went to San José, Costa Rica, which became her second country and by 1933 she was teacher of music, art, and typing in a school for the daughters of the wealthy. Many of her students were won over to her way of life, and worked with her to help the poor and abandoned.
Charity.
Her ministry became focused on social development, helping the rich to see how they could help the poor. She set up recreational centers in 1945, food distribution centers in 1953, a school for poor girls in 1961, and a clinic in 1966. In 1973, she organized the construction of seven homes, which became the foundation of the village of Centro San Jose, a community where poor families could have decent homes.
She died of a heart attack on 7 July 1977, at age 75, in the Salesian house in Leon, Nicaragua where she had been sent for a rest. Her mortal remains were sent back to San José, Costa Rica, to be buried in the Salesian Chapel.
Veneration.
Sr Maria was venerated by Pope John Paul II on the 18 December 2000 which was then followed by her beatification on the 14 April 2002. Sr Maria Romero Meneses is the first blessed from Central America.

History of Pulicat

The History of Pulicat revolves around the early role of Pulicat as a seaport in one of the few natural harbours on the Coromandel Coast of South India. Pulicat is in Tamil Nadu at the mouth of Pulicat lake. Pulicat is notable as the headquarters of Dutch Coromandel between 1616 to 1690 and 1782 to 1825.
Summary.
Described as a grand port, starting with early 300 BCE history till the 15th century, Pulicat figured prominently as Tamil, Telugu and Muslim rulers fought to garner benefits from rich port revenues. 
Thereafter, some Arabs and Portuguese, followed by the Dutch and the British dominated the port till 1825. 
In the early 16th century, it had a multi-cultural population exceeding 50,000 and was the most important Indian port on the Bay of Bengal. 
Later, it was a fishing village and a health resort under British rule.
In the 17th century, Dutch agents in Pulicat operated a large Slave trade along the Coromandel Coast. Between 1621 and 1665 alone, over 38,000 slaves were shipped from central Coromandel ports, including Pulicat, Madras, Nagapatnam and Devanampatnam.
The history of Pulicat is traced to eight periods of Indian kings and foreign colonialists between the 3rd century BCE and the present post independence period.
Early history (300 BCE – 1279 CE).
[[Image:TabulaPeutingerianaIndo-Scythia.jpg|thumb|300px|c. 250 CE map of South India following cartography of Ptolemy shows "Tabrobane" (Sri Lanka), at the bottom, "Muziris" (Musiri town), "R. dunes" (Kaveri river) below "R. Palerif" (Palar river) and the "R. Ganges" (Ganges river).
Ancient Tamil Kingdoms.
From the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century XE, Pulicat was a northern outpost of the Ancient Tamil kingdoms of the Early Cholas, the Early Pandyan Kingdom and the Sangam Cheras.
In the 2nd century, Ptolomey's list of ports on this coast included Podouke emporion.
Pallava and Chola periods.
In the 3rd century, Pulicat came under the power of the Pallava kings to the north. In the 7th century, during the Pallava period, Calicut was named "Mamalla Pattinam" indicating it was an important coastal city worthy enough to carry the coronation title of a King. In the 11th century, during the Golden Era of the Medieval Cholas an important Shiva Temple was built by Rajendra Chola on the Arani River, southwest of the lake at Tirupalaivanam near Pulicat.
Arab migrants.
In the 9th century, Pulicat contained settlements of Arab maritime traders. In the 13th century, A.H. 668 (1269 CE), Arabic Suni-Shafi Khadems from Medina migrated to the shores of this lake after they were banished from Mecca for refusing to pay tributes to a new Caliph. They adopted the Tamil language and became leading traders in the area. From 1225 to 1275, Arab ships transporting tin from Malaya to Die, Oman or Dhufar regularly stopped at Pulicat. In the 12th and 13th century, as a result of their trade links with Arabian Peninsula and Indian Ocean ports, Pulicat and other Coromandal port towns came to be identified as centers of formal Islam in South India. 
A significant number of their Tamil speaking community were classed as "permanent professing Muslims". In the early 16th century, a Muslim named "Cajole" was the Port Captain of Pulicat. Streets with dilapidated masonry houses, once occupied by these Arabian Muslims, are still found in the area. Some remaining resident families claim records in Arabic testifying their migration to this area.
Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646).
In 1336, at the beginning of the Vijayanagara Empire, during the reign of the early Sangama Dynasty kings Harihara Raya I and Bukka Raya I, the area now called Pulicat was known as "Pralaya Kaveri". In 1422, at the beginning of the reign of Deva Raya II this port city was renamed "Anandarayan Pattinam" after the new governor Anandaraya. This name was retained till 1521, when it was changed to "Palaverkadu" during the reign of Krishnadevaraya.
In the 15th and early 16th century, Pulicat rose to importance due to stabilization of the Vijayanagar empire and firm links, including a road, to the great imperial capital of Vijayanagara. In this period, Pulicat was the most important port in southeast India. It was a well-developed trading center thought to have a population exceeding 50,000. The Coromandal coast was a major producer of textiles and yarns for export to Melaka and Burma, and "Anandarayan Pattinam" was the port from which they were shipped. During this period, in Pulicat there was also a great industry for cutting and polishing precious stones as diamonds, sapphires and rubys procured from the Deccan, Ceylon and Pegu (Burma).
In 1505, Pulicat was stated to be the most active and richest port on the Coromandel Coast.From here there was a barter trade which included exchange of local colored cotton goods for precious rubies from Burma and elephants from Ceylon.The Pulicat Governor, appointed by the Raja of Vijayanagar, collected duties on these transactions. In 1532, it was recorded that property tax was levied in Pulicat on a graded scale and sales tax was levied on rice and paddy, oil and ghee, jaggery, pepper, turmeric, betal nut, gallnut, sugar, cumin, fenugreek, dry ginger and textiles. Import taxes on commodities and export taxes on cloth and corn were also levied.
After the 1556, Battle of Talikota resulted in a decline of the Vijayanagar Empire, Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah Wali, the third ruler of the Kingdom of Golkonda took control of "Palaverkadu". In 1570, the new king Tirumala Deva Raya divided the kingdom and allowed Sriranga Deva Raya to rule the area. "Palaverkadu" was renamed as "Prelaya Kaveri".
In 1586, Oboyoma, the favorite queen of Venkatapati Deva Raya, the Vijayanagaar emperor, now operating from the new capital at Chandragiri, was bequeathed Pulicat to rule. 
She gave aid to Portuguese Jesuits to build a residence at Pulicat.
After the death of Venkatapati Deva Raya in 1614 and a succession struggle, his son Ramadeva became king in 1617 and named his father in-law Ethiraja as master of Pulicat. At the time of his death, the King had no less than three large chests full of diamonds in his possession. In 1616, the Madurai Nayak ruler Muttu Virappa paid a tribute of 600,000 Pagodas to Venkatapati Deva Raya at Chandragiri.
European trading outpost (1502–1825).
Portuguese trading outpost.
In 1502, the Portuguese traders established a trading outpost here during the rule of Krishnadeva Raya and soon dominated the port until 1560. 
These private merchants were out of reach of the official authority in Goa and some were viewed as renegades, bandits and pirates. In 1515, they built a church dedicated to Nossa Senhora Dus Prazeres ("Our Lady of Joys") which was renamed to "Our Lady of Glory". It is the oldest church in the present Madras-Mylapore Diocese and is still used, but in poor condition.
In 1520, there were 200 – 300 Portuguese inhabitants in Palaverkadu. 
By 1545, there were 600 – 700 families and from 1565 their population was in decline.
Dutch trading center.
In 1606, a Dutch ship stopped on the shores of the "Karimanal" Village, north of the mouth of the lake requesting water. Local Muslims offered food and help to the Dutch. They struck a trade partnership to procure and supply local merchandise to the Dutch for trade in the East Indies.
Queen Eraivi, a wife of King Venkata II, ruled "Prelaya Kaveri" and during her reign in 1608 the Dutch East India Company ("Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie" or (VOC), was given permission to build a fort and do trading.
They built a fort named "Geldria" at Pulicat as a defense from local kings and the Portuguese, from where they soon monopolized the lucrative textiles trade with the East Indies and other countries in the region. Under pressure from the Dutch, an English trading post established in 1619 was disbanded in 1622. The Dutch establishment here met with early stiff resistance from the Portuguese, including several attacks on the harbor. In 1611, Venkatatapati turned against the Portuguese and the Jesuits were ordered to leave Chandragiri and the Dutch were permitted to build a fort at Pulicat.
In 1614, subsequent to the death of Venkatapati and taking advantage of a predicament in naming his successor, the Portuguese attacked the Dutch at Pulicat. In 1623, the Portuguese attacked the harbor and burned two ships. In 1633, the Portuguese again attacked the Dutch at Pulicat with a promise of land support from the Vijayanagar ruler which never materialized. After the Portuguese had withdrawn their fleet, the Vijayanagara King (Sri Ranga) residing at Ratnagiri then attacked the Dutch at Pulicat but was paid a handsome tribute by the Dutch. Thereafter, the Dutch were not troubled.
During the Dutch occupation Pulicat was known by the name "Pallaicatta"
From 1616 to 1690, Pulicat was the official headquarters of Dutch Coromandel. 
It then shifted to Negapatnam but with ceding of Negapatnam to the British in 1784, the headquarters shifted back to Pulicat. The VOC was established to protect Dutch trade in the East Indies and fight their enemies from Europe who wished to enter east India trade. 
They held power for 200 years as the largest trading company. The trading involved spices including nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, and tea, silk and Chinese porcelain.
Manufacture of cloth for export was the sole occupation of several indigenous groups in Pulicat and the hinterlands of Tamil, Telegu and Kannada territories, and it is likely that over 1,000 handlooms operated in Pulicat alone. In the 1620s, the Dutch East India Company established a gunpowder factory in Pulicat. Its output was so substantial that for several decades it was able to keep many of the major Dutch trading centers in the East Indies and homeward-bound fleets well supplied. In 1615, the first VOC mint in India was established in Fort Gelria where, initially, “Kas” copper coins with VOC monogram and a Sanskrit legend were minted. The Pulicat mint operated till 1674, when a new mint was established at Negapatanam. These coins were widely used in Ceylon.
Dutch’s dominance in the coasts of India during the 16th century was partly attributed to the Hindu ruler, Zamorin. Zamorin welcomed the Portuguese and in turn prospered from the trade from the entry point ports he commanded.
Among the many trading voyages that departed from Pulicat, in 1658 the Dutch trading ship "Avondster" (captured as the "Blessing" from the British in 1653 and renamed) transported money and valuable cargo from Pulicat to Bengal.
By the early 17th century, Pallaicatta's population has been estimated to have declined to just over 10,000. In 1746, the monsoon failed, resulting in a devastating famine. In the larger towns of Pulicat and Santhome alone the death toll was put at 15,000 and only one third of the textile weavers, painters and washers survived. Cloth prices increased 15% and little was available even at that price. An even more significant cause of the Dutch decline was conquest of the area by the Golconda forces commanded by Mir Jumla. Except for two short breaks, Dutch rule of Pulicat lasted for 214 years between 1606 and 1825 till the King of Arcot acceded Chingleput District (which included Pulicat village) to the British in 1825.
Pulicat today bears silent testimony to the Dutch, with the Dutch Fort dating back to 1609 in ruins, a Dutch Church and Cemetery with 22 protected tombs dating from 1631 to 1655 and another Dutch Cemetery with 76 tombs and mausoleums protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
Slave trade.
For most of the 16th and 17th centuries Europeans on the Coromandal coast were extensively involved in the trading, brokering and shipment of slaves from India to Ceylon and the West Indies. The Dutch were "the nexus of an enormous slave trade" and between 1621 and 1665 alone, used 131 ships to transport 38,441 Indian slaves obtained mostly from Pulicat brokers. In Pulicat, the price of a slave ranged from 27 to 40 guilders in "expensive years" to as little as 4 guilders in "cheap years".
Normally 150 – 400 slaves were shipped each year from central Coromandel ports, including Pulicat, Madras, Nagapatnam and Devanampatnam. This trade increased greatly during several famine periods. 
Between 1659 and 1661, eight to ten thousand slaves were shipped from central Coromandel ports including Pulicat. Domestic slavery was officially recognized by the English at Madras and run mainly by the Dutch at Pulicat.
Slave labour was a defining element of the high production levels and luxury standards of Dutch colonial settlements throughout the Indian Ocean. Slaves empowered the elite groups, and formed 25% – 66% of the total population of the major settlements, including Pulicat.
British rule (1825–1947).
Though the Pulicot area was ceded to the English in 1760 as a "Jagir" (estate), and the town was finally captured by the English in 1795, Dutch control of Pulicat lasted till 1825 when it was annexed to Chingulput district, which had been taken from the French by the English in 1753. Thereafter it served as a fishing village and a British health resort.
In 1889, Pulicat had a population of about 5,000. The importance of Pulicat receded with the declining sea power of the Dutch and the increasing role of the Madras Presidency and the British port in Madras, to the south. It got relegated to a village level, with land access becoming difficult due to dense forest growth. 
Even the Lighthouse, which was rebuilt in 1895, served only to warn passing ships of the dangerous Pulicat shoals.
Religious traditions.
Pulicat was an atypical multi-religious community with a history of three prosperous religious traditions.
Hinduism flourished in Pulicat from early 300 BCE, when it was dominated by the Hindu ancient Tamil kingdoms. By 1825, there were several Hindu temples dedicated to the worship of Shiva, Vishnu, Murugan, Amman (mother goddess) and the "Gramma Theyvathai" (family goddesses). Unlike the Brahmin temples, the Amman temples were open to members of every Jāti.
The Muslim religious community began here in the 9th century with the arrival and settling of Arab maritime traders. After the Dutch fortification of Pulicat, two large mosques and some small places of worship and scripture reading were built by the Moslem traders in Pulicat proper. 
The mosques built earlier were then used by Moslem boat builders. The traders, descendants of the Khadems from Medina who were previously socially undifferentiated from the boat builders, became a distinct group of "nobility" called Labbay.
Christianity prospered here from the 16th century initiated by Portuguese traders and continued by the Roman Catholic Church they built. There was also a Roman Catholic church in the Christian hamlet of Pattanava, with a Roman Catholic priest appointed by the Madras Bishopric.
The arrival of the monotheistic religions of Islam and Christianity, combined with the breakdown of the earlier Hindu ruled kingdoms and imposition of colonial rule, evolved new forms of rank and communal affiliation among the areas' religious communities. South India was not always a strictly "orthodox" Hindu Society. To the contrary, Christianity, Islam and Brahmanical Hinduism were forces which all came to impinge on the warrior cultures of South India.

Col Markham

Colin William (Col) Markham (born 4 June 1940) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 2003, representing the electorates of Keira (1988–1999) and Wollongong (1999–2003). He was a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr Labor government.
Early years.
Markham was born in Wollongong, the son of Vincent Markham and his wife Iris, and studied at West Wollongong Public School and Wollongong Junior Technical College (now Keira High School). He dropped out of school at fifteen, and took up an apprenticeship as an electrical fitter with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. He worked in the Kemira mines for two years after the completion of his apprenticeship, before shifting to the Coalcliff mines, where he spent a further 24 years. He joined the Labor Party in response to the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, and was active in his local branches for many years thereafter.
State politics.
Markham won Labor preselection for the newly created seat of Keira in 1988, following the abolition of the previously safe Labor seat of Corrimal held by the long-serving Member for Corrimal, Laurie Kelly. Kelly challenged sitting Independent MP Frank Arkell for his seat of Wollongong, but was defeated.
Markham won a narrow victory and was subsequently reelected at the 1991 and 1995 State elections, increasing his majority at each election. Markham developed a reputation as an occasionally outspoken local MP, publicly clashing with his party over their policies on the coal industry not long after his election. He was promoted into the shadow ministry in 1989, taking the position of Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, but was cut upon the election of the Carr government in 1995 after struggling to gain a profile in the role.
Markham was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Aboriginal Affairs after his demotion from Cabinet, and was a persistent advocate for Aboriginal issues throughout the remainder of his parliamentary career. He was the architect of early land rights legislation transferring a number of government-owned sites into the control of their traditional owners, and continually campaigned for action from the state government on Aboriginal reconciliation, ultimately resulting in the Carr government's Statement of Commitment on Aboriginal reconciliation in 1997. He was also a frequent advocate for local workers as the job cuts of the 1990s hit the Wollongong economy hard.
Markham had long faced rumors of a preselection challenge from the right-faction, which had been gaining increasing dominance in his region through the late 1990s. As a popular local member, however, he was tipped to be difficult to shift, and planned challenges for the 1991 and 1995 elections never eventuated. He faced a much more difficult situation ahead of the 1999 election, however, when an electoral redistribution saw the right-wing faction gain firm control of the electorate's Labor branches. A deal was struck by which Markham would instead contest preselection for the neighbouring seat of Wollongong, held by fellow left-winger Gerry Sullivan. Markham won preselection for Wollongong, but his treatment by the party caused a local backlash, with Wollongong councillor Dave Martin running for and nearly winning Markham's old seat of Keira as an independent. Sullivan took the preselection to the Supreme Court but lost, and publicly considered running as an independent before deciding against it.
He was reappointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Aboriginal Affairs after the election, and acted as a strong proponent of Sorry Day and National Reconciliation Week. He faced speculation about another challenge for his seat in 2002, when it was leaked to the press that his name was on an internal party "hit-list" for the next election. Long a target of the right wing, the faction had been especially angered by his refusal to cross a union picket line at Parliament House in opposition to Carr government workers compensation changes that were deeply unpopular in Markham's blue-collar electorate. The speculation received a sharp response from the trade union movement, with the local divisions of six major unions threatening protests and support for independent candidacies if Markham was toppled by head office. Markham's impending axing took on federal consequences when angry local unions and left-wing groups directed their resources against the right faction candidate Labor had endorsed for a by-election in the federal seat of Cunningham; in a shock result, Green candidate Michael Organ won the seat after a disastrous Labor campaign.
Markham received a late endorsement from Premier Bob Carr ahead of the 2002 preselection vote, but this was not enough to sway the right-dominated preselectors, who voted for Noreen Hay, a local left faction figure who defected to the right soon after. He retired at the election rather than run as an independent, and Hay held the seat, albeit with a 13% swing against her. Tickets to his farewell dinner at the WIN Entertainment Centre sold out five days before it was held.
Community involvement.
Since leaving politics, Markham has maintained his interest in aboriginal affairs, having previously served as an Executive Member, Deputy Chairperson, and now Ambassador of the New South Wales Reconciliation Council. He holds a strong interest in rugby league and is a Director of the Illawarra Steelers Board and Gold Foundation Member of the Illawarra Steelers as well as previously serving as Chairman of the Illawarra Steeler's Injured Player Fund.
In 2003, he was awarded as an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wollongong.

Twist lifts

A twist lift is a pairs figure skating hand-to-waist lift. The man lifts the lady in the air, where she performs one or more rotations in a laid-out position. He catches her in the air and lets her down onto one foot. The element is judged on a variety of factors, such as speed, smoothness of the take-off and landing, the height reached, the position of the lady in the air, the continuous rotation, and good coverage of the ice surface.
Technique.
The twist lift movement starts with both skaters skating backward. The man holds the lady by the waist and she holds him on his wrists. The lady toe-picks into the ice and springs into the air, while the man assists into lifting her above his head and then throwing her into the air. In the short program in International Skating Union (ISU) competition, the twist lift take-off is either a Flip take-off or a Lutz take-off. In the free skating of ISU competition, there is no such restriction.
The lady rotates a specific number of times in the air. The number of rotations may be part of the requirement for the element. 
As the lady completes the element in the air, the man rotates forward to catch her at the side of her waist. Under ISU rules, the man's secure contact with her waist should be made while the lady is in the air and prior to her landing on the ice. The lady's hands should not touch the man during the catch. In 2007, the ISU rules were revised to indicate that the lady's arms as well as her hands were not to touch the man on reentry to the ice. The man then assists the lady into a smooth landing on the ice. For ISU competitions, the lady lands on the ice on a backward outside edge on one foot. The man also exits from the twist-lift on one foot.
Types of twist lifts.
Twist lifts are categorized by the edge and type of take off. The three types of twist lifts are named for the jump entrance take-off that they use. The "Toeloop twist lift" uses the toe loop jump take off, the "Axel twist lift" users the axel jump take off, and the "Lutz/Flip twist lift" uses either the Lutz jump or the Flip jump take off. 
Twist rotations are the counted the same as with jumps. Therefore, a one-rotation twist is a single twist, a two-rotation twist is a double twist, a three-rotation twist is a triple twist, and a four-rotation twist is a quad twist.
Variations.
The lady may achieve a split position in the air before rotating. This is not required but increases the level of difficulty if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis. Other variations which may increase the score include steps or other skating moves going into the twist, delayed rotation, or the lady holding her arms over her head. 
A twist may be performed in either vertical or lateral position. Although vertical was traditionally preferred by the judges, lateral ones have become more common since the 1990s. The pair's choice does not affect the score. A lateral twist involves the man slightly tipping the lady to twist almost parallel to the ground.
In competition.
In ISU competitions on the junior level, the twist in the short program must be a double or a triple, Here, double or triple twists are a required element in the pairs short program at the senior level, but there is no rotation restriction in the free skating. In 2007, the ISU rules were revised to require a minimum of one full revolution.
Scoring.
Under the ISU Judging System, twist lifts are graded on the four levels of difficulty, with level one being the easiest, and level four being the hardest. In the protocol abbreviations, the number of rotations precedes the abbreviation and the level of difficulty follows it. A triple toeloop twist lift that was awarded a level four would be abbreviated "3TTw4" in the protocol.
In determining the quality of twist lift execution at ISU competitions, each judge will mark every element with positive and negative points as a function of the features of the execution. The ISU judge will consider factors such as the speed, smoothness of the take-off and landing, the height reached, the position of the lady in the air, the continuous rotation, and good coverage of the ice surface. Points are deducted for an awkward catch, if the twist rotations were not completed, if one of the partner falls, if the lady collapses on the partner during the catch, if she is not caught at the waist or in the air, or if she lands on two feet. In addition, deductions are taken if the man finishes the element on two feet, there is poor height or distance on the twist, poor speed at take-off or landing. Further, serious scratching on take off, touch down with the free foot, and missing a 1/4 or more of a revolution could result in deductions.

Alexandros Alexandrakis

Alexandros Alexandrakis (Athens, 1913 – Athens, 1968) was a Greek painter, who became widely known from his particularly dynamic depictions of the Greco-Italian War of 1940.
Alexandrakis showed an early talent for design and painting. In the age of 17, he exhibited 23 works in the group show organised by HAN. He then studied painting in Athens School of Fine Arts under the supervision of masters Spyridonas Vikatos and Umbertos Argyros. Later, he attended classes in engraving by the master Giannis Kefallinos. He graduated from the school in 1937, and went on to participate in various exhibitions.
In World War II, which in Greece is called the Greco-Italian War, Alexandrakis and his five brothers were called to military duty to the Greek-Albanian borders. He found himself in the high mountainous area of 'Pindos' where he served as corporal. Inspired by his situation, he sketched and painted his memories in a series of artworks that made him popular in Greece in the post-war years. A collection of them was published in 1968 with the title 'Thus we fought' (original in Greek: Έτσι πολεμούσαμε).
He also spent considerable time with Art nude and in 1958 Alexandrakis was the illustrator of public junior school book for the fifth grade. He became known outside Greece when he started collaborating with institutions such as the Guggenheim Museum and USA Senator Library. He died at the age of 55.
In 1980, the National Gallery of Greece honoured Alexandrakis with a Retrospection Exhibition. Gallery K in London presented works by him in 1998 and 2005.

Angelbert

Angelbert was a Frankish soldier and poet, possibly from Aquitaine. His "Verses on the Battle that was Fought at Fontenoy" are a first-hand description of the Battle of Fontenoy of 25 June 841, in which he participated with the army of Lothair I. They are an important piece of battle literature from the twilight of the Carolingian Renaissance. Historian Bernard Bachrach has examined them as a source for the emotional effects of battle during the ninth century. 
According to his poem, Angelbert fought on the front line, stationed on a hill overlooking a stream. He was the only survivor ("solus de multis remani") of the men in his unit. The night after the battle is "especially terrible". The day after the battle he cannot hold back tears, but he urges the other survivors to hold them back. This battle, he says, should be forgotten: "Laude pugna non est digna, nec canatur melode" ("The battle does not deserve to be praised or to be the subject of fine song"). 
Two major streams of interpretation of Angelbert's poem exist. The first sees it as a "ballad of victory" rooted in vernacular Germanic poetry. Angelbert is assumed to have spoken Old High German, and the imagery of birds and beasts consuming the corpses of the dead has been assumed to be borrowed from Old High German literature. There is no such surviving literature with such imagery and it is supposed to have existed on analogy with Old English and Old Norse traditions of the same. The imagery is also found in other Carolingian poetry, e.g. of Radbod of Utrecht and Florus of Lyons, and it probably reflects the reality of battle, not Germanic tradition 
The breaking of family bonds mentioned by Angelbert is common to the "Hildebrandslied", but the themes of mistaken identity and heroic duty are absent from Angelbert and Carolingian Latin poetry in general. The "Battle of Fontenoy" also differs from vernacular Germanic literature, like the "Ludwigslied", in that it is full of historical detail. Angelbert wrote "in order to describe the actual events of his own lifetime," which has more in common with contemporary Latin trends. 
The latinity of the "Battle of Fontenoy" is learned, and it has the marks of a "planctus" in the Carolingian tradition. It has the interesting features of citing David's lament of the death of Saul in "II Samuel" (1:21), and its effect on nature, which Paulinus II of Aquileia cites in his "planctus" on the death in battle of Eric of Friuli. Rhythmically, the poem is an imitation of Venantius Fortunatus' "Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis". The strophes begin with the letters of the alphabet from A to P as a mnemonic device aiding recitation. 
Angelbert's poem is preserved in manuscript BnF lat. 1154, originally from Saint Martial of Limoges in Aquitaine; Pippin I of Aquitaine was an ally of Lothair. The poem presents the partisan viewpoint of Lothair and Pippin's men; Florus of Lyons represents the view of the other side, of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, in his "Lament on the Division of the Empire".

Flos Carmeli

The Flos Carmeli is a Marian Catholic hymn and prayer. "Flos carmeli" literally means "Flower of Carmel". In the Carmelite Rite this hymn was the sequence for the Feast of St. Simon Stock, and, since 1663, for the Feast of Our Lady of Mt Carmel. It is said to have been written by St. Simon Stock himself (c1165 - 1265). The prayer is taken from the first two stanzas of the hymn.

Innovation management

Innovation management is the discipline of managing processes in innovation. It can be used to develop both product and organizational innovation.Innovation management includes a set of tools that allow managers and engineers to cooperate with a common understanding of goals and processes. The focus of innovation management is to allow the organization to respond to an external or internal opportunity, and use its creative efforts to introduce new ideas, processes or products. Importantly, innovation management is not relegated to R&D; it involves workers at every level in contributing creatively to a company's development, manufacturing, and marketing. By utilizing appropriate innovation management tools, management can trigger and deploy the creative juices of the whole work force towards the continuous development of a company. The process can be viewed as an evolutionary integration of organization, technology and market by iterating series of activities: search, select, implement and capture.
Innovation processes can either be pushed or pulled through development. A pushed process is based on existing or newly invented technology, that the organization has access to, and tries to find profitable applications to use this technology. A pulled process tries to find areas where customers needs are not met, and then focus development efforts to find solutions to those needs. To succeed with either method, an understanding of both the market and the technical problems are needed. By creating multi-functional development teams, containing both engineers and marketers, both dimensions can be solved. The lifetime (or product lifecycle) of new products is steadily getting shorter; increased competition therefore forces companies reduce the time to market. Innovation managers must therefore decrease development time, without sacrificing quality or meeting the needs of the market.
Common tools include brainstorming, virtual prototyping, product lifecycle management, idea management, TRIZ, Phase–gate model, project management, product line planning and portfolio management.
Measuring Innovation Management.
There are two phases the first phase involves the design of the innovation and the second involves its implementation. The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted using surveys to establish internal benchmarking. There is now an emerging body of work around the Management Innovation Index as an effective analytic that uses regression analysis enabling the measurement of organizational innovation that focuses on the four organizational pillars of innovation - culture and environment, strategy, innovation practice and the personal traits, beliefs and attitudes of managers to creativity and innovation. In addition, the Management Innovation Index maps the flow of creative inputs through the organization's operating system that produces the organization's innovation, i.e. the creative outputs.
Manage Complex Innovation.
To manage complex innovation, ask the right questions
Innovation is the change that outperforms the previous practice. To lead or sustain with innovations, managers need to concentrate heavily on the innovation network, which requires deep understanding of the complexity of innovation. Collaboration is an important source of innovation. Innovations are increasingly brought to the market by networks of firms, selected according to their comparative advantages, and operating in a coordinated manner.
When a technology goes through a major transformation phase and yields a successful innovation then it becomes a great learning experience, not only for the parent industry but for other industries as well. Big innovations are generally the outcome of intra- and interdisciplinary networking among technological sectors along with combination of implicit and explicit knowledge. Networking is required but network integration (networking of networks) is the key to success for complex innovation in today’s era where diverse technologies are available at its best. Social economic zones, technology corridors, free trade agreements and technology clusters are some of the ways to encourage organizational networking and cross-functional innovations. To win with innovation in a flat world we definitely need complex networking and crowd-sourcing.

<doc id="20577411" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20577411" title="Milton's antiprelatical tracts">
Milton's antiprelatical tracts

John Milton's antiprelatical tracts are a series of five political pamphlets that attack the episcopal form of church leadership.
Background.
During Bishops’ Wars of 1639 and 1640, Milton joined the factions opposing the policies of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the policies of the Church of England. Soon after, an antiprelatical movement started and the Root and Branch petition was put to Parliament 11 December 1640. The petition called for the end of the episcopal hierarchy and Laud was removed from his position on 18 December 1640. After a few months, a royalist, pro-episcopal movement was started. This movement was led by Joseph Hall, and it was he that produced pamphlets supporting the Church of England hierarchy. 
Hall published "An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament" in January 1641. The tract argued in support of the Church of England's liturgy and the episcopal hierarchy of the church. This work was responded to by Smectymnuus, five Puritan clergy, in the work "An Answer to a Booke Entituled, An Humble Remonstrance". This publication started a pamphlet dispute between the two sides, and Hall published "A Defence of the Humble Remonstrance against the Frivolous... Exceptions of Smectymnuus" on 12 April 1641. This tract was responded to with "Vindication of the Answer to the Humble Remonstrance, from the Unjust Imputations of Frivolousness and Falsehood" on 26 June 1641 by Smectymnuus. Milton joined in the debate with his "Of Reformation" published May 1641. The debate between Hall and Milton became personalised as the conflict progressed, with an ever-increasing emphasis on personal integrity.
Tracts.
Of Reformation.
"Of Reformation" was Milton's first independently produced work, and was published in May 1641. Milton's argument focuses on both the role of church government and of government in general, especially of the importance of republicanism. Throughout the work, Milton opposed the establishment of a central Church government because he believed that individual congregations should govern themselves.
Of Prelatical Episcopacy.
"Of Prelatical Episcopacy" is the shortest of Milton's antiprelatical tracts and was written as a response to many works, including Archbishop James Ussher's "The Judgement of Doctor Rainoldes Touching the Originall of Episcopacy" (25 May 1641). The tract was published in either June or July 1641. Milton's main argument is a discussion of the nature of truth and how truth can only be attained through scripture. The work is openly hostile to any need for a medium between the Bible and the individual reader, especially such mediation as is provided by an organized church.
Animadversions.
"Animadversions", published July 1641, was written as a response to the works and claims of Hall. The tract is filled with direct attacks against Hall's person, and this is accomplished through satire and mockery. Like his other tracts, Milton continues to attack the authority of church governments and liturgies while emphasizing how an individual's reading of the Bible is more important than other considerations.
The Reason of Church-Government.
Milton published "The Reason for Church-Government Urg'd against Prelaty" in January/February 1642. Although the tract was the fourth of his antiprelatical tracts, there was a 6 months delay after the publication of "Animadversions". The work is a response to an attack on his previous works which was titled "Certain Briefe Treatises, Written by Diverse Learned Men, Concerning the Ancient and Moderne Government of the Church". Unlike Milton's previous three, he including his name upon the tract and he emphasized himself within the text. This tract includes a detailed discussion, in the preface of Book II, of Miltons views on literature and genres.
Apology for Smectymnuus.
"Apology for Smectymnuus" was published in April 1642 and is his final antiprelatical tract. The tract was written as a response to another refutation by Hall against an earlier tract. The tract praises Parliament and emphasizes that they are both reformers and the foundation of England. The work also contains some of Milton's Aristotelian feelings about man as a political animal.

2008 Greek riots

The 2008 Greek riots started on 6 December 2008, when Alexandros Grigoropoulos (), a 15-year-old student, was killed by two policemen in Exarcheia district of central Athens. The murder of a young student by police resulted in large protests and demonstrations, which escalated to widespread rioting, with numerous rioters damaging property and engaging riot police with Molotov cocktails, stones and other objects. Demonstrations and rioting soon spread to several other cities, including Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city.
Outside Greece, solidarity demonstrations, riots and, in some cases, clashes with local police also took place in more than 70 cities around the world, including London, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Dublin, Berlin, Frankfurt, Madrid, Barcelona, Amsterdam, The Hague, Copenhagen, Bordeaux, Cologne, Seville as well as Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, and the western Cypriot city of Paphos. In cities far away from Athens, solidarity often was expressed as a peaceful informational protest, for example Sao Paulo, it proved that people could spread the news around the globe, from San Francisco to Wellington and Buenos Aires to Siberia. Newspaper "Kathimerini" called the rioting "the worst Greece has seen since the restoration of democracy in 1974".
While the unrest was triggered by the shooting incident, commentators described the reactions as expressing deeper causes as well, especially a widespread feeling of frustration in the younger generation about specific economic problems of the country (partly as a result of the global economic crisis), a rising unemployment rate among the young generation and a perception of general inefficiency and corruption in Greek state institutions.
The shooting incident.
The fatal shooting that triggered the riots and protests took place in the evening of 6 December 2008, shortly after 9 pm in the Exarcheia district of central Athens.
According to press reports, two Special Guards (a special category of the Greek police personnel, originally meant for guard duties on public property) had been engaged in a minor verbal clash with a small group of teenagers in a main street of Exarcheia, outside a shop. On driving away in their police car, they were then confronted by another small group at a nearby street crossing. The two guards were ordered by the Greek police center of operations to disengage immediately and withdraw from the confrontation site. However, the two guards did not comply and are therefore accused of insubordination. Instead, the two special guards chose to station the police vehicle outside the PASOK headquarters, left their car and went to Tzavella Street on foot in order to confront the youngsters.
Although the incident remains shrouded in mystery and conflicting reports, the following is an attempt to piece together the saga. Following some exchange of verbal abuse that, according to several witnesses, was initiated by the guards, one of them, Epaminondas Korkoneas, fired his gun. The initial police's report on the incident claims that the special guard shot in response to a renewed attack by the youths that involved throwing stones and bottles. Eyewitnesses speaking to the Greek mass media, however, reported that the special guards were not attacked by the youths nor was their physical safety put in danger at any time. Instead, the special guards approached the group and verbally assaulted them in order to provoke them. The special guard said he fired three rounds, two warning shots in the air and a third aimed on the ground. Several eyewitnesses said they believed the policeman had targeted the youngsters directly.
The victim, Alexandros – Andreas Grigoropoulos () was a 15-year-old student, who lived in the affluent northern Athens suburb of Palaio Psychiko and attended a private school (the Moraitis School). Immediately following the shooting, he was transported to the nearby Evangelismos Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Investigation of the shooting.
A criminal investigation was initiated against the police officer who fired the shot on a charge of murder ("intentional homicide" according to Greek law), while his partner was charged as an accomplice. Both were suspended from duty and were kept in detention. The defense counsel that was initially hired resigned shortly after accepting the case, citing personal reasons.
On 10 December, Alexis Kougias, counsel for the defendants, said that preliminary results of the ballistic tests apparently show that it was indeed a ricochet and that the two policemen will only appear before the public prosecutor after the forensic, toxicological, and ballistic examinations have been completed. However, the results of forensic tests indicate that the bullet that killed Grigoropoulos had entered the youth’s body directly. This casts doubt on claims by the 37-year-old policeman charged with the boy’s murder that the bullet had been fired as a warning and ricocheted. On the morning of 11 December, Dimitris Tsovolas, former and economic minister under the previous government, formed by PASOK agreed to serve as the counsel for Grigoropoulos' family.
On the same day, counsel for the two policemen involved in the shooting released an explanatory statement that described the deceased as demonstrating "deviant behaviour". According to the memorandum, Grigoropoulos was a teenager from a wealthy family, he frequented the Exarcheia district, and he had allegedly taken part in riotous activities that took place following the end of a basketball game two hours before he was shot, and that, in general, "the victim did not show the expected behaviour and personality of a 15-year old adolescent". Grigoropoulos' family, friends, schoolmates and high school teachers immediately condemned those statements and declared in public that the allegations in the defendants' memorandum are "completely inaccurate" and "insulting"; the private school Grigoropoulos attended also issued a public statement that denies all the allegations. Alexis' stance, as well as his comments in the explanatory memorandum, forced the Athens bar association to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him.
On 15 December, Alexis appealed that the two defendants be released from custody, on the grounds that neither of them ever had any previous criminal convictions, that their names and addresses were known, that they had considerable ties with their community, and that the charges were based on the testimony of witnesses that the defendants objected to. Specifically, the defendants' counsel took issue with the testimony of four eyewitnesses who had testified for the public prosecutor, and appeared to refute almost all the claims made by the defendants and their counsel.
On 17 December, Dimitris Tsovolas, counsel for Grigoropoulos' family, publicly requested that the defendants and defendants' counsel stop provoking the Greek people and the victim's family by making degrading comments, unsubstantiated accusations, and smearing the memory of Alexandros. The ballistics report was also released on 17 December and stated that the bullet that killed Grigoropoulos had in fact ricocheted. However, forensic reports conducted on 21 December concluded that the bullet was not fired in the air, but rather towards the group of teenagers, though there may have been no intention to kill the boy.
Court decision.
On 11 October 2010, the Mixed Jury Court of Amfissa (consisting of 3 judges and 4 jurors) found the two special guards guilty. Epaminondas Korkoneas was found guilty of "homicide with direct intention to cause harm" and Vasilis Saraliotis was found guilty as an accomplice. Korkoneas was sentenced to lifetime and an additional 15 months of imprisonment (votes 4–3) while Saraliotis was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment (votes 6–1).
The riots and political crisis.
First 2 days.
Within the hour following the shooting of Grigoropoulοs, angry demonstrators took to the streets in and around Exarcheia, and violent confrontations with the police erupted. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations were reported in other Greek cities as well, including Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Komotini, Kastoria, Patras, Tripoli, Volos, Trikala, Mytilene, Agrinio, Kavala, Corfu, Piraeus, Chania, Heraklion, Rhodes, Karditsa, Lamia, Stylida, Drama, Xanthi, Lagkadas, Kozani, Alexandroupoli, Larisa and Corinth. After midnight, the demonstrations in Athens turned into violent rioting in some central streets of the city. By dawn on Sunday, 24 police officers had been injured, one seriously (with facial burns and his little finger mutilated) and 31 shops (particularly across Ermou Street), 9 banks, and 25 cars had been either seriously damaged, burned, or destroyed within the downtown area.
First week.
By Sunday 7 December 2008 38 vehicles were damaged, 13 police officers were injured, and 22 rioters were arrested.
Monday 8 December 2008 saw police assess damage as daily schedules resumed and rioting subsided. However, all was not quiet, as all over Greece, several thousands of high school students walked out of their schools and marched on local police stations, throwing eggs, paint bombs, and water bottles. Protesters continued to occupy university campuses around the nation, while organizations such as the Communist Party of Greece announced plans for protests later that day. The massive demonstrations of that evening were confronted by police using tear gas; during the demonstrations, some 11 public buildings around the central plaza of Athens, Syntagma Square, were set on fire.
Students around Greece proceeded to occupy their school buildings, in protest, including in Serres, Imathia, Chalkidiki, Pieria, and Thessaloniki. The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the National Technical University of Athens, as well as the Athens University of Economics and Business remained under student occupation. Rioters also set fire to the Kostis Palamas building that led to the total destruction of the European Law Library situated at the corner of Akadimias and Sina street. After the fire, the rector of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Christos Kittas, resigned, but some days later withdrew his resignation.
A police report released Tuesday, 9 December 2008 in the morning put the numbers of injured police officers at 12, arrested rioters at 87, and persons who had been brought before a public prosecutor at 176. In Thessaloniki, 16 rioters were arrested for theft, 3 of whom were under 18 years old. After four days of rioting, some citizens began to act against the rioters, and some rioters fired on police officers. Citizens attacked people that were found looting and were seen throwing stones to protect their belongings. In the city of Patras, according to the city's mayor, members of far-right organisations took part in the violence. In Athens, seven police officers were injured, four rioters were arrested for violence against the police, 12 were arrested for theft and 55 were arrested for rioting with another 25 people of non-Greek nationality arrested for the same reason.
In a report on Tuesday, Amnesty International accused the Greek Police of brutality in handling the riots. The Greek department of Amnesty International canceled the scheduled celebrations on 10 December for the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in response to the police violence in Greece.
The crisis deepened on Wednesday 10 December 2008 when the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) and the Civil Servants' Confederation (ADEDY), representing 2.5 million workers or roughly half of the total Greek workforce, called a one-day general strike in protest against the government's economic policies. Rioting continued in Athens as thousands of workers gathered for anti-government protests at Syntagma Square.
On Thursday, 11 December 2008 4,000 students marched against the police throwing firebombs.
On Friday, 12 December 2008 students attacked police outside the parliament building. Riot police fired tear gas in response. Heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days. The protests inspired small protests in some European cities, sowing fears of copycat riots elsewhere. On the same day, Greek police issued an appeal for more tear gas after supplies ran low, since more than 4,600 capsules of it were released against the protestors by that time.
On Saturday, 13 December 2008 large groups of demonstrators gathered in front of the Greek Parliament in central Athens. Despite the fact that the protest in front of the Greek parliament was relatively peaceful, the riot police attempted to dissolve it at 1:30 (local time) by using tear gas and violence. On the same day, about 100 protesters firebombed a police station near the Exarcheia district where Alexandros Grigoropoulos was killed.
On Sunday, 14 December 2008 students joined residents of the Exarcheia district to demand the renaming of that street in honour of the dead teenager. Also, at least four radio stations based in Athens were occupied by protesters. In Thessaloniki, students demonstrated in solidarity with all the people who were arrested as a result of rioting over the past week.
Second week.
On Monday, 15 December 2008 students gathered outside the Attica General Police Directorate in central Athens. The riot police chose to dissolve the protest through violence after some of the demonstrators threw eggs against one riot police squad. Many of the demonstrators were of school-age. Several newspapers report that the protesters were provoked by policemen. In Piraeus, approximately 300 students rallied outside the local Korydallos Prison and taunted the police who fired tear gas to disperse them. According to teachers' unions, some 600 schools were under occupation, while 150 university facilities across the country had been taken over according to the Greek Ministry of Education. In Ioannina, the local public radio station was occupied by students and far-leftist groups. Rallies and demonstrations have also taken place in Chania, Heraklion, Larissa and Thessaloniki.
On Tuesday, 16 December 2008 rallies and protests took place outside many police stations in Athens and Piraeus. Early in the afternoon, masked youths emerged from the university complex in Zografou and firebombed nearby Athens' riot police headquarters. Six police officers were injured and ten vehicles were burnt. Meanwhile a group of around 30 protesters infiltrated the studios of public broadcaster ERT and interrupted a news broadcast featuring Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis. For about a minute, the protesters stood in front of the camera holding banners reading “Stop watching, get out into the streets.” ERT Chairman Christos Panagopoulos tendered his resignation over the incident but it was rejected by the government. “It is unacceptable for unidentified individuals to deprive others of their right to information,” he said.
On Wednesday, 17 December 2008 a rally was held outside the capital's main courthouses, where youths threw eggs and fruit at the police. There was also one demonstration organised by the All-Workers Militant Front (PAME) in central Athens from Omonoia Square to the Greek Parliament, drawing around 5000 people. Student protesters evaded security guards at the Acropolis of Athens and unfurled two giant pink banners over a wall near the Parthenon to rally support for continued demonstrations. "Thursday 18/12 demonstrations in all Europe," one banner read, while the other simply bore the message, "Resistance," in Greek, English, Spanish and German. "We chose this monument to democracy, this global monument, to proclaim our resistance to state violence and demand rights in education and work," "(We did it) to send a message globally and to all Europe." said the protestors. Government spokesman, Evangelos Antonaros, said this protest was "inexcusable" and accused the protesters of tarnishing Greece's image abroad. In Kaisariani, near the riot police headquarters that were targeted by youths on Tuesday, a group of anarchists torched a police bus. The only person in the bus, the driver, managed to escape unhurt. In another protest, about 40 people – including workers, immigrants and unemployed citizens – occupied the offices of the country's main labor union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE). The union's president, Giannis Panagopoulos, said the protest was mistargeted: “The GSEE does not govern this country”. A protest was also held outside the Prefecture of Thessaloniki offices and the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace which is also based in Thessaloniki. Late that night, a homemade explosive device planted outside a branch of Eurobank in the Thessaloniki district of Kalamaria damaged the building’s facade when it detonated. A similar device smashed the windows of a local Citizens’ Information and Service Center (KEP). In Ioannina, the town hall was occupied, while in Chania, a local television station remained under occupation by protesters for about 1 hour.
On Thursday, 18 December 2008 demonstrations took place in central Athens, more than 12,000 protesters crowded the streets near the Greek parliament in a peaceful demonstration in central Athens which turned violent when a group of protesters broke away from the rally and threw rocks and firebombs at police and buildings near Parliament, overturned a car and set fire to trash cans, splashed the police with red paint and tried to burn down the city’s main Christmas tree which had just been replaced after being torched during last weeks riots. The police responded with tear gas and flash grenades, and drove the rioters back toward the administrative headquarters of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the university’s School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences. After another round of pitched battles between masked rioters and the police, several hundred protesters entered the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences. Christmas shoppers fled the streets and retailers rolled down their shutters as protesters smashed store fronts and burned at least four cars. Demonstrations also took place in Thessaloniki where protesters gathered outside the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace. Rallies and protests also took place in Patras, Tripoli, Chania and Trikala. Some labour unions stopped work in solidarity with the demonstrators. The work stoppage by the air traffic controllers forced Olympic Airlines to cancel 28 flights and postpone 14. Hospitals were also operating with very limited staff.
On Friday, 19 December 2008 a protest took place outside the Greek parliament, and a solidarity concert outside the administrative building of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. More than 1500 people demonstrated peacefully in the western suburb of Athens, Peristeri following another shooting of a 16-year-old on Wednesday, 17 December, night. The teenager was struck in the hand by a bullet fired by an unidentified assailant while sitting in a park, outside a local high school with friends. The police admitted that they had made a mistake in their initial statement that the boy was hit by an air-gun pellet. Tests revealed it was either a .38 Special or .357 Magnum bullet. Officers are investigating the incident, anxious to disprove rumors that an off-duty or undercover policeman fired the shot. A police spokesman said that no officers were in the area at the time of the shooting and an investigation was under way. Masked youths attacked the French Institute in Athens with firebombs, "Spark in Athens. Fire in Paris. Insurrection is coming," read one graffiti spray-painted onto the building's walls in French. Another, written in Greek, read "France, Greece, uprising everywhere". Later on Friday, about 50 protesters interrupted the official premiere of the Greek National Theater, holding up banners urging people to join the demonstrations.
On Saturday, 20 December 2008 about 150 youth attacked the Christmas tree at Syntagma Square in central Athens, at around 16.00, hanging trash bags from its branches before clashing with riot police. The square was cleared within two hours. At least three news photographers were injured by police batons. The Christmas tree protest had been advertised as part of a day of events in Greece and around the world to commemorate Grigoropoulos' shooting. On Saturday evening, masked men broke into the building housing the offices of Tiresias SA, a company that keeps records of delinquent debtors and cardholders, and firebombed the company's offices. The fire was extinguished but the company's offices were destroyed. Rioters, using the National Technical University of Athens as a base, launched attacks against police, throwing rocks and petrol bombs and erecting roadblocks. In Thessaloniki a group of anarchists briefly occupied a radio station and a theater before disrupting and threw cakes and candy at Mayor Vassilis Papageorgopoulos and one of his deputies during an open-air charity event near the theater. Later, a group emerged from the same theater and attacked a Nativity scene, throwing away Christ's figure.
On Sunday, 21 December 2008 in the early hours of the morning, unidentified hood-wearing assailants threw petrol bombs at the police academy in the west Athens district of Nea Philadelphia six police vehicles were torched, without causing any casualties. The vehicles that were parked outside the building of the police accounting department at Patriarchou Constantinou street, also suffered damage in the attack. At around the same time, rioting and clashes with riot police continued in the area around the National Technical University of Athens and the University of Thessaloniki, with protesters again lobbing petrol bombs at police.
Third week.
On Tuesday, 23 December 2008 more than 3,000 chanting protesters marched through Athens. During the demonstration, one police car was damaged. At 05:50 local time, shots were fired at a riot police bus in Athens near the riot police headquarters in Zografou. None of the 19 officers on board were injured, authorities said, but the attack raised concern that violence against police could escalate. The shots were fired from the grounds of the National Technical University of Athens’s facilities in Zografou, known as Polytechnioupolis. One bullet blew out two tires on the bus, while another struck the engine. The police found 7.62 mm caliber bullet casings at the scene of the shooting. After ballistic examinations, it was announced that there were at least two shooters who used Kalashnikov type rifles and that the particular weapons used in the attack had not been used in any other attack, robbery, or other criminal incident in Greece.
On Wednesday, 24 December 2008, hundreds of anarchists marched through Athens streets in a peaceful protest.
On Thursday, 25 December 2008, in central Athens and the suburb of Palaio Faliron there was a string of arson attacks against banks and car dealerships, causing widespread damage but no injuries. There was also an attack against the offices of the Ministry for Development in the city center. Arsonists also targeted the car of Deputy Environment and Public Works Minister, Stavros Kaloyiannis, outside his home in the northwestern town of Ioannina, destroying the vehicle. The assailants doused the wheels of the parked car with flammable liquid before setting it alight, according to the fire service.
Aftermath.
By Wednesday 31 December 2008 the occupation of Greek universities in Athens and Thessaloniki had ended and the administrative officials had begun assessing the cost of damage done during the occupation.
On Thursday, 1 January 2009 arsonists attacked 10 banks and two car dealerships around Athens and Piraeus amidst the New Year celebrations. No injuries or arrests were reported by the police. The attacks caused minor damage. At least five arson attacks were also reported by police in Thessaloniki; earlier that day police also briefly clashed with protesters, and fired tear gas at rock throwing demonstrators.
In the early morning of Monday, 5 January 2009 at least two masked gunmen fired over 20 rounds at a riot police unit guarding the Greek Ministry of Culture in central Athens, hitting a 21-year-old officer in the chest and groin. The officer had apparently spotted the gunmen and warned his colleagues shortly before he was hit. An automatic Kalashnikov rifle and an MP5 submachine gun were used in the attack, also a fragmentation grenade was used as a diversion as the perpetrators escaped. The wounded policeman, identified as Diamandis Matzounis, was in a critical, but stable, condition in hospital after six hours of surgery. Authorities said they had cordoned off the region around the site of the attack to collect evidence for forensic examination. At least 72 people were detained during the initial search for suspects. Police said ballistics tests showed the MP5 matched one used in a 30 April 2007, attack on a police station in Athens suburb Nea Ionia. That attack caused no injuries but was claimed by the far-left Revolutionary Struggle group. Police also said ballistics tests showed that a second weapon used on Monday, a Kalashnikov rifle, was used in the more recent attack on police, on 23 December 2008. On Wednesday 14 January 2009 Revolutionary Struggle sent a statement to the weekly satirical newspaper, To Pontiki. The statement said the group carried out the 23 December shooting attack and the separate 5 January shooting at the police officers. By Monday, 19 January 2009 Diamantis Matzounis The 21-year-old police officer seriously injured in the attack of 5 January 2009 was removed from intensive care following an improvement in his condition. Doctors said Diamantis Mantzounis had to undergo two operations to staunch a stomach hemorrhage caused by a bullet wound, but he has managed to recuperate.
On Friday, 9 January 2009 a long-planned education protest march took place in Athens. The rally was organized to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 murder of high school teacher Nikos Temponeras by the secretary of the Patras youth organization of the, back then, ruling New Democracy (Greece) party, participants said they protest against police repression, corrupt politicians, the education reform and a social system that offers little hope, it was one of two held in the capital but it was the only one that turned violent. The trouble began after the rally by several thousand schoolchildren, teachers and students had almost reached its end, near the entrance to University of Athens where it had started. When hooded youths broke away from the student march and threw stones and flares at riot police, who fired tear gas and flash grenades. The youths then turned on police, hurling rocks and flares. At one point a group of protesters tried to force their way into the rector’s office and to occupy the central offices of the University of Athens. The occupation of the University’s offices was obstructed by groups of students and academics. According to rector Christos Kittas, police officers did not ask for university immunity to be lifted so that they could gain access to the faculty. Clashes continued in the area which was closed to traffic and where hundreds of demonstrators remained for an hour. There were repeated police charges and several arrests were made. Some 60 persons were arrested with several demonstrators severely injured in clashes with police. Between those arrested were fourteen lawyers, who said that they had nothing to do with the protest, also several people sustained minor injuries and one was hospitalized. Afterwards the influential Journalists' Union of the Athens Daily Newspapers (ESIEA) protested to the Ministry for the Interior and Public Order about "the brutal attacks and beatings" to which reporters and camera crews had been subjected by some riot police units. "There may have been excesses to be condemned, we are looking into the issue, but the police did their job," Minister for the Interior and Public Order Prokopis Pavlopoulos told Greek television. Later that evening, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the capital’s central police headquarters on Alexandras Avenue, leading to some tense scuffles with officers. But the crowd had dispersed by late night, according to police who did not report any additional problems.
Protests were carried on Thursday, 15 January, policemen labor unionists also took part in the demonstrations ""to condemn the violent phenomena, from wherever they come, and to state categorically that social problems are not solved by repressive measures"". Veteran politician Manolis Glezos who took part in the protest, attributed police violence to the obedience of police forces to the executive power and not the judiciary.
On Friday, 16 January some of the lawyers arrested on Friday's demonstration in Athens, filed suits against police officers accusing them for breach of duty, attempted bodily harm and unnecessarily exposing of people to tear gas.
On Wednesday, 17 January a demonstration was held in Larissa, where more than three thousand people protested against the anti-terrorism act and requested the withdrawal of the charges and the release of four jailed students, who were arrested during the demonstrations of December 2008. Larissa was the only city where the act was applied last month when twenty five teenagers were arrested. At the same time protesters of a separate rally also in Larissa destroyed bank cameras and wrote slogans on walls, churches and supermarkets.
Background and causes.
The shooting happened during a period where the Greek society faced a variety of difficulties in the midst of a worldwide economic slump. In a survey conducted shortly after the events for the Greek newspaper "Kathimerini", 60% of the respondents considered them to be part of a wider "social uprising". Many people were concerned with corruption scandals, most of which involved mishandling of public money, the spread of poverty, the increasing rate of unemployment amongst young graduates and the slowing economy as the effects of the global economic crisis began to show. The local student community—which formed the main body of protesters—had also been in significant turmoil since 2006, being opposed to a series of proposed laws regarding the reform of the country's education system. Many of the student demonstrations in relation to these laws in early 2007 turned violent and resulted in clashes with the police, though the perpetrators of the incidents of violence and vandalism, then as in December 2008, should not be necessarily identified with the students.
As in many other countries, young people are faced with expensive studies and are especially affected by unemployment. However, in terms of unemployment Greece is comparable with France, Germany, or Portugal; has a lower unemployment than Spain or Slovakia; and has more unemployment than Italy, Bulgaria, or Cyprus. Similarly, young people also represent a declining demographic group, compared to baby boomers, resulting in a weaker impact of the youth vote in political life, though this is also not particular to Greece.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned that there was a risk of social unrest spreading unless the financial sector shared wealth more evenly. Greece had recently proposed to go through with €28 bn of cash injections to its banking system while at the same time leaving medicine suppliers unpaid.
Regarding the possibility that economic inequality has been a factor, Greece has a Gini Index of income inequality of 34.3 (where a lower number represents a more egalitarian society in terms of distribution of wealth), comparable with that of France and Ireland; less equitable than Germany, Bulgaria, or Ukraine; and more equitable than Italy, the UK, or Turkey.
Additionally Greece scores a 4.6 on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index which is used to gauge corruption in a state. This makes Greece comparable with Italy, Poland, or Turkey; more corrupt than France, the UK, or Cyprus; and less corrupt than Albania, Bulgaria, or Romania.
Greece also suffers from one of the highest levels of public debt in the EU, with foreign debt valued at 93.9% of projected 2008 GDP and 16% of revenue in 2009 projected to go towards servicing this debt.
First commemoration of the shooting incident.
On Saturday, 5 December 2009 a large crowd gathered at the place where Grigoropoulos was shot, ahead of Sunday's scheduled demonstration, with no reported clashes. However, Police had detained 160 people following minor clashes in central Athens. Police, also, made a preemptive raid on an anarchist hangout in Keratsini near Piraeus on Saturday night detaining 22 people, including Italian, Spanish and Albanian citizens. They discovered some 200 empty bottles they believe were going to be used to make Molotov cocktails, two jerry cans of fuel, two hammers, three sledgehammers, three helmets, 13 gas masks and a stun grenade. They also seized a computer. Two of the people arrested were the son and daughter of Panhellenic Socialist Movement MP and deputy parliamentary speaker Grigoris Niotis. “I have total faith in Greek justice. Just as I have faith in my children, who are adults,” said Niotis.
On Sunday, 6 December 2009 on 11.30 pm A memorial gathering, at the cemetery where 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos is buried, took place in the presence of his family and was attended by hundreds of people including the Greek Minister of Education. Later that day, several thousand demonstrators marched in central Athens and other cities across Greece and Europe to commemorate the death of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos at about. However the protest in Athens was followed by scenes reminiscent of those that followed Grigoropoulos’s death, as several hundred protesters remained holed up in the grounds of the University of Athens and the city’s Law School and used the two institutions as their bases, they clashed from roughly 6 pm and for about three hours with thousands of police who had been deployed in the city center to ensure that the anniversary of the killing of Alexis Grigoropoulos passed as peacefully as possible. Authorities said 134 people were detained for public order offenses in Athens and 80 in the northern city of Thessaloniki, where a similar demonstration also ended in violence, with youths throwing petrol bombs at police and setting fire to cars. At least five protesters and 16 police officers were injured during the clashes. Including one female demonstrator, who was severely injured by a policeman when he struck her with his motorbike. The rector of the University of Athens, Christos Kittas, was hospitalized after protesters stormed into his office. Kittas was struck on the head and was taken to the Ippocrateio Hospital, where doctors placed him in intensive care, saying that he had suffered a heart ischemia. According to the witness of two contributors of the magazine, Occupied London, the director leaving the area had no blood on his head, and the story of his heart attack was fabricated as a "pretext for a full-on attack on the academic asylum".
The series of protests and riots continued months later with the May 2010 Greek protests.
Reactions.
Domestic response.
The Greek government condemned the shooting. Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis wrote a letter to the student's family, stating that "In these difficult moments please accept my condolences for the unfair loss of your son. Like all Greeks I am deeply saddened. I know that nothing can relieve your pain." He continued on to write that "the state will see to it that such a tragedy does not happen again." On a nationally broadcast statement, he also vowed to end the "dangerous" extremist-inspired riots that have hit the country: 
"The unacceptable and dangerous events cannot and will not be tolerated, the extremist elements who exploited the tragedy...by showing that their only goal was to spread violence. The state will protect its citizens and society...It is the least of the tributes we owe Alexandros. "
President Karolos Papoulias sent condolences in a telegram, while Interior minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos expressed "deep sorrow". The police, who claimed that an investigation was underway into the "isolated" incident, also apologized.
Athens Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis has expressed his condolences for the death of the 15-year-old boy, adding that festive events for Christmas in Syntagma Square will be suspended until further notice. Moreover, he assured the owners of damaged shops that they will be aided in restoring their damages, adding that he will propose the Municipal Committee be acquitted of municipal duties for 2009.
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) attributed the killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos to the result of escalating authoritarianism, reinforcement of the suppression mechanisms and their action, the network of reactionary laws and the "Euro-terror laws" created by the governments of ND and PASOK. The KKE has stated that the riots and the destruction is the work of foreign agents acting as provocateurs. The leader of the KKE, Aleka Papariga, called for organized struggle against the main politics that it will be well guarded against suspicious command centers. Meanwhile, the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) spoke of a cruel murder. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement issued an announcement holding the police responsible for the incident and stated that people "must answer the government's policies en masse and peacefully," while the Hellenic Federation of University Teachers' Associations (POSDEP) called a three-day strike, condemning the killing of the teenager.
From Moscow, where he attended Patriarch Alexy II's funeral, Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens called on everyone to face the crisis and the problems ahead with co-operation and not with destruction. Also in an interview on 13 December, the Archbishop added that the "youths are not enraged for no reason" and stated his belief that the effects of the global economic crisis coupled with the large unemployment rate are the causes of this violent outburst.
On 10 December, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced 7 governmental measures to aid the large number of Greek businesses that were damaged by the rioters, also aiding businesses that are undamaged. The Prime Minister stated that the commercial world of the country faced the destructive mania and the raw violence of extremist groups. "The government", he said, "will ensure the sentiment of public safety and support all damaged businesses.
The General Federation of Professional Tradesmen and Traders of Greece saluted the measures and agreed with the direction that the measures were headed in.
On 12 December, Vice-Minister of the Interior Panagiotis Chinofotis, as a political leader of the Greek Police, said that he felt that he had to ask for forgiveness for the shooting incident and the resulting death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, since neither the defendant nor the defendant's lawyer did so.
On 16 December, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis speaking to New Democracy (Greece)’s parliamentary group, condemned the killing of the 15-year-old by the policeman, while calling for all parties to isolate rioters. He also acknowledged that "Long-unresolved problems, such as the lack of meritocracy, corruption in everyday life and a sense of social injustice disappoint young people". Karamanlis said income-tax cuts will go ahead. But he warned against high expectations, saying Greece will spend 12 billion euros, about 5 percent of GDP, just to service its debt. "Our top priority is to support those hurt the most ... (but) this debt is a huge burden that reduces the government's flexibility at this critical time".
Criticism.
Criticism of the Government.
On 10 December the Communist Party of Greece's Central Committee released a written statement where they said that "an effort is being made by the bourgeoisie state, the ND government to utilise the blind violence of the hooded people, which we are witnessing mainly through the television channels, to check the swelling wave of discontent and popular intervention that is developing."
On 12 December, PASOK leader George Papandreou speaking before his party's political council members blamed the ruling New Democracy government for the recent violent street protests in Athens and other parts of the country. He held the government solely responsible for everything taking place in the country, stated that "the government itself is the problem" and called for early elections so that, the Greek people will be able to provide a clear mandate.
On the same day, MP Adonis Georgiades of the Popular Orthodox Rally accused the political leadership of the Greek police for giving orders to the riot police not to intervene effectively to stop the riots at their initial stage. Also Popular Orthodox Rally proposed a project that anyone hooded should be arrested, to stop university asylum, ban protests and review the role of the army, in order to stop the riots.
In a meeting with police labor unionists, Alekos Alavanos the parliamentary leader of the Coalition of the Radical Left criticised the government for using the riot police as their own "army", he also, asked for an inter-party committee to examine the responsibilities and rights of the Greek police, whereas Alexis Tsipras, current president of the Coalition of the Radical Left, declared that the situation is indeed very grim and that the Greek government needs to find solutions for the actual causes of this "new social phenomenon".
Criticism of the Coalition of the Radical Left.
Aleka Papariga, Secretary General of the Communist Party of Greece, called the leadership of the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) to "stop patting the hooded rioters on the back". Georgios Karatzaferis, president of the Popular Orthodox Rally, also stated that "there are some political powers that are serious, and some that pat them on the back...". Alexis Tsipras, SYRIZA president, replied "we don't pat them on the back, and we don't take the role of the state's prosecutor either". He attacked the Communist Party, describing it as a conservative power that is disturbed when the youth spontaneously storm the streets. He also stated that the young people of the country have reached a deadlock, and this deadlock and their problems force them to the streets. Nikos Konstantopoulos, former SYRIZA chairman, spoke to a local radio station and criticised the present party leadership for not condemning the riots directly.
On Thursday 11th, Georgios Karatzaferis referred to a press release of the newspaper "Adesmeutos Typos" which, he claimed, had an MP of the Coalition supporting "the terrorism" instead of condemning the riots. Alekos Alavanos replied that, "Some have lost sense of what they say and what antidemocratic consequences their sayings might bring". On Friday 12th, in the parliament, MPs of both ruling New Democracy and the PASOK opposition criticised SYRIZA for not condemning the riots, and for Alexis Tsipras's statement that "the struggle must be moved in the schools".
On Sunday 15th, Alexis Tsipras current president of SYRIZA called an unscheduled press conference where he dismissed criticism and decried what he called "slanderous" statements against the recent protests, he also added that "Synaspismos and its affiliated Parliamentary group, SYRIZA, are in an ideological conflict with the hooded gangs, because violence brings forth violence and leads to an impasse".
Criticism of the media.
On 9 December, a photographer working for the newspaper Eleftheros Typos, who had taken on 7 December some snap-shots of a policeman targeting protesters with his gun, was fired, as the paper's editor claimed he was responsible for the leakage of the photos in the Internet. The photographer claimed the photos were not any more in his possession in the time of the leak, said that the editor was unwilling to publish them and denounced his sack as an attempt of political censorship, while left-wing newspapers and websites noted the editor's pro-government stance during the riots. The same newspaper received harsh criticism for misquoting Isocrates in its front page of 10 December.
On 13 December, the Greek National Council of Radio and Television informed all radio and television stations throughout the country that they should be careful in how they broadcast the news about the riots. The Council informed the stations mainly of the necessity of not showing scenes of extreme violence (in ways that might be interpreted as encouraging extreme anti-social behavior), to avoid acting as if they were judicial authorities, and to avoid showing in public documents and other elements that might be the subject of legal proceedings. The Council noted that "there is danger of breaking the broadcasting laws by the way of presenting the latest events."
Financial consequences for the Greek economy.
After the first days of demonstrations and the presentation of the 2009 state budget, that predicted solid economic growth in spite of the 2008 economic crisis, the spread of the Greek 10 year Government bonds had, by 12 December 2008, widened to 230 basis points against the corresponding German Government bonds (Bundesanleihen), a level that represents the highest level for the past nine years and the highest since the country entered the eurozone. This had an immediate effect on the cost of financing for Greece’s government; these costs rose considerably as a higher yield had to be paid on any bonds it sold. In addition, and given the credit crisis prevalent at the time, this curtailed its ability to issue bonds at all since investors were more risk averse than normal.
Additionally, on Wednesday, 17 December 2008, the credit rating agency Moody’s declared it would put Greece’s credit rating, already the lowest in the Eurozone at A1, off positive outlook if political and economic instability continued.

This Week in NASCAR

This Week in NASCAR (formerly "Inside Nextel Cup"), was a 60-minute program that aired Monday nights on the Speed Channel. It was hosted by veteran NASCAR personality Steve Byrnes with panel members Michael Waltrip and Greg Biffle. Other panelists such as Chad Knaus, Bootie Barker and Dave Blaney made regular appearances.

History.
"This Week in NASCAR" replaced "Inside NEXTEL Cup" in 2008, with NASCAR personality Steve Byrnes as host from February 18. "This Week in NASCAR" also replaced the NASCAR Sprint Cup race re-cap and analysis show. It moved into a "handoff" position between events, reviewing topical items from previous races in all three NASCAR national touring series, while also looking forward to upcoming events. Familiar faces also joining the show, including Michael Waltrip and Greg Biffle, who remained a regular Monday night panelist, with NASCAR crew chiefs including four-time champ, Chad Knaus.
The show was pulled at the end of 2009, citing that the show did not "connect with the fans". This decision was met with outrage from many NASCAR fans, with anger especially directed towards the shows replacing its slot.
In 2010, Showtime started a show called Inside NASCAR. It is very similar to This Week In NASCAR, but it runs with Showtimes other programs like "Inside the NFL".
Preemptions.

Klann linkage

The Klann linkage is a planar mechanism designed to simulate the gait of legged animal and function as a wheel replacement. The linkage consists of the frame, a crank, two grounded rockers, and two couplers all connected by pivot joints. 
The proportions of each of the links in the mechanism are defined to optimize the linearity of the foot for one-half of the rotation of the crank. The remaining rotation of the crank allows the foot to be raised to a predetermined height before returning to the starting position and repeating the cycle. Two of these linkages coupled together at the crank and one-half cycle out of phase with each other will allow the frame of a vehicle to travel parallel to the ground.
The Klann linkage provides many of the benefits of more advanced walking vehicles without some of their limitations. It can step over curbs, climb stairs, or travel into areas that are currently not accessible with wheels but does not require microprocessor control or multitudes of actuator mechanisms. It fits into the technological space between these walking devices and axle-driven wheels.
History.
The Klann linkage was developed by Joe Klann in 1994 as an expansion of Burmester curves which are used to develop four-bar double-rocker linkages such as harbor crane booms. It is categorized as a modified Stephenson type III kinematic chain.

The Kingdom of Solomon

The Kingdom of Solomon is an Iranian religious/historical film trilogy, produced by Mojtaba Faravardeh and directed by Shahriar Bahrani who has made Saint Mary before.
The Kingdom of Solomon was going to be released internationally on November 2010 after its screening in Iran, but due to some technicalities its global release has been delayed. The film tells the life story of Prophet Solomon, the King of Israelites. It is mostly based on the Islamic accounts of Solomon's prophetic life extracted from the Qur'an but it also draws upon parallels found in some Jewish texts.
Plot.
Solomon is a wise prophet selected as the crown prince by his father King David (Dawud in Islamic texts) when he was 9. Following Prophet David's death, Solomon succeeds to the crown and God appoints him as a prophet. Requesting from God the establishment of a divine kingdom, Solomon takes the wind under his command and jinns and demons under his control. Inviting rulers of the neighbouring lands to the monotheistic religion, Prophet Solomon continues his divine mission in as much as Balqis, the Queen of Sheba professes monotheism. At the end, while leaning on his cane, Solomon bids farewell to the world, and the jinns and demons get out of reign and return to their own world.
Part one.
Solomon, the prophet and king of Judah, asks God to grant him an ideal kingdom and a promised paradise not to be given to anyone until the end of the world. For this to be fulfilled, he should face the world of the devils (jinns and demons), their materialization, and an imminent and cruel war with them. Filled with disbelief and blasphemy, the heads of the different tribes of the Israelites reject his calls for help. When disaster strikes and the people get demonic and lunatic, barely can Solomon control the crisis. But as soon as the creatures take material form, he prays for God's help and favour to overcome their onslaught. So god helps him and the devils get scared of Prophet Solomon.
Part two.
Filming of this past has not begun yet but its production and casting is under review:
Solomon is announced by God in the Qur'an to have control over various elements, such as winds, to use them for different purposes including transportation. He travels to several territories and builds towers and monuments using the power of jinns. He also sets up a crystal palace in Jerusalem al-Quds. Then he meets the Queen of Sheba and, according to Islamic texts, introduces her into Islam ("submission to God").

Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development

The Holy Land Foundation was the largest Islamic charity in the United States. Headquartered in Richardson, Texas, it was originally known as Occupied Land Fund.
In December 2001, the U.S. government designated HLF a terrorist organization, seized its assets, and closed the charity. In 2004, a federal grand jury in Dallas, Texas charged HLF and five former officers and employees with providing material support to Hamas and related offenses. The prosecution did not allege that HLF funded violence; rather, its theory was that HLF distributed charity through local zakat (charity) committees located in the West Bank; that Hamas controlled those zakat committees; and that by distributing charity through Hamas-controlled committees, HLF helped Hamas win the "hearts and minds" of the Palestinian people. 
The first trial, in 2007, ended in the partial acquittal of one defendant and a hung jury on all other charges. The jury did not return any guilty verdicts. At a retrial in 2008, the jury found all defendants guilty on all counts. The 2008 trial of the charity leaders was dubbed the "largest terrorism financing prosecution in American history." In 2009, the founders of the organization were given sentences of between 15 and 65 years in prison for "funneling $12 million to Hamas."
The organization's website stated: "Our mission is to find and implement practical solutions for human suffering through humanitarian programs that impact the lives of the disadvantaged, disinherited, and displaced peoples suffering from man-made and natural disasters." Their primary area of focus was with the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. They also provided support to victims after disasters and wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Turkey, and the United States (after Iowa floods, Texas tornadoes, and the Oklahoma City bombing).
Designation as a terrorist organization.
HLF, originally known as the Occupied Land Fund, was established in California in 1989 as a tax-exempt charity. In 1992, HLF relocated to Richardson, Texas. It had offices in California, New Jersey, and Illinois, and individual representatives scattered throughout the US, the West Bank, and Gaza. Among the founders of the Holy Land Foundation is Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, a political leader of Hamas, who provided substantial funds to the Holy Land Foundation in the early 1990s, before Hamas was designated a terrorist organization. HLF reported Marzook's donations on its tax returns. Marzook was deported from the US to Jordan in 1997. He was indicted on August 20, 2004, by a US federal grand jury in Chicago, Illinois. He and two other individuals were charged with a 15-year conspiracy to raise funds for terrorist attacks against Israel. Neither HLF nor any HLF officer was charged in the Chicago indictment.
In the year 2000, HLF raised over $13 million. According to the United States Department of Treasury, HLF supported Hamas activities through direct fund transfers to its offices in the West Bank and Gaza that are affiliated with Hamas, and transfers of funds to Islamic charity committees ("zakat committees") and other charitable organizations that are part of Hamas or controlled by Hamas members. The Department of Treasury also reported that HLF funds were used by Hamas to support schools that served Hamas's ends by encouraging children to become suicide bombers and to recruit suicide bombers by offering support to their families. Edward Abington, Jr., former U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, acted as a defence witness and testified that during his daily CIA briefings he had never been informed that Hamas controlled the Palestinian charity groups mentioned.
The Treasury Department designated HLF as a terrorist organization on December 4, 2001 under President Bush's Executive Order 13224 (Bush). The United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control designated HLF as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist,
while the European Union froze its European Assets.
Chronology of events.
On December 4, 2001, following HLF's designation as a terrorist organization, the assets of the organization were frozen by the FBI and Treasury agents. Treasury officials conceded that a "substantial amount" of the money raised went to worthy causes, but insisted that Holy Land's primary purpose had been to subsidize Hamas. Repeated appeals to the courts by HLF to have the freeze lifted failed.
On July 27, 2004, a federal grand jury in Dallas, Texas, returned a 42-count indictment against the Holy Land Foundation.
Charges included: conspiracy, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, tax evasion, and money laundering. The indictment alleged that the Holy Land Foundation provided more than $12.4 million to individuals and organizations linked to Hamas from 1995 to 2001, when their assets were frozen. The indictment also named specific officers of the Holy Land Foundation: President Shukri Abu Baker; Chairman Ghassan Elashi; and Executive Director Haitham Maghawri, and four others: Mohammad el-Mezain, Akram Mishal, Mufid Abdulqader, and Abdulraham Odeh. Five of the seven were arrested. Maghawri and Mishal have not been found, and are considered fugitives.
In December 2004, a federal judge in Chicago ruled that the Holy Land Foundation (along with the Islamic Association of Palestine and the Quranic Literacy Institute) was liable in a $156 million lawsuit for aiding and abetting the militant group Hamas in the death of a 17-year-old American citizen named David Boim. In 2007 this decision was reversed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
“On November 3, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago upheld in large measure a $156 million award to the parents of David Boim, a 17-year-old U.S. citizen murdered by members of Hamas while visiting Israel.”
“The en banc court agreed with WLF that those who donate funds to a known terrorist group are responsible under U.S. law for the group's actions -- even if the donors contend that they only intended to support the group's "humanitarian" activities.”
“The court also rejected the 7th Circuit panel's conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to find Hamas was responsible the teenager's death.” 
2007 trial.
The first HLF criminal trial began on July 23, 2007, at the Earl Cabell Federal Building in Dallas, Texas. On October 22, 2007, Judge Joe Fish declared a mistrial because the jurors were deadlocked.
Testimony and evidence.
During the 2007 trial the lawyers representing the foundation said that the Justice Department fabricated quotes and modified transcripts. Critics faulted much of the evidence given during the trial. For example, over defense objection, the government called two anonymous witnesses: an Israeli Security Agency employee who was known to the jurors and the defense as "Avi" and an Israeli Defense Forces officer who was known to the jurors and the defense as "Major Lior." Even the defense lawyers were not permitted to know the names of these witnesses. The government did not allege that HLF paid directly for suicide bombings, but instead that the foundation supported terrorism by sending more than $12 million to charitable groups, known as zakat committees, which build hospitals and feed the poor. The prosecution said the committees were controlled by Hamas, and contributed to terrorism by helping Hamas spread its ideology and recruit supporters. Some of these charitable committees were still receiving US funding through the USAID programme as late as 2006. None of the zakat committees was included on the Treasury Department list of designated terrorist organizations.
Mistrial.
After 19 days of deliberations, the 2007 jury was unable to come to a definitive conclusion and the case ended in a mistrial. While 200 charges were filed against the defendants, the jurors had acquitted on some counts and were deadlocked on charges ranging from tax violations to providing material support for terrorists. One defendant was acquitted of most of the 32 charges against him. "The New York Times" reported: "The decision today is 'a stunning setback for the government, there's no other way of looking at it,' said Matthew D. Orwig, a partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal who was, until recently, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. 'This is a message, a two-by-four in the middle of the forehead,' Orwig said. 'If this doesn’t get their attention, they are just in complete denial,' he said of Justice Department officials, whom he said may not have recognized how difficult such cases are to prosecute."
Experts found the jury's inability to come to a definitive conclusion to be evidence of weakness in the government's ability to provide clear enough evidence against the charity. The "LA Times" reported that Georgetown University law professor David Cole said: "If the government can shut them down and then not convince a jury the group is guilty of any wrongdoing, then there is something wrong with the process". "The whole case was based on assumptions that were based on suspicions", said juror Scroggins, who added: "If they had been a Christian or Jewish group, I don't think would have brought charges against them."
2008 retrial; convictions.
The HLF retrial began on August 18, 2008. The prosecution again presented the two anonymous Israeli witnesses, "Avi" and "Major Lior." In an effort to strengthen its unsuccessful presentation at the first trial, the prosecution added testimony from former National Security Council staff member Steven Simon, from Treasury Department official Robert McBrien, and from Mohamed Shorbagi, who had pleaded guilty to charges unrelated to HLF and was cooperating with the prosecution. The prosecution also placed into evidence documents that, according to "Major Lior," the IDF had recovered from the Palestinian Authority headquarters in Ramallah during an IDF operation in 2002 known as "Operation Defensive Shield."
On November 24, 2008, the government obtained guilty verdicts on all counts against HLF and the five individual defendants in the retrial. HLF was found guilty of giving more than $12 million to support Hamas. The charges on which the jury found the defendants guilty included conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
"Today's verdicts are important milestones in America's efforts against financiers of terrorism", Patrick Rowan, assistant attorney general for national security, said after the trial. "This prosecution demonstrates our resolve to ensure that humanitarian relief efforts are not used as a mechanism to disguise and enable support for terrorist groups."
The five convicted individuals were Ghassan Elashi, former CEO Shukri Abu-Baker, Mufid Abdulqader, Abdulrahman Odeh, and Mohammad El-Mezain. 
Because of the potential lengthy sentences for the criminal convictions, the individual defendants were remanded into custody without bail pending any appeal.
A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.
The defendants appealed their convictions and sentences to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 7, 2011, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court found that the trial court had erred in admitting each of the additional items of evidence on which the prosecution relied in the second trial (the Simon testimony, the McBrien testimony, the Shorbagi testimony, and the documents recovered from the Palestinian Authority headquarters). But the court of appeals found that the errors in admitting this evidence were harmless (i.e., that the errors did not affect the outcome of the trial).
The defendants petitioned the court of appeals for rehearing. They contended that the four erroneously admitted items of evidence were the key differences between the first trial, where the jury did not return a single guilty verdict, and the second trial, where the jury returned guilty verdicts on every count. The court of appeals denied the petition for rehearing without comment.
In May 2012, Elashi, Baker, Abdulqader, and Odeh filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, challenging their convictions on Sixth Amendment grounds and thereby requesting that the high court review their convictions. The defendants asserted that the prosecution's use of two anonymous witnesses during their trial was impermissible as a matter of law. 
On October 29, 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari.
An Explanatory Memorandum On the General Strategic Goal for the Group In North America.
An Explanatory Memorandum On the General Strategic Goal for the Group In North America is a document seized by the government that was used in the 2008 "United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development" case. The verdict found the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development guilty of laundering money to Hamas. According to the Anti-Defamation League, some observers have suggested that this document "identifies a conspiracy by the Muslim Brotherhood to convert the United States to an Islamic nation." 
The memorandum was written in 1991 by Mohamed Akram, a senior Hamas leader in the U.S., a member of the Board of Directors for the Muslim Brotherhood in North America (also known as the Ikhwan) and one of many unindicted co-conspirators in the HLF trial. He asked them to read it for approval as an update and restatement of the plan they had adopted in 1987.
The memorandum was cited by the September 2010 Center for Security Policy (CSP) report, "Shariah: The Threat to America" and endorsed by several members of Congress.
Related groups.
Elashi, HLF chairman, was also vice president of InfoCom Corporation of Richardson, Texas, indicted along with Hamas' Marzook.

"Kuiama" is a song written by Jeff Lynne and performed by Electric Light Orchestra. 
The song is the last track of the "ELO 2" LP. At 11:19, it is the longest track on the album, and the longest song ever recorded by Electric Light Orchestra. It tells the tale of a soldier who has found an orphan girl wandering the ruins of a battle-ravaged village in the Vietnam war. The soldier is trying to comfort the girl and also to explain how he was the one who killed her parents.
Although not released as a single, the song has been included on many compilation albums, such as "Olé ELO", "Afterglow", and "The Light Shines On Vol 2", and has been performed live. It was also a favorite of the ELO band members during the time.
"This one, without doubt, is the favourite of all the band. It's a sad story about a war orphan with a soldier explaining to her all about the war — and that it was he that killed her parents. The most sensitive thing we do."Bev Bevan (1973, Birmingham Post & Mail article entitled: Chart Boost Coming For Brum And E.L.O.)

Snake Wells

Snake Wells is a term used by Shell Oil to refer to a series of oil wells drilled in the Champion West oil field offshore Brunei. The wells used a combination of technologies including extended reach drilling, swellable wellbore packers and remotely operated zonal isolation and control. The directional drilling technique allows the path of the well to be directed to achieve contact with as many potentially producing features as possible. This results in a "snake like" well path which weaves up and down through multiple geological features in order to achieve maximum reservoir drainage.
Shells marketing suggests that this approach is an invention of Shell, however in reality the technologies involved have all been used before elsewhere. 
Shell's marketing states:
The creative minds at Shell refused to accept that so much perfectly good oil was going to waste - so they decided to do something about it. The snake well drill is a ground breaking piece of technology that allows us to extract oil from these previously hard to reach places. Unlike conventional drills, state of the art software allows the snake well drill to follow complex horizontal paths, cutting through shale and sand to reach a number of different reservoir pockets from a single drilling platform.
However despite the high complexity of the wells, the articles published in the industry publications refer only to existing technologies.

Lee Vanderbilt

Lee Vanderbilt (born Kenrick Pitt) was born in the mid-1930s in San Fernando, Trinidad, moving to the United Kingdom in the late 1950s. In 1964 he signed his first record deal using the stage name, "Ebony Keyes", with Parlophone Records, releasing two songs, "Brother Joe" and "Under the Apple Tree". In 1967, after an introduction from his friend Peter Gage (a founder of Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band and Vinegar Joe), he signed to Pye Records where he released a number of singles on the Pye Label; on their subsidiary record label Piccadilly Records and on the label of their primary Australian distributor, Astor Records. The records included: "If Our Love Should End"; "Sitting in a Ring"; "Country Girl"; "Cupid's House"; "How Many Times"; "Don't"; "Sweet Mary Anne (Sweeter Than a Rose)"; and the hit “If You Knew”. In 1968, he signed to the United Artists Record Label when, at the suggestion of an A&R executive, he changed his stage name from Ebony Keyes to "Lee Vanderbilt". While with United Artists he released a number of singles and sang on a number of film sound tracks including the theme song, “Some Girls Do”, for the British spy-spoof of the same name, directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Richard Johnson. "Some Girls Do" was released by United Artists as a single in 1969. In the same year Vanderbilt was asked to represent the United Kingdom at the Gibraltar Song Festival, where he won gold and bronze medals with two songs of his own composition, "How shall I Know" and "A Woman's Way".
The 1970s and onwards.
In the 1970s, Vanderbilt was regularly in the studio, working as a session musician. Through his session work he met many artists with whom he would go on to collaborate including an aspiring musical arranger, producer and songwriter from India called Biddu Appaiah (also known simply as Biddu). Biddu and Vanderbilt became friends and collaborated for many years on a number of projects. In 1973, Biddu established his own production company to which he signed a number of artists, including Vanderbilt. The first commercially successful artist signed to Biddu's production company was Carl Douglas who in 1974 released his well known disco hit “Kung Fu Fighting”. Carl Douglas also recorded three songs written by Lee Vanderbilt, “I Don’t Care What the People Say” (Biddu-Vanderbilt), “Stand Up For Love” and “Never Had This Dream Before”, all three of which appeared on his “Kung Fu Fighter” Album in 1974.
In 1976, Vanderbilt introduced his friend Tina Charles to Biddu, who Biddu signed and for whom he produced a number of worldwide hits including a single released in 1976 called “I Love to Love”. The B-side of that single was a song written by Vanderbilt called “Disco Fever”. Tina Charles also recorded Vanderbilt's song “All Comes Back to You” on her 1976 Album “Dance Little Lady”. "Jimmy James and the Vagabonds" also signed to Biddu’s production company. Jimmy James recorded a number of Vanderbilt's songs including: “Disco Fever”, “Never had this Dream Before”,"Let's Have Fun", "Suspicious Love" (Biddu/Vanderbilt) and a fifth song called “If You Think that Funk is Junk Your Drunk”. Biddu also had success with his own group known as the Biddu Orchestra. The Biddu Orchestra comprised a group of session musicians with whom Biddu and Vanderbilt had worked for many years. Biddu recorded two songs with the Biddu Orchestra written by Vanderbilt, “Funky Tropical” (which appeared both on his album "Eastern Man" and which he released as a single in 1977) and “Jump for Joy”. Vanderbilt was also a backing vocalists for the Biddu Orchestra.
In 1977, Vanderbilt released his own album on the RCA Record label called "Get Into What You're In". The songs on the album reflect his many musical influences, including funk numbers like "Funky Tropical" and "Show me What you Made Off"; soulful love song like "Coral Isle" and "Stand Up for Love"; and caribbeanesque number like "Sweet Ices" and "What a Way". The Album was produced by Biddu but did not achieve as much commercial success as it did critical acclaim.
In addition to releasing his own album, working with artists as a session singer and percussionist and collaborating with Biddu and the other artists signed to Biddu’s production company, in the 70s, Lee Vanderbilt performed a song, written by Oscar nominated song writer and businessman George Barrie, called "The Night Has Many Eyes", for the 1973 film “Night Watch” starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. The song was released as a single in 1973 on the Brut Record label. He wrote the theme music for the UK comedy movie “Black Joy” (performed by Jimmy Helms) released in 1977 and starring Norman Beaton, Trevor Thomas and Floella Benjamin; and wrote and performed a song called “Lonely I” for the same movie. During the 70s he also sang a number of well known and award winning television commercials including the Martini Hot Air Balloon Commercial; Tia Maria's “Get it Together” commercial; and one of Lilt’s “Totally Tropical Taste” commercials.
Other artists with whom Vanderbilt has worked including, amongst others, Edwyn Collins; Elkie Brooks; Joan Armatrading; George Chandler, Jimmy Helms, Jimmy Cambers (all founding members of the successful UK group Londonbeat); Anthony Moore; Barclay James Harvest; and Bryn Haworth.
Lee Vanderbilt still lives in the United Kingdom and continues to write and collaborate with artists and friends on musical projects. He has three sons, one of whom is an attorney living in New York and two of whom are recording artists, Gary Des-Etages and Christopher "Tambu" Herbert.

John Milton's religion

John Milton's religion was an important part of his life. He wrote many of his works focusing on the nature of religion and of the divine.
Theological political writings.
Church government.
After the start of the Bishops’ Wars, a movement was started calling for the disestablishment of the Church of England and the religious hierarchy. Milton joined in on a pamphlet war that soon followed and produced his antiprelatical tracts. These pamphlets emphasize the need for an individual to be exposed to scripture without any interference from a church government or from a fixed liturgy that could possibly corrupt the individual.
Divorce laws.
Milton married in Spring 1642 but his wife soon left him. The legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce and he began examining the legitimacy of divorce. Milton was motivated towards writing on the topic after reading a work of Martin Bucer that emphasized the scriptural legitimacy of divorce. After publishing his divorce pamphlets, especially after "Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce", Milton developed a reputation as both a divorcer and a polygamist. Eventually, Milton believed that a translation of Bucer's work, published as "Judgement of Martin Bucer Concerning Divorce", would convince Parliament of the truth behind his previous tract on divorce, but this did not happen. He continued to pursue the topic until his wife returned to him and their marriage was reconciled.
Paradise Lost.
"Paradise Lost" is Milton's epic depiction of the Fall of Man. In the story, Adam and Eve are warned against the evils of Satan and are told of the war in Heaven in which Satan challenged God's throne and was cast down in punishment. Satan, in order to get revenge against God, tempts Eve into indulging in the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and Adam, in turn, joins with her in the disobedience so she will not be blamed alone. God punishes them by casting them out of Eden and exposing them to the pain of the world, but he promises them that his Son will descend and bring about their salvation.
Paradise Regained.
"Paradise Regained" is a follow up epic based on Temptation of Christ. It is not as long as "Paradise Lost" and the poem places the Son, incarnated as Christ, against Satan. Through the work, Satan constantly tries to tempt Christ and to discover who he is, but he is unable to before he finally gives up and Christ defeats him.
Samson Agonistes.
"Samson Agonistes" is based on the format of Greek Tragedy and describes the Biblical story of Samson. When Samson is betrayed, he calls upon God to use him to effect his will and exact revenge upon God's enemies. God gives Samson the power to bring about this end, but the play does not depict the moment on stage and does not describe how God granted the power.
Views.
On the Soul.
Milton believed in the idea of soul sleeping or mortalism, which determines that the soul, upon death, is in a sleep like state until the Last Judgment. Similarly, he believed that Christ, when incarnated, merged his divine and human identities, and that both of these identities died during his Crucifixion. With such views on the nature of the human body and the soul, there is no possibility of a state of existence between death and the resurrection, and concepts such as Purgatory are outright denied. However, these views are not standard Calvinistic interpretations, but his views on what happens after the resurrection are orthodox Calvinistic doctrine: Christ, during the resurrection, would raise man up higher than the state he was in before the fall.
Religious toleration.
John Milton called in the "Aeropagitica" for "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties" (applied however, only to the conflicting Protestant sects, and not to atheists, Jews, Moslems or even Catholics). "Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel."

Lululaund

Lululaund was the Romanesque revival style house and studio of German-born British artist Hubert von Herkomer, in Melbourne Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire. It was designed in c.1886 and inhabited in 1894. It was demolished in 1939. The exterior design was developed from a sketch by the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson and was the only example of his work in Europe. It was an influence on the work of English architect Charles Harrison Townsend.
Design.
In the 1880s, von Herkomer had travelled to America twice to paint portraits and to give lectures. In early 1886, he painted the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson in exchange for a home design he could bring back to Britain. Richardson, at the peak of his career and only months before his death at age 47, sketched a single picture of a four storey Romanesque castle, explicitly allowing Herkomer to change the exterior "at will". From this sketch, von Herkomer commissioned the house.
Herkomer's father and two of his three uncles contributed to the idea, which was honoured by the artist in the triptych "The Makers of my House". His uncle John, a joiner and carver, as was Herkomer's father Lorenz, came from America to assist, and his uncle Anton, a weaver, provided the draperies designed by the artist.
The house was built in white tufa from Bavaria and red sandstone. A plinth of courses of rugged stone formed the lower level, above was a wide segmental arch across most of the frontage and this was framed by two round turreted towers. At the top was a patterned gable. A tower rising above the front door was truncated during its construction when von Herkomer discovered it would obstruct light into his studio. Herkomer was solely responsible for the design of the interiors. The rooms were in German gothic style, extravagantly decorated with elaborate wood carvings executed by himself and members of his family. The principal bedroom had a copper ceiling and had wood carved walls entirely covered with gold leaf. The hall and staircase were lined with panels of redwood, three feet wide and 30 feet high. The dining room was decorated with a relief frieze of nude female figures, illustrating "Human Sympathy". It was illuminated by concealed electric lights an innovation for its day. The drawing room had a vast arched chimney-piece and a music gallery . The house was, for its time, built to a very high technical standard, had for instance electricity from its own generator (in a sidehouse), as well as hot and cold water in each bedroom.
History.
Herkomer named the house Lululaund after his deceased wife, Lulu, who had died from a heart attack in 1885. The architect, Richardson, also died, long before the house was completed. Von Herkomer lived in the house from its completion in 1894 until his death in 1914. Lululaund was nicknamed the 'Bavarian castle' by Bushey residents.
Herkomer built a theatre in the grounds where he staged ‘pictorial-music-plays’ that he partly wrote and designed himself. When Herkomer became a pioneer of cinematography the theatre was later turned into a film studio and cinema, and he directed and acted in several films that were released commercially.
When Herkomer died in 1914, his third wife, Margaret, Lady Herkomer, sister of his second wife, Lulu Griffiths, the house's namesake, moved out of Lululaund to another property nearby. Lululaund was requisitioned during the First World War, but subsequently remained largely unoccupied. The house and the film studio were leased in 1915 by the British Actors Film Company for use as their principle production base. The company ran into financial difficulties in the early 1920s and closed the site in 1923. The film boom of the 1930s caused it to reopen the studeo making short films.
During the 1920s and 1930s the surrounding estate land was gradually broken-up and sold for development. The buildings largely fell into disuse. For a number of years the house became the haunt of tramps, courting couples and schoolboys. Lady Herkomer died in 1934, and the trustees of the Herkomer Estate offered the house, rose garden and kitchen garden to Bushey Urban District Council. The house was refused due to the high cost of maintenance but in 1937 the rose garden was transferred to the ownership of the Council. Lululaund was almost completely demolished in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, with only a remnant surviving. It is possible that anti German feeling and the fear it was as an elevated landmark and a navigational marker for enemy bombers influenced the decision.
Much of the masonry from the demolition went as hardcore to build Bovingdon Airfield in 1941.
Films continued to be made in the studio until 1985 when it too closed.
A small portion of Richardson's façade survives: the front door and its tympanum, now the entrance to the former local British Legion hall on Melbourne Road. The rose garden, summer-house, sunken garden and pergola were preserved and are now public gardens known as 'The Bushey Rose Garden. At 2013 the British Legion hall was being redeveloped as housing.
Quotations.
von Herkomer wrote in the 1911 second volume of his autobiography :
""Completed it is not, nor would I wish to feel that the last touch had been put to it. It should still have the possibility of growth, otherwise expectancy would cease, and with it life's greatest stimulant.""
His biographer, Baldry, wrote in 1901 :
""There has been in existence in his family for some generations an idea that there should be erected some day a house which would be at the same time a memorial of the Herkomers and a record of the work that they had done in the world.""

<doc id="20577911" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20577911" title="Trading halt">
Trading halt

A trading halt occurs in the U.S. when a stock exchange stops trading on a specific security for a certain time period. The halt, which can happen a few times a day per security if FINRA deems it, usually lasts for one hour, but is not limited to that. Trading halts occur during the trading day (intraday), while a "trading delay" occurs at the beginning of the trading day (delayed opening). The first 5 minutes of a halt is for "news pending" before any information is released that could affect a stock significantly, also known as the "5 minute window".
Trading halts usually occur when a publicly traded company is going to release significant news about itself. The halt in trading for the affected security gives investors time to review the news and assess its impact. Another situation in which a trading halt might occur is when the exchange is uncertain "whether the security continues to meet the market’s listing standards." 
Note, there are also "trading pauses", which are defined as, under NASDAQ, "if a security is subject to a Trading Pause, the Pause Threshold Price field will contain the reference threshold price that deviates 10% from a print on the Consolidated Tape that is last sale eligible as compared to every print in that security on a rolling five (5) minute basis".
Regulatory and non-regulatory trading halts.
Both of the reasons mentioned above are "regulatory" trading halts and are implemented on many major stock exchanges (for example, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and New York Stock Exchange). When a United States exchange enacts a regulatory halt for a security, other U.S. exchanges that also trade the security will honor the halt.
The NASDAQ and other exchanges currently use 11 codes to specify in more detail why trading has been halted for a security. The Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) currently uses 5 codes.
A "non-regulatory" trading halt occurs if "significant order imbalance between buyers and sellers in a security" exist. (The NASDAQ stock exchange does not implement non-regulatory trading halts.) Before trading resumes, market specialists must determine an appropriate price range in which the security can trade. Unlike regulatory halts, other U.S. exchanges do not always stop trading a security affected by the non-regulatory halt.
NASDAQ OMX (owner of the NASDAQ stock market) displays current trading halts for the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange, along with a rolling 21-day history. The OTCBB maintains its own trading halt list and a rolling 6-month history.
Trading suspension.
A "trading suspension" occurs when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stops trading for a specific security because of "serious questions ... about a company’s assets, operations, or other financial information." Note that in this case, it is the SEC — not the exchange — stopping the security from being traded. 
Trading curb.
Trading curbs stop trading for an entire exchange when the market has experienced a drop (or several drops) in value.

Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year

The Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year was an annual basketball award given to the most outstanding intercollegiate men's basketball player in the United States. The award was first given following the 1904–05 season and ceased being awarded after the 1978–79 season. It was the first major most valuable player (MVP) award for men's basketball in the United States, and the Helms Athletic Foundation was considered within the basketball community to be the authority on men's college basketball for that era. Thus, the award was viewed as the premier player of the year award one could receive up until the 1960s, at which point the Naismith College Player of the Year and John R. Wooden Award took over as the national season MVP awards.

"Frustrated, and realizing that California afforded the opportunity to make films year round, David Horsley moved his operations to the west coast." Company name changed to Nestor Motion Picture Company.
Nestor Studios Hollywood.
In the fall of 1911, the Nestor Motion Picture Company opened the first motion picture studio in Hollywood in the Blondeau Tavern building at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street.

The two rented facilities from Quality Pictures Corporation at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, the place where Al Christie had first started in Hollywood. For the first six months of operations, the new Christie Film Company made comedies under a contract with Universal Film. In July of that year, the company began producing other comedies to sell to the independent distributors and their immediate success was such that they were soon able to finance the acquisition of their studio property. Within a short time, the Christie brothers doubled their stage capacity and constructed a film laboratory equipped with the latest in technology.

Harp switch stand

A harp switch stand is a type of railroad switch stand that was most common during the 19th century in the United States. The name derives from the characteristic shape of the stand. The harp stand was typically used in conjunction with the stub switch. It remained in use longest among narrow gauge railroads such as the Denver & Rio Grande well into the 20th century.
The harp mechanism was a simple lever which pivoted on an axle pin located midway up the main body (the "frame") of the stand. The upper part of the lever passed through a slot atop the stand. A signal target was usually attached at the top of the lever. The lower end of the lever extended below the main body of the stand where it attached to a bar. Pulling on the lever would pull this bar which in turn would move the rail into the desired position. The lever was sometimes secured by notches along the slot at the top of the stand. Variations of this basic design were common.
Harp stands were of two types: a two-position and a three-position, for use with two-way and three-way turnouts, respectively.

Boyuk Jeddikar

Büyük Jeddikar (; 3 February 1929 – 18 December 2013) was an Iranian footballer.
He is known for being the first footballer in Iranian football history to be transferred from an Iranian club to a foreign club.
Club career.
Jedikar first started playing in the position of goalkeeper. His talent of using the left-foot was discovered by coach Ali Danaeifard who suggested that Jeddikar should move upfront and play as a left striker. This discovery paid off and Jeddikar soon became one of the best footballers in the country.
In 1957, he was transferred to Viktoria 89 Berlin on a three-year contract with a 1500 Deutschmarks a month salary, however his time in Germany was shortened when his father died, so after only 9 months Jeddikar returned to Iran to resume his career with Taj SC (currently Esteghlal).
Prior to Jeddikar's transfer, past Iranian footballers only had played outside Iran whilst they were studying abroad such as Hossein Sadaghiani (Belgium, Turkey and Austria), Hossein-Ali Khan Sardar (Belgium and Switzerland), Ahmad-Ali Khan Sardar (Belgium), Khan Khanan (Belgium) and Masoud Boroumand (United States and Lebanon) were all footballers studying and playing abroad. Jedikar's transfer to Germany paved the way for future footballers such as Parviz Koozehkanani, Hamid Shirzadegan and Mohammad Reza Adelkhani.
International career.
At the age of 17 he was selected for Tehran XI. However his first national cap was versus Afghanistan in 1950 and his last cap was versus Turkey in 1965.

Mbaye-Jacques Diop

Mbaye-Jacques Diop (born 15 January 1936) is a Senegalese political figure. He served as a Deputy in the National Assembly of Senegal from 1983 to 2004, as Mayor of Rufisque from 1987 to 2002, and as President of the Council of the Republic for Economic and Social Affairs (CRAES) from 2004 to 2007. He was a long-time member of the Socialist Party (PS), but split from the PS to form his own party, the Party for Progress and Citizenship (PPC), in 2000, before merging that party into the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) two years later.
Political career.
Diop was born in Rufisque and joined the Youth Movement of the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1954 as a founding member. He became the Secretary-General for Organization and Propaganda of the Youth Union of the Senegalese Popular Bloc in 1957; after the Bloc was transformed into the Senegalese Progressive Union, he continued to hold the same post in its youth movement until 1964. Additionally, he was successively a member of the Political Bureau of the Bloc and then the Senegalese Progressive Union from 1957 to 1967. At the Cotonou congress of the African Regroupment Party in July 1958, Diop was a delegate representing the youth of Senegal; he was subsequently the Secretary for Foreign Relations of the National Youth Union of Mali from 1959 to 1960. He was first elected as a municipal councillor in Rufisque in 1964 and was continuously re-elected during the subsequent decades. 
Later, Diop was the Director of the PS Cadre School, which he founded, from 1975 to 1980; also during that period, he was Coordinator of the PS Study and Reflection Group (GER) from 1976 to 1978 and was Permanent Secretary of the PS Political Bureau from 1977 to 1980. He was the Secretary-General of the PS Communal Coordination from 1982 to 1990. Diop was elected to the National Assembly in the 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998 elections as a PS candidate; he also became Mayor of Rufisque in 1987 and was Vice-President of the Association of Mayors of Senegal from 1988 to 2002. Additionally, he held the posts of Secretary-General of the PS Regional Union in Dakar and First Vice-President of the Urban Community of Dakar from 1990 to 2000. In the National Assembly, Diop was President of the Laws and Human Rights Commission from 1996 to 2000 and President of the Defense and Security Commission from 2000 to 2001.
Shortly before the first round of the 2000 presidential election, violence broke out between supporters of the PS and the opposition in Rufisque on 23 February 2000; there were six injuries, and two homes owned by Diop were set on fire. He described it as "a grave sign for democracy in Senegal". After the first round, Diop resigned from the PS on 2 March 2000, choosing to support opposition candidate Abdoulaye Wade against the incumbent president and PS candidate Abdou Diouf and joining a pro-Wade alliance, the Front for the "Alternance". According to Diop, his defection "dealt a severe political, electoral and psychological blow to the PS and its candidate, Abdou Diouf", who was defeated by Wade in the second round. He then founded a new party, the PPC, on 30 May 2000, becoming its Secretary-General. Subsequently he was elected to the National Assembly as a PPC candidate through national list proportional representation in the April 2001 parliamentary election; he was the only PPC candidate to win a seat.
The PPC merged itself into Wade's party, the PDS, on 20 May 2002; Diop became National Political Secretary of the PDS at that time. Also in 2002, Diop left his position as Mayor of Rufisque, instead becoming Honorary Mayor instead. He joined the National Political Administration of the PDS in May 2003 and joined the PDS Steering Committee in May 2004. Wade then appointed Diop as President of the CRAES when that body was created in August 2004. Diop also became President of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie in June 2007. On 1 October 2007, Wade asked Diop to resign from his position as President of the CRAES, while stressing that he did not have a dispute with Diop and did not want to start one. Diop was unwilling to resign, however, saying that he had done nothing wrong and that people would not understand if he left his post prior to the end of his five-year term in August 2009. On 4 October, when Diop was preparing to travel to a meeting of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie, Wade barred him from leaving the country. After Iba Der Thiam mediated the situation, Diop agreed to resign on 16 November, but Wade nevertheless criticized Diop at a meeting of the PDS Steering Committee, saying that he had wasted 300 million CFA francs on "whimisical missions". Wade dissolved the CRAES on 21 November 2007 and established a new Economic and Social Council in its place.
On 13 February 2008, the Grand Marabout of the Mourides, Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacké, asked Diop to return from Paris to meet with Wade in Dakar on 14 February. Wade and Diop accordingly met at the presidential palace and discussed the reasons for Wade's dissolution of the CRAES. On this occasion, Wade complained that Diop had failed to campaign for him in the February 2007 presidential election, while Diop said that he had created a slogan supporting Wade's candidacy and that he had toured the regional capitals to speak in support of Wade's candidacy. Wade also said that he had heard that Diop had boasted that Wade could not act against him; Diop replied that he could not simultaneously support Wade's re-election and defy his authority. Wade told Diop that he no longer had any complaint against him, "especially as my marabout asks it of me". Diop subsequently went to Touba to thank the Grand Marabout for his intervention on 16 February.
Diop said on 16 September 2009 that he did not favor moves to eliminate the two-round system for presidential elections, arguing that it would be less democratic to decide the outcome in a single round. He nevertheless expressed his firm support for President Wade's planned 2012 re-election bid.

Silver High School (Silver City, New Mexico)

Silver High School is located on the corner of 32nd and Silver streets in Silver City, NM. The school was opened in its current location in 1967. It was previously known as Western High School and was part of Western New Mexico University.
History.
In 1949, State Teachers College became New Mexico Western College. At the same time, the name of the high school was changed to Western High. In 1960, the school became under the authority of the Silver City Board of Education. At that time, the school's name was changed from Western High School to Silver High School.
Construction.
In 1966, the present high school building was opened on 32nd street and Silver streets.
The dedication for the new building was held on Sunday, October 29, 1967, at 2:30 p.m., where Superintendent John H. Gaines presided. The school's construction had ended the summer before. At the time, the present enrollment of Silver High was 568 for the 10th, 11th and 12th grades, which was a 15% increase from the year before. The new high school started with 28 teachers plus administrative and maintenance staff.
Athletics.
Silver High School has historically been a 4A division school in the New Mexico Activities Association (the state agency responsible for managing high school athletics in New Mexico), but for the 2010-11 school year, SHS was reduced to a 3A rating. Divisions are based on school enrollment and determine which other high schools, in the relevant geographical district, the school competes with.
Silver High School has very good football and wrestling teams, routinely doing well in district and state competitions. For most other sports, the school has a reputation for dominating within its division/district.

Western High School (Silver City, New Mexico)

Western High School was a building located in Silver City, New Mexico. It was the former location of Silver High School before the current location of Silver High School was built.
History.
Silver City, was founded in 1870. The first public school opened in 1874. On February 11, 1893, when the Thirtieth Session of the Territorial Legislature of New Mexico passed "An Act to Establish and Provide for the Maintenance and Government of the Normal Schools of New Mexico." The location of the school was chosen on a hill so that people coming to town could see the school clearly. 1918, the first high school was opened, and was part of the Normal School. In the 1920s, the New Mexico Normal School became the New Mexico State Teachers' College. The regents made the High School a separate department of the school. In 1926, the high school became the Grant County High School. The school became accredited in 1934. Because of increasing population growth in the area, the old facilities were no longer accommodatable. Plans to create a new high school were being drawn up in 1937.
The Chamber of Commerce and local governments proposed creating a new high school that could accommodate 600 students. Governor Tingley, the governor of New Mexico at the time, approved the sale of bonds to get the project started.
In 1949, State Teachers College became New Mexico Western College. At the same time, the name of the high school was changed to Western High. Because the funding of the high school, in 1939, was by a legislative appropriation by a Silver City bond issue, a suit found that the University should transfer the title of the building and furnishings to the Silver City School District and cease to operate it. In 1960, the school became under the authority of the Silver City Board of Education. At that time, the school's name was changed to Silver High School.
Silver High School.
In 1965, the school had become overcrowded to the point that split sessions were required. In 1966, the present high school building was built on 32nd and Silver streets. The old school building remained vacant and was used for various activities.
Demolition.
The building was purchased by Neil Parrish and Larry Phifer to develop the building into apartments. During the reroofing project, it was determined that there was significant water damage to the building. The amount of money required to renovate the building was astronomical. Demolition activities began, but because the building was so well built, the demolition activities proved difficult. The building stood partially demolished until 1983. The university repurchased the building and completed the demolition. The concrete stairs leading up to the former building can still be seen today. 
The former location of the building holds the location of dormitories for the Western New Mexico College.

<doc id="20578404" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20578404" title="The Fate of a Crown">
The Fate of a Crown

The Fate of a Crown is a 1905 adventure novel written by L. Frank Baum, the author best known for his Oz books. It was published under the pen name "Schuyler Staunton," one of Baum's several pseudonyms. (Baum arrived at the name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle Schuyler Stanton.)
Audience.
In the years just before and after 1900, Baum had established himself as a successful author of children's books. He then set out to expand his audience in three potentially lucrative areas: adult fiction and juvenile fiction for girls and for boys. "The Fate of a Crown" was his first endeavor for the adult audience. In 1906 he published "Annabel" and "Aunt Jane's Nieces", juvenile novels for girls, and "Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea", a book for boys. (Each of these books was issued under a different pseudonym.)
In "The Fate of a Crown", Baum wrote an adventure novel that combines elements of political intrigue, melodrama, and mystery story. He set the book in Brazil in 1889, during the revolution that brought the Empire of Brazil to its end. Baum chose the rather daring strategy of including major historical figures of the period, Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca, Floriano Peixoto, and even Emperor Pedro II, as characters in his fiction. (This may have been an additional good reason for releasing the novel under a pen name.)
Story.
The novel's protagonist is a young American named Robert Harcliffe; a recent college graduate, he works for his family's mercantile business in New Orleans, run by his Uncle Nelson. Nelson Harcliffe receives a letter from an old client in Brazil, Dom Miguel de Pintra, a wealthy man who has retired from business to devote himself to politics — specifically to the republican cause that struggles to replace the Brazilian Empire. Dom Miguel has written to request a secretary; Robert, eager for adventure, agrees to take the job.
Robert's attitude is devil-may-care at first, yet he quickly learns that he has entered into a dangerous enterprise. He cleverly evades a murderous spy on the voyage down to Rio de Janeiro; but as soon as he reaches the city he is arrested by the police. In the carriage taking him to the police station, the lieutenant in charge is murdered by his own sergeant, who is a republican sympathizer. The sergeant and other sympathizers guide Harcliffe to the city of Cuyaba in Matto Grosso state, and to Dom Miguel's plantation.
There, Harcliffe quickly becomes a devoted admirer of de Pintra and a republican sympathizer himself. (Baum presents this as an American's natural preference, over the archaic, authoritarian, European imperial system.) Just as quickly, Robert learns that the circle around the republican leader is fraught with uncertainty. The man's daughter Izabel is cold and suspect, while his ward Lesba is an ardent republican, and a beauty with whom Harcliffe soon falls in love. Lesba's brother appears to be a republican too — yet he serves as the Emperor's minister of police. Harcliffe wrestles with question of who can be trusted, and who is playing a "double game."
The mystery aspects of the story center on the massive steel vault, impregnated with nitro glycerin, that is hidden in a sub-basement of de Pintra's mansion. It holds the treasury and the incriminating records of the republican movement; it opens with an exotic key, a specially-cut emerald in Dom Miguel's ring. The ring is stolen, which leads Harcliffe on a challenging and puzzling chase.
As the revolution starts, Dom Miguel, Harcliffe, and other supporters are captured and face a firing squad, only to be rescued (some of them at least) at the last minute, by Lesba and a troop of rebels. When the rebellion succeeds, Harcliffe marries Lesba and becomes the director of commerce in the new regime. The couple raise their children in a cosmopolitan style, wintering in New Orleans and spending the rest of the year in Brazil.
Baum's first adult novel was successful enough to justify a follow-up effort: a second Schuyler Staunton book, "Daughters of Destiny", was issued in 1906. A third adult novel, "The Last Egyptian", followed.
"The Fate of a Crown" was reprinted in a paperback edition in 2008.

Moshe Levy (chemist)

Moshe Levy (born 1927) is an Israeli professor of Chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.
Birth and education.
Moshe Levy was born on December 8, 1927 in Thessaloniki, Greece. In 1933 his father, Eliyahu, decided to immigrate to Palestine, then under British occupation. He grew up in the southern part of Tel-Aviv and attended the Alliance Elementary School and the Balfour High School. After graduating from high school, he went to work as a laboratory assistant at the Zeiff Institute in Rehovot. There, with the help of Chaim Weizmann (later the first president of the State of Israel) he obtained a scholarship to attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shortly after enrolling at the Hebrew University, he was called, as a member of the Haganah, to fight in the Israeli War of Independence in Jerusalem, and only returned to the university in September 1949. He received a Masters degree in Physical Chemistry in 1952. He finished his Ph.D. in 1955 after two years at the College of Forestry, State University of New York, Syracuse, SUNY-ESF, under the supervision of Michael Szwarc. He has been married to Joan Dvora Sugerman since 1955, and has two children, Sharona T. Levy and Alon Yitzchak Halevy, and has four grandchildren, Danielle and Itamar Menuhin, and Karina and Kasper Halevy. He lives in Rehovot, Israel.
Academic career.
As a post-doctoral fellow under Michael Szwarc, Moshe Levy was a member of the team who discovered "Living Polymers", which was a major breakthrough in the field of Polymers Science. The work was published as a one-page communication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Michael Szwarc received the Kyoto Prize for this work in 1987, acknowledging Moshe Levy for many of the breakthroughs leading to it. After a few years at the Technion and another year as a Research Fellow in Syracuse, he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Rehovot, Israel. At the Weizmann Institute, he initially worked with Aharon Katzir, and later moved to the Plastics Research Department, which he headed from 1977 to 1983. 
In 1982 he started working on solar energy. His worked focused on creating a chemical reaction that enables storing the energy produced by the sun so it can be transported to a user site, and then (after the reverse reaction) be used upon request. With several colleagues, he built the solar tower at the Weizmann Institute that is a center for solar-energy research. In 1993 he became an Emeritus Professor, but has remained active in research and service, including serving as the President of the Israeli Polymer and Plastics Society in 1993-1995 and Editor of Bulletin of the Israeli Chemical Society, "Chemistry in Israel". Moshe Levy has also spent time as a visiting scientist in a number of institutions, including Xerox Research Center (Rochester, New York), DuPont Central Research Center (Wilmington, Delaware), the University of Florida at Gainsville, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

Memons.
Diplo being an old city where Memon'S mostly migrated from other parts of the Sindh during conspiracies of British & Talpurs which made it difficult and unsafe for the people to live there, Memon's being religious and peace loving people so they migrated to far flung area to stay out of reach from those unsafe areas during 1800/1900 BC. A Primary school with 10 rooms was built there dating back in 1912... All Memon's were educated there and they have the highest number of literacy among other Sindhi communities. It was the year 1950 when Diplai Memon's had already reached the level of Deputy Collector... As more education spread and they found lucrative jobs here started the migration of Diplai's to Mirpurkhas and Hyderabad and a very few families in Karachi by 1965...
1965 was the year when some young Diplai's got good jobs in Karachi and in turn the got there relatives inducted also in good jobs and by 1975 Diplai Memon's number in Karachi was almost 25 families and that started growing non stop.. It was then in 1965 when Diplai's started moving a little far to Saudi Arabia and later to Dubai, England USA and Canada today you name any country of world you will find them in good business or jobs..Today they have biggest concentration in Jeddah engaged in business and jobs outside Pakistan.
A high number of Medical Consultant, specialist and doctors is among the top as compared to any other city of Sindh also Engineers and all other professions with this migration they built "Diplai Town" on the outskirts of Hyderabad, Pakistan. This "town" is generally where well to do Diplai's live (or have a second home, if they do not live in Hyderabad),this town is also known as Diplai Memon co-operative housing society https://maps.Google.com/maps?daddr=25.420694332253923,68.379804967599

Payne (surname)

The surname Payne originates in France and is a variation of the name Payen (Payen; Payens). It is one of the most revered and ancient surnames of the noblesse families of France. The original family lived in Payen, Normandy, where they held family seats in Payen and Dauphine . During the Norman Conquest of England and the great migration, members of this family migrated to England and Europe. It is these ancestors that the generations of Paynes that spread out across the world are descendant from. Upon migrating to England, the Payn's were then granted lands and a family seat in Sussex by Duke William Of Normandy for their distinguished assistance in the battle of Hastings. The first record of Paynes outside of France was in England in the Domesday Book shortly after the Norman Conquest. The Paynes are traditionally a Catholic family although many have attempted to draw a loose connection with the Latin "paganus" = pagan due to the Old English word paien being derived from the Latin word Paganus . There is no hard evidence to support this theory.

Kōki Ishii

Kōki Ishii (石井 紘基 "Ishii Kōki", November 6, 1940 - October 25, 2002) was a Japanese politician of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) born in Setagaya, Tokyo. A lifelong reformist, he was murdered under suspicious circumstances.
Early life.
Ishii graduated from Chuo University, where he studied the legal educations and the graduate school of Waseda University. During the student time, he has participated in Student activism. Ishii lived in the Soviet Union for 6 years as an international student to Lomonosov Moscow State University, following the recommendation by Yasushi Akutagawa, Representative of Japan-Soviet Union Youth Friendship Committee at that time. There he majored theory of state and law under the guidance of Professor A. Y. Denisov and earned a doctorate in philosophy.
Political career.
After coming back from Moscow, Ishii started his political activity at the Socialist Democratic Federation (Japan) (SDF). In 1992 he defected from the SDF, entered the Japan New Party and was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in 1993. Ishii was the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of the Management and Coordination Agency under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.
Even though he was elected from Japan New Party, Ishii broke with Morihiro Hosokawa and did not enter the New Frontier Party. After being the member of the Liberal League and the New Party Sakigake, Ishii participated in the formation of the DPJ in 1996.
Ishii's career in the Diet was marked by his fieldwork concerning waste in government spending. He utilized the investigative function of the diet and heading an anticorruption task force known as the "G-Men Squad" within the DPJ. In November 1997, Ishii uncovered malfeasance in the Central Procurement Office of the Ministry of Defense, which has led to a criminal investigation by the Tokyo Local Public Prosecutors Office. The investigation revealed government waste of over 2 trillion yen per year.
Ishii's proposals were as follows:
In 1999, Ishii formed a bipartisan group in the Diet to track Aum Shinrikyo members. He played an active role in exposing the activities of Aum Shinrikyo in Russia, where it had continued to operate.
In 2000 Ishii opposed the screening of Battle Royale considering its contents that students kill each other until only one is left, and asked Tadamori Oshima, the Minister of Education at that time for the government opinion towards the film in the 150th Diet. Ironically this attracted the public interest so that the film grossed ¥3.11 billion domestically. (around $25 million US) 
Final year in the Diet.
In 2002, Ishii intensified his investigations into the Japanese budget and proposed that the real government spending of the Japanese Government is about 200 trillion yen, much of which was being concealed from the public. Masajuro Shiokawa, the Finance Minister at that time, refused to comment, claiming that Ishii was merely expressing an opinion. Spurned by the legislative process, Ishii wrote a book about his discoveries, "Japan's Secret Checkbook: The Truth about the Financial Interests That Will Destroy the Nation" (2002). It was published by a small alternative press.
Murder.
On 25 October 2002, Ishii was stabbed to death by Ito Hakusui, a Yamaguchi-gumi gangster. Ishii was the third Japanese politician murdered after the end of World War II. Ito escaped down the road covered in blood in broad daylight and fled to the mountains without being noticed, but surrendered himself the next day. Ito said he killed Ishii because Ishii refused to pay a bribe. The police claimed that Ito had "personal" motives, making a larger investigation unnecessary. On 15 November 2005, the Supreme Court sentenced Ito to life in prison without being able to determine a motive. After Ishii's death, a by-election was held in Tokyo 6th District on 27 April 2003, and Yoko Komiyama of DPJ was elected to the House of Representatives. Ishii's family refused to endorse her.
Evidence for assassination.
Noriyuki Imanishi, an investigative journalist, claims that Ishii told him just before his death that he had "discovered something terrible." His wife and staffers reported that Ishii made similar statements to them. Ishii had been about to make an address to the Diet when he was murdered, and that day he was going to the Diet to deposit confidential papers. In the chaos after the murder, his briefcase was emptied by an unknown person. Imanishi and others close to Ishii suspect assassination. In 2008, Ito renounced his sworn testimony that there were "personal" motives for the assassination, and now claims that he had been hired to kill Ishii. In October 2010, Asahi TV aired a primetime special on the murder, and an expert claimed that forensic evidence showed Ito was attempting to seize Ishii's briefcase. Asahi interviewed Ito, and received the following replies:
According to Diet member Nobuto Hosaka, there were a number of suspicious circumstances surrounding the murder. Hosaka wrote on his blog that the police squad in charge of the murder did not do even simple things like swabbing for fingerprints, and that Ishii's diary also went missing at some point after his murder. For Hosaka, the single most disturbing thing is that reporters had called him asking about Ito immediately after the murder, a full day "before" any suspects had been announced. The Asahi TV documentary did not report this incident.
Since 2004, Ishii's family has offered a reward of 1 million yen (roughly $10,000 USD) for any information about the murder.

Henri Evenepoel

Henri-Jacques-Edouard Evenepoel (3 October 1872, Nice – 27 December 1899, Paris) was a Belgian artist whose most important works are associated with Fauvism.
Life and career.
Evenepoel first studied art in Brussels at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts between 1889 and 1890, and entered Paris's Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1892. Evenepoel entered the atelier of Gustave Moreau in 1893, which put him in contact with Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence, Charles Milcendeau, and Léon Printemps.
The artist debuted a portrait of his cousin ("Louise in Mourning") at the 1894 Salon des Artistes Français. He showed four portraits at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1895 and continued to exhibit there until his death. His first solo exhibition came at the Brussels Cercle Artistique (December 1897 – January 1898). Family and friends were the artist's preferred subjects; his full-length portraits, often against a neutral background, show the influence of Édouard Manet and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. His Parisian scenes were influenced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Jean-Louis Forain. Though his early scenes had a somber palette, his paintings while in Algeria (where he first wintered during his solo exhibition) were very different in style, anticipating the bold colours of Fauvism (e.g., "Orange Market, Blidah").
Evenepoel died of typhus in Paris at the age of 27.

Singlis

The formerly independent community of Singlis has been since its amalgamation with Borken in 1974 with its population then of 880.
The following constituent communities are in direct neighbourhood. In the southeast is Lembach (among to the municipal of Homberg), in southwest Borken, in the northwest Gombeth and in the east Lendorf.
History.
Where the river Gilsbach, coming from Pfaffenhausen, empties into the Schwalm lies Singlis, an ancient settlement whose roots reach back to the early Stone Age. Singlis's first documentary mention came, as did Großenenglis's, in 775 in the "Breviarium sancti Lulli". In the centuries that followed, the noble family of von Züschen did especially well, amassing quite a bit of wealth. In 1265, the family sold their holdings in Singlis together with everything on the lands, including the mill and the court in Singlis and Nordwig to the monastery at Haina. The monastery built their new domain with about 55 morgen of land into one of its most important farms. As a result of the Reformation and the monastery's consequent dissolution, its farm in Singlis, along with its income, was assigned to the University of Marburg. The farm was put in a landgravial reeve's care and was called the "Universitäts-Vogtei Singlis" ("Singlis University Reeveship"). In the middle of the 19th century, the farm was sold and later, the parts were sold off to various farmers in Singlis. The village belonged in 1578 to the "Amt" of Borken and at the time had about 52 households. After the general drop in population in this part of the world due to the Thirty Years' War, it was not until the early 19th century that the population once again reached its former level. Today, Singlis has 909 inhabitants. The church's current location was presumably the centre of settlement in the early Middle Ages. The land there is roughly 2 m higher than that around it, keeping it well above most floodwater. A church was first mentioned in 1265 when the von Züschens sold the monastery their landholdings. The church that stands today was built between 1700 and 1710 as a simple hall and has since been thoroughly renovated several times, the latest work having been done in 1971. Since then, the bell tower has stood to the north next to the church. Singlis has been since the Reformation the seat of a parish and has an affiliated church in Lendorf.
Singlis's "Schwalmmühle" – Mill on the Schwalm – was first mentioned in 1266. At that time it lay right on the Schwalm, that is to say, right where the river Gilsbach joins it today. Only in 1508 was a millstream dug and the mill moved to the place where it still stands now. From that time until 1977, the mill was owned by the Wagner and Nöll families. In 1807, the writer Ernst Koch was born in Singlis. PreussenElektra, as the new owner, shut the mill down, at least as a grist mill, but to this day they still use it to generate electricity, which is fed into the grid. The 503-hectare rural area was also affected by brown coal strip mining from 1960 to 1972. The former strip mine with the name "Singlis" lay just west of the village and is nowadays a 70-hectare pond.

Bergermeer gas storage

The Bergermeer gas storage is a planned underground natural gas storage in the Alkmaar region north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. When constructed, it would be one of the largest gas storages in Europe.
Technical features.
The gas storage will use a depleted gas reservoir. The working volume of the gas storage will be 4.1 billion cubic meters (bcm) and a volume of cushion gas would be 4.6 bcm. The gas storage will include 14 new wells to a depth of , of pipeline and the gas treatment facility. The gas treatment and compression facilities are being designed as a zero-emissions plant. The project is expected to cost €800 million excluding the cost of cushion gas. In August 2009, Gazprom Export—the export unit of Gazprom—was contracted to supply the project's cushion gas in exchange for gas storage services and a participating interest in operations of the facility. The final investment decision was made in October 2009. Assuming all permits are obtained, construction will start in mid-2010 with drilling of the 14 new wells expected to start in 2011. Commercial operations will start due to resistance of local city councils in 2014 at the earliest.
Project company.
The Bergermeer project consortium consists of TAQA Energy B.V. (a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company), Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN), Dyas B.V. and Suncor. The facility will be operated by TAQA Energy.
Environmental constraints.
A number of scientific reports however show that gas storage might bring about serious seismic hazard to the surrounding municipalities of Bergen, Heiloo and Schermer and the town of Alkmaar. The area has known a number of (man) induced earthquakes during the depletion of the field between 1994 and 2008, with subsequent higher magnitudes on the Richter scale. Scientists from a number of renowned scientific institutes such as KNMI, MIT and TNO are comfortable with an estimated maximum magnitude of 3,9 on the Richter scale, with a chance of occurrence of 2% over the concession period. Earthquakes with lower magnitude but still quite damaging are of a much higher likelihood.

Annabel (novel)

Annabel: A Novel for Young Folk is a 1906 juvenile novel written by L. Frank Baum, the author famous for his series of books on the Land of Oz. The book was issued under the pen name "Suzanne Metcalf," one of Baum's various pseudonyms. "Annabel" was one of Baum's first efforts to write a novel for adolescent girls — who soon became one of his most important audiences.
Literary markets.
In the years around 1900, Baum had established himself as a successful author of children's literature, most notably with "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz". In the middle of the twentieth century's first decade, he worked to expand his reach into three other potentially lucrative markets. He published his first adult novel, "The Fate of a Crown", in 1905. In 1906 came "Annabel", plus "Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea", Baum's first book for adolescent boys. (Each of these books was released under a different pseudonym. The prolific Baum had learned from earlier experience that he ended up "competing with himself" if he issued too much material in his own name in a short period of time. As Reilly & Britton's star author, it was also important that he make it appear that the company published more authours than they did.)
"Annabel", however, was apparently not the breakthrough that the author and his publisher might have hoped for. The novel is a "Horatio Alger-type story in which a virtuous vegetable-peddler discovers that his supposedly dead father is alive and rich..." Baum drives the story with multiple coincidences, and ties them together at the end with a nod to God's providence. "Apparently the book did not catch on, for its author, 'Suzanne Metcalf,' produced no more."
Still, the book was popular enough to be reprinted in a second edition. The original edition of "Annabel" featured illustrations by H. Putnam Hall. In the second edition of 1912, these were replaced with a new set of pictures by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, who illustrated other Baum works, "The Flying Girl", "Phoebe Daring", and "The Flying Girl and Her Chum", in 1911 and 1912.
Also in 1906, Baum's "Aunt Jane's Nieces" (by "Edith Van Dyne") proved to be a popular hit, and launched a series of ten novels for girls that was one of Baum's major successes. He followed that with his "The Bluebird Books", another successful series of the same type.
Synopsis.
Will Carden, the novel's protagonist, is fifteen years old at the start of the story. His family has "come down" in the world: though his late father had once owned a steel mill, Will and his mother and siblings now survive by growing vegetables on a two-acre plot of land. Will is popular with the local children, especially with the five Williams siblings who live in the big house in the town of Bingham. Of the five, Mary Louise is the beauty; her twelve-year-old sister Annabel is plain in comparison, with red hair and freckles and a "pug nose." Their father owns the steel mill that succeeded the Carden mill as the town's leading employer; their mother, the snobbish Mrs. Williams, wounds Will by telling her children to avoid the lowly "vegetable boy."
Will, however, is a lad of fine character; he is encouraged by the local physician, Dr. Meigs, who joins the Carden family in a mushroom-growing business that relieves their poverty. Will saves Annabel's life when she falls through a frozen pond while ice-skating. Annabel and Will grow close as Annabel blossoms into young womanhood; Meigs encourages her steel-magnate father to acknowledge and encourage the boy.
Meigs and Williams also become suspicious of Ezra Jordan, the man who manages Williams's mill and boards with the Cardens. Jordan was crucial in the Carden family's history; the doctor and steel-man realize that all knowledge of the death of Will's father has filtered through Jordan. Upon investigation, they learn that Jordan has cheated both Williams and the Cardens, by appropriating a valuable steel-making process developed by the elder Carden. It turns out that Mr. Carden is alive and well in Britain, where he has made his fortune. Jordan has worked a double fraud: he deceived the Cardens in Bingham into believing that their husband and father had died in a shipwreck — and he also tricked Carden in England into thinking that his family had perished in an epidemic. Jordan maintained his lodging with the family precisely to intercept any possible communications that would reveal his nefarious scheme. 
Once all of the facts are revealed, the Carden family is united in prosperity once more. Will and Annabel look forward to marriage and the prospect of a happy union.
"Annabel" was included in the sixth and final issue of the annual "Oz-story Magazine" in 2000, with the illustrations of both Hall and Nuyttens.

DeLuxe Color

DeLuxe color is a brand of color process for motion pictures. DeLuxe color is Eastmancolor-based, with certain adaptations for improved compositing for printing (similar to Technicolor's "selective printing") and for mass-production of prints. DeLuxe also offers "Showprints" (usually supplied to premieres in Los Angeles and New York). "Showprint" is DeLuxe's proprietary name for an "EK" (for "Eastman Kodak"), the generic name for a release print made directly from the original camera negative instead of from an internegative.
Among the movies that used the DeLuxe color process are:
As Technicolor is now an all-Eastmancolor shop, there is virtually no difference between DeLuxe color and Technicolor.

Wuhan Baishazhou Yangtze River Bridge

The Wuhan Baishazhou Yangtze River Bridge (), sometimes referred as the Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge for being the third Yangtze river bridge in Wuhan, is a highway bridge over the Yangtze River in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It is located 6.8 kilometers southwest (upstream) of the First Bridge (which connects central Wuchang with central Hanyang). The two bridge names come from the order of construction (it was built after the First and Second Bridges), and from the name of the small island (Baisha Zhou (白沙洲), i.e. "White Sand Island") located under the bridge.
The bridge construction started in 1997 and was completed in September 2000.
With an investment of over 1,400,000,000 Yuan (about $170,000,000) the bridge, which is 3,586 meters long and 28.5 meters wide, has six lanes and a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, enormously easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.

Torre dei Lamberti

The Torre dei Lamberti is 84 m high tower in Verona, northern Italy. 
The tower was begun in 1172; in May 1403 a lightning bolt struck the top of the tower, but only in 1448 restoration works were started, lasting until 1464. In the occasion the tower was enlarged: the more recent sections can be recognized today by the use of different materials (such as marble). The large clock was added in 1779.
The tower has four bells: the "Marangona" signals fires, work times, and the hours of the day, while the largest, called "Rengo", is used to call the population to arms or to invoke the city's councils.

Rose Pharma is a private company that was founded in 2003 as Gastrotech Pharma and is located in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company is led by CEO Leif Helth Jensen, who is, together with Michael Forer and Florian Schönharting, also member of the Board of Directors. Rose Pharma is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel treatments for IBS and anorexia/cachexia associated with cancer and other major pathologies. 
History.
Rose Pharma was formerly known as Gastrotech Pharma and founded in 2003. It has a core interest in gastroenterology and was initially established to exploit novel peptide hormones regulating GI and nutritional function. Rose Pharma currently works mainly in the research and development of its main drug, ROSE-010. 
Products.
ROSE-010 is a pharmaceutical therapy intended to treat pain symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. The pharmaceutical, ROSE-010 mimics the hormone GLP-1 which modulates smooth muscle contractions and thus reduces spasms associated with IBS. ROSE-010 must be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. A phase II double-blinded placebo controlled trial in Europe demonstrated efficacy of this approach, and a phase I/II trial in the US established the safety of this concept also in IBS patients with predominant constipation. These clinical data, together with the preclinical data generated by Rose Pharma, provide the rationale for this peptide hormone based therapy for acute pain attacks in IBS.
Partnerships.
Rose Pharma is currently funded by CAT Invest, Nordic Biotech, BML Healthcare and 123MultiNova Europe. In 2008, Rose Pharma signed an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, USA) to in-license a Lilly compound (formerly known as LY307161, now named ROSE-010), an analogue of the naturally occurring intestinal hormone GLP-1. The licensing agreement is a result of an ongoing research collaboration the two companies have participated in since 2004.

Eugene Goodman

Eugene Goodman was the co founder of the Velocette motorcycle company with his father John Goodman.
Eugene was born in Birmingham. His father had a small shop in Great Hampton street in Birmingham selling and making bicycles and fittings. Eugene began working as an apprentice making motorcycles at New Hudson. Inspired by their father, he and his brother Percy set up New Veloce Motors Limited at Spring Hill in Birmingham and began making motor cars in 1908. Their father was experimenting with a new motorcycle engine design and commissioned the engines to be made by his sons, while he went on to develop the frames and cycle parts at his works in Fleet Street, Birmingham. In 1909 they had a working prototype 276cc four stroke which had many innovative design features. The motorcycle market was very much in its infancy, however and sales were poor so he decided to produce a 499cc belt drive model to bring in some much needed cash.
In 1916 Eugene's car making business failed and he joined Veloce, the family firm.
In 1913, the company first used the trade name Velocette for a small two stroke motorcycle invented by Percy, and the name was then used for many later cycles as well. Production was halted by the outbreak of the First World War and the factory was turned over to the production of munitions for the war effort. 
After the war the company name was changes to "Velocette" as this had become a recognised brand. In 1925 Goodman had a breakthrough when his 348cc overhead cam prototype was entered in the Isle of Man TT which was one of the most famous road races of the time and a great 'proving ground' for motorcycle manufacturers. In 1926 Alec Bennet won the TT on a Velocette KTT for the next forty five years a series of very successful motorcycles followed. In 1971 rising development costs and the owners' racing expenses took their toll on the company's bottom line and they went into voluntary liquidation.

The Mianus River Gorge is a nature preserve jointly owned by the Nature Conservancy and the Mianus River Gorge Preserve. It is located in Bedford, New York. The first were purchased by the Preserve, with help from the Conservancy, their first land preservation deal. It has grown over the years and is still managed by the Preserve. In March 1964, it was designated a National Natural Landmark for its old growth climax hemlock forest and the gorge of the Mianus River.
History.
In 1954, Gloria and Anthony Anable reached out for help from Conservancy which pledged $7500 to help purchase of land in the gorge, its first land preservation purchase.
In 1990, were donated as part of a development deal
In 2007, the Conservancy purchased of adjacent wetlands to protect the gorge and its watershed.
Geology.
The gorge is a periglacial formation, carved by streams as the glacier retreated. It contains several types of bedrock including Bedford Augen Gneiss (an igneous intrusion from the Late Devonian period), Hartland Schist, Precambrian and Cambrian gneiss and quartzite. Cameron's Line passes through the preserve.
The old Hobby Hill pegmatite quarry is located in the northern section of the preserve. The Havenmeyer Falls is also part of the preserve.
Wildlife and vegetation.
In 2003, the Preserve began to manage its deer population via limited bow hunting. They did so decrease the risk of excessive deer populations causing damage to the vegetation. They believed that very small scale reductions could effectively manage the population without adversely affecting neighboring populations due to the rose petal hypothesis of deer populations.
There are numerous species of trees, shrubs, vine, herbs, and ferns.
Access.
It is open from April to November, 8:30am to 5pm. There are approximately of well marked hiking trails.

Providencia Ranch

Providencia Ranch, part of 'Providencia Land and Water Development Company' property, was a piece of land in California, USA that was used as a filming location for some early motion pictures; most notably for battle scenes in the silent classic about the American Civil War, "The Birth of a Nation" (1915). The Valley was also the site for two Universal Studios west coast operations in 1914.
Early Universal Ranch (1912-1913).
Universal Film Manufacturing Company took over the west coast assets of Nestor Studios. This included a studio in Hollywood and ranch land in the San Fernando Valley. The Nestor Ranch was located on 'Providencia Land and Water Development Company' property east of the river, just below Cahuenga Peak. Makeshift stages were set up on the 'Oak Crest Ranch' property and the production of western films began at the former 'Nestor Ranch' site in 1912. On December 6, 1912, an informal studio opening was held at the Oak Crest property The public was invited to tour the 'Oak Crest Ranch' and watch the former "Bison" Cowboys and Indians battle.
After the official opening of the new Lankershism Universal City site in 1915, the Providencia ranch (Oak Crest) property would become known as the "Universal Ranch".
Universal City (1913 - 1914).
Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal, saw the Oak Crest site as too small to consolidate all the west coast operations. He ordered the purchase of larger property from the Lankershism Land, Water Development Co. The Lankershism site contained several tracts of land, including Taylor Ranch. Consolidation began in 1914, with the relocation of several small buildings from the Sunset Gower Studios (former Blondeau Tavern) studio and Oak Crest Ranch property. The three sections of the Lankershism property were referred to as the Universal Back Ranch and contained a zoo, cafe, horse corral and stage 2. The Taylor ranch bordering on Lankershism Blvd. was divided by a stream. The Taylor ranch contained the studio front lot and the backlot on the east side of the stream.
The photographs of the Providencia Ranch land can be seen in the a "A Birds Eye View of Universal City".
The alternate names of this filming site include Providencia flats; Nestor Ranch; Oak Ranch; Oak Crest Ranch; Universal Ranch/Universal City site vs Lankershism site; 1916 Lasky Ranch; and Paramount Ranch (until Nov. 1927). Today this area is Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).
Birth of a Nation (1915).
The Providencia Land and Water Development Company property was used as a location was used for the battle scenes in Birth of a Nation. Billy Bitzer illustrates the location of the battle scenes by his hand drawn map.
Lasky Ranch (1918).
The Famous Players - Lasky Corporation have secured the "old Universal Ranch", a 1,000 acre tract within five minutes of Hollywood at a cost said to be $1,000,000. The site will be used for permanent sets and the first Picture will be a revival of "The Squaw Man", which Ceil B. Demile is to direct. 
The Squaw Man II, Presented by Jesse L. Lasky for Artcraft Pictures Corp., released by Famous Players Lasky Corp. on the Paramount Program, Dec. 15, 1918.

The Certificate of Advanced European Studies () is a postgraduate qualification, equivalent to a master's degree, that was awarded by the College of Europe, a postgraduate elite school in Bruges, Belgium, from its foundation in 1949 until the late 1980s, upon completion of its 1-year programme. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was gradually replaced by a diploma and eventually by a master's degree. The current master's degree is still based on the same programme, and the Certificate and the newer master's degrees are considered equivalent. The programme was taught partially in English and partially in French, requiring proficiency in both languages.
Students specialized in Law, Economics or Policy and Public Administration, and were required to have a first degree in one of those fields at least at the same level as a bachelor's degree (many had more advanced degrees).
At the time, the College of Europe did not award degrees in the strict sense, similar to French elite schools like ENA.
The equivalent degrees awarded today are:

Azerbaijan–Belarus relations

Relations between Azerbaijan and Belarus are at very high level that Belarussian president Alexander Lukashenko describes Azerbaijan as a "saver" of independence and sovereignty of Belarus and adds that "there's not anything close" in Azerbaijani-Belarussian relations. Both countries were part of the Russian Empire until 1918 and before 1991, they were part of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan has an embassy in Minsk and Belarus has an embassy in Baku. Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Azerbaijan is a full member of the Council of Europe, Belarus is a candidate. Both Azerbaijan and Belarus are full members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). There are more than 6,000 Azerbaijanis living in Belarus.
Recent political relations.
Diplomatic relations between two republics established in 1993 but two countries started to get close during past decade. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev paid a visit to Belarus on October 17–18, 2006 which was the first high level visit of Azerbaijan. During the visit nine bileral documents were signed. Lukashenko also paid a visit to Baku and met with Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Artur Rasizade, he visited Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and took part in the official opening
ceremony of the national exhibition of Belarus in Azerbaijan.
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Belarus, like all other members of United Nations, does not recognize The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Alexander Lukashenko have stated that Belarus takes a neutral side on this conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and supports peaceful resolution. However, some Belarussian political experts claim that Belarus "clearly siding" with Azerbaijan and supports Azerbaijan's position.
Economic relations.
The Agreement on socio-economic cooperation is the main document defining the perspectives of bilateral relations between the Azerbaijan and Belarus for the period up to 2015. Between 2008 and 2010, Belarus-Azerbaijan trade grew from US$ 100 m to US$ 146 m. More important than this moderate increase is the fact that Belarus enjoys a trade surplus, which helps to counteract its immense foreign trade deficit. Belarus-Azerbaijan trade might reach $800m in 2011.
Azerbaijan is also helping Belarus to acquire alternative oil sources. Minsk recently began importing oil from Venezuela but direct shipments to landlocked Belarus are difficult. Baku thus agreed to swap schemes by which Minsk gains access to Azerbaijani oil in exchange for Venezuelan oil. By mid-July, the Mozyr refinery in Belarus is scheduled to start processing significant volumes of oil from Azerbaijan on a regular basis. Test shipments of Azerbaijani oil have been ongoing since February through Ukraine’s Odessa-Brody pipeline and the Brody-Mozyr section of the Druzhba pipeline.
Military cooperation.
The acceleration of the relations between Defense Ministries of both countries is in the interest of the both sides. Azerbaijan have been described as largest weapon buyer of Belarus. On 14 November 2008, Belarus and Azerbaijan signed agreement on military cooperation.
Humanitarian area.
Cultural relations are at stable level. Azerbaijani and Belarussian cinematographers constantly take an active part in film festivals held in both countries. On May 22–24, 2007 "Azerbaijan Culture Days" were held in Minsk and Bobruysk. However, current level of relations in tourism and education remains as weak.
Azerbaijani diaspora organizations remains active. Current Israeli ambassador to Belarus is Azerbaijani-born Yosef Shagal. Azerbaijanis appear in Belarussian popular culture as well that Belarussian singer of Azerbaijani origin Gunash Abbasova was awarded with "State of Award of Republic of Belarus". One of the most known TV hosts in Belarus Leila Ismailаva is also an Azerbaijani.

<doc id="20579168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20579168" title="Rick Spleen">
Rick Spleen

Rick Spleen (born Richard Shaw) is a character in the BBC situation comedy "Lead Balloon", played by comedian Jack Dee. Spleen is a world-weary comedian who is forced to make ends meet by hosting corporate events.
Character profile.
Rick is a short-tempered, impatient comedian who struggles to find worthwhile gigs or appearances. He spends a lot of his time writing jokes for corporate events with his friend and writer, Marty who always does far more work than Rick.
He lives in a typical London suburb house with partner Mel and daughter Sam. He is a stubborn, incompetent liar, who often attempts to avoid paying professionals by performing a task himself. He also passes off many of Marty's jokes as his own, and always aims to take credit for other people's work. In episode 2 of Season 3, "Panda", it is revealed that Spleen's real name is Richard Shaw, which caused him much grief at school due to it being shortened to 'rickshaw,' after the Chinese/Japanese transport Rickshaw.
Dee and Sinclair have said that they based the character of Spleen on "comedians who hated being comedians" with whom Dee performed as he was starting his career as a stand-up comic.
Relationships with other characters.
Marty.
Spleen often makes fun and insults his American writer Marty, and Marty returns the gesture. However, it is made clear that the two are great friends, despite their on-going bickering. How much the pair need each other is made especially obvious in the final episode of Season 2, "Lucky", where, after Spleen accuses him of lacking ambition, Marty receives a call from America asking him to write in Hollywood. Spleen is upset but tries not to let his feelings show. However, Marty returns and decides to continue writing with Spleen. 
Marty often acts as 'the good guy' when Rick sets off on his usual activity of insulting people. For example, when Spleen has an argument with Michael, the café owner, or with Magda, his Eastern-European cleaner, Marty defends them rather than backing Spleen, which appears to wind him up even more.
Mel.
Mel, who works as an agent for TV performers, and Rick are partners and have a teenage daughter, Sam. However, Rick still lies to Mel to make himself look better, for example in "₤5,000", after Rick is detained by police for aggravating an officer, he claims that he was "being too funny".
It appears that Mel is the only character who understands Rick, and accepts his ways, often agreeing with him or humouring him.
Magda.
Rick barely tolerates the family's Eastern-European cleaner Magda. He often piles a lot of work on her and then takes the credit, for example in the season one episode "Fatty", Rick tells Magda to return a lost cat and then keeps the reward. Rick regularly gets into arguments with Magda and blames her often. He also treats her as slightly less human than everyone else, as she is from a less developed ex-Communist country, and constantly corrects her accented pronunciation of everyday words such as "sale" in which she says "sell" and "unhappy" when she says "unhippy."
In the first two episodes of Series 3, Magda has to stay in Rick's house, much to Rick's dismay. He constantly complains of her making noise, filling the fridge with her food and the fact that she has placed a fridgemagnet on the fridge amongst other things. In the series 3 episode "Karma", Rick is kind to Magda, which unnerves her. However, at the end of the episode he falls back into his ways of arguing with her.
Michael.
Michael, owner of the local cafe, annoys Rick often. Michael sees Rick as a friend, however Rick does not return the sentiment. Rick often calls Michael mad, especially after he starts therapy. Rick accidentally injures Michael in the episode "£5,000", when he drives into him in his car. This results in Michael not being able to take part in the sponsored skip.
In series 3, after Mel drunkenly reveals Michael's father is gay, Rick and Marty go to Michael's home to check up on him, a gesture Michael appreciates.
Ben and Sam.
Sam, Rick's daughter, and Ben, her boyfriend, often irritate Rick by asking for money from him and then wasting it. Ben annoys Rick the most, for example when he breaks Rick's DVD player after taking the back cover off and thereby breaking the security seal thus invalidating the warranty. 
In series 3, Ben stays at Rick's home for an episode. Rick is annoyed by the constant loud music coming from Sam's room, as they practice for their band, 'Ben and Sam.' However, when it is revealed that an advertising agency wants to use the duo's song "Tragic", which was put up on YouTube, Rick changes his mind and starts enjoying the music. 
Ben and Sam temporarily broke up in the fourth episode of series 3, which also ended their band's run.
Production notes.
Jack Dee, who plays Spleen, is the co-creator and one of the executive producers of "Lead Balloon", therefore he writes his own part with the help of co-writer Pete Sinclair.

TopoTarget

TopoTarget () is an international biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs and therapies to treat cancer. While the company has offices around the world, its headquarters are based in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was founded in 2000 by a group of clinicians.
TopoTarget is involved in collaborations with both academia and industry. In 2001 they began collaborating with the National Cancer Institute, a component of the US National Institutes of Health. Since their acquisition of Prolifix, they have been collaborating with the Netherlands Cancer Institute. They also collaborate with Rigshospitalet, the national hospital of Denmark. TopoTarget has also collaborated with other companies, including Novartis since 2003, and Lundbeck as of October 2007; Topotarget has been member of the Danish Innovation Network Biopeople since 2005.
Company profile.
In 2007, TopoTarget’s revenue was 44,890,000 DKK. The company is publicly traded on the OMX Nordic Exchange in Copenhagen under the symbol TOPO. They are a member of Medicon Valley Alliance. The CEO is Peter Buhl Jensen, M.D., Ph.D.
Personnel.
At the end of 2007, TopoTarget had a total of 146 employees who worked in drug development (including assay development, medicinal chemistry, preclinical research, and clinical trials), marketing, and sales. About 58% of employees are in medical and research fields. TopoTarget has public partners in many areas of the world, notably at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Frankfurt University Hospital, Oxford University Hospital, and the National Cancer Institute, US
History.
TopoTarget was founded in 2000 by clinicians specializing in the molecular mechanisms of cancer. Since its start it has grown mostly through acquisitions of other companies. In 2002, TopoTarget acquired Prolifix Ltd. based in the United Kingdom. This was followed by the purchase of G2M Cancer Drugs AG in Germany in 2005. By 2006 TopoTarget had 125 employees specializing in most areas of drug discovery and development. In 2007, they acquired Apoxis, which has two products, APO010 and APO866. TopoTarget currently employs 146 people in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, UK and the USA.
Currently TopoTarget has nine drugs in clinical development, as well as an extensive portfolio of small molecule drug candidates in the pre-clinical phase. Savene/Totect, TopoTarget’s first marketed product was released in October 2006 in Europe and October 2007 in the United States causing a large jump in revenue from 2 million DKK in 2006 to 19 million DKK in 2007. In 2007, 293 patients were treated via drugs from TopoTarget’s pipeline.
Collaborative research and business strategy.
Since its inception in 2000, TopoTarget has developed a strong, two-pronged strategy for expanding its drug portfolio. TopoTarget splits its focus between in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities to maximize its utilization of available skills and resources. In-licensing takes advantage of internal talent and focuses on preclinical and early clinical development of small molecule drugs through Phase I trials. Out-licensing of its products to larger pharmaceutical companies, however, facilitates the progression of drugs with broad market potential through the final stages of clinical development, regulatory approval, and marketing by taking advantage of their established reputations and knacks for navigating the later stages of commercialization. To summarize its strategy, TopoTarget states:
Allowing each sector to focus on its specialty in the drug development timeline maximizes TopoTarget’s use of time and resources to increase productivity.
A number of in-licensing collaborations have expanded TopoTarget’s drug pipeline. In June 2004, TopoTarget entered a licensing and collaboration agreement with CuraGen Corporation with respect to research, development, and commercialization of a group of small molecules that inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. One of these drugs—Belinostat—has proved particularly promising and forms the basis of TopoTarget’s research collaboration with the National Cancer Institute in the USA. In October 2005, Astellas sold them the exclusive worldwide license for a group of compounds with potential anti-cancer or immuno-suppressive activity which are currently undergoing further preclinical evaluation. LEO Pharma sold TopoTarget the license to its preclinical HDAC inhibitor, which is also undergoing evaluation as a treatment for cancer and inflammatory conditions. As of April 2008, all sales rights for this compound were transferred to TopoTarget. In October 2007, H Lundbeck A/S sold the development rights for their sigma receptor ligand, Siramesine. By licensing potential cancer therapeutics from external sources and developing drug candidates from within, TopoTarget hopes to establish a broad array of drugs that target the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer.
Once the viability of a compound has been established internally, TopoTarget relays the remaining responsibilities of the development process to its commercial collaborators in out-licensing agreements. Three prominent bodies maintain such out-licensing contracts: the National Cancer Institute (USA), the Netherland’s Cancer Institute, and Righospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark). TopoTarget has been working with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at NCI since 2001 to develop new anti-cancer agents. Currently, NCI is handling the clinical development of TopoTarget’s HDAC inhibitor Belinostat (PXD101). NCI’s efforts are focused on determining the molecular basis of Belinostat’s anti-cancer activity and the drug’s viability in combination drug therapy. The Netherlands Cancer Institute provides TopoTarget access to the extensive research conducted by the Division of Carcinogenesis, which uses advanced techniques in functional genomics to identify novel genes with roles in carcinogenesis. May 2003 saw the establishment of a five-year research collaboration agreement between TopoTarget and Copenhagen’s Rigshospitalet to test the drug Topotect for effectiveness against brain metastases. Such relationships allow TopoTarget to advance its products through clinical development where its immediate resources are insufficient for the task.
Products.
TopoTarget has a large amount of drugs that are currently in clinical trials or being licensed to other companies. The drugs include Belinostat, Savicol, Baceca, Avugane, APO866, TopotectA, Zemab, APO010, HSP90 Inhibitors, APO200.
Marketed.
Savene.
Savene ("aka" Totect) is TopoTarget's single marketed drug as of the end of 2008., p. 14 The generic name for Savene is dexrazoxane. Savene was developed by TopoTarget and authorized to be put on the market in July 2007 by the European Commission for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation. Savene, developed by TopoTarget is used for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation, a rare complication to chemotherapy. Anthracycline extravasation is defined as the unintentional installation or leakage into the perivascular or subcutaneous spaces during administration. Savene works by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II, which is the target of anthracycline chemotherapy. The drug binds to DNA topoisomerase II at a different step in the catalytic cycle than anthracyclines, which locks the enzyme in a conformational form that is no longer affected by anthracyclines. The drug is delivered as a ready-to-use kit containing both Savene powder and Savene diluents., pp. 12–13; 
In clinical development.
Belinostat.
Belinostat (PXD101), p. 15 is TopoTarget’s lead product that is currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Belinostat works through a new mechanism of action to restore cell control which has been shut down by cancer, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). TopoTarget expects to launch an initial regulatory study using Belinostat as monotherapy to treat peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) by the beginning of 2009. In October 2007 preliminary results were released from the Phase II clinical trial of intravenous belinostat in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for relapsed ovarian cancer. Final results in late 2009 of a phase II trial for T cell lymphoma were encouraging.
Belinostat has been granted orphan drug and fast track designation by the FDA. Belinostat is in a phase II pivotal trial with NDA submission planned for 2011H2.
Savicol.
Savicol, formerly known as PEAC (Pulse Enhanced ACetylation), is an anti-cancer drug candidate that treats familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Savicol delivers valproic acid as a proprietary, which builds up on a specific pharmacokinetic release pattern that is projected to inhibit certain HDAC enzymes in a more efficient manner. Savicol has been entered into Phase II studies by TopoTarget for the treatment of colorectal polyps in FAP patients. Orphan drug status has been granted to Savicol in both the United States and in Europe.
Baceca.
Baceca comprises a topical formulation of valproic acid (VPA) for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases, including basal cell carcinoma and pre-cancerous actinic keratosis. VPA primarily targets HDAC class I enzymes that are involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Baceca is currently in Phase II clinical trials.
Avugane.
Avugane is a novel proprietary formulation of the HDACi VPA that has the potential to be used as a topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases including common acne. Randomized Phase II clinical studies were performed with Avugane in April 2006 and further studies have been conducted since then to investigate the clinical utility of the drug. If the results are successful, TopoTarget may consider conduction trials on other diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
TopotectA.
TopotectA is a topoisomerase II inhibitor for the treatment of brain metastases. This drug is based on the same compound as Savene (dexrazoxane) and is currently involved in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of brain metastases, which are a common secondary condition to patients that have lung cancer and breast cancer.
Zemab.
Zemab comprises an antibody-toxin for the treatment of specific types of cancers in the form of a protein product., pg 20 The recombinant protein product targets the ErbB2/HER2 receptor, which is overexpressed in 30% of breast cancer and is often a marker of a more aggressive disease. This receptor is also believed to be involved in certain other cancers, including head and neck cancers. The next clinical studies of Zemab were expected to be initiated by the start of 2009. but no clinical trials were registered.
APO010.
APO010, also known as mega-FasLigand is a recombinant fusion protein. This protein was derived from the pro-apoptotic human Fas ligand (FasL) protein. APO010 causes cell death of cancerous cells through a mechanism of targeting Fas receptors on the surface of cancer cells inducing cell apoptosis. A Phase I study is currently being conducted with APO010 on patients with untreatable, advanced or refractory solid tumors.
APO866.
APO866, a drug that inhibits the growth of human tumors, is a potent and specific inhibitor of a key enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of NAD, called NMPRT. The worldwide development and marketing rights to APO866 were acquired from Astellas in October 2005. APO866 is a drug that provides a new therapeutic approach to cancer with the potential of acting as both a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy. TopoTarget has opened three separate clinical studies of APO866. The clinical studies are (1) to assess APO866 as a treatment of advanced melanoma, (2) to assess APO866 as a treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and (3) to assess APO866 as a treatment of refractory or relapsed B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Pre-clinical development.
APO200.
APO200 is a therapeutic recombinant protein that is developed from the ectodysplasin A-1 (EDA1) gene. This product is used to treat a rare human genetic disease linked with mutations in the EDA1 gene. The disease reduces a patient’s ability to sweat and increases hypersensitivity to heat, aberrant dentition, hairlessness, and dry skin. Completed pre-clinical development has shown the potential of APO200 in animal models of X-Linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED). APO200 gained orphan drug status from the FDA in February 2006. TopoTarget plans to sell this project to another company or to out-license it.
HSP90 inhibitors.
A number of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) small molecule inhibitors have been developed by TopoTarget, with several compounds showing high potency in several cancer cell lines, particularly those cell lines which over-express HER2 receptors. This project is still in pre-clinical trials and TopoTarget is in the process of out-licensing the product or looking for companies to collaborate with on the project.
Future perspectives.
Research.
TopoTarget has several drugs in preclinical development. A current target is Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is key in protein folding and maturation. TopoTarget is currently looking for small molecule drugs that inhibit HSP90 function to induce apoptosis. Current molecules have shown great promise and are undergoing optimization and evaluation in order to obtain a patent. TopoTarget is also studying the mechanism of action behind the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway to understand targets for anti-tumor drugs. Currently they are looking to find a lead compound in order to continue these studies. TopoTarget is also looking into more drugs that interrupt HDAC activity, not only for cancer therapy, but for diseases like malaria and CNS disorders.
Financial outlook.
For 2008, the company foresees a pre-tax loss of around DKK 175-195 million due to higher research and development costs as well as an increase in international collaboration.

Demand flow technology

Demand flow technology (DFT) is a strategy to define and deploy business processes in a flow, driven in response to customer demand. DFT is based on a set of applied mathematical tools that are used to connect processes in a flow and link it to daily changes in demand.
DFT represents a scientific approach to flow manufacturing for discrete production. It is built on principles of demand pull where customer demand is the central signal to guide factory and office activity in the daily operation. DFT is intended to provide an alternative to schedule-push manufacturing which primarily uses a sales plan and forecast to determine a production schedule.
History.
It was created by John R. Costanza, an executive with operations management experience at Hewlett Packard and Johnson & Johnson. Costanza, who was later nominated as a Nobel Laureate in Economics for Working Capital Management, founded the John Costanza Institute of Technology in Englewood, CO in 1984 to provide consulting and education services for manufacturers to implement the methodology.
DFT uses applied mathematical methods to link raw and in-process materials with units of time and production resources in order to create a continuous flow in the factory. The objective is to link factory processes together in a flow and drive it towards customer demand.
Early adopters of DFT included American Standard Companies General Electric and John Deere (Deere & Company).
In the early years, DFT was regarded as a method for "just-in-time" (JIT), which advocated manufacturing processes driven to actual customer demand via Kanban. It was introduced as a way for American manufacturers to adopt Japanese production techniques, such as Toyota Production System (TPS), whilst avoiding some of the cultural conflicts in applying Japanese business methods in an American company. Later, it has come to be seen as a lean manufacturing method that allows factories to implement techniques such as one-piece flow, TAKT-based line design, Kanban material management and demand-driven production.
Demand Flow Technology is promoted as a method particularly suitable for high-mix, low-volume manufacturing. in 2001, Costanza was awarded a patent for this approach for mixed-model manufacturing.
Principles.
Demand-driven manufacturing.
The central tenet to DFT is the primacy of customer demand in daily execution of the operation. According to Aberdeen Group,
DFT is a pathway to achieve demand-driven manufacturing capability. It is used as a framework to guide the design, implementation and deployment of demand driven manufacturing in a repeatable form. In this way, it is similar original concept of Just-in-Time (JIT) that was first deployed in Japanese manufacturers using a foundation of total quality management. More recently, Just-in-time has been more commonly used to describe supplier delivery methods, rather than a production philosophy. DFT assumes basic process capability that can arise from TQM and statistical process control (SPC) principles and embeds it in a framework of management that can more easily achieve demand driven in a repeatable way.
Mixed-model production.
Mixed-model production is the production of a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material. It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering. Products are increasingly assembled from standard components and sub-assemblies, using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour. DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines.
A production schedule based on MRP will tend to cope with high product mix by allocating each model to a multiple of a shift or a day. This means that the whole product mix is supplied across a scheduling cycle of a multiple of weeks. This tends to extend the lead-time or increase dependency on the forecast. DFT offers “The ability to accommodate a range of volumes for any product, any day, based on the direction of actual customer demand”.
Product synchronization.
The first tool to be used in a DFT implementation, product synchronization is a definition of relationship of processes in a flow to build a product. It takes the form of a diagram, usually created in pen and paper or whiteboard and formalized with a visualization program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio. It displays how the processes relate to each other in a flow, with the conversion of raw material to finished goods. A process is defined by “A logical grouping of value-adding work performed to a common volume”.
Sequence of Events, SoE.
Each of the processes in the Product Synchronization requires a standard process definition. In DFT, the Sequence of Events provides this definition. In the Quantum Leap, the sequence of events is “The definition of the required work and quality criteria to build a product in a specific production process.”
The SoE usually takes the form of a table with the product code, process ID, task description and sequence, required work and set-up time for machines and labour, and quality check criteria. The SoE intends to define times that are reasonable, realistic and repeatable to perform to the necessary quality. Many of the strengths and criticisms of DFT as a methodology stem from the Sequence of Events. The SoE are the foundation of process definition but are not used as work instructions. To communicate standard work at the work center, use Operation Method Sheets.
In an MRP systems environment, the SoE represents a drill-down from the routing that provides a tabular view of the Product Synchronization at the process level. A DFT manufacturer would therefore use the SoE as the master record of process definition and derive routings and ISO documentation from it.
Operation method sheets.
These are visual description of work in motion, materials and the required quality check. In the purest form, operation method sheets are drawn in wire-frame to show the significant contours of the product form and clearly represent work in motion and quality without visual noise. The OMS has three stages of activity: total quality check, work, and verify. This establishes the concept where each operator checks the output quality of the operation immediately upstream. This can contribute to a total quality culture and parts-per-million capability.
Mixed-model process map.
The sequence of events and product synchronization define how tasks and quality check compose the process for any given product. The mixed-model process map shows how products and processes form a requirement for resources. In such a map, the products and processes form a matrix with products as rows and processes as columns. At the intersection are most commonly actual times (standard times at the process from the sequence of events), but could also display yield and optionality ratios.
Demand at capacity.
Demand at capacity is the volume of production for a single product item at capacity. It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply. The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production. In contrast to Toyota Production System, and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand. Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply. The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand. A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range. This will likely affect the resource productivity and inventory levels. A greater mix on the line is able to provide a higher level of service for any given level of resources and inventory.
Effective hours.
The effective hours is the time available for a given resource to produce product or perform process set-up or changeover. It is defined per shift and represents the total available time to perform tasks set in the SoE. Non-productive time such as equipment maintenance, breaks, 5S activity and continuous improvement is deducted from effective hours. Setup time is included as it is arguably a form of productive time and calculations for batch size optimization and dynamic Kanban will require setup and run-time to be managed from a common pool of resource time.
Takt & Operation Cycle-Time, OP c/t.
Takt-time is the ratio of time to volume and in DFT is expressed as
Where HE is Effective Hours, S is the number of shifts and DC is the demand at capacity. This ratio can be expressed for finished products at the end of the line and is referred to as Takt-Time. It can also apply at the process where bill of material relationships, process yield and optionality can affect the dependent volume for any given Dc at the finished goods level. At the process, this ratio is known as operation cycle-time.
Material Kanban.
DFT shares a conventional definition of material Kanban based on a visual signal to replenish a point of consumption with required material. A typical material Kanban system in DFT is “Single Card, Multiple Container” and enables card or container quantities to be consumed and replenished without shortages.
Material Kanban provides an alternative to kitting as a way of issuing material to the production floor. A DFT environment will strive to simplify the definition of warehouse locations for material and reduce the number of transactions required to control the flow of material during production. The aim of Material Kanban is to connect the material flow with actual requirement at the process and provide a more robust availability of parts to production whilst reducing the response-time to the customer.
Production Kanban.
Production Kanban is designed for a replenishment quantity that may be smaller than a lot size or batch. It is based on a “dual card Kanban” system where a “move” card or container represents the quantity required by the downstream point of consumption and a “produce” card is kept on a display board and accumulates to a replenishment batch.
Demand-based management.
Demand-based management is an approach that defines tolerance capability for demand in order to unify material and production planning under conditions of demand uncertainty. It uses “flex fences” to set the upper and lower boundaries of supply against a definition of the current daily rate of demand. The current rate is usually some kind of smoothed average and will move over time. The flex-fences will be different for different product items or groups and should be calculated individually. Order policies, purchasing, inventory and production capacity will all be set against these flex fence boundaries, so these calculations will sit at the heart of operations planning.
Unfortunately, this is a calculation-intensive and critical process that is largely unsupported by MRP/ERP systems. The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management has not had the same level of adoption experienced by the rest of the DFT principles.
Value and results.
Companies that implement DFT are typically looking for an improvement in the response to customer demand. This is reflected in the lead-time or replenishment time for finished product and will affect the level of inventory that is held to buffer response requirements.
Effective response to demand can be described as a distribution curve, with some orders taking longer to fill than others. The result is variation and uncertainty in the manufacturer’s ability to serve the market. Working capital is required to hedge this response lag and uncertainty.
DFT aims to reduce both the variation and duration of response to demand. This can be seen as a more capable fulfillment that provides a higher level of customer service at a lower level of working capital. The intended results are improvement in delivery performance together with increased cash-flow and return on working capital.
Applications.
Demand flow technology is applicable in a wide range of product environments and has been successfully deployed in many different industries. Companies who have embraced demand flow technology include John Deere, Stanleyworks, Flextronics, American Standard, Trane, AstraZeneca and many others. It has a strength in those manufacturing operations that are expected to supply a high mix to an unpredictable and volatile market. It is often seen as the science behind flow manufacturing for discrete manufacturers, whose products do not naturally flow across the manufacturing processes.
Advantages and criticisms.
Advantages.
It is simple.
Demand flow technology provides a simple, logical method based on applied mathematics. The technique is based on simple operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so it does not rely on advanced mathematics.
It is repeatable.
DFT forms a step-by-step guide to converting production from a scheduled-push to a demand-pull and flow system. Although it is applicable to a wide range of products, the steps are consistent and work in the same way. It does not depend on the judgment of an expert in the same way as lean or Six Sigma and can be taught to a broader audience though short training workshops.
It is effective.
At its heart, DFT formalizes the natural flow of material, processes and information required to build a product. It is not so much an invented technology as a description of the optimal way to align a factory towards customer demand.
It is customer-centric.
DFT places the customer at the center of the operation. It enables companies to formalise a customer-centric view with practical tasks and actions that guide behaviour in the organisation. It moves the concept of customer-driven to an achievable plan of action beyond a statement of philosophy.
It aligns business and customer goals.
The concept of maximizing shareholder value is often seen as a conflict with the quality of customer service. Demand Flow Technology, if applied correctly, can unify financial and customer objectives in a holistic approach to managing operating capital and growing a business.
Criticisms.
It is constrained to the factory.
Demand flow techniques have been widely applied to the factory, yet have failed to gain widespread acceptance in corporate management. All too often, it tends to be limited to production planning whilst operations and material planning continue to be dominated by use of ERP/MRP systems. The holistic ideal of demand flow may be fractured by this conflict.
It is unsupported by systems.
Major ERP/MRP vendors have largely ignored the advantages of Demand Flow techniques, or been acquired before their products have had a chance to gain market share. The advocates and users of Demand Flow have largely failed to challenge the inadequate logic that conventional MRP uses for planning capacity and production resources As a result, manufacturers are forced to rely on an outdated routine for planning that is largely unchanged since the 1960s.
It requires process definition and discipline.
DFT aims to apply a standard process definition of product to daily requirements of demand. This favours processes that are capable and defined to the task level. This is sometimes a level of detail and discipline absent from the organisation. The creation and maintenance of Sequence of Events documentation involves extensive manual work. There are powerful advantages to quality and capability in performing this work, but success usually depends on management commitment to change beyond the narrow actions of a DFT implementation.

Le docteur Miracle

Le docteur Miracle ("Doctor Miracle") is an opérette in one act by the French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto, by Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy, is based on Sheridan's play "Saint Patrick's Day". Bizet wrote the work when he was just 18 years old for a competition organised by Jacques Offenbach. He shared first prize with Charles Lecocq. His reward was to have the piece performed 11 times at Offenbach's Bouffes-Parisiens theatre. The premiere took place on 9 April 1857 at Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens in Paris.
Plot.
The story takes place in Padua in the middle of the nineteenth century. The mayor and his wife Véronique are woken up very early one morning by what appears to be a noisy advertising campaign outside their house, shouting the talents of a Doctor Miracle. This is, in fact, a young officer, Silvio, who had thought up this ruse in order to be able to serenade the mayor’s daughter Laurette, with whom he has fallen in love. The mayor, who has an aversion to the military, has got wind of their relationship and had forbidden Laurette to have anything to do with soldiers. He suspects that Doctor Miracle is Silvio in disguise, but his worries are calmed by Laurette and by Véronique, who has guessed what is going on.
Laurette sings of her passion for Silvio, and a young man suddenly arrives at the house: he says that he is Pasquin and that he has been sent by a friend of the mayor to help out with the housework – he adds that he is allergic to soldiers. The mayor is delighted to welcome him into the house, not realising that Pasquin is in fact Silvio in another disguise. Pasquin sings of his many attributes as a servant and the mayor is pleased with what he hears.
The mayor introduces Pasquin to his wife and daughter and Pasquin, to Laurette’s disgust (although she has not recognised him yet), pretends to flirt with Véronique. It is time for breakfast, and the mayor gives Pasquin instructions to prepare an omelette.
In the famous ‘omelette quartet’, Pasquin brings in the omelette and they all sing its praises. But when the mayor and his wife and Laurette taste it, they all start to choke – it is disgusting. The mayor and Véronique rush from the house to rinse their mouths out and Laurette now recognises Pasquin as Silvio: they sing a tender love duet which turns into a trio when the mayor returns and catches them together. Furious, he throws Silvio out of the house.
Soon after, a telegram arrives from Silvio confessing that the omelette was in fact poisoned. The mayor is terrified, but Laurette tells him that she knows a wonderful doctor who will be able to cure him. In a panic, the mayor promises to give this doctor anything he wants in return for the antidote to the poison. The doctor arrives – it is, of course, Silvio again, back in the Doctor Miracle disguise. He offers to cure the mayor in return for Laurette’s hand in marriage. The mayor concedes defeat and agrees to the marriage, at which Silvio declares that the omelette wasn’t poisoned after all. Thoroughly outwitted, the mayor offers Laurette to Silvio and the opera ends in an ensemble in which they all agree that the phony doctor did after all have the cure for everything, which is Love.

Adamsia is a genus of sea anemones in the 
family Hormathiidae. Species in this genus are mutually symbiotic with hermit crabs. The anemone gets a place to live and discarded scraps of the crab's food in exchange for its help in the crab's defence. As these anemones grow, they secrete a horny membrane, known as a carcinoecium, which overlies the crab's original snail shell and expands the living space of the crab. This means the anemone does not have to change substrate and the crab does not have to seek a larger shell as they both grow.

Maria was born in 1907 in Žatec, Bohemia, then Austria-Hungary, as the middle of three daughters of the owner of a printing shop who died when she was 10. After the Great War, the Sudetenland became part of the newly founded Czechoslovakia. In 1945, at the end of the Second World War, she and her husband Ernst Gottfried Treben were victims of the Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. For several years they lived in refugee camps until they found refuge in Austria and settled down in Grieskirchen in 1951. She died in 1991.
Her remedies.
Maria used traditional German/Eastern European remedies handed down by previous generations. She only used local herbs and always accompanied her remedies with advice on diet. She commonly used Thyme, Greater Celandine, Ramsons, Speedwell, Calamus, Camomile, Nettle and Lady's Mantle. She treated a broad range of conditions from psoriasis to constipation and diabetes to insomnia. She used her own recipes as well as traditional healing remedies like Swedish bitters that she believed was a cure-all. Some of her remedies and advice proved to be controversial as with all natural health cures it is difficult to prove their efficacy. Yet, to this day she is widely read and referred to for her knowledge of European medicinal herbs.

Gateway Technology

The Gateway cloning System, invented and commercialized by Invitrogen since the late 1990s, is a molecular biology method that enables researchers to efficiently transfer DNA-fragments between plasmids using a proprietary set of recombination sequences, the "Gateway att" sites, and two proprietary enzyme mixes, called "LR Clonase", and "BP Clonase". Gateway Cloning Technique allows transfer of DNA fragments between different cloning vectors while maintaining the reading frame. Using Gateway, one can clone or subclone DNA segments for functional analysis. The system requires the initial insertion of a DNA fragment into a plasmid with two flanking recombination sequences called “att L 1” and “att L 2”, to develop a “Gateway Entry clone” (special Invitrogen nomenclature).
Large archives of Gateway Entry clones, containing the vast majority of human, mouse and rat ORFs (open reading frames) have been cloned from human cDNA libraries or chemically synthesized to support the research community using NIH (National Institutes of Health) funding (e.g., Mammalian Gene Collection, http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/). The availability of these gene cassettes in a standard Gateway cloning plasmid helps researchers quickly transfer these cassettes into plasmids that facilitate the analysis of gene function. Gateway cloning does take more time for initial set-up, and is more expensive than traditional restriction enzyme and ligase-based cloning methods, but it saves time, and offers simpler and highly efficient cloning for down-stream applications.
The technology has been widely adopted by the life science research community especially for applications that require the transfer of thousands of DNA fragments into one type of plasmid (e.g., one containing a CMV promoter for protein expression in mammalian cells), or for the transfer of one DNA fragment into many different types of plasmids (e.g., for bacterial, insect and mammalian protein expression).
Basic Steps.
The first step in Gateway cloning is the preparation of a Gateway Entry clone. Entry clones are often made in two steps:
1) “Gateway attB1, and attB2” sequences are added to the 5’, and 3’ end of a gene fragment, respectively, using gene specific PCR primers and PCR-amplification;
2) the PCR amplification products are then mixed with special plasmids called Gateway “Donor vectors” (Invitrogen nomenclature) and the proprietary “BP Clonase” enzyme mix. The enzyme mix catalyzes the recombination and insertion of the att-B-sequence-containing PCR product into the att P recombination sites in the Gateway Donor vector. Once the cassette is part of the target plasmid, it is called an "Entry clone" in the Gateway nomenclature, and recombination sequences are referred to as the Gateway “att L” type.
The gene cassette in the Gateway Entry clone can then be simply and efficiently transferred into any Gateway Destination vector (Invitrogen nomenclature for any Gateway plasmid that contains Gateway “att R” recombination sequences and elements such as promoters and epitope tags, but not ORFs) using the proprietary enzyme mix, “LR Clonase”. Thousands of Gateway Destination plasmids have been made and are freely shared amongst researchers across the world. Gateway Destination vectors are similar to classical expression vectors containing multiple cloning sites, before the insertion of a gene of interest, using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Gateway Destination vectors are commercially available from Invitrogen, EMD (Novagen) and Covalys.
Since Gateway cloning uses patented recombination sequences, and proprietary enzyme mixes available only from Invitrogen, the technology does not allow researchers to switch vendors and contributes to the lock-in effect of all such patented procedures.
To summarize the different steps involved in Gateway cloning:

Beardfish (band)

Beardfish is a Swedish progressive rock band formed in 2001. Their style resembles progressive rock bands from the 1970s, such as Yes and Genesis. The band initially featured vocalist Rikard Sjöblom, guitarist David Zackrisson, bassist Gabriel Olsson, and drummer Petter Diamant. The band underwent several changes in their formative years but since 2003 have had a stable lineup consisting of Sjöblom, Zackrisson, drummer Magnus Östgren, and bassist Robert Hansen. The band was signed by InsideOut Music after releasing two albums independently; they have since released four more albums. 
In 2008, the band toured with a fellow progressive rock band The Tangent. They were scheduled to tour North America in the summer of 2009 as part of "Progressive Nation", a tour organized by Dream Theater's then-drummer Mike Portnoy; however, they were forced to withdraw when InsideOut lost funding after its distributor, SPV, declared bankruptcy.
Beardfish's second most recent album, "Mammoth", was released on March 28, 2011 in Europe and March 29, 2011 in North America.
In September 2012, Beardfish were the opening act for all European dates of the band Flying Colors, and in May 2013, were one of the opening acts (along with Sound of Contact) for all European dates of the band Spock's Beard.

Taj Mahal Bangladesh

Taj Mahal Bangladesh (Bengali: তাজ মহল বাংলাদেশ) is a copy of the original Taj Mahal (a Mughal mausoleum located in Agra, India) located 10 miles east of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka in Sonargaon. Unlike the original, work on the building took only five years. Ahsanullah Moni, a wealthy Bangladeshi film-maker, announced his 'Copycat version of Taj Mahal' project in December 2008. The project cost about USD$ 56 Million, and was built 20 miles northeast of Capital Dhaka. This caused complaints from Indian officials, "You can't just go and copy historical monuments" an official of Indian High Commission in Dhaka told press. 
He has told how he built a replica of the Taj Mahal so that the poor of his nation can realise their dream of seeing neighbouring India's famed monument.
Construction work began five years ago, but Mr Moni says that he came up with the idea in 1980 when he first visited the real Taj in Agra, northern India. He said that his homage had been built because most people living in Bangladesh - where nearly half of the population exist below the poverty line - cannot afford to travel to India to see the real thing. "Everyone dreams about seeing the Taj Mahal but very few Bangladeshis can make the trip because it's too expensive for them," he said. Mr Moni first visited the original in 1980 and has made six return trips. So enamoured was he of the site that he hired a group of architects and sent them to India to measure it. He said: “I used the same marble and stone as in the original Taj. We used machinery, which is why it took less time. Otherwise it would have taken 20 years and 22,000 workers to complete it.” Last night Mr Mittal, at the Indian High Commission, did concede that the replica was unlikely to detract from the magnificence of the original. He also admitted that visitors were unlikely to mix up one with the other. “A copy is a form of flattery, I suppose,” he said. 
Taj Mahal in Bangladesh.
The construction of the replica had irritated the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. Early reports said the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh says it will sue Ahsanullah Moni () for copyright infringement of the original 350 year old building; however, the Indian High Commission later announced that the replica was unlikely to detract visitors from the original.
Original stays Original... 
The building was picked up by many news channels, newspapers and sites, including the BBC, Sky, Reuters, Voice of America, Hindustan Times, "Guardian" and "The Times", and caused large discussion and debate on social networking sites and blogs.

Hans Grade

Hans Grade (Born in Köslin, May 17, 1879 - ; died October 22, 1946 in Borkheide) was a German aviation pioneer.
Hans Grade was an engineer and a German aviation-pioneer. On 28 October 1908 he successfully conducted the first motor-flight over German soil in a motorised triplane aircraft of his own construction at Magdeburg. 
A year later, on 30 October 1909, flying a new monoplane design he won the 40.000 Reichsmark "Lanz-Preis der Lufte", for the first German to fly a flat "8" in a German aircraft with German engine around two pylons 1000 meters apart, no match for pilots from other nations at that time.
In 1910 he established the first aviation school in Germany.
A Grade monoplane carried Germany's first air mail, when pilot Pentz made a flight from Bork to Bruck in February 1912 with a small sack of mail in his lap. Although successful, Grade monoplanes did not become as famous as many contemporary European designs, and for this reason comparatively few were built. 
In 1921 he established an automobile company called "Grade Automobilwerke AG", which produced small, 2 seater personal cars.
The small aircraft company, founded with this money, did not survived the Versaille-agreement of 1918. His extraordinary construction of driving a car with no use of a gear-box did not stand against the established constructions. 
The Grade Automobilwerke AG was closed in 1927 owing to financial difficulties. After the Nazi takeover in the 1930s Grade tried, without success, to develop a new Volksflugzeug and in 1934 he undertook research projects for the German aircraft manufacturers.
In 1939 May 14 he re-flew his original monoplane from 1909, then 30 years old, at Berlin Tempelhof Airport for about 550 metres to celebrate his sixtieth birthday.
Hans Grade died in 1946 at the age of 67.

William Gordon Harris

Sir William Gordon Harris KBE CB (10 June 1912 – 20 February 2005) was a British civil engineer.
Harris was born in Liverpool on 10 June 1912. He studied the Mechanical Sciences Tripos at Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge. Harris worked for the London Midland and Scottish Railway as an engineer from 1932 until 1935 when he transferred to the Irrigation Department of Sudan. He returned from Sudan in 1937 to work in the Civil Engineer's Department of the Admiralty, the start of a 26 year association with that department. Harris married Margaret Harvie in 1938, he would have three sons, one daughter and sixteen grandchildren with her. Harris received several promotions during his time with the Admiralty, becoming Assistant Civil Engineer in Chief in 1950, Deputy Civil Engineer in Chief in 1955 and Civil Engineer in Chief in 1959. Harris gained a Commonwealth Fund of New York Scholarship in 1950 which allowed him to spend two years with the US Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks. In 1960 he became the Director-General of Navy Works at the Admiralty, a post he would hold until the reorganisation which followed the merger of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army administrations into the Ministry of Defence in 1963. During his time with the Admiralty Harris saw the last large gunnery ships go out of service to be replaced with submarines and aircraft carriers. This change of fleet composition required a revolution in dockyard facilities, for which he was responsible, especially those at Faslane, the submarine base.
In the 1963 Queen's Birthday Honours Harris was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and became Director-General of Works at the Ministry of Public Building and Works. From 1965 Harris was the Director-General of Highways at the Ministry of Transport (later the Department of the Environment). During this time he was responsible for all design, construction and maintenance of roads in England. Harris's tenure as Director-General saw the construction of 650 miles of motorways and an expenditure of £2.2 billion on new road construction. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours. Harris was involved with the Permanent Association of Navigation Congresses from 1969 until 1985 and from 1970 to 1971 was the UK's chief delegate to the Permanent Association of Roads Congresses. Harris was a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1971 to 1974 and president from November 1974 to November 1975. In 1973 Harris left the Department of the Environment and became a partner at Peter Fraenkel & Partners, a position he held for the next five years.
From 1976 to 1979 Harris was chairman of the Construction Industry Manpower Board and from 1978 to 1987 was the chairman of the B&CE Holiday Management Company and Benefit Trust Company, a provider of benefits, holiday pay and pensions to the construction industry. Harris was the deputy chairman of the board of the Port of Dover for 1980 to 1982, having been a member of the board since 1959. In 1984 He was elected president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. In 1985 he received the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award from the US Army Corps of Engineers in recognition of his work to secure an international agreement upon the disposal of dredged material. His wife, Margaret, died in 1991 and in 1992 he married Rachel Bishop. Harris died at East Carlton, Northamptonshire on 20 February 2005.

Chetna

Chetna is a 1970 Bollywood action film directed by B.R. Ishara. The film stars Shatrughan Sinha, Anil Dhawan, and Rehana Sultan. The film focuses on the subject of rehabilitation of prostitutes. However, the film is more famous for its bold scenes of the actress Rehana Sultan. The film virtually ended the film career as she was typecast thereafter. One of its songs, "Main To Har Mod Par Tujhko Doonga Sada," is singer Mukesh's all-time memorable and popular song.
Plot Summary.
In this film, actor Anil Dhawan (elder brother of director David Dhawan) plays the role of a shy and reclusive young man by the name of Anil, who gets introduced to a beautiful prostitute named Seema (Rehana Sultana) through his friend, Ramesh (Shatrughan Sinha). Anil and Seema become good friends through their increasing patience, acceptance, and understanding of each other's ways. They eventually fall in love.
One day, Anil proposes to Seema, and although Seema is happy about this, she's very reluctant in taking the decision to proceed with him because she's not sure if she can lead a normal life after marriage. Still, she accepts the proposal, and Anil offers her to stay with him for some time before she marries him. Seema becomes convinced that Anil truly loves her, and that she can actually lead a normal life with him. She starts to plan for her marriage, and, during that time, a matter comes up in which Anil has to go out of town for a few days.
When he returns, he returns to an unrecognizable Seema. Seema takes up drinking, smoking, and develops a very nonchalant and distant attitude towards him. He wonders what might have happened to her during his absence. Unknowing to him, Seema comes to know that she's pregnant and she doesn't know who the father is. Not wanting Anil to be ridiculed and cursed by society, she consumes poison.
Major comeback in Indian cinema and exotic scenes.
Music.
The musical score for the film was composed by Sapan-Jagmohan. The lyrics were written by Naqsh Lyallpuri.

Alexander von Wagner

Alexander originally Sándor von Wagner (April 16, 1838 – January 19, 1919) was a Hungarian painter.
Biography.
Wagner was born in Pesth. After graduating from the Real-Gymnasium in his hometown at the age of nineteen, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts at Vienna, where he was a student of Henrik Weber. The following year, he switched to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Munich and was taught by Professor Karl von Piloty from 1856 to 1864. From 1869 to 1910 he was professor in history painting at the Munich Academy. His themes were history paintings and Hungarian life scenes in particular. A portrait of Von Wagner painted by Franz Lachner belongs to the collection of the Gebrüder-Lachner-Museum in Rain since 2003. Among his students were Pál Szinyei Merse, Emil Wiesel, Anton Ažbe, Franciszek Żmurko.
Von Wagner died in Munich, where he is buried in the Old Southern Cemeterey.
Works.
His most famous work is "Chariot Race" (now at the Manchester Art Gallery), which he painted for the Vienna Exposition (1873) and then expanded to a larger size for the Columbian Exposition (Chicago Fair) of 1893. The painting depicts the close of a chariot race in the Circus Maximus in Ancient Rome, presided over by Emperor Domitian. "Chariot Race "was completed in 1882 just two years after the publication of Ben-Hur. The painting depicts the loss of a wheel of a chariot at the hight of the race. In the original book the wheel is "crushed", in the painting it is shown intact spinning off to the left.
In the painting "After the Hunt" (1864) Wagner portrayed his wife Bertha von Oldenburg in the circle of an elegant company of hunters, dressed in the historical costumes from the period of Mathias Corvinus. Another famous work was a round panorama of old Rome, titled "Das alte Rom mit dem Triumphzuge Kaiser Constantin’s im Jahre 312 n.Chr.", which he painted in cooperation with Josef Bühlmann in Munich in 1888. The painting was destroyed, and repainted by Yadegar Asisi in the Leipzig Panometer.

Chemical Workers' Union (Czechoslovakia)

The Chemical Workers' Union was a trade union in the Czechoslovakia. The union was led by Josef Hais. The union published "Dělnik" ('Worker'). As of 1921, the Chemical Workers' Union had a membership of 76,978.
The Chemical Workers' Union was affiliated with the "Odborové sdružení československé" (OSČ). However, within OSČ the Chemical Workers' Union represented a leftist position. Hais upled the line of 'non-compromising socialism'. Overall, the chemical industry workers were amongst the lowest paid workers in Czechoslovakia at the time, a fact that contributed to the radicalization of their union.
The OSČ rightwing branded Hais as a 'communist', and in February 1921 a rightist splinter union was formed under the leadership of Karel Piták.
In June 1922, communist trade unionists were expelled from the Metalworkers' Union (a union which was firmly controlled by Social Democrats). They then formed the 'Opposition Committee of Metalworkers'. The Opposition Committee was provisionally accepted into the Chemical Workers' Union.
On 25 June 1922, a conference of revolutionary trade unionists was held in Brno. The conference staked out plans for a new trade union centre. At the conference an 'Agitation Committee for the Red International of Labour Unions' was formed, with Josef Hais as its secretary. In July 1922 the board of the Chemical Workers' Union decided that the union would join the new trade union centre once it was formed. On 13 July 1922, the Chemical Workers' Union was expelled from OSČ.
When the new, pro-communist trade union centre "Mezinárodní všeodborový svaz" (MVS) was formed in October 1922, the Chemical Workers' Union merged into it as its Chemical workers' section. At the time of the merger, 45,068 workers of the Chemical Workers' Union joined MVS.

Causeless cause

Causeless Cause (or Uncaused Cause, "All-Cause") in Theosophy, is 'An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle...' also described as 'infinity' to (impersonal) 'intelligence' & (divine) 'spirit' & 'consciousness' (but also non-consciousness or at least unconsciousness) & 'essence' to 'the one life.'
Causeless cause is synonymous with 'the absolute,' which 'Protologos' is often confused with, but it is not: 'first' (Gk. 'proto') denotes finite bound, but causeless cause is unbounded. Hindus and Theosophists call it Para Brahman (Parabrahm.) Formless Parabrahm is said to periodically emanate Logoi, which are hence not causeless, but are non-eternal except in cycles of emanation, existence, pralaya (dissolution.) In each cycle, causeless cause causes the Logoic Monad to move into action, which develops into the Logoic Triad/triple manifestation, and the heptad (i.e. seven; prajapatis (Devas) or Elohim,) which continue the cosmic chain of cause and effect. It has been shown the causeless cause is so described in some religious cosmogenesis accounts.
The ideas of causeless and Logoic causes are said to enable various logic. Their ideas are used in unification of metaphysics/theology—it is said such ideas are easier to understand with all symbology (seven keys) i.e. specific 'sacred sciences' fully used mainly in the East.

<doc id="20579994" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20579994" title="The Edwardians">
The Edwardians

The Edwardians (1930) is one of Vita Sackville-West's later novels and a clear critique of the Edwardian aristocratic society as well as a reflection of her own childhood experiences. It belongs to the genre of the Bildungsroman and describes the development of the main character Sebastian within his social world, in this case the aristocracy of the early 20th century.
“I ... try to remember the smell of the bus that used to meet one at the station in 1908. The rumble of its rubberless tyres. The impression of waste and extravagance which assailed one the moment one entered the doors of the house. The crowds of servants; people’s names in little slits on their bedroom doors; sleepy maids waiting about after dinner in the passages. I find that these things are a great deal more vivid to me than many things which have occurred since, but will they convey anything whatever to anyone else? Still I peg on, and hope one day to see it all under the imprint off the Hogarth Press, in stacks in the bookshops.” (Letter from West to Virginia Woolf, July 24, 1929)
Plot introduction.
The story is mainly set in the House of Chevron, an enormous country estate in the south of England. In some passages the setting switches to London, for example when Sebastian visits Teresa. The plot covers the years of Sebastian's and Viola's adolescence which means approximately 1905-1910.
Plot summary.
Sebastian, is the 19-year-old heir to the country estate of Chevron. Being at home from Oxford at the weekends he regularly attends the magnificent parties given by his widowed mother Lucy, where the guests indulge in food, drinks, games and affairs. At one of these parties he meets the adventurer Leonard Anquetil who grew up under humble circumstances but managed to become well-known and socially acknowledged due to his several successful expeditions. During a deep conversation on top of Chevron’s roof Anquetil tries to open Sebastian’s eyes displaying to him the artificiality and hypocrisy of his mother’s aristocratic society and to convince the young heir to leave his social obligations behind in order to accompany Anquetil on an expedition. However, Sebastian is not impressed enough by the predictions made by Anquetil (affairs, marriage, service to the crown, but never being completely content) to turn his back on his safe home. One of the reasons for that is the love affair he had just started with Sylvia Roehampton, a married friend of his mother. After Sylvia’s husband finds out about this relationship she, Lady Roehampton, leaves Sebastian and does not accept his offer to run away and start a new life together, since she does not want a public scandal and sticks to social conventions. Soon after, Sebastian plans to start an affair with Teresa Spedding, a doctor’s wife, but she eventually does not respond to Sebastian’s courtship. Yet coming from a middle-class background she is extremely impressed by and interested in aristocratic society. Sebastian, being disappointed and never seeming to be content, attempts to distract himself by having two more affairs with women from different classes. During the coronation ceremony of George V, which he attends, he finally gives in to the expectations and obligations his family history imposes on him and plans to marry a decent young lady and to settle down in a career at the Court. Just a few moments later, he meets Leonard Anquetil again, who informs him that he is going to marry Sebastian’s independent sister Viola, to whom the adventurer regularly wrote letters in the last years, and repeats his offer to join him on an expedition. Stunned by this possibility Sebastian agrees to accompany him.
Main characters.
Sebastian: age 19, attractive, heir of Chevron
Viola: Sebastian's younger sister, independent, critical, breaks through expected conventions
Lucy / Duchess of Chevron: Sebastian's and Viola's mother, widow, follows the conventions of the aristocratic society
Sylvia, Lady Roehampton: notable aristocratic woman, Sebastian's first love affair, friend of the Duchess of Chevron
Leonard Anquetil: self-made man, independent, no obligations to society
Teresa Spedding: middle-class woman, wife of a doctor, overcomes the temptation to have a liaison with Sebastian, impressed by Chevron and the aristocratic society
Major themes.
• Vita Sackville-West gives insight into the every day life of the upper class of the Edwardian era. She describes the occasions where the high society meets regularly such as the glamorous parties, which are given every weekend by Sebastian’s mother Lucy, and the numerous luncheons which take place during the week. The customs and free time activities like playing cards are also mentioned. With this presentation, however, Sackville-West reveals the majority of the aristocracy and upper class as superficial and artificially constructed. A lot of members of this social group are not authentically interested in anything other than their personal entertainment. Intellectual issues are discussed only superficially and cultural institutions are only visited for representational reasons. An awareness that the keeping of the expensive lifestyle is only possible with the help of servants, is absent in the minds of most aristocrats Sackville-West depicts. 
• Chevron, the estate of Sebastian’s family, forms a world of its own, since it seems to be an independent community with its own shops and a loyal staff which mostly consists of families. The peaceful atmosphere and the rituals, such as the Christmas tree ceremony, and the consistent rules are of high value for Sebastian, the squire. However, Chevron is about to undergo changes too. The son of a loyal employee for instance, does not want to follow his family tradition and work at Chevron, but turns his back on it and plans to start working in the motor industries. 
Leonard Anquetil compares Chevron to a “splendid tomb” and states, that “the house is dying from the top”, which indicates change. 
• Most of the married couples in The Edwardians did not marry for romantic reasons but represent convenience marriages, which are to maintain social standards. To compensate the desire for affection, extramarital affairs according to the concept of polyamory are common practice. However, these affairs are to be kept secret, and scandals such as divorces have to be avoided by all means. That is why Sylvia Roehampton does not leave her husband in order to start a new life with Sebastian, but abides with her husband so that a scandal and social downfall can be prevented. 
Sackville-West also describes the different social expectations to the different genders concerning their sexuality. Relationships out of wedlock are accepted with males (Sebastian), whereas upper class women would be disowned. 
• The question whether individuals are allowed to follow their personal decisions and to be self-determined or whether they have to stick to social conventions and family traditions, is also posed by Sackville-West. Leonard Anquetil and Viola, representatives of the former, decide to lead an independent life, make their own decisions and emancipate (Viola) themselves from aristocratic conventions. 
Sylvia Roehampton, representative of the latter, on the other side, decides to subordinate her personal desires, such as her love for Sebastian, to tradition and the expectations of the upper class. 
Sebastian is torn between those two positions.
Biographical influences.
“Vita had done what she set out to do: write a popular success; and she had done it by recreating the lavish, feudal, immoral ancient régime of her childhood. ... Chevron ... is Knole in every detail ... . She promotes the lady of the house to the rank of Duchess, and divides her own personality between the two children of the house – Sebastian, the young heir, dark moody and glamorous, and Viola his withdrawn, straight-haired, sceptical sister. 
‘No character in this book is wholly fictitious,’ she wrote provocatively in her Author’s Note.”
Her writing of "The Edwardians" was greatly affected by Virginia Woolf, Vita’s female lover who introduced her to the Bloomsbury culture. Through her own novel "Orlando", the protagonist of which is wholly based on Vita, she inspired her to write a novel about Knole House and her childhood experiences there herself. 
Her parents, Lionel Edward Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville and Victoria Sackville-West, had great influence on the development of Vita’s personality. 
As their only child she had to replace the male heir for her father who introduced her to the duties of a squire and whose love for Knole House, representing to her permanence and security, she adopted. However she could never inherit it because of her female gender. Therefore in "The Edwardians" Knole revives in Chevron as well in its physical features as also in the customs cultivated there.
The relationship towards her mother was torn between hatred and love, the last overweighing. Vita was not to dwarf her own beauty or question her value system. Therefore Vita tended to suppress her feminine side and adopt traits of masculine courting behaviour. Lady Sackville-West was a major model for the aristocratic ladies in "The Edwardians", where Vita also dealt with the mother-daughter relationship of the Edwardian age.
Vita’s personality was embossed by dualities. Those can be seen in her relationships, her conception of gender, and herself being torn between conformity to traditions and genetic inheritance and her wish for self-determination. This is mirrored in the characters of Sebastian and Viola in "The Edwardians".
Critical reception.
In general, the book received positive reviews and sold well: 30,000 copies were sold in the first six months in England, and 80,000 copies in the first year in the United States.
Review highlights.

Positive:
• Clear picture of pre-war fashionable English society
• Brilliant comedy of manners
• Vivid atmosphere
• Good integration of “real people” + celebrities 
Negative:
• Autobiographical facts → Artistic reality not convincing enough: Sebastian + Leonard Anquetil not as “artistically […] alive” as the Duchess of Chevron, Viola, Lady Roehampton, Theresa and her husband, the servants + Lord Roehampton’s discovery of the intrigue
• Exaggeration in depiction of English aristocracy → Edwardian elite painted too “black”
• Has “overstepped the limits of fair comment the depiction of … the follies and falsities of the old regime”

The Meaning of Love (album)

The Meaning of Love is the only album by Scottish pop singer Michelle McManus released on Sony BMG/Syco. The album was released on February 16, 2004 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was Michelle's first album since winning the UK Talent show Pop Idol in December 2003. The album yielded two UK Top 20 singles "All This Time" (which charted at number one) and the album's title track "The Meaning of Love".
Reception.
Aside from a smattering of reviews that wavered on ambivalence, "The Meaning of Love" was released to a largely negative reception. Lynsey Hanley of "The Telegraph" wrote: "This whole record smacks of boil-in-the-bag songwriting and lazy, hasty production tarted up with cheesy strings." She also unfavourably compared McManus to previous "Pop Idol" victor Will Young, saying that she lacked his "genuine soulfulness", and that the song "All This Time", "was one of the lamest Pop Idol-sponsored efforts yet." Fiona Shepherd of "The Scotsman" delivered a harsh track-by-track critical assault of the record, with a particular loathing for the cover of Nina Simone’s "Feelin' Good", which according to her, had "the guts ripped out of it." An Entertainment.ie review argued that McManus was the single worst winner of the entire "Pop Idol" series, and that she made fellow reality television music competition winners Will Young and Alex Parks "look like worldbeaters by comparison". The publication asserted: "the project is sunk by McManus's vocal performances, which never rise far above the level of a very average club singer." Most scathing was the appraisal published in "Q" magazine, which described the album as "appalling" and its public release as "fiercely malicious."
Conversely, BBC journalist Ruth Mitchell opined that the album is "packed full of dreamy songs" and "surprisingly sounds like a very competent and unhurried effort indeed."
Chart performance.
The album debuted at #3 on the UK Albums Chart on the 22 February 2004. In the album's second week, it fell to #14. The album's last seen position on the UK Album Charts was at #72. The Meaning of Love made 7 weeks on the UK Album Charts, selling over 100,000 copies and being certified Gold by the BPI. Sales did not meet expectations, and McManus was dropped by her record label Sony BMG.

Stavelot Massif

The Stavelot Massif is a geological massif in the Belgian Ardennes (geologically a part of the Rhenish Massif). Most of the massif crops out in Belgium, but a small part lies across the border with Germany.
The massif consists of early Paleozoic (late Cambrian and Ordovician in age) metamorphic rocks, mostly quartzites and phyllites. In other parts of the Ardennes they form a basement which is covered by only slightly metamorphosed late Paleozoic limestones and sandstones, that only saw a low degree of metamorphism. On the other hand, the early Paleozoic rocks were deformed and metamorphosed to a higher degree during the Caledonian orogeny (about ). 
Both the Caledonian basement and the low grade cover rocks were deformed again during the Hercynian orogeny (about ). This phase of deformation created a large northeast-southwest oriented anticline that runs across the Belgian part of the Rhenish Massif (the Ardennes anticline). In the core of this anticline a number of massifs of early Paleozoic rocks crop out. The Stavelot Massif is one the larger, other Caledonian massifs are the Rocroi Massif, the Serpont Massif and the Givonne Massif.
The higher competence of the Caledonian basement rocks made them more resistant to erosion. The massif therefore forms a plateau in the topography. This plateau is called the High Fens and encompasses the highest summits of Belgium.

Rafflesia philippensis

Rafflesia philippensis is a parasitic plant species of the genus "Rafflesia" that was named by Blanco in his Flora de Filipinas in 1845. "R. philippensis" is known only from a mountain located between the provinces of Laguna and Quezon, Luzon where it was first discovered. Its plant host is "Tetrastigma pisicarpum". This species went unnoticed since its first description by Blanco but was rediscovered in 2003 by members of the Tanggol Kalikasan, a local environment conservation group in Quezon province who first saw and photographed the open flower of this species. It was brought to the attention of Manuel S. Enverga University (MSEUF), who formed a team composed of students and faculty to document the newly discovered "Rafflesia" species.
Morphology.
The mature flower bud of "R. philippensis" has a diameter of around 13-16 centimeters. Its fully opened flower has a diameter of 29.3-32 centimeters, placing it in a group composed of other small-sized "Rafflesia" species such as "R. manillana", "R. lobata", and "R. baletei", whose open flowers measure an average of 20 centimeters in diameter. The open flower has 9-10 reddish perigone lobes measuring 9.0-10.5 centimeters with 8-12 white oval or elongated warts fused together along the median part of the lobe. "R. philippensis" has a distinctive closed diaphragm, same reddish color with the perigone lobes, 3.5-4.0 centimeters thick and measuring 12.5-13.0 centimeters across. The diaphragm’s opening has a diameter of 5.5-6.0 centimeters with an inner white margin lining. The diaphragm’s surface, like the perigone, is blotted with a network of white, thin, elongated and continuous warts.
Distribution.
The species is known to occur as a small single population within the vicinity of Mount Banahaw National Park (14°03.239 N, 121°29.214 E), a protected area located south of the Laguna-Quezon provincial boundary line, between Laguna de Bay to the north and Tayabas Bay to the south. The mountain rises to about 2,100 meters above sea level. The park has been closed to the public since 2003 to allow the forest to recover from the adverse effects of human activities in the area. The population of "R. philippensis" is located along a trail in Kinabuhayan, Dolores, Quezon province.
Taxonomy.
The taxonomy and nomenclature of this species is complex. The most recent work by Dr. Julie Barcelona and colleagues has documented that the taxon named by Blanco in the mid-19th century is indeed the same as the taxon named by her own research group and that of Dr. Domingo Madulid. Thus, the two later names, "R. banahawensis" and "R. banahaw" are synonyms of "R. philippensis".

Arthur E. Drumm

Arthur E. Drumm (December 6, 1929- ) is an American inventor and industrialist of the modern street sweeping and industrial broom industry.
Early life.
Born 1929 in Marysville, Ohio, Arthur was one of 14 brothers and sisters, and the son of Francis Drumm and Evelyn Warner. Raised during the Great Depression, he worked on his father's farm from a very young age, graduated high school, and then joined the Marine Corps. He achieved the rank of staff sergeant before his discharge. Stationed in San Francisco, he would meet his wife, Roberta Bumpus. He would earn an apprenticeship in machinery, and would manage his own farm on the outskirts of Marysville until his 30's while raising his young daughters.
Inventions and Industrialism.
Industrial Brooms.
Drumm would become involved in the industrial broom industry. Industrial brooms are an emerging conservation product as the world moves toward more environmentally friendly practices. They remove harmful substances and pollutants from the roads that would otherwise drain off into vegetation and/or water sources, or be continually carried and pushed around by vehicles and other street traffic. They add longevity to asphalt through cleansing and preventing early decay. This in turn cuts down on the environmentally harmful practices of consistently paving and the manufacturing of toxic asphalt. They prevent flooding by collecting debris that would accumulate and block storm drains.
Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc..
In 1964, Drumm started Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc. in his machine shop, which was on the property of his home and farm. He would sell locally and regionally through "word of mouth." In the late 1960s he would develop a machine which made the manufacturing of wafer brooms cheaper and faster through a mechanical process, versus the old manual process. This gave the business an advantage, and production increased dramatically. He would also obtain U.S. patent 3407425 for a spacer used in rotary brush assembly in 1968. 
By the 1970s, Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc. had become a notable player in the industry, selling nationally and worldwide. Drumm would obtain numerous U.S. patents in the years to come while he led Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc.: 3900913 in 1975 (core mounting assembly for rotary brooms), 4077081 in 1978 (sweeper brush section), 4214339 in 1980 (rotary broom core assemblage), 4490872 (spiral brush section), 4490877 (spiral brush section), and 4498210 (brush bristle unit for brush rolls) in 1985. The machine shop Drumm had started in eventually would be transformed into a modern factory through additions and new construction during this period.
Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc. reached its pinnacle under Drumm by the mid-1980s. The company was attracting attention from all over with various interests, whether it was Drumm being featured on the local Columbus WBNS-TV evening news in a story about Reaganomics and the successful impact it was having locally on the economy with businesses.
For personal and retirement reasons, Drumm would let go of Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc., eventually being bought out in 1985 by Savage. Kennedy Brush, Savage's other industrial broom manufacturing company, and Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc. would merge in 1990 to form United Rotary Brush.
Drumm Industries.
Shortly after he sold Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc., Drumm would start a new company, Drumm Industries in which he manufactured push brooms. In 1988 he received U.S. patent 4763378 (push broom head of the channel-mounted bristle type).
He would focus a considerable amount of time innovating a replaceable strip brush. This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was worn out or scrapping the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain many patents relating to the strip brush innovation, including U.S. patents 5160187 in 1992, 5251355 in 1993, 5358311 and 5358312 in 1994, 5445438 in 1995, 5762404 in 1998,
Drumm Industries would eventually be sold to Sweepster.
Family and Retirement.
In 2004 he was issued U.S. patent 6681871 along with his son-in-law, which improved an auger boring device. This invention is celebrated as progress in the history cited in a patent obtained in 2007 by another individual. The "ground-breaking" product was part of a joint venture he became involved with called Custom Augers. 
The Drumm Family was honored by the Union County, OH Veterans Remembrance Committee on Veterans Day, 2008. A ceremony was held at the veterans memorial in Marysville honoring the Drumm Family's military service.

Thunder Birds (1942 film)

Thunder Birds (1942) (subtitled "Soldiers of the Air") is a Technicolor film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Gene Tierney, Preston Foster, and John Sutton. It features visually stunning aerial photography and location filming at an actual Arizona training base of the United States Army Air Forces named Thunderbird Field No. 1 during World War II.
The film was made as a propaganda vehicle to boost civilian morale at a time when American involvement in World War II was still much in doubt, while at the same time providing a look at training activities and promoting airpower as a means of winning the war. Wellman was himself a veteran of the U.S. Air Service as a World War I fighter pilot.
Plot.
Soon after the US enters World War II, Steve Britt (Preston Foster), a former World War I flying ace, arrives at Thunderbird Field looking for a job as a civilian primary flight instructor. The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. "Mac" MacDonald (Jack Holt); Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny) is in charge of Royal Air Force cadets at the base.
Steve says he wants the job because he's too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend Kay Saunders (Gene Tierney) lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus "Gramps" Saunders (George Barbier), also a close friend of Steve's.
Steve immediately flies to their ranch and flies stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls. When he lands she seems miffed, but responds to his passionate kiss of greeting. Kay is still very fond of him, but no longer deeply in love.
Steve is introduced to the new class of RAF cadets, including Peter Stackhouse (John Sutton), whose father Steve knew. (Another cadet is Peter Lawford in an uncredited role.) But Peter flies clumsily and is sick from acrophobia. Mac warns Steve to "wash them out fast" if cadets can't perform, so after three such failures, Steve tries to persuade Peter to transfer.
But Peter is confident he can overcome what he calls his "conditional reflex", and asks for more time.
In a flashback, he relates that his brother was killed on a bombing mission. Their grandmother, Lady Jane Stackhouse (Dame May Whitty), summons Peter (an intern at a London hospital) home to show him the check she is sending Winston Churchill for the purchase of a new bomber to carry on the fight in Tom's memory, since no male is left in the family to do so. Peter contradicts her: he has left his hospital service and transferred to the RAF to learn to fly. After hearing his story, Steve agrees to keep Peter in training.
On his first leave from duty, Peter meets Kay Saunders and is immediately infatuated. She dates Peter, but warns him that she might still be in love with Steve. Still, her instincts warn her that Steve would make a poor husband: he seems a carefree nomad not interested in settling down.
Peter admires Steve and is grateful to him, so he warns Steve that he is in love with Kay and intends to propose marriage. Steve promises that he won't wash out Peter because of their rivalry. His judgment tells him that Peter will one day be a fine pilot. Squadron Leader Barrett gives Peter a check flight and he gets sick again. Steve stands by Peter in a showdown, threatening to resign.
Gramps throws a Fourth of July party for the cadets and, to help Steve win Kay, tricks Peter into riding a bucking bronco. This backfires when Peter proves to be an adept horseman. Steve sees that Kay has fallen in love with Peter, even before she realizes it herself.
The decision on Peter's training must be made. Steve tells Peter to fly the plane just as he rode the bronco, by easing up and relaxing. The advice works. Steve then forces Peter to fly solo by bailing out! But he descends into a sandstorm and is blown along the ground toward a cliff.
Peter lands nearby and saves Steve, but the wind flips his airplane over
before they can return to it. Mac believes that Peter's incompetence caused the damage, washes him out, and fires Steve. Kay tricks Mac and Barrett into giving them one more chance. She tells Steve that she has decided to marry Peter, and reminds him of his own words about where the war will be won. Peter makes good on the faith shown in him, making a deadstick landing when his engine fails during his solo. Soon after, Steve, hobbling on a cane, greets an incoming class of new RAF cadets.
Production notes.
"Thunder Birds" was intended by Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck to be a follow-up to his popular "A Yank in the R.A.F.", given the working title of "A Tommy in the U.S.A." Using the pen name "Melville Crossman," Zanuck himself wrote the original story. William Wellman agreed to direct in exchange for financial backing from Zanuck to film the novel "The Ox-Bow Incident", which Wellman began immediately after production ended for "Thunder Birds". 
At one point it was announced that Dana Andrews would play the lead in "Thunder Birds" opposite Gene Tierney, with whom he eventually made five films.
Filming of "Thunder Birds" coincided with the time frame of the story. Production filming began on location at the actual Thunderbird Field No. 1 northwest of Phoenix, Arizona from mid-March 1942 and ended May 6. Additional sequences were filmed in the first week of June 1942, and retakes during July. The storyline revolved around cadets flying the Stearman PT-17 primary trainer, but also featured many live action formation flights of BT-13 Valiant and North American AT-6 trainers. Stunt pilot Paul Mantz flew the live action flying scenes.
Home video release.
20th Century Fox released "Thunder Birds" on June 6, 2006 as a Region 1 DVD, while in Region 2, it is available as part of a DVD box-set of Gene Tierney's films for TCF.

William Delbert Gann

William Delbert Gann (June 6, 1878 – June 18, 1955) or WD Gann, was a finance trader who developed the technical analysis tools known as Gann angles, Square of 9, Hexagon, Circle of 360 (these are "Master charts"). Gann market forecasting methods are based on geometry, astronomy and astrology, and ancient mathematics. Opinions are sharply divided on the value and relevance of his work. Gann wrote a number of books on trading.
Biography.
Gann was born June 6, 1878 in Lufkin, Texas. His father was a cotton farmer. He started trading in 1902 when he was 24.
He was believed to be a religious man by nature who believed in religious as well as scientific value of Bible as the greatest book ever written. This can be repeatedly observed in his books.
He was also a 33rd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite Order, to which some have attributed his knowledge of ancient mathematics, though he was also known to have studied the ancient Greek and Egyptian cultures.
Stock market trading.
Gann described the use of angles in the stock market in "The Basis of My Forecasting Method" (1935). Calculating a "Gann angle" is equivalent to finding the derivative of a particular line on a chart in a simple way. Each geometrical angle (which is really a line extended into space) divides time and price into proportionate parts. The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45° angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. If you draw a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, you have illustrated the concept of the 1x1 angle, which moves up one point per day.
There has been a general disagreement whether he made profits by speculation himself. However, his famous Ticker Interview shows that his claim to profits was as real as his documented forecasts.

Balsamorhiza sagittata

Balsamorhiza sagittata is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower tribe of the plant family Asteraceae known by the common name arrowleaf balsamroot. It is native to much of western North America from British Columbia to California to the Dakotas, where it grows in many types of habitat from mountain forests to grassland to desert scrub. It is drought tolerant. All of the plant can be eaten.
Description.
This is a taprooted perennial herb growing a hairy, glandular stem 20 to 60 centimeters tall. The branching, barky root may extend over two meters deep into the soil. The basal leaves are generally triangular in shape and are large, approaching 50 centimeters in maximum length. Leaves farther up the stem are linear to narrowly oval in shape and smaller. The leaves have untoothed edges and are coated in fine to rough hairs, especially on the undersides. 
The inflorescence bears one or more flower heads. Each head has a center of long yellowish tubular disc florets and a fringe of bright yellow ray florets, each up to 4 centimeters long. The fruit is a hairless achene about 8 millimeters long. Grazing animals find the plant palatable, especially the flowers and developing seed heads.
Uses.
Many Native American groups, including the Nez Perce, Kootenai, Cheyenne, and Salish, utilized the plant as a food and medicine.
Under the name Okanagan Sunflower, it is the official flower emblem of the city of Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.

<doc id="20580275" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20580275" title="White City (Chicago)">
White City (Chicago)

White City (sometimes listed as White City Amusement Park in print advertisements) was a recreational area located in the Greater Grand Crossing and Woodlawn community areas on the south side of Chicago from 1905 until the 1950s. At the time of its opening, on May 26, 1905, it was claimed to be the largest park of its type in the United States. It contributed to Chicago's status as the city with the most amusement parks in the United States until 1908. It eventually introduced the world to the Goodyear Blimp, which was first assembled at the park.
Background.
"Time" once used the park as point of reference for the city of Chicago. The park was located at 63rd Street and South Avenue and covered fourteen acres of land with gardens and strolling paths. There were several buildings all lined with white lights, from which the park took its name. One of the buildings housed a ballroom with a dancefloor large enough for 1,000 dancers. The park had a tower that could be seen for . The College Inn, a restaurant, could seat 2,500 diners at a time. "White City" was also the name associated with the landscaping and architecture of the World's Columbian Exposition, held near the same location in 1893 because the exhibition's buildings used plaster of Paris and were painted a chalky white. In its prime the park rivalled Coney Island as a model for worldwide amusement park architects, designers and planners. There was no general admission ticket, and patrons purchased tickets to use each of the park's features.
Early history.
White City was originally envisioned to be like Dreamland, a park in Brooklyn that was widely praised for its amazing spectacles. The park's ambitious plan faced obstacles. The newspapers reported on the construction rush, which led to an incident in February 1905 when three plasterers fell from a scaffold, as they worked on a ceiling. After the park had opened, there was one occasion when a ride malfunctioned; a patron was killed, and two other patrons were injured. A year later, the park's roller coaster also malfunctioned, injuring twelve people. The new park's operation appeared as safe as similar parks, and almost from the beginning, White City was very well received. The city experienced dramatic increases in ridership on the public transportation that took people to White City. In August 1905, ridership on the South Side 'L' Train rose by 11,000 fares over the amount of riders from a year earlier, an increase directly attributed to the opening of the park.
1950s and 1960s newspaper articles associated the park with an owner named Aaron Jones who was a Chicago entrepreneur who had been a successful operator of a penny-arcade business. Jones had visited the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and been so impressed that he aspired to create an amusement park that was similar to it. Earlier 1905–1915 newspaper accounts had said the owners were two Chicago brothers, Morris and Joseph Beifeld. Morris was frequently called the president of the corporation that operated the park, and the 1910 United States Census states that he is President of the White City Amusement Park. Newspaper articles that reported declining business in 1911 called Morris the "President of White City Construction Company, which operates the Chicago amusement park." Joseph was the proprietor of the Hotel Sherman (originally called the Sherman House) but in an article about self-made millionaires, the "Chicago Tribune" noted that he was not only a hotel magnate but "principal stockholder in the White City Amusement and Construction Company." Also in 1907, the "Tribune" referred to the White City Amusement Park's executives as "President Joseph Beifeld, Treasurer Aaron J. Jones, and General Manager Paul D. Howse." Mr. Howse had been a journalist in Chicago, and his July 10, 1933 obituary stated that he was one of White City's founders and its first general manager.
Admission was ten cents in the early years, and newspaper ads noted that White City was open rain or shine. In good weather, patrons could enjoy "...the spacious plaza, the outdoor sports and amusements", and if the weather was inclement, there was "...the excellent vaudeville show, the Chicago fire, ...the Baby Incubators, the Wild Animals show..." In August 1906, the list of features at the park included these: Big Otto's Trained Wild Animal Show, Hale's Tours of the World, Flying Airships, Temple of Palmistry, Scenic Railway, Trip to Mars, Infant Incubators, Electric Cooking, the Midget City, and the Chutes.
The park information mentioned a small Ferris wheel that had six cars and a miniature railroad. The park also featured the first Shoot-the-Chutes ride in Chicago. It also featured a roller coaster and the Garden Follies Dancers. The park featured regular outdoor concerts, and it had a roller rink. The park hosted burlesque shows, and performers like Annette Kellerman, Bill Cody and Sophie Tucker performed at the park regularly. Daredevil aeronautic shows of performers like Horace Wild were also common at the park.
Prior to political correctness concerns, Midget City was a very popular exhibit. This exhibit featureed 50 men and women who all had dwarfism; at the time, the word used to describe them was 'midgets,' and working the carnival circuit was one of the few jobs open to them. The exhibit showed a miniature city, with a miniature mayor, and even miniature horses. Also popular was the "Chicago Fire" exhibit, which featured an exhibit described as a faithful reproduction of the burning of the city: "... a panoramic display... in miniature, with all the addenda of realistic fire and smoke effects and crumbling of buildings..."
Beginning in the summer of 1906, the "Chicago Tribune" newspaper made use of White City to hold an annual benefit for Chicago's hospitals, with the proceeds devoted to helping babies who needed care. In addition to the regular exhibits, there were well-known bands of the day that came to perform: for example, in August 1907, the Kilties, a Canadian band that played Scottish music, performed traditional Scottish folk music and folk dances. The Baby Incubators exhibit, a feature of several other fairs and parks of that time, attracted much attention and many donations. There is evidence that tiny infants were displayed at White City from the park's earliest days. The stories of the struggle for survival of these so-called "incubator babies" even made the west coast newspapers. (For example, a story of a 1 pound, 4 oz. infant from Indiana, called the "Tiniest Baby in the World", was written up in the "San Francisco Chronicle", July 20, 1905, p. 2) At the time, not every hospital had incubators, and the Chicago Tribune was among the newspapers that used the Baby Incubator displays to raise money so that all hospitals in the Chicago area would have them. By 1908, another area amusement park, Riverview Park, was also involved in this cause. From 1906 through 1920, a doctor, identified in some sources as simply "Dr. Couney", and elsewhere as Dr. M.A. McConey or Dr. M.A. Couney maintained an exhibit of an incubator in which live infants were tended, including the daughter of the editor of the "Chicago Tribune".
In October 1910, White City served as the home of a major Christian evangelistic crusade. Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman and Mr. Charles M. Alexander made use of the ballroom, which seated nearly 4000, and they brought with them a chorus of several hundred people. The evangelists planned to make appearances all over the Chicago area during the month, but wanted to do something very memorable to begin their revival. They felt that White City was the place to launch the crusade in a very spectacular fashion.
In late September 1911, White City experienced a serious fire, as flames swept through the southern section of the park. Newspaper reports said it started in a storage area near the railway, and it attracted a large crowd. A strong north wind kept the fire contained to the rear of the park, which prevented a nearby 200 foot tower in the center of the boardwalk from being destroyed. Firefighters were able to put the fire out without anyone sustaining serious injuries. The scenic railway and half of the Figure 8 took the brunt of the damage.
During the early 1920s, the park continued to be involved with charity benefits. A "Chicago Tribune" advice columnist whose pen name was "Sally Joy Brown" sponsored a children's event beginning in 1923. Sally Joy's column had become famous for getting readers to do good deeds to help the poor, and even children often participated in lending a hand. Now, the newspaper wanted to provide free access to the park for 100 lucky boys and girls who sent in the best letters explaining why they wanted to come to Sally's party and spend a day at White City. Many of the children who responded had never been to an amusement park. This content continued into the early 1930s, when the "Sally Joy" of that time was a woman named Ann Nangle.
White City served as the place of assembly and departure point for the first Goodyear Blimp, called the "Wingfoot Air Express". Both B. F. Goodrich and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company assembled dirigibles at the park for the United States Navy. A dirigible serviced the park, bringing passengers from Chicago's Grant Park. On July 21, 1919, the dirigible run crashed into the Illinois Trust & Savings Building on LaSalle Street, killing twelve and injuring twenty-eight. The pilot, John A. Boettner was saved by his parachute. He was arrested, pending an investigation of the tragedy, but later released without charges. This crash resulted in the closure of the Grant Park Airstrip and the creation of the Chicago Air Park (currently Midway International Airport).
There was another fire at the park in early July 1925, and although it did some damage, it was contained without any serious injuries. A later fire in June 1927, however, was much more serious. Starting in the ballroom, it spread and did over $200,000 in damage; the tower that was not harmed in the 1911 fire finally was destroyed in this blaze. Some historians believe the 1927 fire signalled the beginning of the end for the park.
Later history.
White City had experienced periodic financial problems because attendance was dependent on the economy. As far back as 1915, there had been a question of whether the park's lease would be renewed, but finally the landlord, Chicago business mogul J. Ogden Armour re-negotiated it and the park remained open. But the Depression, along with the ongoing problems from the fires of 1925 and 1927, had a very negative impact on White City. Although 1930 still wasn't too bad for White City, with each successive year, attendance declined, and by 1933, the company that operated it was unable to pay the taxes that were due, causing the park to be placed in receivership.
White City continued to deteriorate until it was condemned in 1939 and its facilities were auctioned off in 1946.
In 1945, the land on which White City had stood was designated for a co-operative housing development for African-Americans. The irony, as reporters from black newspapers like the "Chicago Defender" quickly pointed out, was that the history of the White City Amusement Park had been one of de facto segregation. Black people were discouraged from attending during the park's early years. As far back as 1912, there had been comments that the name "White City" was very appropriate, given how it seemed to be a park for white people, and where black people served as objects of ridicule: one game was called the "African Dip", and it involved patrons throwing projectiles at the head of a black person, and trying to hit him. Black columnists were irate that some black men willingly took these kinds of jobs. Admission policies were desegregated when the neighborhood changed and more people of color resided nearby. The housing development was to be called Parkway Gardens, and at the time, it was seen as a hopeful sign that a neglected neighborhood would have new housing.
The same anti-black policies that had beset the amusement park also applied to the roller rink at the park. The rink was still open, and during in the 1940s, it became the site of demonstrations and brawls as Blacks fought for their right to roller skate indoors. In 1942, the Congress of Racial Equality was involved in one of these rallies. In 1946, the Congress of Racial Equality sued the management of the rink, saying it was violating the Illinois Civil Rights Law. Eventually, the White City rink was desegregated and changed its name to Park City. However, the Park City rink closed in 1958.
Today, White City Amusement Park, which was once considered the equal of other turn of the century parks like Coney Island, is all but forgotten; but in its heyday, it was known as "the city of a million electric lights", because its tower was an amazing sight that could be seen for 15 miles.

MANAPO

The Macedonian National Movement (abbreviated MANAPO) (, transliterated: "Makedonski Nacionalen Pokret") was a leftist movement started in 1936 among the progressive Macedonian students in the Belgrade and Zagreb universities in the period between the World Wars. 
MANAPO's aims were to help bring about democracy in Yugoslavia and to fight for the right to self-determination of the Bulgarians in Vardar Macedonia. The official historiography in post-1945 Yugoslavia and present-day Republic of Macedonia plays down the Bulgarian nature of this organization and claims that MANAPO's platform was based on the awaking of the Macedonian national conscience among the Macedonian Slavic-speaking population, the affirmation of the Macedonian language as well as fight against the Serbian hegemony and fascism.
When MANAPO was dissolved in the beginning of the Second World War, with some of its members entering the ranks of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, while others felt the aims of the organization had been established with the liberation of Vardar Macedonia by Bulgaria in 1941.

Paradise Found (band)

Paradise Found is an acoustic/electronic band from Reading, UK. They make recordings under the Dancing Turtle Records label. Their first self-titled album was a combination of warm repetitive guitar loops with occasional vocals. Their music is a blend that borrows from the likes of Boards of Canada and Steve Reich to create a minimalist hypnotic sound.
Paradise Found recorded their second album with Tears for Fears producer and Adam and the Ants drummer Chris Hughes. It was released in 2009.
History.
Paradise Found started out as a band formed by J. Ellis and T. Smith to play ambient music for friends at the "Pans Garden parties" held around Wiltshire, UK. Their philosophy was that people could have a good time while listening to calm music. They performed looped guitar and vocal-based songs with repeating simple melodies, the effect being a type of hypnosis similar to that of trance music.
From 2007 bassist/guitarist Tom Ferreira brought some more depth to the sound of Paradise Found with simple bass loops and additional rhythm guitar.
Paradise Found released their third album 'Deep Paradise' digitally on January 10th 2010 through www.deepparadise.com. The new album merges acoustic folk sound with more dark and moody electronics The tracks "Zen Love" and "We're an Object" could be considered the 'singles' of the album and have vocals that bring together the chilled beats and dark electronica sounds, instrumental tracks "Apep", "Theps" and "Eight8" is where you hear them shift into their new moody electronic sound but still incorporating harmonising layers creating a feeling of peace. Other tracks like "The Sun Will Rise" and "The Tower" bear a greater resemblance to their previous albums with layered guitar, vocal, ambient noise and beats tracks. 
Paradise Found were set to spend 2010 touring the United Kingdom.
