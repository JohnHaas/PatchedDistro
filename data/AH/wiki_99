Shalimar railway station

Shalimar Station is one of four intercity railway stations serving Howrah and Kolkata, India; the others are Sealdah Station, in Kolkata, Kolkata Station in Kolkata and Howrah Station in Howrah. Shalimar station is situated in the Shalimar area of Howrah. It is located near Shibpur area of Howrah. It is one of the cleanest, most well-maintained and non-congested railway terminals in the Kolkata area.
History.
The place where now the station is situated was formerly a very small rail station, and served by some diesel loco hauled trains. The present platforms were occupied by some goods lines. Those lines were a part of large Shalimar rail yard.
In 2000, the first plan was conceived to utilise this area as a bigger rail station. The rapidly growing long distance passengers were gradually overcrowding the Howrah station. Due to the limitation of space, new platform construction is restricted at Howrah. Although 3 new platforms (17, 22 & 23) were constructed at Howrah during 2006 – 2008, those were not sufficient. Side by side, due to its almost central position in Howrah, Howrah station is too busy for both suburban and long distance rail traffic. Unlike Sealdah Station, Howrah Station has less suburban trains than long-distance trains. Due to increasing of Eastern Railway trains, many platforms, which were previously built for South Eastern Railway trains, now often occupied by Eastern Railway trains. But many people of Howrah feel that it is much easy to catch a long distance train from Howrah than Sealdah, particularly in early morning and late night. But due to platform limitation, increasing the number of long distance trains was not possible from Howrah for South Eastern Railway.
To overcome this problem, South Eastern Railway suggested to Indian Railway officers to construct another bigger rail station at Howrah, mostly for long distance trains. The many unutilised and not so utilised tracks of Shalimar yard was the first choice of the authority.
Construction started from 2000. The construction of platforms, station buildings & car parking area were started. After the completion, other tracks were re-aligned. The tracks around platform were completely electrified for passenger coaches shunting. At first, only one express train started. This train stopped later and then other long distance trains started. From this time, diesel loco hauled trains were replaced by EMU trains, which started suburban services..
Services.
The station is served by the South Eastern Railway for trains to Amta, Haldia, Kanthi, Medinipur and others. The number of suburban trains is lower than long-distance trains. This station runs some long distance express trains to various destinations. There are two platforms, among them Platform 1 is used by only suburban trains, and Platform 2 is used by long-distance trains. The station is operated by the South Eastern Railway.
Facilities.
There is a taxi stand and a bus stand outside the station. The nearest tram terminus was formerly Shibpur, but it was closed in 1971.
Criticism.
As a newest rail station, this station is not well connected by public transport. The most direct service to the station is taxi, which is not preferable by poor. Only two West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation's bus routes serve the station directly. Other buses run through College Road, which is 1 km away from the station. It is often impossible to walk this 1 km with heavy luggage for a commuter. Due to the lack of transport link, many people avoid this station. An irregular steamer service from Garden Reach is also present.
There is a plan to transfer part of the Howrah Station bus terminus to the front of the station, mainly for Kolkata bound routes, but nothing materialised.

Physalia utriculus

Physalia utriculus, also called Blue Bottle or (Indo-Pacific) Portuguese Man-of-War, is a marine hydrozoan of the order Siphonophora found in the Indian and Pacific oceans. A gas filled bladder allows it to float on the surface, propelled by currents, tides, and by a sail at the top of the bladder, which may be left or right-handed. A single long tentacle of venomous cnidocytes, hanging below the float, provides the animal with a means of capturing prey.
"P. utriculus" is distinguished from the Atlantic Portuguese Man o' War ("Physalia physalis") by the smaller size of the float (six inches compared to twelve) and by having a single long fishing tentacle. Like its larger relative, "P. utriculus" often occurs in swarms.
Occurrence.
"P. utriculus" is less widely distributed than the larger "P. physalis", but it is the most common species on Australian coasts. It is also found in Hawaiian waters, where it is informally named "‘ili mane‘o or palalia".
Hazards.
Individuals of "P. utriculus" sometimes become stranded on beaches, where their toxic nematocysts can remain potent for weeks or months in moist conditions. "P. utriculus" is responsible for most of the reported injuries on Australian beaches, where up to 30,000 stings are reported. Most of the incidents are on the eastern coast, with only 500 or so in western and southern waters. Unlike "P. physalis", no fatalities have been recorded for "P. utriculus" stings.
Biology.
Each individual is actually a colony of four specialized polyps and medusoids.

Awlam

Awlam () was a Palestinian village south of Tiberias situated on the slopes of the westward Wadi Awlam.
History.
Awlam is identified as Oulamma, an important town that existed during the Roman era of rule in Palestine. The Crusaders referred to it as Heulem, and it conceded its tithes to the church of Mount Tabor.
Awlam was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and by 1596 it was a village of 83 inhabitants under the administration of the "nahiya" ("subdistrict") of Tiberias, part of the "sanjak" of Safad. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, goats, and beehives. In the late 19th century, it was described as an agricultural village of 120, built of adobe bricks. The Ottomans built an elementary school in this time period.
The 'Arab al-Muwaylhat Bedouin tribe settled in the village by the time Awlam was a part of the British Mandate of Palestine. The village had a mosque, but its school was closed down. The residents, who numbered 555 in 1931 and 720 in 1945, grew and cultivated grain, figs, grapes, and pomegranates. They drew their drinking and domestic water from six springs.
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Awlam's villagers were ordered to leave on April 6, 1948, by the Arab Higher Committee who feared they might aid "Zionist forces". But the Haganah states that its Golani Brigade entered the village on May 12, and the inhabitants fled upon their arrival. Awlam became the final village in the eastern Lower Galilee emptied of its Arab inhabitants. According to Walid Khalidi, "nothing remains of the village buildings except stone rubble; only a spring that was used by the villagers has been left unchanged".

Dennis Volunteer Fire Company

The Dennis Volunteer Fire Company (DVFC) provides fire services for the Dennisville section of Dennis Township in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. A volunteer fire company, the department relies on the men and women of the surrounding area for staffing. The company is responsible for the area within Dennis Township Fire District #2. 
History.
The company was founded after a fire in the town of Dennisville claimed the lives of three children trapped in a house. At that time, the area received fire coverage from neighboring towns such as Ocean View and Woodbine. After the tragic fire, the townspeople decided that it was time to form their own fire company. Through fund raising, the company began and the build was built.
After years of operating in a small station, the construction of the current building was completed in 1999.
Type of calls.
Most of the calls Dennis Volunteer Fire Company receives are that of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), as one of New Jersey's most frequently traveled roads, Route 47, runs directly through the district. Being the main route of vacationers heading to the shore from mid-May to late-September, the area is prone to several accidents per-week. 
MVAs aren't the only calls that the company handles, however. Structure fires, brush fires, activated fire alarms, landing zone assignments, and even an occasion water rescue are all incidents handled by DVFC each year. In recent years, the department has also responded to three airplane crashes - June 20, 2008 (Broad St., Belleplain); June 25, 2009 (Frederickstadt Ave., Woodbine) and November 14, 2009 (Petersburg Rd., Dennisville). In addition to their own calls, DVFC often provides mutual aid assistance to fire companies in nearby communities, such as Woodbine, Ocean View, Belleplain, and Goshen.
In 2012, DVFC was located at the center of the landfall point of Hurricane Sandy and responded to 5 calls for action in a period of three hours following the landfall, including downed trees on Academy Road and Route 47, arcing wires on Hagan Road, a tree onto a house on Lake View Drive, and a mutual aid request by Maurice River Township, Cumberland County for Marine 18 on Moore's Beach Road. The department's EMTs also provided backup emergency medical coverage for the township with an ambulance stationed at the firehouse by Belleplain Emergency Corps. In the days following the hurricane, Tender 1843 spent approximately 16 hours at Ship Bottom Volunteer Fire Company on Long Beach Island in Ocean County to assist in recovery efforts.

Mike Hedlund

Michael David Hedlund (born August 11, 1946) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for six seasons. He played for the Cleveland Indians in 1965 and 1968 and the Kansas City Royals from 1969 to 1972.
Cleveland Indians.
Hedlund was born in Dallas, Texas, and signed as an amateur free agent with the Cleveland Indians upon graduation from Arlington High School in . He was just eighteen years old when he made his major league debut on May 8, against the Boston Red Sox. He appeared in just six games, and pitched a total of 5.1 innings before returning to the minors.
He returned to the majors in as a September call up, and appeared in three games. After the season, he was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft.
Kansas City Royals.
Hedlund went 3–6 with a 3.24 earned run average during the Royals' inaugural season. Used as both a starter and relief pitcher, he was far more effective out of the bullpen, posting a 1.69 ERA and earning two saves. His finest start came on September 18 when he held the Oakland Athletics to just one run, and struck out eight to earn the complete game victory.
After the season, Hedlund pitched for Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. He set a league record by not allowing an earned run for the first 53 innings he pitched, and finishing with a 0.75 ERA. While in Venezuela, Hedlund would contract the Hong Kong flu and bronchitis, causing him to lose thirty pounds. But he recovered and served as a reinforcement for the Navegantes del Magallanes, eventual champions of the 1970 Caribbean Series.
Hedlund began the in the majors, but was ineffective, and was reassigned to the triple A Omaha Royals. In , the Royals boasted one of the most talented young starting rotations in the majors with Hedlund, Dick Drago and Paul Splittorff all under 27 years old. After narrowly avoiding one hundred losses in 1970, the Royals improved to 85–76, in 1971 to finish second in the American League West. For his part, Hedlund rebounded to go 15–8 in with the leagues fourth best ERA, 2.71. After the season, Hedlund traveled to Vietnam with a group of Major League ballplayers on a tour of hospitals and military bases.
Hedlund started in the Royals' rotation, but after starting the season 0–5, was moved into the bullpen. He improved considerably at that point; winning his next four starts when used by manager Bob Lemon as a spot starter. At the 1972 Winter meetings he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians for utility infielder Kurt Bevacqua.
Minor leagues.
The Indians intended to use Hedlund as a long reliever and spot starter, but he failed to make the club out of Spring training. He spent the entire season with the triple A Oklahoma City 89ers, going 7–8 with a 4.44 ERA. The following Spring, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox for minor league outfielder Ken Hottman. Despite a respectable 2.90 ERA, Hedlund was 5–8 in for the Iowa Oaks. He was traded again after the season, this time to the Cincinnati Reds for Ozzie Osborn, but never played a game with them at any level.

Tahdig

Tahdig () is a speciality of Persian cuisine and Mesopotamian cuisine consisting of crisp rice taken from the bottom of the pot in which the rice is cooked. The name comes from a Persian word meaning "bottom of the pot". It is traditionally served to guests at a meal.
Ingredients commonly added to tahdig include yogurt and saffron, bread, potato and tomato.
Variations on 'Tahdig' include placing thin vegetable slices at the bottom of the pot, so they crisp up instead of the rice. Common vegetables include potato and carrots. Iranians also apply this 'crisping' method to spaghetti as well, providing a crisp spaghetti base.
Iraqi rice cooking is similar to the method used for Persian "chelow", a multistepped process intended to produce just-tender, fluffy grains of rice. A prominent aspect of Iraqi rice cooking is the "hkaka", a crisp bottom crust. It differs slightly from the Persian "tahdig", which is a single thick piece; the "hkaka" contains some loose rice as well. Before serving, the "hkaka" is broken into pieces so that everyone is provided with some along with the fluffy rice.

SiS 6326

The SiS 6326 was a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufactured by Silicon Integrated Systems. It was introduced in June 1997 and became available to the consumer market in the end of that year. Although it had a low performance compared to the GPUs of its age, eventually it became very successful, specially integrated in many motherboards designed to the corporate market, where the low cost is decisive and the 3D performance is not a priority. SiS shipped over seven million units of the SiS 6326 in 1998.
Architecture.
The SiS was available in discrete, with an AGP 2x or PCI bus, and integrated graphics. It had a 64-bit 2D/3D graphics accelerator, a DVD decoder, a TV coder as well as the AGP interface. It was available in 4 MB or 8 MB of memory.
Performance.
Since this chip aims cost over performance, it does not have a good performance, even compared to contemporary products. According to a test of Tom's Hardware of January 21, 1998, it could perform roughly a third of the performance of a NVidia RIVA 128 or 40% less than an ATI Rage Pro in terms of frames per second in Direct3D benchmarks and simply couldn't play Quake 2 due its lack of OpenGL support. Yet, the same article says that even the "slow and unknown graphic chip" could still produce a "quite nice image quality".
A beta driver codenamed Java was released as late as 1999, being the only version with an OpenGL ICD included, which finally allowed it to run some OpenGL applications such as GLquake, "Quake 2" and GLexcess. it still crashes in "Quake 3" though, due to its incomplete 3D features.
The SiS6326 was even capable of running relatively newer 3D applications such as 3DMark2001/2001, with no significant image flaws to be found despite its abysmal speed.
Linux support.
There is little support to Linux except the drivers developed independently by Thomas Winischhofer. Since the driver does not support OpenGL, not even the Windows one provided by SiS, this driver is only for 2D acceleration. There is also an experimental FrameBuffer driver developed by Sergio Costas, currently unsupported, available only for 2.4 kernels and without any kind of hardware acceleration. This driver was not ported to 2.6 because the native VesaFB driver available offered the same capabilities.
Variants and Immediate Successors.
In 1998, DVD/Macro-Vision and then AGP variants of the SiS6326 were released. Later that year, northbridge chipsets with integrated GPUs were released: SiS530 for Socket 7, and SiS620 for socket 370.[http://web.archive.org/web/20060107141513/http://www.sis.com/aboutsis/aboutsis_index02.htm It was in April of 1999 that the SiS6326 became officially obsolete by the SiS 300.
Overclock.
The card is overclockable using the software PowerStrip, but with most cards, even 5 MHz overclocking will cause serious pixel failures on windows desktop.

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (eHAE) is a rare tumor, first characterized by Sharon Weiss and Franz Enzinger that both clinically and histologically is intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma. Some now refer to it as low grade epithelioid angiosarcoma. It typically occurs in the 20 - 40 age range with no sex predilection, although the overall age range involved is much broader. It has an indolent course, some have survived for decades with multi-organ disease. Before their description the tumor had been reported under a variety of other names, including histiocytoid hemangioendothelioma, intravascular bronchoalveolar tumor (in the lung), and sclerosing cholangiocarcinoma (in the liver). In the lung and liver, common sites of metastatic tumor, it was most likely to be confused with carcinoma (tumor with epithelial differentiation), a far more common type of tumor. 
It is a vascular cancer in the lining (intima) of blood vessels, originally described most commonly in the veins of the extremities (arms and legs) and two organs, the liver and lungs. It has since been described in organs throughout the body. In addition to liver and lungs, bones and skin have been the most frequent organs. 
Genetics.
The cytogenetics of eHAE are not well characterized, as yet: t(1;3)(p36.3;q25) and a small supernumerary marker chromosome involving 22qll have been described in some patients. 
Epidemiology.
It is so rare that only 0.01 percent of the cancer population has it and it affects about 1 person in every 1,000,000 worldwide. Around 20 cases are diagnosed in America every year - the cause is unknown. It is unresponsive to any known strain of chemotherapy, making treatment very difficult. 
Prognosis.
Although Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma typically presents as a low grade tumour occasionally eHAE presents as high grade and more aggressive. eHAE presenting in the pleura, for example, is associated with a much more aggressive and hard to treat course. There is no standard chemotherapy treatment for eHAE at current but success with drugs such as Interferon, Paclitaxel, MAID, Thalidomide and Doxurubicin have been reported.
People with eHAE.
In 2003 photographer and actress Kris Carr was diagnosed with a stable and low grade version of eHAE. Karr has become a success as a 'Wellness Warrior' advocating a vegan lifestyle as a way to avoid and stabilize disease.

TGR M class

The Tasmanian Government Railways (TGR) M Class is a design of 4-6-2 steam locomotive built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns in 1952. Ten were built for use on light passenger and mixed trains on the mainline railways of Tasmania, and saw service from 1952 to 1975.
History.
After World War II, the TGR were adamant on reconstructing and modernising their ageing fleet of mainline locomotives. Seeking to supplement their current stock, and to displace a number of locomotives designed in the 1920s, the company ordered ten 4-6-2 light passenger/freight locomotives from Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns in 1951.
The locomotive was based upon a design known as the YB class; manufactured for the Indian Railways from 1927 and Burma Railways in 1947.
MA Class.
In 1957, four members of the class were reclassified as the MA class, after the original 4'7" driving wheels were replaced with surplus 4' 0" Australian Standard Garratt wheels.
These new driving wheels enabled better operation on steeply graded sections of track, and were particularly useful on the North East line, where the decrease in maximum speed was less of an issue.
Preservation.
Fortunately, all members of the class have been preserved to an extent, with four locomotives seeing further use on heritage trains. The example at the Tanfield Railway in England, remains in an derelict state, due to the railway not having an interest in maintaining the non-standard narrow gauge locomotive.

Para-SAR

The Esquadrão Aeroterrestre de Salvamento (EAS) (English: "Airborne Rescue Squadron"), known by its nickname Para-SAR, is a Brazilian Air Force airborne search and rescue squadron, based in the city of Rio de Janeiro. 
The unit has no aircraft of its own and its airborne personnel conduct operations by being dropped from other units' aircraft. The unit has seven SAR teams located in seven states.
Each Para-SAR detachment is made up of SAR qualified military parachutists. Members of this unit can be distinguished by their maroon berets and orange baseball caps.
History.
The Brazilian Air Force has a long history of parachute training. In 1943, at the former Alfonsos Field School of Aeronautics and with the support of the Air Force, cadet gymnastics instructor Achile Garcia Charles Astor first introduced civil parachute training in Brazil.
Seeing the usefulness of having a parachuting unit, the Electronics and Flight Protection Administration conducted studies to see how such a unit could be created under the auspices of the air force. The results of that study gave rise to the Para-SAR.
In 1946, the Brazilian Army formed its parachute school, the now-named General Penha Brazil Parachutist's Instruction Center. It graduated its first class of Brazilian Air Force students in 1959.
The group initially consisted of a division of three officers and five sergeants whose mandate was to provide instruction to the cadets of the School of Aeronautics and to provide search and rescue, by means of the DEPV. The unit also consisted of a group of volunteers who trained at the old military aviation school and went on to provide help in accidents and under special circumstances.
Eventually, on 2 September 1963, the Airborne Rescue unit was formed. Para-SAR is the traditional name given to the search and rescue arm of the air force and is housed in the old School of Aeronautics. 
By November 20th, 1973, the flotilla no longer existed, becoming the Airborne Rescue Squadron, or EAS. Its mandate was to continue training of the BAF parachutists, the instruction and the administration of the rescue teams and helicopter squadrons among other tasks.
Mission.
The Para-SAR mandate includes specialized instruction for crewmembers and rescue teams of the Brazilian Air Force, SAR and special operations.
Training.
New members of the squadron start with the Brazilian Army parachute course and then complete courses such as parachute packing and maintenance, aerial resupply, demolition, sniper and jungle warfare. They then move onto advanced training. The following training programs are offered by the squadron:
Search and rescue.
This course includes: aircraft access; firefighting; machines, engines and radio equipment; free diving; helilift operations; orientation and ground searches; sea and jungle survival; SAR combat tactics; mountaineering; search and rescue theory and first aid.
Scuba diving.
Graduates become qualified in scuba diving which is typically used to recover charges and pieces of submerged aircraft.
Airborne techniques.
Graduates are qualified to parachute out of a military aircraft as well as air drop supplies, precision landing, calculate the effects of wind and carry out the pathfinder role. They also learn packing, inspecting and repairing parachutes. Also taught are techniques for aircraft operations using the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and C-95.
Skydiving.
The course teaches parachutists operational skydiving, the use of instruments and equipment; skydiving from both low and high altitudes and jumping with weapons and equipment for military operations.
Master skydiver.
Graduates of this course become qualified in all aspects of skydiving, from organizing the jump team to coordinating the aircraft to be used. Students are also given a knowledge of meteorology and reading weather reports as well as precision targeting, advanced navigation skills and techniques of free fall Basic Body Fly.
Commando.
The Brazilian Air Force commando course teaches combat search and rescue, including locating downed crews in a hostile environment, survival, evasion, resistance and escape. The course also covers counter-terrorism, reconnaissance and sabotage subjects.

Robert Pleasants

Robert Pleasants (1723–1801) was an American educator and abolitionist. He was born in Henrico County, Virginia and became a plantation owner and operator of Robert Pleasants & Co., a consignment tobacco exporting company. His father, John Pleasants, also a Quaker and member of the Curles Neck Meeting, wrote a will asking his heirs to free over 500 slaves when they reached 30 years of age. Contacts with the anti-slavery advocate Anthony Benezet and what became the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1774, spurred their commitment to the abolitionist movement.
However, testamentary manumission provisions were illegal in Virginia when John Pleasants died in 1771. Robert Pleasants lobbied Virginia legislators to allow manumissions, and when such became legal in 1782, freed his slaves, then hired them as paid laborers and provided for their education. Robert Pleasants also initiated Pleasants v Pleasants as executor of his father's will and on behalf of the slaves that his siblings failed to free despite the will's provision. Pleasants also gave about 78 former slaves over 350 acres of land, and by 1801 founded the Gravelly Hill School, the first educational institution for free blacks in Virginia. The Civil War Battle of Glendale was fought on the property, part of which was eventually rebuilt as the Gravel Hill Baptist Church.
Robert Pleasants was also one of the founders of the short-lived Virginia Abolition Society, and served as its president in 1790. The society disbanded after Virginia passed a law in 1798 forbidding abolitionists from sitting on juries in freedom suit cases.
Meanwhile, Pleasants submitted numerous petitions to the Virginia state government and the U.S. Congress calling for the end of the slave trade. The most famous, from 1791, is now at the Library of Virginia. Many of Pleasants' letters to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry regarding the legality and morality of slavery still survive. The Swem Library at the College of William and Mary holds many of his papers. Some of the founders replied to Pleasants, affirming their own distaste for the "peculiar institution."

South Asian Gate (南亚之门) will be Kunming City's tallest skyscraper at 83-storeys, with a height of 333m. It will be situated in the Tuodong Lu Central Business District and will be the largest building in the Yunnan province.
The first design had 288 metres and 72 storeys. The Department of Construction did not approve it, because Yunnan is a seismically active region and the design would not be safe in a strong earthquake. It was revised to 316 metres, 81 storeys. Again it was turned down. It was approved the third time at 333 metres and 83 storeys. The approved design has two separate towers, equal in height. The space between the towers looks like a Yunnan-style pagoda.
It is scheduled to be completed 2012 or 2013 and will be home to a five-star hotel, serviced apartments, grade-A office space, residential apartments, a commercial area, and leisure and entertainment facilities. The South Asian Gate will occupy 34,500 square metres with a total construction area of 550,000 square metres.
The project is a joint venture between Jiangsu World Group (江苏天地集团) and Yunnan Zhongju Group (云南中炬集团). In addition to being a local landmark and the dominant feature in Kunming's skyline, the building is expected to serve as a hub for business between China and South and Southeast Asia.
As a milestone project in Kunming, South Asian Gate takes more attention of the Municipal Party Committee and Government, according to sources. On November 3, the developer of the South Asian Gate brought six conceptual blueprints from well-known foreign and domestic architectural agencies to a Kunming Urban Planning and Major Programs Briefing Meeting. On December 2, the project was announced by the Kunming Planning Bureau.

Salty Dog Surf Shops

Salty Dog Surf Shops is a chain of stores situated in Daytona Beach, Florida (with the exception of the Panama City Beach, Florida Location) specializing in surfboards, beach wear, and accessories. All the locations tend to focus on a certain type of product, for example one location could specialize in Surfboards, Skateboards, and other types of boards while another location will focus more towards Clothing, Housewares, and other souvenirs.
History.
Bruce Miller first opened Salty Dog out of the trunk of his car selling t-shirts in November 1979. The first store to be opened was the International Speedway Blvd. location, in 1984 the other stores were built. The high point of sales for the franchise was in the mid 80's early 90's due to the MTV Spring Break crowd. Most of the business today comes from previous generations.
Locations.
There are five Salty Dog locations four of which are in Daytona Beach:

Internal fan-cooled electric motor

An internal fan-cooled electric motor (colloquially, "fan-cooled motor") is a self cooling electric motor. Fan cooled motors feature an axial fan attached to the rotor of the motor (usually on the opposite end as the output shaft) that spins with the motor, providing increased airflow to the motor's internal and external parts which aids in cooling.
Uses.
Fan cooled motors have many common uses in motors that either produce a lot of heat or have poor airflow because they are always stationary or in an enclosed space and require a compact cooling system. They are common for industrial uses, household appliances such as blenders and mixers, power tools such as drills and rotary tools, and radio-controlled cars
Advantages.
Attaching an internal fan to a motor is a fairly simple way to cool it. Since a fan cooled motor always provides airflow over itself regardless of whether it is stationary or partially enclosed, it is more effective than using a heat sink in applications with poor airflow because heat sinks usually require air to be flowing over them for maximum effectiveness. Internal fan cooling also takes up far less space than external fan cooling or water cooling.
Disadvantages.
All fans generate noise, something that may not be desired in a motor, and drag on their power source. Also, like any device with a fan, increased airflow through the motor can cause increased dust build up, which could potentially hinder the motor's operation.

Edward Hicks Hohnhorst (January 31, 1885 – March 28, 1916) was a Major League Baseball first baseman who played for two seasons. He played in 18 games for the Cleveland Naps during the 1910 Cleveland Naps season and 15 games during the 1912 Cleveland Naps season.
Death.
Hohnhorst became a police officer in Covington, Kentucky. In 1915 he shot a suspect during an arrest. Although he was found to be blameless for the death, Hohnhorst became guilt-ridden, which lead to alcoholism, lack of sleep and stomach pains. Hohnhorst committed suicide with his service revolver, with the death certificate citing "temporaty insanity" as the reason for his death.

List of concertos for English horn

A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra.
English-horn concertos appeared about a century later than oboe solo pieces, mostly because until halfway through the 18th century different instruments (the taille de hautbois, vox humana and the oboe da caccia) had the role of the tenor or alto instrument in the oboe family. The modern English horn was developed from the oboe da caccia in the 1720s, probably in Silesia. The earliest known English-horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann Michael Malzat) and Joseph Lacher. Few of these works have survived. Among the oldest extant English-horn concertos are those by Josef Fiala (a period transcription of a piece originally for viola da gamba) and Anton Milling. It is known that Milling's concerti were performed in 1782 by the Italian oboist Giovanni Palestrina at a concert in Hamburg.
Many solos in orchestral works were written for the English horn and a decent amount of chamber music appeared for it as well. However, few solo works with a large ensemble were written for the instrument until well into the 20th century. Since then the repertoire has expanded considerably. Of the 270+ concertos listed below, only 35 predate the Second World War.

National Security Coordination Secretariat

The National Security Coordination Secretariat is a construct of the Singapore Government set up in 1999 within the Ministry of Defence. It was tasked to strengthen coordination amongst Singapore's existing security agencies (The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force, Internal Security Department).
History.
In 1999, the National Security Secretariat (NSS) was set up to forge and strengthen inter-agency links through the strategic convergence of these organisations and other relevant government ministries, directing efforts against the emerging threats of non-conventional warfare and transnational terrorism.
With the advent of the terrorist incidents taking place in the United States of America on Sept 11, 2001, the NSS was responsible for implementing several ad hoc coordinating arrangements to protect Singapore from subsequent attacks. 
These ad hoc coordinating arrangements were known to relate to areas in terms of aviation, land transport and maritime security. It is possible that through the work of the NSS, the Singapore Armed Forces began researching into rearranging itself into a task based force structure, with a dedicated focus in a new operational area of homeland defence. SAF soldiers following Sept 11, 2001 began to be deployed to Key Installation sites, known as KINS, in support of the Ministry of Home Affairs. These areas cover Changi International Airport, Sembawang Wharves, and the oil refineries situated on Jurong Island.
The SAF and Singapore Civil Defence Force also began parallel efforts to develop measures to counter chemical and biological warfare. With the SAF, a battalion equivalent of forces commenced development of the CBRE group - Chemical Biological Radiological and Explosives ordnance group, which was rightfully an expansion of its chemical warfare capability. The SCDF strengthened the development of its HAZMAT (Hazardous Material) forces. 
Ad Hoc arrangements gradually became regarded as insufficient to meet the new security landscape, and the NSS recognised that there was a crucial need for not merely the security agencies, but rather all ministries to work together to develop a whole-of-government approach towards handling modern day security threats.
From 2003 onwards, it was decided that formulating relevant security policy and implementing integrated and coordinated approaches would be best done through a small coordination unit that was managed at the Prime minister's level - As such the NSS would be headed at the Prime Minister's Office. 
On 20 July 2004, in Parliament, then Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan laid out the case for a new Strategic Framework for national security in Parliament. This framework sought to address the issues and close the gaps identified, and put in place the machinery to enable the government to systematically deal with the security issues confronting Singapore. Included within the framework was the plan to re-describe the NSS as the National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) - which was established under the Prime Minister's Office and tasked with national security planning and the coordination of policy and intelligence issues. The NSS was renamed the National Security Coordination Centre (NSCC) and together with the Joint Counter Terrorism Centre (JCTC) formed up the NSCS.

Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad

"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad" is a young-adult novel written by L. Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. It was the second volume in the ten-novel series "Aunt Jane's Nieces", which was, after the Oz books, the second greatest success of Baum's literary career. Like the other books in the series, the novel appeared under the pen name "Edith Van Dyne," one of Baum's multiple pseudonyms.
Date.
Though the original edition of "Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad" bore the publication date "1906" (the same year as its predecessor book, "Aunt Jane's Nieces"), the book was actually published "late in 1907." (Baum's adult novel "The Last Egyptian", issued in the same period, bears a copyright date of 1907 and a publication date of 1908.)
Background.
In writing the book, Baum faced the task of creating an effective sequel to a successful novel. He enriched his story with abundant real-world observation and local color. Baum and his wife had taken an extensive tour of Egypt and the Mediterranean region in the first six months of 1906; and Baum exploited the experiences of that trip for his book. The Baums had witnessed the eruption of Vesuvius on 7 April 1906; Baum used the eruption as a central event in his novel. The characters in "Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad" follow some of the Baums' Italian itinerary closely, even staying at the same hotels as the Baums had done.
Synopsis.
The second book in the "Aunt Jane's" series picks up where the first left off. The eccentric and down-to-earth millionaire John Merrick decides to take his three beloved nieces — Patsy Doyle, Elizabeth de Graf, and Louise Merrick — on a tour of Europe. The parents of the three girls react variously, but don't oppose the trip; Mrs. Merrick, Louise's mother, wants to accompany them as chaperone, a prospect that Uncle John rejects out of hand. Still, Mrs. Merrick allows her daughter to go; she wants to separate Louise from Arthur Weldon, the young man who has been courting her. (The social-climbing Mrs. Merrick is desperate for Louise to land a rich husband. Weldon's father is a wealthy railroad magnate, but the father and son are in a clash of generations and the elder Weldon threatens to disown the younger).
Uncle John and the three cousins embark for Europe, and make new acquaintances aboard ship. Among them is a somewhat sinister and mysterious man called Victor Valdi, who combines "refinement and barbarity" in his manner. Patsy goes out of her way to draw him out of his sullen silence, to "make him talk and 'be sociable'." The tourists reach Italy, where they witness an eruption by Vesuvius and cope with the public's fears and a layer of ash in the streets of Naples. They consider a detour, but decide to carry on intrepidly. They encounter a local aristocrat, the Count of Ferralti, who fancies Louise — though the clever Uncle John quickly realizes that he is only a pretend nobleman. John warns Louise of the young man's pretense, but otherwise allows the acquaintance, especially when Ferralti proves a courageous help in a near-disaster on the road.
At Taormina, the travelers meet Victor Valdi again; he appears more sinister and mysterious than ever in his native element, where he is called "Il Duca." There is much talk of the danger of "brigands" in Sicily — though the local people cheerfully insist that "There are no brigands" in Sicily, an ironic refrain that winds through the book. Quickly enough, both Uncle John and Ferralti are waylaid by Valdi, who is the chief local brigand, and makes a living for his family and followers by kidnapping tourists and holding them for ransom. Uncle John learns the ways of Valdi's curious establishment, which includes his ruthless mother and his daughter Tato, who masquerades as a boy to serve as her father's henchman.
After initial resistance, Uncle John reconciles himself to paying the ransom for his life and freedom; but his nieces and friends are unwilling to yield to bandits, and stage a bold and effective rescue of Uncle John and Ferralti. It is revealed that the false Count Ferralti is actually Arthur Weldon; he has come to Europe in disguise to be with Louise. Uncle John lets the two young people continue to see each other, as long as there is no talk of marriage yet. (News has arrived that Weldon's father has died in a railway accident, and that Arthur is now a wealthy heir.)
The Americans are surprised a few days later, when Valdi and Tato appear at their hotel. While Tato was acting as the go-between in the ransom plot, the girl and Patsy had become something like friends; with typical generosity of spirit, Patsy does not blame the girl for the actions of her family. Now, Valdi asks the Americans to take Tato under their charge for a time; Valdi is trying to leave brigandage behind and take up an honest life. The cousins naively accept Tato, and enjoy dressing her in a new wardrobe and teaching her manners. They are surprised again when Tato absconds with the ransom cash ($50,000 of Uncle John's money and $30,000 of Weldon's); the girl leaves a cheerful but mocking letter behind her, explaining the ruse.
Having learned their lesson, the travelers complete their tour through Italy, Switzerland, and France, and gratefully return home.
Americans and guns.
Throughout the book, the characters place great stress on their special nationality. This is most noticeable in their confrontation with Valdi and his kidnap plot. Beth puts it most blatantly when she cries, "It's a beastly shame that free born Americans should be enslaved by a crew of thieving Sicilians, and obliged to purchase their freedom!" — but the other characters are nearly as vocal. (The word "American," singular or plural, occurs 58 times in Baum's text.) Valdi is a supremely successful brigand, until he encounters the Americans' pride, courage, and resourcefulness; conversely, the Americans' frank and generous kindness leaves them open to victimization. 
The patriotic self-satisfaction turns ugly only once, when Patsy "gleefully" tells her Uncle John after his rescue, "Did you think your nieces would let you be robbed by a bunch of dagoes?" (Perhaps momentary high spirits can excuse the normally better-behaved girl).
The Americans are so formidable in part because they are so heavily armed. Beth carries her "pet revolver" and Uncle John has two in his trunks; "cousin" Kenneth Forbes and American friend Silas Watson carry guns when in Sicily. As the cousins prepare to rescue Uncle John and Ferralti/Weldon, Patsy sticks a "pop-gun" in "the bosom of her dress..." When Kenneth asks her if she can shoot, she replies, "No, but I suppose the pistol can. I know enough to pull the trigger."
Characters.
To make his sequel effective, Baum needed to develop and deepen his continuing characters. In the first book, Louise was willing to follow her mother's lead in searching for a rich husband; but in the second she favors Arthur Weldon even when he runs a risk of disinheritance, suggesting a greater sincerity, sensitivity, and independence. Beth is the most formidable of the cousins; she carries a revolver and is a crack shot. Yet in the climactic confrontation with Valdi, she faints when the bullet she fires hits Valdi's finger and draws blood; afterward she swears she will never fire a weapon again. This display of a softer side tends to balance out her personality. Even Kenneth Forbes, the cousin who actually inherited Aunt Jane's estate in the first book, reveals unexpected depths of pluck and spirit.

Reid River Airfield is a World War II airfield located to the south of the Reid River near Townsville, Queensland, Australia.
Disused since the war as an airfield, the former base is private property used for mustering cattle and horses. An arch marks the western edge of the strip, easily accessible from the main road. With permission of the owner, visitors can tour the strip. On the eastern edge of the strip are concrete pads from former buildings including the mess hall and first air station. Also, there are the remains of a B-26 crash site and a former 2nd BS camp area. Small markers, left by veterans in 1992 mark these locations.
History.
The airfield, which had a single main runway running east to west, was built by the United States Army Air Forces.
Two units were based at the airfield:
Both squadrons initially flew B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The first mission by the 408th BS was on 22 April 1942 from Reid River, operating until January 1943 when the group went on R&R. In early February 1943, both the 2nd and 408th Squadrons converted from B-26 to B-25 Mitchell bombers when it was decided to send the B-26s to the Mediterranean Theatre.

George Ojemann

George Ojemann is a professor emeritus of neurologic surgery in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His research focuses on the neurobiology of human cognition, particularly cortical organization for language and memory, which he investigates in the context of awake neurosurgery under local anesthesia. In order to study these aspects of cognition, Ojemann utilizes techniques ranging from electrical stimulation mapping to recording of activity of single neurons, which have resulted in methods for reducing the risk of cortical resections for epilepsy and tumors. 
Early life.
Ojemann received a B.A. in 1956 from the University of Iowa, having served in the Air Force wing of the ROTC and being elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was awarded the University's Brigg's award on graduation for having the highest cumulative GPA for the four undergraduate years. 
Medical career.
He received a M.D. in 1959, from the University of Iowa as well. During that time, he had developed an interest in neurology, under the guidance of Dr. Adolph Sahs, best known for his work in the natural history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from aneurysms. During his medical school years, he had completed a rotation in neurosurgery as Massachusetts General Hospital. He received the MacEwen prize for top academic performance throughout medical school and was elected AOA president his junior year. He then completed training in the field of neurosurgery at King County Hospital (now Harborview Medical Center) in Seattle and the University of Washington, followed by further specialty training in surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health. He served as a military surgeon for the United States Public Health Service from 1964-66. He returned to Seattle in 1966, and has been affiliated with the neurosurgical faculty at UW since that time. He was board certified in 1967 by the American Board of Neurological Surgery.
Ojemann served as director of the Washington Epilepsy Center at Harborview from 1986–1996, serves as a consultant for the Veteran’s Administration Hospital, and is on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals in the fields of neurosurgery and neurology.
Research.
He has authored or co-authored over 300 articles in the neurologic and neurosurgical literature.
Publications.
He is the co-author of two books with William H. Calvin, Ph.D.: "Inside the Brain" was published in September 1980, and "Conversations with Neil's Brain: the Neural Nature of Thought and Language" in April 1995. He has co-authored "Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Brain Function" 1987 and "Epilepsy Surgery" 1993.

Alcanzar una estrella II (album)

Alcanzar una estrella II (Album) is the second soundtrack album from the telenovela Alcanzar una estrella II, released by Discos Melody. It was released as the telenovela was coming to an end in June 1991.
The telenovela's fictional pop band Muñecos de Papel was formed by Sasha, Ricky Martin, Bibi Gaytan, Pedro Fernandez, Erick Rubin and Angelica Rivera.
This album includes the voices of Bibi Gaytan and Erick Rubin - both Bibi and Erick had been omitted from the "Muñecos de Papel" album, released months earlier by Sony. It is, however, unclear whether Sasha, Pedro Fernandez and Angelica Rivera contributed backing vocals to the only group song in "Alcanzar una estrella II", "No quiero dejar de brillar" - Bibi Gaytan, Erick Rubin and Ricky Martin all have solo verses but the other members do not, and the credits do not include this information.
"No quiero dejar de brillar" did not achieve the success of the group's previous single "Muñeco de Papel". The song is not attributed to the fictional band Muñecos de Papel, but instead it's credited to "Estrellas de Alcanzar una Estrella" (Stars from Alcanzar una Estrella) - which might indicate that it was not recorded by all six members of the group. Further evidence is the fact that there are no Muñecos de Papel photos in the artwork, and the back cover only features Gaytan and Rubin (then under contract with Melody), as well as other cast members who were not part of Muñecos de Papel but did contribute songs: Angelica Ruvalcaba, Marisa de Lille and Hector Suarez Gomis. There are no images of Sasha, Martin, Fernandez or Rivera.
The album was not as successful as Muñecos de Papel; still, Bibi Gaytan had her first solo hit with the single "Tan solo una mujer". No further singles were released.

Cornelis Melyn

Cornelis Melyn (1600 – c. 1662) was an early Dutch settler in New Netherland and Patroon of Staten Island. He was the chairman of the council of eight men, which was a part of early steps toward representative democracy in the Dutch colony.
Early life.
Cornelis Melyn was born in Antwerp, then a part of the Spanish Netherlands, where he was baptised at St. Walburga's church September 17, 1600, the son of Andries and Maria (Gheudinx-Botens) Melyn, and grandson of Lambrecht Melyn, of the same place. Both of Cornelis' parents died in 1606. Two guardians, Jacques Melyn and Hans Salomons, were appointed for him and he was taken into the family of his half-brother Abraham Melyn to be raised. When he was about twelve years of age, Cornelis was apprenticed as a tailor.
When Melyn was about 18 years old, the priest of St. Walburga's church issued him a baptismal certificate and a certificate of good conduct. It is possible he left Antwerp at this time for Amsterdam, where he married Janneken Adriaens in 1627. Their marriage certificate lists them both as residing in Amsterdam. By this time, Melyn had changed his occupation, being listed in this certificate as a "seemtouwer", a "dresser of the finer and softer leathers".
Migration to New Amsterdam.
Cornelis Melyn made at least one voyage to the New World before deciding to settle there, aboard the Dutch West India Company's ship "Het Wapen van Noorwegen" (The Arms of Norway) in 1638. After returning to the Netherlands, he applied for the Patroonship of Staten Island, which he was granted July 3, 1640. Soon afterwards, he sailed, possibly in the "Engel Gabriel" (Angel Gabriel), for New Netherland. But the vessel was captured by a Dunkirk raider August 13, 1640, and Melyn was forced to return to the Netherlands.
Melyn sailed once again to New Amsterdam May 17, 1641, aboard the vessel "Den Eyckenboom" (The Oak Tree) with a new party of colonists, including his wife and children. Also on board was Adriaen van der Donck who would one day be a political ally of Melyn and a fellow victim of Director-General Peter Stuyvesant's persecution. Soon after The Oak Tree's arrival in New Amsterdam, Cornelis Melyn and his party of 41 persons were at work establishing a new colony on Staten Island. June 19, 1642, Melyn received from Director-General Willem Kieft his patent to all of Staten Island except for a farm which had already been allocated to David Pietersen de Vries.
Leadership.
In November 1643, during the bloody conflict with the neighboring Lenape tribes which became known as Kieft's War, Melyn and his colonists were forced to abandon Staten Island. According to his own statement, "I was obliged to flee for the sake of saving my life, and to sojourn with wife and children at the Menatans till the year 1647."
In 1644, his plantation having been destroyed, Cornelis Melyn purchased three adjacent lots near the Dutch fort on lower Manhattan, along the East River near the intersection of the present Broad and Pearl Streets. He settled there with his family for the next three years. As the Dutch colony drifted into chaos and some colonists expressed outrage at what they considered Kieft's ineptitude, the Director-General sought to placate his critics by appointing a council of eight men, with Cornelis Melyn as chairman, to assist him in governing the colony. This body, which was supposed to represent the people of New Amsterdam, was one of the earliest steps toward representative democracy in that colony. The colonists' opposition to Kieft continued, however, and the council demanded his removal in a letter transmitted to the States-General of the Netherlands in October 1644.
Melyn is attributed with having written the "Vertoogh van Nieu Nederland' ('A Tale of New Netherland')", considered one of earliest descriptions of life in colony and condemnation of Dutch West Indies Company policies.
Conflict With Stuyvesant.
In 1647, when Peter Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam to replace Kieft as Director-General, Melyn and Jochem Pietersen Kuyter, acting in name of the citizens of New Amsterdam, brought charges against the outgoing governor, demanding an investigation of his conduct while in office. Recognizing the danger of such actions to his own administration, Stuyvesant refused to consider Melyn and Kuyter's demands and caused them to be tried for lèse-majesté. The case was quickly decided against the defendants, who were sentenced to banishment from the colony.
August 16, 1647, Kuyter and Melyn sailed aboard the "Princess Amelia" to appeal their convictions to the States-General. Their vessel ran aground off the coast of Wales, but both survived and were able to present their cases in early 1648. The States-General acted favorably upon their appeal and issued a writ of mandamus dated April 28 ordering Director-General Stuyvesant to appear in person, or through his representative, to sustain his judgment against them.
Cornelis Melyn returned once again to New Amsterdam and caused the writ to be presented to Stuyvesant March 8, 1649, at a dramatic meeting in the New Amsterdam church. As Burton describes the confrontation:
Melyn returned to the Netherlands in August 1649. Stuyvesant's representative, Cornelis van Tienhoven, the Secretary of the Colony, also proceeded aboard a different vessel. The case was apparently never brought to a hearing.
Melyn returned in 1650 aboard the "Nieuw Nederlandsche Fortuyn" (New Netherland's Fortune) to resume his attempt to colonize Staten Island, along with a group of about 70 persons. His feud continued with Director-General Stuyvesant, who had him arrested and imprisoned without trial or hearing in 1655. During Melyn's imprisonment, there was another Indian uprising known as the Peach Tree War which destroyed the Staten Island colony. It was soon after this disaster that Cornelis Melyn and family left for the English New Haven Colony, where he took an oath of allegiance to the English crown April 7, 1657. In 1659, he agreed with the West India Company to relinquish his right of Patroonship of Staten Island.
Death.
There is no record of Cornelis Melyn's death, but his name ceases to appear in the records of the New Haven colony after 1663 and is not mentioned in the records of the marriages of his two daughters in New Haven August 25, 1664. Melyn's role in history is recognized in a mural in the Staten Island Borough Hall by Frederick Charles Stahr.

Holy Cross Priory, Dalby

Holy Cross Abbey is an important Augustinian monastery located in Skåne's old capital, Dalby, then Denmark, now southern Sweden.
History.
The Holy Cross Abbey of Dalby began its story as a Viking Age royal manor (Danish: gård). The buildings along with a granite chapel were donated for the establishment of a Benedictine monastery during the reign of King Sweyn II of Denmark, who gifted the old manor on which the abbey was to be built and two and a half other rented properties to fund its construction. The old manor buildings were converted into the ranges of the monastery. In 1066 Bishop Henrik of Lund died and Bishop Egino of Dalby Diocese took his place. Plans had been made to build a cathedral complex at Dalby, but the pope instead combined the dioceses of Dalby and Lund. In addition, Bishop Egino became the first Archbishop of Lund, after Pope Alexander II decided that Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia should from that time forward be an independent archdiocese of the Catholic Church. 
King Sweyn II's son, King Harald III of Denmark, was buried in the church at Dalby in 1080, indicating its important status at the end of the Viking Era.
A new expanded church was built of granite in the Romanesque style as a basilica dedicated to St Peter and given over to Augustinian canons. The building was further extended in the early 13th century with the addition of double towers, an extended west facade and two smaller towers flanked the new apse added onto the choir.
In the 14th century the abbey had become wealthy enough to rebuild itself, so the original Viking Age buildings were demolished and new larger brick buildings took their place. The church was nearly as large as Lund Cathedral when it was complete and was arranged in the typical plan for monasteries of the day. Three ranges were built adjacent to the church forming a four-sided enclosure to separate the canons from the world. At its height, Dalby owned 450 farms and other properties throughout Skåne.
Monks from Dalby founded the monastery at Tvilum on Jutland.
The abbey was sacked by the Swedish King Charles Knutsson in 1450 and never fully recovered its status. As a result the buildings were maintained, but not extended.
In the 1530s Denmark fought over the question of religion. Lutherans urged Danes to abandon their Catholic beliefs, customs, and institutions in favor of those of the Lutheran movement. Dalby lost its support and rapidly declined. In 1536 Denmark became a Lutheran kingdom. All religious houses and their properties reverted to the crown. Dalby was secularized and given to the nobleman, Anders Bille and then other owners. 
Dalby suffered during the wars between Sweden and Denmark. It became the property of the Swedish Crown in 1678 when Skåne became part of Sweden and in 1686 the eastern half of the church and towers were demolished. The buildings became so dilapidated by the 1740s that, while some parts were restored, other were demolished. In 1755 the entire eastern end of the church collapsed, destroying the famous marble altar. The partially ruined church was restored and a late Gothic brick tower added in 1758. The remaining range called "Boningshus" was repaired. It remains Sweden's oldest inhabited dwelling. In 1809 Dalby reverted to the Swedish Crown and it was restored again and modernized into the complex that can be seen today. Several additional buildings were constructed in the same style as the surviving buildings to replicate the feel of the ancient abbey.
The church is the oldest existing church building in Sweden, and the sandstone baptismal font in Dalby Church is believed to be one of the oldest in Scandinavia still in use.

Cui Sun

Cui Sun (崔損) (died November 27, 803), courtesy name Zhiwu (至無), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong.
Background.
It is not known when Cui Sun was born. His family was from the prominent Cui clan of Boling (博陵, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and had been prominent since Northern Wei. Cui Sun's ancestors traced their ancestry through a line of officials of Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, and Tang Dynasty, although, as far as Cui Sun's branch was concerned, after Cui Sun's great-grandfather Cui Xinggong (崔行功), who served as the director of the archival bureau (秘書省, "Mishu Sheng"), his grandfather and father were said to have little reputation, and their names were not even recorded in the "New Book of Tang"'s table of the chancellors' family trees.
Early career.
Toward the end of Emperor Daizong's "Dali" era (766-779), Cui Sun passed the imperial examinations and was made a scribe at the archival bureau. He later served as the sheriff of Xianyang County (咸陽, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), within the capital municipality of Jingzhao (京兆). However, later, because his maternal uncle Wang Hong (王翃) was the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality and thus could not properly serve as his superior, Cui was made a "Dali Pingshi" (大理評事), a judge at the supreme court (大理寺). He later became "Bingbu Langzhong" (兵部郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of defense (兵部, "Bingbu"). He later became "You Jianyi Daifu" (右諫議大夫), a high-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng") in 795.
As chancellor.
In 796, with the chancellor Zhao Jing having recently died and another chancellor, Lu Mai, seriously ill and unable to tend to affairs of state, Emperor Dezong made Cui Sun and Zhao Zongru chancellors with the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事) — in Cui's case, because he had been recommended by Emperor Dezong's close associate Pei Yanling, who had himself recently died as well. It was said that at the time, with two chancellors recently having died or been incapacitated, the people were hoping for virtuous chancellors, and with Cui not having had a good reputation, the people were disappointed. Further, it was said that after Cui became chancellor, he was not virtuous in his behavior, and was carefully avoiding to offend the emperor in any way, and therefore rarely spoke when Emperor Dezong met with the chancellors.
In 798, Cui was made "Menxia Shilang" (門下侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"), and continued to serve as chancellor. That year, the funereal palace (i.e., a palace intended to be built for the spirit of the deceased emperor) at Emperor Taizong's tomb Zhaoling (昭陵) was destroyed in a wildfire. Emperor Dezong commissioned Cui to head the project to rebuild not only that funereal palace, but also at Xianling (獻陵, Emperor Gaozu's tomb), Qianling (Emperor Gaozong's tomb), Dingling (定陵, Emperor Zhongzong's tomb), Tailing (泰陵, Emperor Xuanzong's tomb), Qiaoling (橋陵, Emperor Ruizong's tomb), and Yuanling (元陵, Emperor Daizong's tomb), as well as repairs to the funereal palace at Jianling (建陵, Emperor Suzong's tomb).
Late in Cui's service as chancellor, he was often ill and staying at home. It was said that while he went through many important posts at both the legislative and examination bureaus and served as chancellor, he served without distinction. He was also criticized for not expanding the tomb of his mother and not attending the funeral of his older sister (who had become a Buddhist nun). It was further said that Emperor Dezong knew that the popular sentiment was that Cui was not a suitable chancellor, but because Cui served him carefully, he continued to favor Cui. Cui died in 803 and was given posthumous honors.

Tully Lake is an important link in the Tully Trail.
Flood control.
As of 2007, the USACE reported that Tully Lake had prevented an estimated $26 million in flood damages. The dam's capacity is of water; it can contain 7.72 inches of rainfall runoff and has a downstream channel capacity of . The closest the lake has come to capacity was in 1987, when it rose to 62%.
Recreation.
Tully Lake is open to fishing, small boats, hiking, cross country skiing, mountain biking, picnicing, hunting (in season), and swimming. Motor vehicles are not allowed on the property. The USACE maintains a disc golf course, a mountain bike trail, and a picnic area. In conjunction with The Trustees of Reservations (TTOR), a non-profit conservation organization, the USACE manages a 35 site tent-only camping facility on Tully Lake.

Gameplay.
"SingStar" games require players to sing along with music in order to score points. Players interface with their console via "SingStar" USB microphones while a music video plays in the background. The pitch players are required to sing is displayed as horizontal grey bars, which function similar to a musical stave, with corresponding lyrics displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game analyses a player's pitch and compares it to the original track, with players scoring points based on how accurate their singing is. Different modes of "SingStar" may vary this basic pattern, but the principle is similar throughout.
"SingStar" includes a variety of game modes. The standard singing mode allows one or two people to sing simultaneously, either competitively or in a duet.
The PlayStation 3 version of the game supports trophies, however older versions of the game will need to go online to get the latest patch. Future SingStar games will include the trophy patched game on the Singstar disc.

SS Empire Almond

Empire Almond was a cargo ship that was built in 1941. She was renamed Marquita in 1946, Marsland in 1951, Huta Zgoda in 1960 and MP-Zozie-12 in 1969. She was scrapped in 1978.
History.
"Empire Almond" was built by Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Co Ltd, Hong Kong as yard number 297. She was launched on 23 July 1941 and completed in September 1941. "Empire Almond" was built for the Ministry of War Transport and initially operated under the management of the W Runciman & Co Ltd, London and later the Coolham Steamship Co Ltd. "Empire Almond" was initially homeported in Hong Kong but her homeport was changed to London in 1942.
War service.
"Empire Almond" was a member of a number of convoys during the Second World War.
Convoy OS 33 sailed from Liverpool for Freetown, Sierra Leone on 1 July 1942, arriving on 20 July. "Empire Almond" sailed from the Clyde with a destination of Takoradi, Ghana with a cargo of Government stores.
Convoy MKS 52 departed from Augusta on 13 June 1944. "Empire Almond" was bound for Malta for attention to defects.
Convoy KMS 67 left Liverpool on 24 October 1944 and arrived at Gibraltar on 2 November. "Empire Almond" was carrying a cargo of stores and general cargo, bound for Alexandria. At 1300 hrs on 26 October, "Empire Almond" was stopped with an engine fault. It took about 4 hours before she was able to resume her journey. She was escorted by the S and , rejoining the convoy at 2200 hrs.
Convoy MKS 72 left Lisbon on 23 December 1944. "Empire Almond" was carrying a cargo of steel.
Convoy KMS 85 left Liverpool on 17 February 1945 and reached Gibraltar on 24 February. "Empire Almond" sailed from Southend bound for Lisbon.
Post-war.
In 1946 "Empire Almond" was sold to Kaye, Son & Co, London and renamed "Marquita". "Marquita" visited Auckland, New Zealand on 3 May 1949. She was renamed "Marsland" in 1951. In 1960, "Marsland" was sold to the Polska Żegluga Morska, Szczecin and renamed "Huta Zgoda". In about 1967 "Huta Zgoda" was sold to Rejonowe Zaklady Zbozowe PZZ and converted into a grain storage hulk at Gdansk. In 1969, "Huta Zgoda" was sold to Zaklady Obrutu Zbozami Importawanymi i Eksportowymi PZZ and renamed "MP-Zozie-12". she served in this capacity until 1978. "MP-Zozie-12" was sold for scrap in 1978, arriving at Faslane under tow on 10 July.

Cistanthe pulchella

Cistanthe pulchella (formerly "Calyptridium pulchellum") is a rare species of flowering plant in the purslane family known by the common name Mariposa pussypaws. It is endemic to the Sierra Nevada foothills of central California, where it is known from only a few scattered occurrences. It grows on barren patches of granite gravel in woodland and grasslands. It is a federally listed threatened species.
Description.
It is a very small red-green annual plant radiating spreading stems a few centimeters long. There is a basal rosette of tiny, thick leaves. The inflorescence is a number of spherical clusters of rose-colored petals and thin sepals. The fruit is a tiny translucent capsule containing one or two seeds.
Conservation.
In 2007, there were about 9 or 10 occurrences of the plant, with some occurrences made up of two or more small populations. The total population number varies year to year, generally because of the influence of local weather changes on the germination of seeds and the growth of seedlings. Past total population estimates varied from 1680 to nearly 3000 individuals. Some populations are located on private land and have not been surveyed in many years. Others are quite variable in size, increasing from 58 to 770 individuals, or decreasing from hundreds of plants to only 3.
A major threat to this species is habitat fragmentation; populations have been bisected by roads, dirtbike trails, and firebreaks. At least two populations are in the middle of residential subdivisions, or on the edges; these may be extirpated by now. Residential and commercial development continue to claim the habitat, as does the expansion of infrastructure to support the new development, including local services, utilities, and roads. Livestock are allowed to graze in some areas, but it is unknown if this affects the species. Since most of the populations are small, they are vulnerable to destruction from any one severe local event, such as drought or disease, and since the populations sometimes fall to very low numbers they are at risk for genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift.

67th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade

The 67th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade is a battlefield surveillance brigade (BfSB) of the Nebraska Army National Guard. It derives its lineage from the 67th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), previously a component of the 35th Infantry Division (Mechanized).
As the 67th Infantry Brigade, the brigade was initially formed in August 1917 in the Iowa and Nebraska Army National Guards, and was part of the 34th Division mobilized for World War I. It comprised the 133rd Infantry Regiment and the 134th Infantry Regiment. It was disbanded in February 1919, but formed again in 1921, still as part of the 34th Division. From 1921 to 1942 it was part of the Iowa Army National Guard seemingly comprised only of the 168th Infantry Regiment.
From 1964 to 1985 it was the 67th Infantry Brigade, and then the 67th Bde, 35th ID, from 1985 to 2002. State ARNG newspapers reporting the recreation of the BfSB in 2008 say that the infantry brigade was reformed in 1962, with its main elements being the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 134th Infantry Regiment. Other combat units that were part of the brigade from the 1960s eventually included the 1st Battalion, 168th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Battalion, 195th Armored Regiment (which joined in 1978), and Troop E, 167th Cavalry, which was constituted and assigned in 1964. 
Material reproduced by Globalsecurity.org from 2001-2002, seemingly originally drawn from state National Guard sources, said:
In 2003 it was converted to the 67th Area Support Group. On September 7, 2008, it appears to have been redesignated the 67th BfSB.

Cochran Gardens

Cochran Gardens was a public housing complex on the near north side of downtown St. Louis, Missouri. Constructed in 1952 and occupied until 2006, it was famous for its residents' innovative form of tenant-led management. In 1976, Cochran Gardens became one of the first U.S. housing projects to have tenant management.
Built by the same firm, Leinweber, Yamasaki & Hellmuth, as the infamous Pruitt–Igoe complex, Cochran Gardens was more successful than its ill-fated sister project. In 1969 it was as run down as Pruitt–Igoe; casual sniper firing at pedestrians earned it the nickname of "Little Nam". In the same year, twenty-year-old Bertha Gilkey led a nine-month rent strike in protest against living conditions at Cochran Gardens; in 1976 she finally won a property management contract from the city. Independent management improved Cochran Gardens and created small business jobs in the neighborhood. President George H. W. Bush visited the site in 1991, commending tenant management and Bertha Gilkey. However, in 1998 city authorities took over Cochran Gardens, citing tax mismanagement by the tenant association. The buildings rapidly deteriorated, by 1999 vacancy rate increased from under 10% to one-third.
Cochran Gardens, which survived into the 21st century, was demolished in 2008.

Fred Besana

Fred Besana (born March 9, 1954 at Roseville, California) is a former American football quarterback for the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League as well as the Buffalo Bills and the New York Giants of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round (115th overall) of the 1977 NFL Draft. He was active for two games in 1977 and two games in 1978, before being released by the New York Giants on August 13, 1979.
With Besana's NFL pro career effectively over, he returned to California, playing semi-pro ball for the Twin Cities Cougars of the California Football League from 1980-1982.
Invaders years.
The Oakland Invaders signed Besana on January 26, 1983. Besana would go on to win the starting job for the Invaders leading them to a 9-9 record and the Pacific Division title. The Invaders lost in the first round of the playoffs to the league's eventual champion, the Michigan Panthers, 37-21. Besana was the league's 2nd ranked QB spreading the ball around to 4 receivers who caught over 50 passes. Following the season, All-League tight end Raymond Chester retired and by the start of the 1984 season big play threat wide receiver Wyatt Henderson would also be off the team.
Without two of his top four receivers to stretch the defense, opposing defenses were able to smother the Invader offense. In spite of a strong defense, the team lost its first nine games --- scoring a total of 82 points. Without a running game and with few good receiving options, Besana struggled. In the second half of the season, halfback Eric Jordan emerged as an effective feature back. Besana, Jordan, and WR Gordon Banks combined to reignite the offense. The team won 7 of their last 9 games.
Following the 1984 season the Invaders merged with the Michigan Panthers and Besana was forced to the bench backing up Bobby Hebert on the eventual Western Conference Champions. The new team retained Jordan & Banks and added Michigan stars Albert Bentley, Anthony Carter, Derek Holloway, & John Williams. Besana did see the field a few times in 1985 with this team full of weapons and Besana put up the third best QB rating in the league.

Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit

The Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit, variously called Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit, Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit and commonly referred to by its acronym CAFGU (pronounced "kahf-goo") is an irregular auxiliary force of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Creation.
The CAFGU was created on July 25, 1987 when President Corazon C. Aquino signed Executive Order No. 264 entitled "Providing for the Citizen Armed Force". The creation of the unit was based on the "clear, consolidate, hold and develop" strategy adopted by then-Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos in dealing with insurgent-infiltrated villages.
CAFGU units are components of the AFP Ready Reserve detailed to Military Auxiliary Service. Article X, Sec. 61, sub-paragraph 2 of Republic Act 7077 describes this manner of service as follows:
Military auxiliary service entails services rendered in meeting local insurgency threat. Reservists serving under this category will be organized into Ready Reserve units. They must be issued and allowed to carry firearms: Provided, That these reservists will be utilized only for the defense of their respective localities and will not be employed outside their localities. Elected/appointed local government officials are expected to perform their duties and responsibilities in their respective peace and order council levels or similar organizations efficiently and effectively to enhance a total integrated system approach against threats to national security. The Secretary of National Defense shall prescribe the rules and regulations to implement this section in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government.
Organization.
CAFGU units are administered by, and under the operational control of, regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Philippine Army infantry battalions assigned to this function are also referred to as "Cadre Battalions". Deactivation of CAFGU units assigned to these battalions result in the return of their status as regular infantry battalions.
The CAFGU units are tasked to prevent the re-infiltration of insurgents into communities that have already been cleared of their influence by combat operations conducted by regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The CAFGU units are issued small arms; typically M1 Garand, M-14, or M-16 rifles, and receive a monthly stipend of Php 2,700.00 (about USD 57.00).
Criticism.
In 1993, the Philippine government considered deactivating the CAFGU units due to allegations of human rights abuses; 60 CAFGU units comprising 10,000 troops were disbanded. However, in 1996, the government halted its program to completely disband the CAFGU units. As of 2007, an estimated 60,000 CAFGU troopers are active in the country, taking part in military operations alongside regular soldiers of the AFP.
The Commission on Human Rights' records show that as of 2000, 853 human rights abuse cases have been filed against 1,070 CAFGU members.

<doc id="20852379" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20852379" title="Equivalents">
Equivalents

Equivalents is a series of photographs of clouds taken by Alfred Stieglitz from 1925 to 1934. They are generally recognized as the first photographs intended to free the subject matter from literal interpretation, and, as such, are some of the first completely abstract photographic works of art.
Description.
Stieglitz took at least 220 photographs that he called "Equivalent" or "Equivalents"; all feature clouds in the sky. The majority of them show only the sky without any horizon, buildings or other objects in the frame, but a small number do include hills or trees. One series from 1927 prominently features poplar trees in the foreground.
Almost all of the photographs are printed very darkly so the sky often appears black or nearly black. The contrast between the sky and the much lighter clouds is striking in all but a few of the prints. Some images include the sun either as a distinct element in the photograph or as an illuminating force behind the clouds.
Background.
The multiple series Stieglitz called "Equivalents" combined two very important aspects of his photography: the technical and the aesthetic. He was a master at both, but with "Equivalents" he succeeded in bringing his skills to a new level. On the technical side, Stieglitz had been fascinated by the special problems of photographing clouds ever since the summer of 1887, when he took his first pictures of clouds over Lake Como in Italy. Until the 1920s most photographic emulsions were orthochromatic, which meant they were primarily sensitive to light on the blue end of the spectrum. This made photographing clouds particularly difficult because unless special filters were used the sky would appear very light and the clouds would be lost against it. Over the years Stieglitz repeatedly took photographs of clouds using orthochromatic emulsions, but he reported "Every time I developed cloud negative I was so wrought up, always believing I had nearly gotten what I was after – but had failed."
In 1922 Stieglitz read a commentary about his photography by Waldo Frank that suggested the strength of his imagery was in the power of the individuals he photographed. Stieglitz was outraged, believing Frank had at best ignored his many photographs of buildings and street scenes, and at worst had accused him of being a simple recorder of what appeared in front of him. He resolved immediately to begin a new series of cloud studies "to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter – not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges – clouds were there for everyone…" He said "I wanted to photograph clouds to find out what I had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life –…My aim is increasingly to make my photographs look so much like photographs that unless one has "eyes" and "sees", they won't be seen – and still everyone will never forget them having once looked at them."
Coincidentally at this same time a new panchromatic photographic emulsion was developed that allowed the full range of colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" x 10" view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called "Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs" (also called "Clouds in Ten Movements"). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.
Encouraged by the success of the "Music" series he took his smaller 4" x 5" Graflex camera and shot dozens of pictures of the sky in the summer of 1923. He arranged many of these photographs into distinct series he called "Songs of the Sky". In late 1924 he exhibited sixty-one of his cloud photos in a single room at the Anderson Galleries. In the catalog to the exhibition he wrote "Songs of the Sky – Secrets of the Skies as revealed by my Camera are tiny photographs, direct revelations of a man's world in the sky – documents of eternal relationship – perhaps even a philosophy." After seeing the exhibition, Ananda Coomaraswamy, who was then curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, persuaded Stieglitz to donate some of his photographs, including five from "Songs of the Sky", to the museum. This was the first time a major museum in the U.S. acquired photographs as part of its permanent collection.
Stieglitz continued photographing clouds and skies for most of the next decade. In 1925 he began referring to these photographs as "Equivalents", a name he used for all such photographs taken from that year forward. In 1929 he renamed some of the original "Songs of the Sky" as "Equivalents", and these prints are still known by both names today.
Stieglitz certainly knew what he had achieved in these pictures. Writing about his "Equivalents" to Hart Crane, he declared: "I know exactly what I have photographed. I know I have done something that has never been done…I also know that there is more of the really abstract in some 'representation' than in most of the dead representations of the so-called abstract so fashionable now."
Artistic importance.
The "Equivalents" are generally recognized as the first intentionally abstract photographs. It is difficult to look at them today and understand the impact that they had at the time. When they first appeared photography had been generally recognized as a distinct art form for no more than fifteen years, and until Stieglitz introduced his cloud photos there was no tradition of photographing something that was not recognizable in both form and content. Art critic Hilton Kramer said that "Equivalents" "undoubtedly owe something to the American modernist painting (Dove's and O'Keeffe's especially) that Stieglitz felt particularly close to at the time. Yet they go distinctly beyond the pictorial conventions that governed avant-garde painting in this period by reaching for the kind of lyric abstraction that was not to enter American painting until the 40's and 50's. In the line that can be traced from the paintings of Albert Pinkham Ryder to, say, those of Clyfford Still, it is in Stieglitz's "Equivalents" – rather than in painting itself – that we find the strongest link." 
One of the reasons that the strongest of these photographs appear so abstract is that they are void of any reference points. Stieglitz was not concerned with a particular orientation for many of these prints, and he was known to exhibit them sideways or upside down from how he originally mounted them. Photography historian Sarah Greenough points out that by doing so Stieglitz "was destabilizing your viewer's relationship with nature in order to have you think less about nature, not to deny that it's a photograph of a cloud, but to think more about the feeling that the cloud formation evokes." She further says:
"New York Times" art critic Andy Grundberg said "The Equivalents" "remain photography's most radical demonstration of faith in the existence of a reality behind and beyond that offered by the world of appearances. They are intended to function evocatively, like music, and they express a desire to leave behind the physical world, a desire symbolized by the virtual absence of horizon and scale clues within the frame. Emotion resides solely in form, they assert, not in the specifics of time and place."
Photographer Ansel Adams said Stieglitz's work had a profound influence on him. In 1948 he claimed his first "intense experience in photography" was seeing many of the "Equivalents" (probably for the first time in 1933, when they met).
Series and sets.
Stieglitz arranged the photographs he called "Equivalent" into several different groups when he exhibited or published them, and often he inscribed the mounted prints on the back with one or more letters to further identify what he called "sets". These groupings are not sequential, and Stieglitz did not consider any single series or set as a discrete unit. Some of the individual prints are included in more than one series or set, and some copies of the same print are inscribed with different identifications. In general, his sets should be seen as "totally artificial constructions which mirror, not the passage of real time, but the change and flux of Stieglitz’s subjective state."
The following is a chronological listing of the "Equivalents" photographs. Many of the prints do not have individual titles, and dozens of photographs are known by the same generic name "Equivalent". The most comprehensive catalog of these photographs is found in "Alfred Stieglitz: The Key Set"., and the numbers in this list refer to the photographs identified in that publication.

Muñecos de Papel (album)

Muñecos de Papel is the first soundtrack album to the telenovela "Alcanzar una estrella II", released in 1991. It includes the first opening song for the telenovela, "Estrella de Ilusion", performed by Zarabanda, as well as the second opening song "Muñeco de Papel", performed by the fictional band Muñecos de Papel (Sasha, Ricky Martin, Bibi Gaytan, Pedro Fernandez, Angelica Rivera and Erick Rubin). 
The album version of "Muñeco de Papel" is different from the one that served as the opening song for the telenovela; Bibi Gaytán and Erick Rubín were then signed to Melody and due to differences between the record companies, their voices - which can be heard in the TV version (Sasha at 0:01, Bibi 0:13, Erick 0:40, Ricky 0:47, Pedro 0:54, Angelica 1:53)- were replaced by Sasha and Alejandro Ibarra, respectively.
Despite the title, this record was not a full Muñecos de Papel album; instead, it served to promote songs from the band members' solo albums ("Siento", "Juego de Ajedrez", "Oro") as well as other Sony Music artists such as Garibaldi that were not even featured in the telenovela. Songs such as Chantal Andere's "Musculo", which was often used in the TV show, are not present in this album - Chantal was also under contract with Melody.
The third opening song "No quiero dejar de brillar" was included in the second album released for this telenovela, simply titled Alcanzar una Estrella II and released by Melody in mid-1991.

Salvatore Naturale

Salvatore Antonio "Sal" Naturale, also known as Donald Matterson (c. 1953/1954– August 23, 1972) was an American bank robber who, along with John Wojtowicz, inspired the 1975 film "Dog Day Afternoon." In the film he is portrayed by actor John Cazale.
Early life.
Little is known about Naturale's background except for criminal acts he committed and that he lived in Manhattan, in the same neighborhood as John Wojtowicz. As a kid, growing up in Keansburg, New Jersey for two years in his early years as an adolescent, he had been picked up and arrested on countless charges of truancy, grand larceny, burglary and dangerous drugs. He spent most of his teen years in and out of state reform schools, and within the three months before the fatal robbery attempt, Salvatore had been charged with possession of burglary tools and possession of narcotics. As a youth while incarcerated in prison he was victim to numerous acts of sodomy from older, stronger inmates.
In the novelization of the crime by Patrick Mann, it is suggested that Naturale had connections with the Italian mafia in New York City, but he in fact had no known associations with organized crime. He sported a faint blond mustache and crude tattoos on his arms and thighs and lived mostly as a drifter, but a "The New York Times" article stated that he remained in contact with and occasionally lived with his mother. A middle-aged man named Wallace Hamilton, who told reporters that he was a friend of Naturale's, identified Naturale's corpse at the city morgue following the robbery.
The robbery.
On August 22, 1972, Naturale attempted to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan bank on the corner of East Third Street and Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn; the robbery was led by John Wojtowicz and Robert Westenberg. Westenberg was unnerved by a police car on the street and fled the scene before the robbery was underway. Wojtowicz and Naturale then held seven Chase Manhattan bank employees hostage for fourteen hours. Wojtowicz, a former bank teller, had some knowledge of bank operations. However, Wojtowicz had apparently based his plan on scenes from the movie "The Godfather," which he had seen earlier that day. 
Before the robbery, Naturale had informed Wojtowicz and Westenberg that he would rather die than go back to prison. He was seen by the police on the scene as nervous, highly strung and volatile and they feared that the more pressure that was put on Naturale and Wojtowicz would cause them to be frightened and unbalanced and impossible to negotiate with on reasonable terms. He was the only one of the three bank robbers who had a previous criminal record. During the robbery he was dressed in a black business suit and tie and carried an attache case. His last meal consisted of takeout pizza and soda pop which they ate during their holdout at the bank with the hostages. The robbery was meant to fund the sex reassignment operation of John's wife. Naturile's share was to finance his two sisters' removal from foster care and separation from their mother, who drank and neglected all three of her children.
The standoff with police.
During the robbery, Naturale surveyed the street and alleyway realizing that they were surrounded by police. It was later reported by the bank manager and tellers held hostage by him that he spoke often of the tremendous power of the .30-06 rifle and his ability and willingness to use it. He was more feared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York City Police Department (NYPD) during the hostage situation than the more stable Wojtowicz. He was the only one of the robbers who had a previous criminal record and was known by the police. He fired a single shot at the police through the Chase Manhattan bank's exit rear door, fearing that the police were preparing to storm the building.
Assuming the Donald Matterson identity.
Wojtowicz identified Salvatore to police by his criminal alias, "Donald Matterson". He used the alias when he was arrested for possession of narcotics and burglary tools five months before the bank robbery. For two hours, local television stations, live at the scene reported that the two suspects were Wojtowicz and a Donald Matterson. It was not until later that he was officially identified as Salvatore Naturale, who had charges pending against him after being released on parole for his arrest in Manhattan for possessing burglary tools.
The ambush and capture.
When entering the limo to be chauffeured to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in South Ozone Park, Queens, Wojtowicz told Naturale to sit with bank employee Shirley Ball and another co-worker in the third row, while the others sat in the fourth, reserving the fifth row for himself and the two remaining hostages. There was a .38 caliber handgun hidden in the front seat of the limousine that John missed when searching the limo upon first arriving at the bank. FBI Special Agent Fred Fehl positioned himself on the driver's side of the limo next to the open window closest to Salvatore, who sat between two hostages in the third row. FBI Special Agent Dick Baker took up a position on the right side of the car closest to John, who was still situated in the rear seat. NYPD Police Chief of Detectives Louis C. Cottell, who headed the negotiations during the initial standoff, stayed 15 feet away from the rear of the limo. 
When everyone prepared for the final standoff, the Hansa Jet rolled out onto the tarmac where they sat in the limo. Baker asked a police officer identified only as "Murphy" to ask whether the group wanted any food on the flight. He took advantage of this opportunity to assess the threat Salvatore and John posed, from where they were situated in the vehicle. Baker grabbed the handgun with his left hand and ordered the two men to "freeze". Simultaneously, he wrestled with the barrel of Naturale's shotgun, knocking it toward the ceiling and shooting him in the head point blank. Naturale slumped in the seat, mortally wounded. He was rushed to the hospital by an ambulance that was waiting at the scene but was pronounced dead on arrival.
"Dog Day Afternoon".
Salvatore Naturale's story was used as the basis for the film "Dog Day Afternoon." The movie was released in 1975, and starred Al Pacino as Wojtowicz (called "Sonny Wortzik" in the film), and John Cazale, Pacino's co-star in "The Godfather", as Naturale.
In 1975, John Wojtowicz wrote a letter to "The New York Times" expressing concern that people would believe the movie version of the events which he said was only 30% accurate. Among other objections, he stated that the movie intimated that he had "sold out" Naturale to the police, which he claims to be untrue. Several attempts were made on Wojtowicz's life following an inmate screening of the movie. He would, however, later praise Al Pacino's portrayal of himself, and Chris Sarandon's of his wife Elizabeth Eden, as accurate. In a 2006 interview, the screenwriter of the movie, Frank Pierson, said that he tried to visit Wojtowicz in prison many times to get more details about his story when he wrote the screenplay, but Wojtowicz refused each time to see him because he thought he was not paid enough money for the rights to his story. An 18-year-old actor was originally to be cast in the role of Naturale, but actor John Cazale, who was 39 years old at the time of production, ultimately got the part.

Charles "Charlie" H. Robertson (born 1934) is an American politician who served as Mayor of York, Pennsylvania from 1994–2002. He attended William Penn Senior High School in York and spent two years as a medic in the United States Army.
Robertson is best remembered for his role in the 1969 York Race Riot, during which time he was a police officer. He helped to incite the violence by shouting, "White power!" and by allegedly giving white rioters ammunition and encouraging them to, "kill as many niggers as can." He was arrested on May 17, 2001, and released on $50,000 bail. On May 27, 2001, Robertson was arraigned on murder charges stemming from his involvement in the riot; he was found not guilty on October 19, 2002. While he admitted that he had shouted the racial slur (calling it "a youthful incident of ingrained police racism"), he steadfastly denied all other charges against him.

Archie Roberts (Australian footballer)

Archibald Frederick "Archie" Roberts (16 July 1910 – 6 June 1945) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne and Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Roberts also played with Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Prahran after his VFL career ended.
He took part in the Battle of Ambon during World War II in January 1942. He was captured, and eventually died of illness, still a prisoner of war of the Japanese, on 6 June 1945.
Family.
The son of Archibald William Roberts and Lily Roberts, née Davis, Archie was born on 16 July 1910 in Burnley.
Footballer.
Melbourne.
Recruited by Melbourne from Cheltenham, he played several matches for the Second XVIII before he played his first senior VFL match for Melbourne, aged 21, against St Kilda, at the MCG on 2 July 1932 (round nine); Lou Riley and Alan Ryan also played their first senior matches on that day. Having lost its first eight matches, this was Melbourne's first win for the 1932 season, winning by 11 points, 12.13 (85) to 10.14 (74).
He also played in the remaining nine matches of the season. He was only selected for two senior games the following year (1933). In 1934, he played in fifteen of Melbourne's eighteen games; however, in 1935 and 1936, he could only manage five and four senior games respectively. His last game for Melbourne was in Melbourne's 50 point victory over Hawthorn on 15 August 1936, 17.10 (112) to 9.8 (62).
Essendon.
Having played a total of 36 senior games for Melbourne, he was given a clearance to Essendon on 21 April 1937. He played at full-back for Essendon, against Footscray, at the Western Oval, on Saturday, 24 April 1937 (round one). Essendon lost by four points in the last minutes of an uninspiring match. In 1937 he played in twelve of a possible eighteen senior matches, playing his last match, in round seventeen, at full-back against Fitzroy, at Windy Hill, on 21 August 1937.
Prahran.
On 1 June 1938, Roberts was granted a clearance from Essendon to the Victorian Football Association club Prahran (the competition's 1937 premiership team), and he played his first senior VFA match, at full-back, for Prahran against Coburg on Saturday, 4 June 1938 (round nine). Most likely due to lack of match practice, he did not play all that well. He played quite a number of he remaining matches of the season, including Prahran's losing semi-final match against Northcote on 30 July 1938. He played at centre half-back, in his last match for Prahran, its 1939 preliminary final loss to Williamstown on 30 September 1939.
Soldier.
He enlisted in the Second AIF on 11 July 1940, and Private Archibald Frederick Roberts (VX44381) was assigned to the 2/21 Australian Infantry Battalion. He was trained at Bonegila, and then his group moved through to Alice Springs, and then Darwin, and then, eventually they marched into the barracks at Tan Tui, just north of Ambon town, the main port of Ambon Island, on 16 December 1941, nine days after the Japanese had entered the war.
As part of the Australian Army's "Gull Force" he took part in the Battle of Ambon during World War II.
He was captured by the Japanese in January 1942. He was taken prisoner by the Japanese, and was treated brutally (as were all of his comrades). He died of illness, due to maltreatment and malnourishment, still a prisoner of war, on 6 June 1945.

Ebenezer P. Dorr

Ebenezer Pearson Dorr (13 March 1817 – 29 April 1882) was a merchant sailor, insurance executive, and meteorologist.
Dorr was born in Hartford, Vermont. His earliest inclinations were for a seafaring life and when only ten years of age he sailed from Newburyport as a boy before the mast. In 1838, Dorr settled in Buffalo, New York, and became a sailor on the Great Lakes, serving as captain of several vessels.
In 1843, Dorr became marine inspector for the Buffalo Mutual Insurance Company, and acted as agent of the New York board of underwriters for "the entire northwest" (the Great Lakes region). He was also for some time the Buffalo representative of many insurance companies, and served for seven years as president of the Board of Inland Underwriters.
He was the first to organize a regular system of wreckage on the Great Lakes, and did much to improve the condition of seamen and to obtain recognition of their acts of heroism.
Dorr was also a leader in Buffalo's business community. He acted at different times as president of the Board of Trade, the Society of Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Buffalo, and as vice-president of the National Board of Trade.
When the idea of systematic weather reporting was first suggested, Dorr took up the duty. At the request of Matthew Fontaine Maury, superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory, Dorr submitted daily meteorological observations from Buffalo, NY.
On January 5, 1874, Captain Dorr presented a paper entitled "A Brief Sketch of the First "Monitor" and its Inventor" to the Historical Society of Buffalo.
Mr. Dorr was well acquainted with many prominent naval officers, and was elected an Associate Member of the Naval Institute in 1879, and a member in 1880.
He died in Buffalo in 1882.

Edda Göring

Edda Göring (born 2 June 1938), sometimes spelled Edda Goering, is the only child of the Nazi politician and "Reichsmarschall" Hermann Göring by his second marriage to the actress Emmy Sonnemann.
As a child she received many works of art as gifts, including a painting of the Madonna and Child by Lucas Cranach the Elder. In the 1950s and 1960s this was the subject of a fifteen-year legal battle, which she finally lost in 1968.
Life.
The only child of Hermann Göring, Edda was born on 2 June 1938.
According to Giles MacDonogh:
Hermann Göring received all together some 628,000 messages of congratulations on his daughter's birth. It has often been suggested that the name Edda was given in honour of the daughter of Benito Mussolini, but her mother stated that this was not so. At her baptism at Carinhall, her father's country house near Berlin, on 4 November 1938, her godfather was Adolf Hitler, and the occasion was reported by "Life" magazine, with a photograph of Edda and her parents. Her christening presents included two paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder. To the displeasure of Heinrich Himmler and others, it was discovered that neither Edda's mother nor her nanny were Nazi Party members, but this was soon corrected when Göring arranged for Emmy to join the Party. On Hitler's instructions, she received a Golden Party Badge.
Edda grew up at Carinhall, and like other daughters of high-ranking Nazi leaders she was called "little princess" ("kleine Prinzessin"). Indeed, when she was one year old Douglas Reed writing in "Life" magazine called her "a sort of Nazi Crown Princess". The Luftwaffe paid for a small-scale replica of Frederick the Great's palace of Sans Souci to be built in an orchard at Carinhall for her to play in. Some fifty metres long, seven metres wide, and three and a half metres high, this had within it a miniature theatre, complete with stage and curtains, and was known as the "Edda-Schlößchen" ('Edda's little palace').
In 1940, ' printed a story which alleged that Edda had been conceived by artificial insemination. An angry Hermann Göring demanded action by Walter Buch, the supreme Nazi Party regulator, against the editor, Julius Streicher. Buch was ready to "stop that sick mind once and for all", but Hitler intervened to save Streicher, and the outcome was that he was stripped of some honours but was allowed to go on publishing ' from the exile of his farm near Nuremberg.
During the closing stages of the Second World War in Europe, Hermann Göring retreated to his mountain home at Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, taking his wife and daughter with him. On 8 May 1945 Germany surrendered unconditionally, and on 21 May, a few days before her seventh birthday, Edda was interned with her mother in the U.S.-controlled Palace Hotel, code-named Camp Ashcan, at Mondorf, Luxembourg. By 1946 the two had been freed and were living at one of their own homes, Burg Veldenstein in Neuhaus, near Nuremberg. There they were visited by the American officer John E. Dolibois, who described Edda as "...a beautiful child, the image of her father. Bright and perky, polite and well-trained". During the Nuremberg trials, Edda was allowed to visit her father in prison. He was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death, but on 15 October 1946, the night before his scheduled hanging Hermann Göring committed suicide.
In 1948, while living near Hersbruck with her mother and her aunt Else Sonnemann, Edda Göring joined the "", a high school for girls at Sulzbach-Rosenberg in Bavaria, where she remained until the Abitur. In November 1948 the family moved to Etzelwang to be nearer the school. In 1949, Emmy Göring faced a challenge for some valuable possessions (see below) and explained many of them as the property of Edda, now aged ten. After leaving school, Göring became a law clerk and later graduated from the University of Munich. A letter of 1959 says of Edda Göring: "The baby is now a young lady, slim, fair-haired and pretty. She lives with her mother on the fifth floor of a modern apartment block in the Munich city centre." Meanwhile, Edda worked in a hospital laboratory and was hoping to become a medical technician. Göring was a regular guest of Hitler's patron Winifred Wagner, whose grandson Gottfried Wagner later recalled that:
Edda Göring worked in a rehabilitation clinic in Wiesbaden and devoted herself to taking care of her mother, remaining with her until she died on 8 June 1973. After that, for five years in the 1970s Göring was the companion of the "Stern magazine" journalist Gerd Heidemann. Heidemann had bought the yacht "Carin II", which had been Hermann Göring's, and according to Peter Wyden. 
For some years Edda Göring made public appearances, attending memorials for Nazis and taking part in political events, but in recent years her life has been more withdrawn. Unlike the children of other high ranking Nazis, such as Gudrun Himmler or Albert Speer, Jr., she has never publicly commented on her father's involvement within the Reich or the Holocaust. In the 1990s she said of her father in an interview:
Successive governments of West Germany and the reunited Germany have denied Göring the pension normally given to the children of government ministers of the old German Reich. In 2000 she was reported to be still living in the Munich suburb of Lehel, in the apartment she had shared with her mother, but other sources state that she moved to South Africa during the 1990s. 
In 2010, Edda Göring said of Albert Göring in an article in "The Guardian" 
Legal dispute over a Cranach Madonna.
At the time of her baptism in November 1938, Edda Göring received several works of art as gifts, including a painting of the Madonna and Child by Lucas Cranach the Elder, a present from the city of Cologne. Part of the collection of the Lord Mayor of Cologne, this had previously been on display in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum. After the war, the city of Cologne sought the return of the painting, on the grounds ("inter alia") that the gift had been made under pressure from Hermann Göring.
Advocate-General Philip Auerbach, state commissioner for racial, religious and political persecution in Bavaria, was entrusted with the return of many art treasures that had been acquired by the Görings, and the legal battle over the Cranach Madonna lasted for fifteen years. At the first hearing, in the regional court of Cologne, judgement was given for the city. Edda Göring, who at the time was studying law, appealed this decision to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, which in 1954 overturned the lower court. Anna Maria Sigmund reports that 
This was Edda Göring's second victory of 1954. She had already been successful in forcing the state of Bavaria to return to her jewellery valued at DM150,000 which it had seized. However, the German authorities continued to pursue the case of the painting by Cranach, and in January 1968 the Federal Court of Justice of Germany in Karlsruhe gave a final judgment for the City of Cologne. By that point, both the state of Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany had laid claim to the painting, which is now back in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum.
In literature.
Edda Göring is mentioned in a poem by Robert Pringle called "Stations of the Cross":

Shelter in place

Shelter in place (SAME code: SPW) is the use of a structure and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate individuals from a hazardous outdoor atmosphere. It entails closing all household doors, windows and vents and taking immediate shelter in a readily accessible location, such as a basement or central medium to small room, and trying to make it as airtight as possible by shutting off all ventilation/HVAC systems and extensively sealing the shelter's doors and windows from all outside air contaminants with damp towels, or if available, plastic sheeting and adhesive tape. Diagrams of what sheltering in place entails following a (CBRN)Chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threat, and how long it is advised to be done for, is provided by the FEMA affiliated website ready.gov.
Shelter-in-place effectiveness has been evaluated and experimental results show that proper sealing can make a substantial difference to a normal home shelter, finding it to be at least twice as effective against a host of airborne substances when compared against simply staying inside and not implementing the countermeasure, and in most airborne contaminant cases, it is usually much more effective, depending on the particle size of the substance in question. If the occupant's breathing produced carbon dioxide is the only consumer of oxygen in the room then carbon dioxide levels would not begin to reach dangerous values until 3+ hours had passed, in all likely, 4 family home, scenarios.
In the military, "Shelter-in-Place" is comparable to "buttoning up" and has proved life saving in many instances.
If an individual finds themselves outside during an emergency that calls for shelter-in-place, then effective but low-tech decontamination is required before entering into the shelter.
In practice, depending on the exact situation, everyone within a specific distance of the airborne incident may be ordered to shelter in place or people within a closer range may be ordered to evacuate while everyone else shelters in place to minimize public exposure as much as possible. Sheltering in place is generally only used for a short period of time, typically a few hours. However it can be extended if the occupants are equipped with common drain cleaner that contains sodium hydroxide- which is an effective carbon dioxide scrubber in addition to self-contained oxygen candles or the more common welding Oxygen tanks, both of which also have the added benefit of producing and maintaining a shelter positive pressure which keeps any shelter leaks, leaking "out" rather than leaking "in".
The phrase has also erroneously been used, instead of the more accurate "lockdown", to describe precautions to be taken by the public when violence has occurred or might occur (particularly in shootings) in the area and the perpetrator is believed to still be in the area but not apprehended. The public in the area is advised to carry out all the same tasks as a typical shelter-in-place but without the key step of sealing the shelter up to prevent outside air from circulating indoors, in this scenario people are simply urged to lockdown - stay indoors and "close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows."
Reasons.
Public authorities may call for potential victims in a hazardous situation to shelter in place, particularly in the event of a release of hazardous materials such as radiological, biological, or chemical contaminants. Such releases, whether accidental or intentional, may put surrounding populations in danger and authorities may call for residents to shelter in place. Chemical agents that might trigger such a response could include solids, liquids, or gases that could cause serious injury or death to people, animals, or plants. In light of active shooter events, and the panic that can ensue, shelter in place is also being implemented as a response to armed events.
Implementation.
Shelter in place is intended as a short-term strategy for dealing with disaster. As such, recommendations from the American Red Cross and other disaster management agencies are for individuals to be prepared to shelter for a matter of hours in a safe place should such a strategy be implemented. The Red Cross suggests a number of steps to prepare for a shelter in place. They encourage those preparing to develop and be familiar with emergency procedures and shelter in place plans both at home and at their place of work or school. These plans should include the selection of a room with access to a water supply and few or no windows, and creation of an emergency kit that includes food and water. The room chosen should have a minimum of of floor space per person to allow people to stay inside for at least five hours when sealed without dangerous buildup of carbon dioxide. A radio, flashlight, duct tape, and first aid supply should also be included.
Residents of an affected community might be informed that shelter in place is being implemented through the news media, Emergency Alert System, Reverse 911, warning sirens or horns, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports, and announcements from vehicles equipped with public address systems. In the United States, facilities like nuclear power plants are required to be equipped with audio alert systems that can be heard within a radius.
Once a shelter in place is called, residents are expected to immediately go indoors, bring all children and animals with them, and to close and lock windows and doors. All ways in which outside materials may enter the shelter area should be eliminated, including closure of fireplace dampers, shutting off ventilation or climate control systems, and prepare an area for pets to eliminate waste that does not require allowing them outside. If told to do so via television or radio, those sheltering should seal their rooms with duct tape and plastic. Upon reaching shelter, those who were outside for a period of time seeking shelter after the shelter in place was called and who may have been exposed to chemical contaminants should remove all outer clothing, put it in a plastic bag, and wash with warm water. After an announcement that the shelter in place is over, residents should go outside and open all doors and windows to ventilate the shelter. Similar processes should be followed in cars, workplaces, or schools.

Jack Shelton

John Thomas "Jack" Shelton (24 January 1905 — 1 May 1941) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda and South Melbourne. He was killed in action in Tobruk in 1941.
As a VFL footballer, he was sometimes known as "J. A. Shelton" (rather than "J. T. Shelton" ), with the "A" most likely a reference to Avenel, in order to distinguish him from the other Jack Shelton, John Frederick "Jack" Shelton, a prolific goalkicker, recruited from Koo Wee Rup in 1926, who was playing for St Kilda at the same time.
Family.
The son of Richard John and Jane Elizabeth Shelton (née Skinner), he was born at Avenel, Victoria on 24 January 1905. As a young lad of 7, Jack's father had been saved from drowning in swollen Hughes Creek, Avanel by a young Ned Kelly, aged 10.
Jack married Winifred Emma Planck Gadd in 1932. He was the father of John Shelton (born 13 August 1933) and Hawthorn's Bill Shelton (born 13 July 1936), and the uncle of Essendon's Ian "Bluey" Shelton.
Education.
He was educated at Brighton Grammar School as a boarder, and he later attended Dookie Agricultural College.
Footballer.
Although he began as a forward and rover, throughout his later senior football career he played as an either a backman or in the ruck. He was a tough player who played hard and fair.
It is important to note that Main and Allen, (2002, p. 336) have, along with Feldman and Holmesby (1992), become confused between this Shelton (John Thomas "Jack" Shelton) and the other St Kilda Shelton (John Frederick "Jack" Shelton). This Jack Shelton was not in the St Kilda team that played against Geelong at the Corio Oval on 7 August 1926,but John Frederick "Jack" Shelton did play for St Kilda on that day. Therefore, the "Shelton" mentioned in the account of the thuggery directed, particularly, at Geelong's Arthur Rayson (who also worked as the caretaker at the Corio Oval), by members of the St Kilda team, and the account of the spectators' response to Rayson's injury (which included broken ribs), specifically directed at "Shelton", refers exclusively to John Frederick "Jack" Shelton, and not "this" Shelton (as Main and Allen have mistakenly supposed).
In fact, although a very tough and relentless footballer, this Jack Shelton, unlike his team-mate John Frederick "Jack" Shelton, was never reported, let alone suspended, in his entire football career.
St Kilda.
He received his clearance to play for St Kilda on 28 April 1926. He played eleven senior games for St Kilda in his first season, playing his first game, on the half-forward flank, against Hawthorn at the Junction Oval on 5 June 1926.
He returned to Avenel for the 1927 season; and, once again, came back to play with St Kilda in mid-1928, resuming his senior career in the eighth round match against Essendon, in the first ruck, at Windy Hill, on 4 June 1928. Shelton played very well in his first game back in the VFL, and St Kilda won by 9 points. He played eleven senior matches for St Kilda in 1928 (rounds 8 to 18 inclusive) and six in 1929, with his last match against Richmond, at the Punt Road Oval on 13 July 1929 (round eleven).
South Melbourne.
He received his clearance to play for South Melbourne on 11 June 1930. He played his first match for South Melbourne, as a back-pocket ruckman, against Hawthorn on 14 June 1930 (round seven). South Melbourne thrashed Hawthorn 17.11 (119) to 9.10 (64), in its first win for the 1930 season.
He played the next two matches (rounds eight and nine), and the last four matches of the season, retiring after playing against North Melbourne at the Lake Oval on 13 September 1930. He was one of the best players in a team that soundly beat North Melbourne 15.19 (109) to 4.14 (38), having kicked 9.6 (60) to 1.1 (7) in the last quarter.
Avenel.
He received his clearance to play for Avenel on 3 June 1931.
In 1934, in a match against Nagambie, he broke a collarbone.
At the time of his enlistment in the second AIF, in mid-1940, he was still playing football for Avenel, and was the captain of the Avenel team.
Soldier.
Both his eldest brother, Private Richard John Shelton (1895-1967), and his second oldest brother, Sergeant Leslie Norman Shelton (1897-1933), had served in the First AIF (they both enlisted on 19 September 1914, with Leslie producing letters of permission from his mother and father).
On 23 July 1940, Jack left his farm, "Mittagong", at Avenel and enlisted in the second AIF aged 35.
After training at Wangaratta, he was promoted to Lieutenant, joined the 2/24th Battalion, and was sent to the Middle East, and then Northern Africa, with the 9th Division.
He was killed in action, at Tobruk, on 1 May1941.
Remembered.
His name appears on the Roll of Honour (panel 52) at the Australian War memorial. He has no known grave, and is commemorated at the Alamein Memorial, in Egypt.

University of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine

The School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow is one of six veterinary schools in the United Kingdom, and offers undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Veterinary Medicine.
It was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the University in 1949 and gaining independent Faculty status in 1969. In 2010 it became a constituent school of the new College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences.
Early days.
In 1859, James McCall, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh, moved to Glasgow and started a practice in Hope Street, from which he gave informal lectures in veterinary medicine. In 1862, formal classes were instituted and the practice moved to a larger accommodation, a set of stables at 399 Parliamentary Road.
In 1863, a royal warrant was issued which established McCall's enterprise as the Glasgow Veterinary College and entitled its students to examination at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; the first graduate qualified in 1865. The College was the second veterinary school in Scotland, after the Dick School in Edinburgh, McCall's alma mater, which was established in 1823. In 1873, it moved to much larger facilities in Buccleuch Street, a former pumping station, and merged into the University of Glasgow in 1949. The current Vet School was built on the Garscube Estate in 1970.
Facilities.
The School is now based at the Garscube Estate in Bearsden, on the outskirts of Glasgow, purchased by the University in 1948 from Sir George Campbell of Succoth. Sir George was a descendent of Ilay Campbell, Lord Succoth, who had studied Law at the University and later served as Lord President of the Court of Session and Rector of the University. The main Garscube House had been used as a hospital during the Second World War. The School has a farm, a Small Animal Hospital and an Equine Hospital on the Estate, as well as the James Herriot Library, named for Alf Wight, a graduate of the School who wrote under that name. The University's Wolfson Halls are also situated on the Estate, as is the Garscube Sports Complex, used by the School's student rugby team as well as other students and sports clubs in the University.
The School also has facilities on the Cochno Estate, purchased by the University in 1954. The Estate originally extended to some , including of woodland, but is now an business enterprise, including a farm and the elegant Cochno House. Cochno was formerly the seat of the Hamiltons of Barnes, but during the late nineteenth century, the Estate was home to William Anderson Donaldson, a Glasgow iron merchant of the firm, James Watson & Company.
Degree.
The School presents students for the degree of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery (BVMS). This is one of only five degree programmes in Europe recognised by the American Veterinary Medical Association, and is one of a small number recognised automatically by the South African Veterinary Council.
The School scored 95% for 'graduate prospects' and 5B for 'research quality' in The Times "Good University Guide 2009".

The Continental IO-360 is a family of fuel-injected air-cooled, six-cylinder aircraft engines manufactured by Continental Motors in the United States of America, now part of AVIC International since 2010. 
The engine is available in both normally aspirated, fuel injected IO-360 model and a turbocharged TSIO-360 versions. It is also available in both left and right hand rotation versions for use on twin-engined aircraft.
There was no carbureted version of this engine, which would have been designation "O-360", therefore the base model is the "IO-360".
History.
The IO-360 was first certified by the Federal Aviation Administration on 15 May 1962 to the CAR 13 certification standard, effective June 15, 1956, as amended by 13-1 thru 13-3. The engine is produced by Continental under Production Certificate No. 508.
The turbocharged TSIO-360 series was first certified on 11 October 1966 to the Federal Aviation Regulations Part 33 standard effective February 1, 1965, as amended by 33-1. This series is manufactured under Production Certificate No. 7, except the TSIO-360-D which is under Production Certificate No. 508.

1922 British Mount Everest expedition

The 1922 British Mount Everest expedition was the first mountaineering expedition with the express aim of making the first ascent of Mount Everest. This was also the first expedition that attempted to climb Everest using bottled oxygen. The expedition would attempt to climb Everest from the northern side out of Tibet. At the time, Everest could not be attempted from the south out of Nepal as the country was closed to Western foreigners.
In 1921 an had seen the whole eastern and northern surroundings of the mountain. In searching for the easiest route, George Mallory, who was also a participant of the 1924 expedition (and the only person on all three expeditions in 1921, 1922 and 1924), had discovered a route which, according to his opinion, would be a potential solution for reaching the summit.
After two unsuccessful summit attempts the expedition ended on the third attempt when seven porters died as the result of a group-induced avalanche. Not only had the expedition failed to reach the summit but it also marked the first reported climbing deaths on Mount Everest. The expedition did however establish a new world record climbing height of during their second summit attempt, which was subsequently exceeded in the 1924 expedition.
Preparations.
The ascent trials were - notwithstanding other thoughts - an expression of the pioneering thinking that was common in the British Empire. As the British were unsuccessful as the first to reach the North and South Poles they tried to go to the so-called "third pole" — to "conquer" Mount Everest. 
Cecil Rawling had planned two expeditions in 1915 and 1916 but they never happened due to the outbreak of the First World War and his death in 1917. The expeditions in the 1920s were planned and managed by the British Royal Geographic Society and the Alpine Club in a joint Mount Everest Committee.
The surveying activities in 1921 allowed the creation of maps which were a pre-condition for the 1922 expedition. John Noel took on the role of official expedition photographer. He took with him three movie cameras, two panorama cameras, four sheet cameras, one stereo camera and five so called "vest pocket Kodaks". The last named were small cameras that were of small weight and size to be taken by the mountaineers to great heights. These cameras were intended to allow climbers to document a possible summit success. Additionally they had on their way a special "black tent" for photographic works. Thanks to Noel's efforts, many photographs and one movie chronicled the expedition. 
During the 1921 expedition they had seen that the best time for a summit bid would be April–May before the monsoon season. The expeditions in 1922 and 1924 were planned according to this knowledge.
Bottled oxygen as a mountaineering aid.
This year of 1922 can also be seen as the starting year for the enduring question of "fair means" and controversies about the use of bottled oxygen for mountaineering purposes in the "death zone". Alexander Mitchell Kellas was one of the very first scientists who had pointed out the possible use of bottled oxygen for gaining great heights. At this point in time the available systems (derived from mining rescue systems) were in his opinion too heavy to be a help in great heights. Kellas was part of the Everest reconnaissance expedition in 1921 but died on the way to Mt. Everest. This expedition had taken bottled oxygen with them, but it was never used. Additionally, few paid much attention to Kellas’ innovative ideas, possibly because his scientific work belonged strictly to the amateur tradition. More attention was paid to the pressure vessel experiments of Professor Georges Dreyer, who had studied high-altitude problems the Royal Air Force encountered in World War I. According to his experiments—which he did partly together with George Ingle Finch—survival at great heights could only be possible with the aid of additional oxygen.
As a consequence of this scientific work, the 1922 expedition planned to use bottled oxygen. One bottle contained ca. 240 litres of oxygen. Four bottles were fixed on a porting fixture which had to be carried by a mountaineer. With the additional elements there was a weight of ca. 14.5 kg. So every mountaineer in the beginning of a climbing day had to bear a very heavy additional load. Ten of these systems were part of the expedition equipment. Additionally to a mask over mouth and nose there should be held a tube in the mouth. Dreyer also had proposed the flow of oxygen: at a flow rate of 2 litres of oxygen per minute, in the summit climb they should use 2.4 litres per minute. The result was a usable time of two hours per bottle. So all the oxygen would be used up after a maximum of 8 hours of climbing. Nowadays, 3 or 4 litre bottles are filled with oxygen of 250 bar pressure. At a flow of 2 litres per minute a modern bottle can be used for about 6 hours.
George Finch was responsible for this equipment during this expedition which also was related to his education as a chemist and to his knowledge of this very technique. He ordered daily education for his climber colleagues to become accustomed in the use of this equipment. The apparatuses were very often faulty, were of low robustness and were very heavy together with a low grade of oxygen filling. There was distress about these bottles in the mountaineers group; many mountaineers intended to climb without use of these bottles. The Tibetan and Nepalese porters nicknamed these oxygen bottles as "English air".
Expedition participants.
The expedition participants were selected not only for their mountaineering qualifications. It was also the family specific attitude of the higher classes of the British society and as well as their military experiences and professions. To the public, their military service and educational achievements were highly touted.
The mountaineers were accompanied by a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese porters so that the expedition in the end counted 160 men.
Approach to Mount Everest.
The journey to base camp primarily followed the route used in 1921. Starting in India, the expedition members gathered in Darjeeling at the end of March 1922. Some participants had arrived one month earlier to organize and recruit porters. The journey started on 26 March for most participants. Crawford and Finch stayed a couple more days to organize transportation for the oxygen systems. These items had arrived too late in Kolkata when the main travel started in Darjeeling. This further organisation went well and further transportation of the bottles was without incident.
For the journey through Tibet they had a travelling permit from the Dalai Lama. From Darjeeling the route went to Kalimpong, then Phari Dzong and further to Kampa Dzong which they reached on 11 April. Here the group rested for three days so that Finch and Crawford could catch up to the team with the oxygen bottles. Then they went to Shelkar Dzong, then north to the Rongbuk Monastery and to the spot where they wanted to erect base camp. To promote the process of acclimatization the participants changed their travelling methods between walking and horse riding. On 1 May, they reached the lower end of the Rongbuk Glacier, the site of base camp.
Planned climbing route.
For the British expeditions before World War II, Everest was only climbable from the north out of Tibet as the southern side in Nepal was closed to Western foreigners at the time. Mallory had discovered a "makeable" route in 1921 from the Lhakpa La to the north face of the mountain and further to the summit. This route begins at the Rongbuk Glacier, then leads through the rough valley of the eastern Rongbuk Glacier and then to the icy eastern slopes of the North Col. From there the exposed ridges of North Ridge and Northeast Ridge allow an access in direction of the summit pyramid. A severe but unknown obstacle (unknown in these days) and a climbing hindrance was the so-called Second Step at , one of the three ridge elevations on the upper northeast ridge. This step is approximately 30m high and has a slope of more than 70 degrees, with an ending wall of nearly seven vertical metres. From there the ridge route leads to the summit, by lengthy but gentle slopes. (The first official successful climb on this route was the Chinese ascent of 1960.) Alternatively the British checked a route via the north wall flanks of the mountain and to ascend by the later so called Norton Couloir to the Third Step and to the summit. (By this very route Reinhold Messner first went in his 1980 solo ascent.)
Summit attempts.
The base camp area in the Rongbuk Valley as well as the upper east Rongbuk Glacier were known from the 1921 reconnaissance expedition but nobody had yet gone along the eastern Rongbuk Glacier valley. So on 5 May, Strutt, Longstaff, Morshead and Norton tried a first intensive reconnaissance of this very valley. The Advanced Base Camp (ABC) was erected on the upper end of the glacier below icy slopes of the North Col at . Between the base camp and the advanced base camp they erected two intermediate camps: camp I at and Camp II at . The erection and the feeding of these camps was supported by local farmers who only could help for a short time as their own farms needed work. Longstaff became exhausted in managing the organisation and transporting tasks and became so ill that he could not do any real mountaineering activities later on in the expedition.
On 10 May Mallory and Somervell left base camp to erect Camp IV on the North Col. They arrived in Camp II only two and a half hours later. On 11 May they started to climb on the North Col. This camp was at a height of 7000 m and was supported with food. The further plan was to do a first ascent trial by Mallory and Somervell without supplemental oxygen, then followed by a second climb by Finch and Norton with oxygen. However, these plans failed as a majority of the climbers became ill. So the (more or less) healthy climbers Mallory, Somervell, Norton and Morshead should do a common climb.
First: Without oxygen.
This first try was done by Mallory, Somervell, Norton and Morshead without oxygen, and was supported by nine porters. They started 19 May from Camp III. They climbed at 8:45 a.m. to the North Col. The day was nice and sunny according to Mallory. Around 1 p.m. they erected the tents. The following day the climbers intended to carry only the minimum stuff: two of the smallest tents, two double sleeping bags, food for 36 hours, a gas cooking system and two thermos bottles for drinks. The porters were with three persons per tent and they were in good health at this point in time.
The following day, 20 May, Mallory was awake around 5:30 a.m. and inspired the group to start the day. The porters had slept badly the night before, as the tents provided inadequate air flow and let little oxygen into them. Only five of them intended to go up higher on the mountain. As there were also problems in preparing the food they started the further climb around 7 a.m. However, the weather worsened and the temperature fell dramatically. Above the North Col they climbed on unknown territory. Never before had any mountaineer climbed on the summit slopes of such a mountain. The porters had no warm clothing and shivered excessively. As the hammering efforts for steps into the icy slopes was severe because of the hard ice surface they dropped their plan to erect a camp at . They only went to 7600 m (which is common also for today) and erected a small camp which was named Camp V. Somervell and Morshead could erect their tent quite upright but Mallory and Norton had to use an uncomfortable slope some 50 metres beside them. The porters were sent down the mountain. 
On 21 May the four mountaineers left their sleeping bags around 6:30 a.m. and were ready to go around 8 a.m. During preparation a rucksack with food fell down the mountain. Morshead, who had to fight the cold, was able to regain this rucksack but he was so exhausted from this action that he could not go higher. The climb of Mallory, Somervell and Norton was along the north ridge in direction of the upper northeast ridge. The circumstances were not ideal ones as a light snowfall began to cover the mountain. According to Mallory the snow ramps were not hard to climb. Shortly after 2 p.m. the mountaineers decided to turn around. They were 150 m below the ridge. The gained height was which was a world record in climbing. Around 4 p.m. they got back to Morshead in the last camp and climbed down with him. There was nearly an accident as all mountaineers except Mallory began to slip. However, Mallory was able to secure them by his rope and ice axe. They got back to Camp V in the dark and over a dangerous area of crevasses above the camp. On 22 May they started to climb down from North Col at 6 a.m.
Second: With oxygen.
The second climb was done by George Ingle Finch, Geoffrey Bruce and the Gurkha officer Tejbir with oxygen support. After Finch had gained back his health he stated that no real mountaineer beneath his abilities was available. So he searched for other persons who would be fit enough for a climb. Bruce and Tejbir seemed to be qualified next. In the days before the oxygen bottles had been transported to Camp III so that enough bottles were available on the upper slopes. The three mountaineers went to camp III on 20 May, checked the bottles and found them in a good state. 
On 24 May they climbed to the North Col together with Noel. There Finch, Bruce and Tejbir began at 8 a.m. the following day to climb via the north ridge and on to the northeast ridge. The extreme wind was quite a hindrance the entire climb. Twelve porters transported the bottles and the other equipment. In doing this again it was evident that the use of oxygen was a great help. The three mountaineers could climb much faster than the porters opposite to their heavier loads. As the wind grew intense they erected camp at . The following day 26 May the weather worsened and the group could climb no further.
They again climbed on 27 May. At this point the food was nearly exhausted as such a long lasting climb had not been planned. Nevertheless, they started at 6:30 a.m with the sun shining but climbing was hindered by a steadily increasing wind. Tejbir who had no suitable clothing against the wind grew slow and slower and broke down at . Finch and Bruce sent him back to the camp and again climbed to the northeast ridge but they were no longer connected by a rope. At Finch changed the route because of the severe wind conditions and they entered the north wall flank into the direction of the steep couloir later named "Norton Couloir". They made good progress horizontally but they gained no further elevation. At 8326 m Bruce had a problem with the oxygen system. Finch determined that Bruce was exhausted and so they turned back. During this climb the height record was broken again. At 4 p.m. the mountaineers got back to the Camp on the North Col, and 1½ hours later they were back at Camp III on the upper Eastern Rongbuk Glacier.
Third: Avalanche kills 7.
In the medical opinion of Longstaff they should not make a third try as all mountaineers were exhausted or ill. However, Somervell and Wakefield saw no big risks and a third try was undertaken.
On 3 June Mallory, Somervell, Finch, Wakefield and Crawford started with 14 porters at base camp. Finch had to quit in Camp I. The others arrived in Camp III on 5 June and spent one day there. Mallory had been impressed by the power of Finch, who in the second attempt had climbed much higher in the direction of the summit and also was nearer to the summit in horizontal distance. Mallory now also wanted to use oxygen.
7 June Mallory, Somervell and Crawford led the porters through the icy slopes of North Col. The 17 men had built four groups, in each they were connected by ropes. The European mountaineers were in the first group and compacted the snow. Half way a piece of snow became loose. Mallory, Somervell and Crawford were slightly buried under snow but managed to free themselves. The group behind them instead was hit by 30m of heavy snow by this avalanche, and the other nine porters in two groups fell into a crevasse and were buried under huge snow masses. Two porters were dug out of the snow, six other porters were dead, and one porter could not be retrieved dead or alive. This accident was the end of the climbing and marked the end of this expedition. 
Mallory had made a mistake not to go straight up on the icy slopes but instead try lesser slopes in curves. So the groups caused an avalanche. 
On 2 August all expedition members were back in Darjeeling.
After the expedition.
After their journey back to England Mallory and Finch toured the country making presentations on the expedition. This journey had two goals. First, interested audience should get information on the expedition and the results. Second, with the financial results of this journey another expedition should be financed. Mallory additionally made a three month trip to the United States. During this travel Mallory was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. His answer: ""Because it is there"". The intended 1923 expedition to Mount Everest was delayed by financial and organizational reasons. Beneath some other circumstances there was insufficient time to prepare another expedition the following year.
The movie which was recorded by Noel during this expedition was also published. "Climbing Mount Everest" was shown for ten weeks in Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall.
The expedition members received for their efforts the Olympic medal in alpinism at the 1924 Summer Olympic Games. To each of the 13 participants Pierre de Coubertin handed over a Silver Medal with gold overlay.

Leaving Springfield

Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture is a non-fiction compilation work analyzing the effect of the television program "The Simpsons" on society, edited by John Alberti. The book was published in 2004 by Wayne State University Press. Contributors to the work include academics associated with Northern Kentucky University, the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, The Australian National University, and the University of Sydney.
The book discusses the nature of "The Simpsons", and its impact on society from the perspective of popular culture and that of political satire. The work received a positive review from Luke E. Saladin of Scripps Howard News Service for the breadth of issues discussed in the book, and was criticized by Cathlena Martin in a review in the journal "ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies" for a lack of discussion and analysis of gender issues and the role of women in the television series.
Authors.
John Alberti, the editor of the work, is also the writer of the book's introduction. Alberti teaches American literature and critical studies at Northern Kentucky University, where he is an associate professor of English. Alberti notes that there is a distinction between poking fun at something and satire: "Satire involves defining a kind of moral or political point of view and using humor to show how it's not living up to this ethical standard." Alberti told CanWest News Service that rather than the Fox Network, the most valuable database for information on "The Simpsons" when doing research for the book was "an online archive established, maintained and vetted by unpaid Simpsons enthusiasts". Other contributors include David L. G. Arnold, who teaches English at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point; Duncan Stuart Beard, who holds a Ph.D. in English literature from The Australian National University; and Mick Broderick, Associate Director of the Centre for Millennial Studies the University of Sydney.
Contents.
The book analyzes the impact of "The Simpsons" – both as a popular television program as well as its use of political satire. "Leaving Springfield" discusses the financial success the program has had; despite often parodying the forms of capitalism it also promotes. Commentators in the book take a look at the use of parody and satire in society to critique itself, by discussing the impact of the television series on its viewership and its place within television comedy history.
Reception.
Luke E. Saladin of Scripps Howard News Service notes that an "especially popular theme in the essays" contained in the work is the fact that "The Simpsons" promotes its nature as a corporate product of Fox, while simultaneously denigrating the Fox network in jabs during the program. Saladin also notes that essays in the book discuss "The Simpsons"' "place in television history, its treatment of social issues and capitalism, and everything else from the Cold War and nuclear arms to what Homer Simpson's narcissism tells us about our own tendencies".
In her review of the book for the journal "ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies", Cathlena Martin is critical, and points out that the book "lacks a feminist study of The Simpsons", noting: "A weakness of this collection is that it does not address more gender issues and analyze the main or supporting female characters more. ... The lack of analysis with regard to the female members of Springfield is decisively missing." Jeremy G. Butler cites the book as an example in his work "Television: Critical Methods and Applications", when noting that "books on "The Simpsons" have become a cottage industry". An essay from the book on "Cultural Conflicts" is required reading in a sociology course on "The Simpsons": "The Simpsons Global Mirror", at the University of California, Berkeley.

Octyl glucoside

Octyl glucoside ("n"-octyl-β-D-glucoside) is a detergent frequently used to solubilise integral membrane proteins for studies in biochemistry. Like Genapol X-100 and Triton X-100, it is a nonphysiological amphiphile that makes lipid bilayers less "stiff". 
It has become one of the most important detergents for purification of membrane proteins because it generally does not denature the protein and can readily be removed from final protein extracts. Above its critical micelle concentration of 0.7%, it was noted as the best detergent for improving selectivity of immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine modified proteins. 
The compound gained popularity with researchers following the publication of an improved synthesis in 1978. However, in 1990 the cost remained prohibitive for large-scale protein isolation.
Octyl glucoside has been proposed as a conditioning agent to prevent microbial colonization of contact lenses, due to its ability to lower the hydrophobicity of contact lenses and prevent adhesion of "Staphylococcus epidermidis" and "Pseudomonas aeruginosa".

However other non-professional holders of the rank kept their much lower positions as company sergeant majors, etc. This major discrepancy cased a great deal of confusion.
Reform 1972 - Rank inflation phase I.
Prior to 1972, military personnel were divided into three categories "Underbefäl" (non-commissioned officers), "Underofficerare" (warrant officers) and "Officerare" (commissioned officers). The reform established a four-career-path system with four categories as described below and carried out major promotions of most personnel below the rank Överstelöjtnant. 
The "Underbefäl" category was split into two categories 
The "Underofficer" category was renamed kompaniofficerare to include
The "Officer" category was renamed regementsofficerare to include 
Reform 1983 - Rank inflation phase II.
All categories were merged into one professional officer category with the lowest rank set to fänrik. Furir, överfurir, sergeant and fanjunkare were removed as a professional ranks. Holders of the rank fanjunkare were promoted to löjtnant and the rest to fänrik.
New two-career-path system.
After the implementation of two-career-paths systems for officers 2008, this rank may again become a professional rank within the newly created “specialist officer” category. The intention of the new system is to better align Swedish military forces with that of Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Britton as well as increasing the skills of leaders of team, squad, platoon level units. It is a partly rollback to the system that existed prior the implementation of the one career path system 1983.

Crepidotus versutus

Crepidotus versutus, commonly known as the evasive agaric, is a species of fungi in the family Crepidotaceae. It is saprobic on wood, like other "Crepidotus" species, but it can also decompose herbaceous forest litter. The species is characterized by large, punctate, ellipsoid spores, and the white, hairy pileus.
The specific epithet "versutus" is derived from the Latin word "versut" (clever), which may be a reference to the ability of the fungus to correctly orient itself for growth depending on the position of its growing surface. The basionym of this species is "Agaricus versutus" Peck 1878. Older, obsolete synonyms include "Crepidotus bresadolae" and "Crepidotus pubescens".
Description.
The pileus is typically 5–14 mm in diameter, initially resupinate, then later turned up. It is attached dorsally or laterally to the substrate. Fan- or kidney-shaped, it is dry, white, and covered with a layer of soft hairs which may or may not be matted. The outer edge is rolled slightly inwards. The context is thin, soft, and white. Both the odor and taste of this mushroom are mild.
The gills radiate from an eccentric or lateral point of attachment, medium broad, and tend to swell in the middle. The gill spacing is sub-distant, with many short gills (lamellulae) that do not reach the attachment point. The gills are initially white, then later tinged a rusty-brown color. The spore print is cinnamon-brown in color.
This species has no stipe, although it may have a small tubercle attaching it to its growing surface.
Microscopic features.
The basidiospores are 7–11 x 4.5–6 µm in size, ellipsoid in shape, marked with very small spots, and yellowish to yellowish-brown under microscopic view. Basidia are 27–32 x 6–7 µm and 4-spored. Pleurocystidia are absent. The cheilocystidia are 22–63 x 3–12 µm, cylindric, and either swelling in the middle, or bottle-shaped. The gill trama are interwoven or at times subparallel, the hyphae 4–7 µm in diameter. The generative tissue below the hymenium (subhymenium) is arranged in a parallel fashion. The cuticle (the outer layer of the fruiting body) is made of dense interwoven hyphae, connected to a tuft of colorless, long, slender (2.5–5 µm diameter) hyphae. There are no clamp connections in the epicuticular hyphae, but there are on the hyphae of the tomentum at the base of the pileus.
Habitat and distribution.
This species may usually be found on the bark of deciduous wood in damp, shaded places. In the Pacific Northwest, it is known to grow on "Abies", "Acer" and "Populus" trees.
Similar species.
"Crepidotus applanatus", the so-called "flat crep", is larger, with a shell-shaped cap, more closely spaced gills, and has conspicuous white mycelial threads at the point of attachment. "C. herbarum" has smaller spores and a pale-yellowish spore print.

Futian Railway Station

"For the Metro station, see Futian Station (Metro)."
Futian Station () is a station under construction of Guangshen'gang XRL. It is located between Fuzhong 3 Road and Shen Nan Rd, in Futian District, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People Republic of China. Once completed it will become the largest high speed railway station built completely underground. This allows for a location in the geographical heart of Futian District, Shenzhen. It will offer connections to Kowloon in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Zhengzhou and Beijing.
This station will serve as the terminus of many high speed intercity services from across Mainland China. Through high speed trains will continue to Hong Kong, with a high speed commuter service linking the Futian CBD with Kowloon.
Structure.
As Asia's largest underground railway station, it is 1023m long and 78.86m wide, constructed by open-cut method to a depth of 32m. It consists of three subterranean levels. The first level is a transfer concourse allowing for access to both the Metro services and high speed long distance trains. Business and VIP lounges will be available, plus customs and immigration facilities for cross border services to Hong Kong.
The second level contains the Futian Metro Station, which allows for access to the commuter Line 3 (Longgang Line), Line 2 (Shekou Line) and the future Line 11 (Airport Line).
The lowest level is where the high speed train platforms will be located. Cross-Border Shuttle services to Hong Kong's West Kowloon Railway Station will separated from long distance services to such destinations as Beijing and Shanghai
Services.
Cross-border services to Hong Kong will have a travel time of only 15 minutes, quicker than the 45 minute journey via the Hong Kong MTR. High speed rail services by 'G' numbered Intercity trains will travel to Beijing and Xi'an in a time of about 9 hours.
All other Shenzhen's trains are served elsewhere. Less expensive D-series trains to Guangzhou, as well as various "conventional" trains to destinations throughout China leave from Shenzhen Railway Station; there is also a much less busy Shenzhen West Railway Station. Shenzhen East Railway Station opened in December 2012 to handle regional services and connected to Shenzhen North on the soon to be completed Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen High-Speed Railway.

The Villa Mettlen is a country estate in the municipality of Muri bei Bern in the Canton of Bern in Switzerland.
The first documented evidence of Mettlengut is in 1650. The first Lord was Samuel Ougspurger, who was married to Jacqueline de Graffenried. Around 1750, Johann Albrecht von Steiger improved the estate with money and artistic flair, as have other owners who have left their mark, most notably Count Karl Friedrich von Pourtalès in the 19th century.
In the 1960s, then current owner César Gustav Tauber sold the estate to the municipality of Muri, on condition that it be remodeled into a cultural center.
Since 1970, the villa has been the headquarters of the Muri-Gümligen music school. The ground floor and vaulted cellars can be rented for private events such as birthday parties, corporate conferences or weddings.

Zhao Zongru

Zhao Zongru (趙宗儒) (746 – October 18, 832), courtesy name Bingwen (秉文), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong — and then served under five more descendants of Emperor Dezong's: his son Emperor Shunzong, his grandson Emperor Xianzong, his great-grandson Emperor Muzong, and his great-great-grandsons Emperor Jingzong and Emperor Wenzong.
Background.
Zhao Zongru was born in 746, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Deng Prefecture (鄧州, in modern Nanyang, Henan) and traced its ancestry to the Northern Wei general Zhao Tong (趙彤). Other male-line ancestors of Zhao Zongru's served as officials under Northern Wei, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty, including his father Zhao Hua (趙驊).
Service under Emperor Dezong.
Zhao Zongru passed the imperial examinations and was made a scribe at Hongwen Pavilion (弘文館). He served there for over a year, and, because his writing skills were considered excellent, was made the treasurer at Luhun County (陸渾, in modern Luoyang, Henan). Just several months later, he was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as "You Shiyi" (右拾遺), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng"), as well as an imperial scholar. On the same day that the received these commissions, his father Zhao Hua was promoted to be the deputy director of the archival bureau (秘書省), and it was said that their commissions were named the same day because Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong, who was then emperor, wanted to honor their household. In 783, Zhao Zongru was made "Tuntian Yuanwailang" (屯田員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (工部, "Gongbu"), and continued to serve as imperial scholar as well. After his father Zhao Hua died later that year or shortly thereafter when fleeing Chang'an in light of Zhu Ci's rebellion (which also caused Emperor Dezong to flee), Zhao Zongru left public service to observe a mourning period for his father. After the mourning period was over, he returned to public service and successively served as "Simen Yuanwailang" (司門員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, "Xingbu") and "Sixun Yuanwailang" (司勳員外廊), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Libu").
In 790, Emperor Dezong put Zhao in charge of evaluating the officials' performance, and it was said that Zhao carried out this task diligently and fairly. Emperor Dezong approved of his actions and made him "Kaogong Langzhong" (考功郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs. He later left public service again to observe a mourning period for his mother, and after the mourning period was over was made "Libu Langzhong" (吏部郎中), also a supervisorial post at the ministry of civil service affairs. In 795, he was made an imperial attendant (給事中, "Geishizhong"). In 796, he was made chancellor with the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), along with Cui Sun. Virtually nothing is recorded in history about his acts as chancellor, however, and in 798 he was removed from the post and made a staff member of Emperor Dezong's crown prince Li Song.
After Zhao's removal as chancellor, it was said that he was careful in his action and all he did was attend imperial meetings when called. Emperor Dezong approved of his carefulness, and in 804 made him the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, "Libu Shilang"). When he met Zhao, he stated: "I know that you, Lord, have closed your doors for six years, and therefore decided to give you this office. Do you still remember how you were given commissions on the same day as my old subject (Zhao Hua)?" Zhao was so touched that he wept prostrate.
Service under Emperors Shunzong and Xianzong.
In 805, Emperor Dezong died, and Li Song succeeded him (as Emperor Shunzong). Emperor Shunzong put Zhao Zongru in charge of drafting the mourning text for Emperor Dezong.
Early in the "Yuanhe" (806-820) era of Emperor Shunzong's son Emperor Xianzong, Zhao was made the defender of the eastern capital Luoyang. He was later recalled to serve, successively, as the minister of rites (禮部尚書, "Lǐbu Shangshu") and then minister of census (戶部尚書, "Hubu Shangshu"). He was thereafter made the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) as well as the mayor of its capital Jiangling Municipality (江陵). While serving there, he released 2,000 soldiers who were not needed from their commissions. In 811, he was recalled to serve as the minister of justice (刑部尚書, "Xingbu Shangshu"). In 813, he was made the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Xingyuan Municipality (興元). In 814, he was recalled to serve as chief imperial censor (御史大夫, "Yushi Daifu"), but soon was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality. While there, there was an occasion when he was accused of wrongly spending money allocated for soldiers' salaries, and he was fined one month's worth of his own salary. In 816, he was recalled to serve as the minister of defense (兵部尚書, "Bingbu Shangshu"). Shortly after, he was made an advisor to Emperor Xianzong's crown prince Li Heng, but was also acting minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, "Lìbu Shangshu", note different tone than the minister of rites). In 819, he became full minister of civil service affairs.
Service under Emperors Muzong, Jingzong, and Wenzong.
After Emperor Xianzong died in 820 and Li Heng succeeded him (as Emperor Muzong), Emperor Muzong, as he was still in the mourning period for Emperor Xianzong, requested that the officials from the executive bureau (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng") be in charge presiding over the imperial examinations, rather than having him personally do so. Zhao Zongru opposed on the basis that this was against tradition and that there was no time to revise the examination method before the examinees would be forced to leave the capital. Emperor Muzong agreed. Thereafter, Zhao was again made an advisor to the crown prince, but also was acting as minister of worship (太常卿, "Taichang Qing"). In 821, he was made acting "You Pushe" (右僕射), one of the heads of the executive bureau, as well as minister of worship. Part of his responsibilities included supervising a musical corps known as the Lion Orchestra (師子樂, "Shizi Yue"), which was ordinarily not used except for the solemn imperial meetings and which used decorations of five different colors, representing the five directions (including center). With Emperor Muzong being young and frivolous, giving much authorities to his musicians, the eunuchs who directed the palace musical corps demanded that the five-colored decorations be given to the palace musical corps. Zhao did not dare to refuse, but reported this to the chancellors. The chancellors, however, felt that it was Zhao's responsibility to refuse this improper demand, and believing Zhao to be cowardly, had him removed and serve only as advisor to the crown prince.
In 825, when Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong was emperor, Zhao was made a senior advisor to the crown prince. When Emperor Jingzong died in 826 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wenzong, Zhao was made the director of Daming Palace (大明宮). In 830, Emperor Wenzong made him acting "Sikong" (司空, one of the Three Excellencies) and senior advisor to the crown prince. Emperor Wenzong summoned him and asked him for advice, and he responded, "The way of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun [(two mythical emperors known for their benevolent rule)] were based on kindness and frugality. I wish that Your Imperial Majesty would keep that in mind." Emperor Wenzong appreciated the advice. In 831, when the chancellor Song Shenxi was falsely accused of treason, Emperor Wenzong convened a group of senior officials to discuss potential punishments. Zhao was one of the senior officials summoned, but on account of his old age, Emperor Wenzong ordered that he not be required to bow. Soon thereafter, Zhao requested to retire, and in 832, Emperor Wenzong approved of the retirement after conferring on him the full "Sikong" status. Zhao died in the fall of 832 and was posthumously honored. He was remembered for having come to prominence due to his literary abilities, having served three terms as military governor, and having been in charge of selecting officials eight times. However, he was criticized for being not careful in the rites and paying too much unnecessary attention to details of life.

Erdős–Nagy theorem

The Erdős–Nagy theorem is a result in discrete geometry stating that a non-convex simple polygon can be made into a convex polygon by a finite sequence of flips. The "flips" are defined by taking a convex hull of a polygon and reflecting a pocket with respect to the boundary edge. The theorem is named after mathematicians Paul Erdős and Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy.
History.
Paul Erdős conjectured the result in 1935 as a problem in the "American Mathematical Monthly", and Szőkefalvi-Nagy published a proof in 1939. The problem has a curious history and had been repeatedly rediscovered, until Branko Grünbaum surveyed the results in 1995. As it turns out, the original proof had a delicate mistake, which has been since corrected.

Brian Burtt

Brian Laurence Burtt ("Bill") (27 August 1913 Claygate, Surrey - 30 May 2008 Edinburgh), was an English botanist and taxonomist who is noted for his contributions to the family Gesneriaceae. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation B.L.Burtt when citing a botanical name.
Education & Career.
Burtt, in a career that spanned 74 years, worked first at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and then at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE). He made numerous field trips to South Africa and Sarawak and described a total of 637 new plant species, of which the greater number were Gesneriaceae, a family poorly represented at the RBGE when Burtt started there in 1951. Members of this family are key indicators of habitat health.
He was educated at Dulwich College, excelling in Latin. After Dulwich he was employed at Kew as herbarium assistant to Sir Arthur William Hill, the Director. Here he learnt to work with dried plant material from all over the world, painstakingly dissecting and classifying. Burtt wrote his first paper in 1932 with the assistance of John Hutchinson, the authority on South African plants. This was the first of 384 papers, the final being published in 2006.
Another of his papers appeared in 1935 and was co-authored by the Director, Sir Arthur William Hill, dealing with two genera from New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, "Gaultheria" and "Pernettya". He took night classes in botany at Chelsea Polytechnic, and was awarded an external Bachelor of Science from the University of London in 1936.
No work had been done at RBGE on Zingiberaceae until the 1960s when Burtt and Paddy Woods went on a collecting trip to Sarawak. By the 1980s RBGE led the world in their extensive living collection of Zingiberaceae from Malaysia and Borneo, only being rivalled in recent years by that of the Smithsonian Institution.
In 1962 Burtt left Edinburgh on the first of five strenuous collecting trips to Sarawak. He made the first of 19 visits to South Africa in 1964, to collect and study "Streptocarpus". Here he made the acquaintance of fellow botanist Olive Hilliard of Natal University, and started a collaboration which would last some 44 years.
Their botanical collaboration was extraordinarily prolific, resulting in numerous papers and three books, "Streptocarpus: an African Plant Study" (1971), "The Botany of the Southern Natal Drakensberg" (1987), and "Dierama: The Hairbells of Africa" (1991). They revised the taxonomy of the twinspur, "Diascia", a South African member of the Scrophulariaceae. The diascias with which they returned to Scotland were noticed by the nurseryman Hector Harrison, who raised cultivars from this original stock and turned the plant in the space of ten years into one of the most popular subjects for gardeners throughout Britain.
Through Burtt's work, Edinburgh became an important research centre for Gesneriaceae, and led to the popularity in Britain of African violet and "Streptocarpus" as window-sill plants. Another favoured family were the Zingiberaceae, among which are ginger, turmeric, cardamom and some species of medicinal interest.
Honours and Awards.
In 2003 the "Edinburgh Journal of Botany" published a festschrift for his 90th birthday, including numerous contributions from friends and colleagues scattered throughout the world. An attractive tree-dwelling "Aeschynanthus" from Sulawesi, "Aeschynanthus burttii" Mendum was named in his honour. Burtt could transform quite readily from his customary Edinburgh tweed suit to a khaki safari outfit suitable for the tropics, at ease in either habitat.
Burtt was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Linnean Society of London, and a holder of the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society, the Linnean Society of London’s Medal for Botany and the Gesneriad Society’s Award of Appreciation.
Personal.
After the death in 2004 of his wife Joyce, from whom he had separated in the 1960s, Burtt married Olive Hilliard. He is survived by Olive Hilliard, and the two sons of his first marriage.

Royal Dunedin Male Choir

The Royal Dunedin Male Choir is one of New Zealand's oldest male choirs. Their repertoire includes popular tunes, hymns, operatic choruses, folk songs and traditional melodies. The Choir undertakes fee-paying and charity engagements throughout the Otago, Southland and South Canterbury regions of New Zealand. 
History.
The Choir's origins can be traced back to 1878 and the entertainment provided at functions marking the opening of the northern railway link into Dunedin. From this evolved a Liedertaefel Quartet which, in response to public demand, was to become the Dunedin Liedertaefel Society which was incorporated on 1 May 1886. Its aims were stated as "the practice and performance of music for male voices, and for the cultivation of a refined taste in that class of music". Its founder was Mr. S. Moyle.
In 1915 the name was changed to the Dunedin Male Choir, with the word "Royal" being added by royal patent in 1927, acknowledging three performances before royalty in 1901, 1920, and 1927.
The Royal Dunedin Male Choir from time to time combined with the Dunedin Choral Society (City of Dunedin Choir) in performances.
Audiences have included these notable persons:
Administration.
The Royal Dunedin Male Choir is administered by the Royal Dunedin Male Choir Incorporated, limited to and exclusively for charitable purposes, in New Zealand. The activities of the Choir are administered by a Committee, elected at the Annual General Meeting.
Patronage.
The Choir's constitution stipulates the Mayor of Dunedin is their patron.
The Musical Directors (Conductors).
The Royal Dunedin Male Choir has been led and inspired by many musical directors and conductors.
Beginning with the choir's founder Samuel Moyle in 1886, he was followed by: Benno Scherek, Arthur Barth, Raphael Squarise, Jesse Timson (25 years), Dr Victor Galway (17 years), Alfred Walmsley, William Francis, Ernest Drake, Charles Collins, Gilmore McConnell, Donald Munro, James Clark, Val Drew (a record 26 years), Harry Madden, Les Bonar, and the current Musical Director is Richard Madden (son of Harry Madden) who took up the position in 2001.
Accompanists.
The choir has been well served by 27 pianists since 1886 and, coming forward in time, have included: Edward Taylor, Chas Martin, Colin Oliver, Iain Kerr, Judy Faris (née Galloway) with a record 27 years service, and from 1994 to the present, Linda Folland (née Kydd).
Membership.
Membership of the Royal Dunedin Male Choir is open to male singers from all walks of life who share a common delight in choral singing.
The choir comprises four sectional groups; First Tenors, Second Tenors (or Leads), First Basses (or Baritones) and Second Basses. Following a successful audition the Musical Director will assigns a singer to one of these sections based on his assessment of the singer's vocal range.
Repertoire.
Over the past 122 years the choir has been in existence it has sung a huge array of different music styles and genres. The list is far too long to display here but has included traditional hymns such as "The 23rd Psalm", Negro spirituals the likes of "I'm Gwine to Sing" and "Kentucky Babe", and songs from the popular operatic musicals like "Phantom Of the Opera", "Porgy and Bess", "Oklahoma", and "My Fair Lady".
The choir also enjoys singing the big heart-warming songs such as "Gwahoddiad", "American Trilogy" and "And the Glory of the Lord" (from Handel's "Messiah").
The choir stages two major concerts in the Dunedin Town Hall each year: one around mid-year (June) and a Christmas Concert in early December.

Queensland Railways 1300 class

The 1300 class were a class of diesel locomotive built by English Electric, Rocklea for Queensland Rail between 1967 and 1972. They were later sold to AN Tasrail.
History.
The 1300 class was an upgraded version of the 1270 class with more powerful engines and larger fuel tanks. 
The class was primarily used on the Blackwater and Moura coal lines and based at Gladstone. The class became surplus following electrification of the coal lines in 1986/87.
In 1988 the entire class was sold to AN Tasrail where they became the ZC class. They were renumbered consecutively, 1300 becoming ZC1 and 1344 becoming ZC45, although 12 units were only used as a source of spare parts. Most had very short working lives with just 13 remaining in service by 1995 and only six by 1997.
Ten of the ZC class were sold to Morrison-Knudsen Australia in April 1994, with eight rebuilt with new cabs as the MKA class at their Whyalla, South Australia factory. Two were operated on the BHP Whyalla Steelworks network from February 1995, before being exported to Senegal. Four saw service in Malaysia before returning to Australia. These along with the unused two were purchased by Pacific National in 2004 with three returning to Queensland and three to Tasmania. By 2007 all six were in service in Tasmania renumbered in the 2130 series.
With the privatisation of Australian National, AN Tasrail was sold to the Australian Transport Network, with the seven remaining ZCs becoming the 2140 class. Most stored units were scrapped and the last was withdrawn in 2004. In February 2004 Pacific National purchased Australian Transport Network, including four stored 2140 class locomotives. Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia purchased 2142 and 2143 for a proposed tourist service, they were later sold to Senegal. In September 2009 TasRail was sold back to the Government of Tasmania. TasRail sold three of the remaining stored locos for scrap in 2012 and donated 2144 (formerly ZC19 and 1318) to Diesel Traction Tasmania for preservation.

Ulubrae was an ancient village about 50 kilometers (30 mi) from Rome, past the Three Taverns on the Appian Way, and at the start of the Pontine Marshes. It is known primarily for its use as a byword for a remote and empty location by Latin authors such as Cicero, Juvenal, and Horace.
Its use in this proverbial fashion is also associated with the 18th-century Scottish Boswell family's country seat at Auchinleck. Alexander Boswell inscribed a line from Horace on Auchinleck House—"what thou seekest is here, it is in Ulubrae, unless equanimity is lacking"—and his son James Boswell referred to himself as the "Master of Ulubrae".

Campro Production

Campro Production (CP) was a Cambodian film and Karaoke production company based in Phnom Penh that operated from 2003 to 2007.
History.
The company was founded in early 2003 by a group of film students as a company that imported Asian horror films. Heng Tola was one of the producers. The company was formerly the owner of Kirirom Cinema, which closed in 2007 and was turned into a nightclub.
Their first film, "Gratefulness", was inspired by the true life story of a young girl. The film has many similarities to Thai 1980s drama "Walli".
The next movie was a period horror film called "Neang Neath", which performed well at the Cambodia box office. The film was a remake of the Thai film "Nang Nak". The company made several Karaoke as well in this period, but discontinued in late 2004 to concentrate on making movies.
The next projects were successful horror genre films such as "The Forest", "The Haunted House", and "Ghost Banana Tree", the highest grossing film for the company.
Campro Productions received good press for their highly professional work and quality productions.
Despite the current taste for horror movies, Heng Tola believes a more serious trend is emerging, prompted in part by the resentment many Cambodians feel about their colonial past and toward domineering neighbours such as Thailand and Vietnam. The company produced some dramas and comedies, including "Gratefulness", "Motherless", "Mr. Moa", "The Wall of Love", and "The Painter"' (film) but most failed at the box office. "The Wall of Love" was pulled from the screen after being screened for less than a week. "The Painter" was a minor success at the box office.
Awards.
Some of the films, including "Gratefulness" and "The Forest", were nominated for awards at the Khmer national film festival.
Campro Films closed in 2007, amid declining film viewership in the country.

N-Acylethanolamine

An "N"-acylethanolamine is a type of fatty acid amide formed when one of several types of acyl group is linked to the nitrogen atom of ethanolamine. These amides conceptually can be formed from a fatty acid and ethanolamine with the release of a molecule of water, but the known biological synthesis uses a specific phospholipase D to cleave the phospholipid unit from "N"-acylphosphatidylethanolamines. Another route relies on the transesterification of acyl groups from phosphatidylcholine by an "N"-acyltransferase (NAT) activity. The suffixes "-amine" and "-amide" in these names each refer to the single nitrogen atom of ethanolamine that links the compound together: it is termed "amine" in ethanolamine because it is considered as a free terminal nitrogen in that subunit, while it is termed "amide" when it is considered in association with the adjacent carbonyl group of the acyl subunit. Names for these compounds may be encountered with either "amide" or "amine" varying by author.
Examples of "N"-acylethanolamines include:

New South Wales state election, 2011

Elections to the 55th Parliament of New South Wales were held on Saturday, 26 March 2011. The 16-year incumbent Australian Labor Party government led by Premier Kristina Keneally was defeated in a landslide by the Liberal-National Coalition opposition led by Barry O'Farrell. Labor suffered a two-party swing of 16.4 percent, the largest against a sitting government at any level in Australia since World War II. From 48 seats at dissolution, Labor was knocked down to 20 seats--the worst defeat of a sitting government in New South Wales history, and one of the worst of a state government in Australia since Federation. The Coalition picked up 34 seats to win a strong majority, with 69 seats. It is only the third time since 1941 that an NSW Labor government has been defeated.
New South Wales has compulsory voting, with an optional preferential ballot in single-member seats for the lower house and single transferable vote with optional preferential above-the-line voting in the proportionally represented upper house. The election was conducted by the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC).
Background.
The centre-left Labor Party, led by Premier Kristina Keneally, and the centre-right Liberal Party, led by Leader of the Opposition Barry O'Farrell, were the two main parties in New South Wales. In the 2007 state election, of 93 seats total, Labor won 52 seats, the Liberals won 22 seats and the Nationals, led by Andrew Stoner, who are in coalition with the Liberals, won 13 seats. Six seats were retained by independents. Smaller parties which hold no seats in the lower house but achieved significant votes in 2007 include The Greens and the Christian Democratic Party.
On 18 October 2008, four state electorates (Lakemba, Ryde, Cabramatta, Port Macquarie) went to by-elections as a result the resignation of the Premier, two of his ministers, and an independent who left after winning a federal by-election. The results in Ryde, Cabramatta, and Lakemba showed the largest by-election swing against Labor in its history. The results showed a significant swing towards the Liberal Party with a swing of 22.7 percentage points in former health minister Reba Meagher's seat of Cabramatta, but was retained by ALP candidate Nick Lalich, and a swing of 13 points against Labor in former premier Morris Iemma's seat of Lakemba, also retained by an ALP candidate, Robert Furolo. Ryde, once a safe Labor seat, with a swing of 23.1 points delivered former deputy premier John Watkins' seat to Victor Dominello. Peter Besseling, the independent candidate, won Port Macquarie, left vacant after the resignation of Nationals-turned-independent member Robert Oakeshott, over the Nationals by a two-party-preferred margin of 54.5% to 45.5%, despite a swing of 23.7 percentage points to the Nationals. On 19 June 2010 a by-election in the electoral district of Penrith was triggered as a result of the resignation of Labor Party MP Karyn Paluzzano, with Liberal candidate Stuart Ayres winning the seat with a two-party-preferred swing of more than 25 points, the biggest swing against an incumbent government in New South Wales history.
Campaign.
The Labor Party launched their campaign on 5 February 2011 in Liverpool within the electoral district of Macquarie Fields. Premier Keneally launched the Labor Party's campaign slogan "Protecting jobs – Supporting families". In attendance for the launch were former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former Premiers Wran and Carr.
The Liberal and Nationals Coalition launched their campaign on 20 February 2011 at the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre in Penrith within the electoral district of Penrith with the slogan: "Real Change for NSW". In attendance for the launch were both Liberal and Nationals Leaders O'Farrell and Stoner as well as federal Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott, former Liberal Premiers and Leaders Lewis, Greiner, Fahey, and Chikarovski.
The Coalition had been leading in opinion polling for almost three years, and were unbackable favourites throughout the campaign to win the election. The final Newspoll had support for Labor at an all-time low with 23 percent of the primary vote and 35.9 percent of the two-party vote. Bookmakers were paying $1.01 for a Coalition win with Labor getting as much as $36 and one agency even paid out the winnings and declared the winner a week earlier. At one point, Labor was widely predicted to win as few as 13 seats, seven less than the actual result. According to several pollsters, Labor was in danger of losing several seats where it had not been seriously threatened in decades, as well as several that it had held for a century or more.
Resulting parliament.
The Liberal/National Coalition won the largest proportional number of seats in NSW state history with 69 of 93 seats in the lower house – in contrast, Labor won 69 of 99 seats at Neville Wran's second "Wranslide" in 1981 election. Labor won 20 seats, the lowest for Labor in NSW Parliament in over a century, and the worst defeat that a sitting government in NSW has ever suffered. Many prominent Labor MPs and ministers lost their seats including Verity Firth, David Borger, Matt Brown, Jodi McKay, Virginia Judge, Phil Costa and Kevin Greene. In the process, the Coalition took dozens of seats in areas considered Labor heartland, such as western Sydney and the Upper Hunter--some on swings of well over 10 percent. The Liberals actually won 51 seats, enough for a majority in their own right--the first time the main non-Labor party in the state had achieved this since adopting the Liberal banner in 1945. Although O'Farrell thus had no need for the support of the Nationals, he opted to retain the Coalition.
In the upper house however, where half of the chamber was up for election, the landslide was not enough to deliver a Coalition majority. Three additional votes outside of the Liberal/National Coalition will be required to pass legislation. The balance of power is expected to shift from the Greens to the Shooters and Fishers Party and Christian Democratic Party. With two seats each held by the latter two parties, both will need to give legislative support if Labor and the Greens oppose legislation.
Retiring members.
Where a Member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council did not renominate to contest the election, their term ended at the dissolution of the parliament. Members who confirmed their retirement were:
Polling.

Stargate (production team)

Stargate is a Norwegian record producing and songwriting team, composed of Tor Erik Hermansen (born 14 October 1972) and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen (born in 1972), based in New York City. The team's genres include R&B, pop and hip hop. Stargate was established in Trondheim, Norway.
Stargate broke into the American recording industry in 2006, with the release of the "Billboard" Hot 100 No. 1 single, "So Sick", produced and co-written by the team and performed by singer Ne-Yo. They also produced and co-wrote with singer Beyoncé Knowles her worldwide hit single "Irreplaceable", which topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 for ten consecutive weeks. Throughout their career they have been noted for their extensive work with Rihanna, writing and producing three consecutive "Billboard" Hot 100 No. 1 singles with the Barbadian singer in 2010 and 2011.
The team has worked with various American artists and received mainstream awards including the Songwriters of the Year accolade at the 2007 ASCAP/PRS Awards and the 2009 ASCAP Pop Songwriters of the Year. They have also been named the Number One Producers of the Year on the Billboard Hot 100 Year End Chart in 2006 and 2008, and Hitmakers of the Year in Rolling Stone magazine in 2008. A documentary about Stargate, which follows the duo from childhood through to their careers in America, aired in Norway on 25 February 2012.
Formation and early works.
Stargate began in 1997 as a song-writing trio in Trondheim, Norway, consisting of Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen, and Hallgeir Rustan. When they first met, Hermansen was a talent scout for the Norwegian branch of the record label Warner Music Group, Eriksen owned a studio, and Rustan was a mechanical engineer before becoming involved in music. One of their first successful productions was with Norwegian R&B singer Noora Noor. Her first album "Curious" was produced in their Trondheim studio. Noora Noor was signed to the Norwegian branch of the record label Warner Music Group. Her main hit from this album "Need You" was released throughout Europe and gave Stargate attention from the UK music industry. While in Norway, they ventured into the British market, mostly writing songs for R&B-pop performers. At this time they called the team Stargate, a name specifically established for their projects in the United Kingdom.
The team's initial successes were in the British market. Stargate's first international success came with British pop outfit S Club, whose 1999 single "S Club Party" reached No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand. This success was followed with another British pop group, Hear'Say's single "The Way To Your Love", which peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom in 2001. The team has also produced many Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom for acts such as Blue, Mis-Teeq and Atomic Kitten, and worked with European acts Javine, Shola Ama, Five, and Samantha Mumba.
The team had been listening to American hits and "trying to measure up". They remixed American hip-hop and R&B songs, adding layers of melody to suit the European radio audience. In the wake of their early successes, the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals: "We knew that to make the records we really wanted to make, we had to go to America." Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan preferred to remain a producer in Norway because he did not want to leave his family behind.
In 2001, Stargate produced and co-wrote songs for American pop singer Mikaila's self-titled debut album. "So in Love With Two", a track from the album, had reached No. 25 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming one of the team's earliest co-written singles that appeared on the US charts. It was followed three years later with Mis-Teeq's "Scandalous", which peaked at No. 35 on the Hot 100 and No. two in the United Kingdom.
In the spring of 2005, Eriksen and Hermansen settled in New York. Initially, their work was slow until they met singer-songwriter Ne-Yo in a hallway at Sony Music Studios in New York. Ne-Yo, who had been working on his debut album, "In My Own Words", decided to collaborate with the team, aware that Stargate produced R&B records. After listening to each other's music, a songwriting session ensued and spawned in its second day the song "So Sick", which later topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 and ushered Stargate into American pop songwriting.
Notable collaborations.
Stargate and Ne-Yo collaborated on the hit single "Unfaithful" for Barbadian singer Rihanna's 2006 album "A Girl Like Me". In the same year, Stargate again collaborated with Ne-Yo for the single "Irreplaceable", recorded by American singer Beyoncé Knowles. The single topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 for ten consecutive weeks in 2007. Also in 2006, Stargate and Taj Jackson gave American singer-songwriter Lionel Richie his first R&B hit, "I Call It Love", in 10 years.
With the team's contributions to music, Stargate emerged as the No. 1 hot producer on the 2006 "Billboard" Year End Chart. In the following year, Stargate received a Spellemann (Norwegian Grammy). The team received three awards at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards 2007 in Los Angeles, for the songs "So Sick", "Sexy Love" and "Unfaithful"; and two awards at the ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Awards 2007 for "So Sick" and "Sexy Love". They were named Songwriters of the Year at the 2007 ASCAP/PRS in London, receiving nine awards including Song of the Year for "So Sick".
In 2007, "Beautiful Liar", a duet between Knowles and Colombian singer Shakira, became another hit for Stargate, reaching No. 1 in more than 30 countries including the United Kingdom. The song earned Hermansen and Eriksen the Ivor Novello Award for Best-Selling British song. Although "Beautiful Liar" is chiefly an American song, it includes British songwriters Amanda Ghost and Ian Dench, thus eligible for the award.
At the 2008 ASCAP Pop Music Awards, Hermansen and Eriksen received five awards for most performed songs, including "Irreplaceable" among the top five. Stargate was named Best Hitmakers in "Rolling Stone" magazine's "Best of Rock 2008". Eriksen and Hermansen received Grammy nominations for five separate songs in six categories for the 2008 Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year for "Irreplaceable", Best R&B Song for "Hate That I Love You" and Best Dance Record for "Don't Stop The Music".
On Ne-Yo's third solo-album, "Year of the Gentleman", Stargate have produced and co-written four songs, among them the singles "Closer" and "Miss Independent", the latter of which had reached No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Stargate received nominations in more than 10 categories for the 2009 Grammy Awards. They won their first Grammy in 2009 in the Best R&B Song category for "Miss Independent", performed by Ne-Yo.
Stargate produced "Black and Yellow" for rapper Wiz Khalifa in 2010, a song that reached No. 1 in the Billboard U.S Charts, and Sean Kingstons "Letting Go". They produced four No. 1 singles for Barbadian recording artist Rihanna including "Rude Boy", "Only Girl (In The World)", "What's My Name?" and "S&M". Stargate co-wrote and co-produced Owl City's single "Shooting Star" which was released on the "Shooting Star EP" on May 15, 2012.
In 2012, the first collaboration with the French DJ David Guetta resulted in the co-production of a track called "Right Now" performed by Rihanna, from her album "Unapologetic"
Other ventures.
Stargate teamed-up with American hip hop mogul Jay-Z to launch the record label StarRoc. The label, which is based at Jay-Z's Roc The Mic studio in Manhattan, will be a 50/50 partnership with the team and Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation. Eriksen and Hermansen's connection with Jay-Z, who was then the CEO of the record label Def Jam, began with the release of "So Sick". They met through Ty Ty Smith, A&R from record label Def Jam and a long-time friend of Jay-Z.
In addition to their new venture, Eriksen signed a global co-publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing. According to "Music Week", his relationship with EMI will further the publishing company's involvement on Stargate's future projects. Prior to the deal, EMI has been involved with Hermansen's projects for nearly ten years since he signed a deal in 1999. Hermansen and Eriksen will also continue their joint-venture partnership, Stellar Songs, with EMI.
Mikkel Eriksen owns part of the Norwegian clothing firm JohnnyLove which they are trying to introduce to the American market. On the American launch party in New York on the 12th of October 2011 Jay-Z came to show his support and stated to the reporter that he was "a little bit Norwegian, as I am sure you know".
Tor Erik Hermansen owns one third of the award-winning Norwegian St. Lars restaurant in Oslo together with international TV-chef Andreas Viestad and Face2Face-founder Per Meland. Queen Sonja of Norway and the Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg are regular guests. The owners have tried to bring some of the ambience from the New York-restaurant The Spotted Pig, owned by Stargate's StarRoc-partner Jay-Z, to the restaurant.
Influences and style.
Stargate chiefly produces songs in the genres R&B, pop, and hip hop. Hermansen and Eriksen grew up as R&B and hip hop fanatics in Norwegian suburbs, where most children listen to Euro pop and American rock. Their interest in music started in the 1980s with breakdance and rap. Eriksen and Hermansen were raised on pop music, growing up listening to music of 1970s pop group ABBA and Germany-based pop outfit Boney M. In an article by "The New York Times", Barry Weiss, president of Jive Records, who had hired Stargate to produce songs, "Those influences lend themselves to them making very melodic pop records, with great hooks and choruses." According to the team, they have always loved American music, citing acts such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Usher, Destiny's Child, and R. Kelly and the English band Depeche Mode as their inspiration. The team also cited producers Antonio "L.A." Reid and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds of the 1980s R&B band The Deele, and R&B-pop production team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as their early influences.
In their usual production style, Stargate first creates an instrumental backing track—also common in pop and hip hop productions—from which a collaborator would write lyrics and add vocal melody into. In an interview with About.com, the team explained their style:
We always start out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into creating a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.
Ben Sisario of "The New York Times" described Stargate's music as "sugary, lilting R&B in the Michael Jackson vein leavened with the kind of melody-rich European pop that paints everything in bright primary colors ... Their work carries on a tradition of Scandinavian bubble-gum artistry that stretches from Abba to Max Martin". Sisario added that, unlike other's producers in the United States, "Stargate signature is more difficult to detect, because to some degree the duo’s style is an adaptable method, not a specific sound". Steve Lunt, an A&R executive at Atlantic Records, pointed out, however, that "if you put a bunch of Stargate songs together you will see the thread running through them". co:wrote with Mike "Compass" by Lady Antebellum in 2013's single
Critical reception.
Stargate's works have received critical acclaim from mainstream publications. In a review for singer Jordin Sparks' self-titled debut album, "Rolling Stone" magazine music critic Sheffield praised Stargate's works, calling them "most of the other winners" on the album.
Critics found some of Stargate's succeeding works a replica of "Irreplaceable"'s musical formula. Sheffield commented that, in the song "Tattoo" by Sparks, the team "have no shame about churning out 'Irreplaceable' replicants forever", reprising the acoustic guitar-drum loop formula. "The New York Times" music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it "sounds like a cousin" of "Irreplaceable". The release of R&B singer Chris Brown's 2007 single "With You" produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that "Stargate was just trying to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of "Billboard" magazine wrote that "With You" "leans a bit too heavily" toward "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, "Hate That I Love You" was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, "Here you’ve got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... is hardly the new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh."

Sunset Lake (New Jersey)

Sunset Lake is a medium-sized reservoir located in and near the city of Bridgeton in southern New Jersey (Cumberland County). The reservoir lies mostly in the townships of Hopewell Township and Upper Deerfield Township. The lake was created by damming a stream that feeds to the area from above Seeley Lake. And a stream that feeds into the lake from the nearby Mary Elmer Lake also located in Bridgeton. The dam is located next to Park Drive, a major roadway that cuts throughout the city's park system and interconnects with Route 49. Just across the turnpike in Deerfield it opens over in the "Silly Pond". The water from Sunset Lake flows over the spillway dam and into the Cohansey River. Originally, the lake was known as Tumbling Dam Pond.
Sunset Lake (present day).
Sunset Lake is home to canoe rentals and a swimming beach (Stony Point Beach) operated by the City of Bridgeton Dept. of Recreation. The lake also offers picnic areas, a boat ramp (public access to Sunset Lake is provided from the Bridgeton City Park, just off of County Road 607) at Piney Point (a peninsula that juts out into the lake) and opportunities for fishing. People can kayak or canoe in the lake and carry their boats to the nearby stream that leads to the Cohansey River. Another canoeing option is the Raceway, a 19th-century earthen structure that was created as a mill race but since has been converted to recreational use. The Raceway meanders through the Cohanzick Zoo and dead-ends near Downtown Bridgeton (near the Nail House Museum). There is also a stream that one could take that feeds from Mary Elmer Lake (a nearby lake also in the Bridgeton Park System).
History.
Early History of area:
Sunset Lake was once the home of Tumbling Dam Park, situated at the southeast corner of Sunset Lake in Bridgeton. The Park was located on the shore of the lake and started out as a boat rental and pavilion area for picnics during the Victorian era. Eventually the park evolved to include early amusement park rides, like the one built by a local company called Pretzel Amusement Ride Company a bowling alley, baseball fields, concession stands etc. Notable celebrities of the time also visited Tumbling Dam Park; among them were counted the Wright Brothers, and Anne Oakley. The Park was damaged during the Flood of 1934 but was repaired, only later to fall into disrepair in the 1950s. The Park was eventually torn down and the land sold to developers who built houses on it.
Hurricane Irene in August 2011 caused the lake to rise and overflow its banks. Sunset Lake is now emptied.
Wildlife.
Sunset Lake is inhabited by various species. Many turtles reside in the lake's waters, including snapping turtles. Geese, ducks, and seagulls are the primary avian residents of the lake area. Aquatic residents include sunfish, catfish, and fresh water clams along with leeches.
Events.
The City of Bridgeton hosts events from time to time at Sunset Lake
Annual Pig King BBQ
Annual Triathlon
Various shows, concerts, and plays conducted at the Amphi-theater

ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating

The ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating is a figure skating team competition sanctioned by the International Skating Union. The World Team Trophy was held for the first time in Tokyo, Japan from April 16 to 19, 2009. Traditionally, the competitive skating season had concluded with the World Championships. 
The new event was announced at a news conference during the 2008 World Championships, in the hope of encouraging countries to develop top figure skaters in all disciplines. Each country sends two men, two ladies, one pair and one ice dancing entry, unlike the planned Olympic team event which will have one entry per discipline.
Competition and participants.
Selected skaters from the six countries with the best results during the season compete in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies singles, pair skating, and ice dancing in a team format. The participating countries in the inaugural event were (in descending order of finish) the USA, Canada, Japan, France, Russia and China. The Japan Skating Federation paid the global prize money for the ISU World Team Trophy in 2009. The total prize money in 2009 was 1,000,000 USD, the highest ever in an ISU event, with $200,000 awarded to the winning country. In 2012, the qualifying countries (in descending order of qualification) were Japan, Canada, Russia, the United States, Italy and France, with Japan taking the title. Prize money was once again 1,000,000 USD.
Reactions.
In 2009, there were reports that some of the participating skaters did not wish to take part in the event. Canadian ice dancer Scott Moir was quoted as saying that although the event was fun, skaters had been pressured to attend. U.S. ice dancer Tanith Belbin told an interviewer that she and partner Benjamin Agosto had not been aware of the event until after the 2009 World Championships. Evan Lysacek, who had won the World Championship shortly before the World Team Trophy, was quoted in the same article as saying he was excited and looking forward to competing in Japan as part of the American team, referring to the event as "icing on the cake".
In 2012, skaters expressed more enthusiasm about competing at the World Team Trophy. Daisuke Takahashi referred to the competition as "a lot of fun", while Scott Moir said it was turning into an exciting event, especially considering a team event would be contested at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

St. James High School (Philippines)

St. James High School (SJHS) is a private school under the Roman Catholic order, founded by the priests of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, located in Buenavista, Agusan del Norte and run by the Diocese of Butuan, Butuan City, Philippines.
The main campus of the institution is located at the eastern area of the Parish grounds, where a 2-storey building with 14 classrooms is located. It is the only Catholic school in the town.
History.
Saint James High School began as an elementary parochial school, St. James Elementary School, in 1939. After a couple of years in operation, war broke out, and the school was temporarily closed. When the war was over, the parish school was reopened, this time to answer the town's felt need for a secondary school, so that in 1948, the elementary school became St. James High School.
St. James High School is named after the town's patron saint – St. James the Great. It started as an elementary parochial school in 1939. After a couple of years in operation, war broke out and the school was temporarily closed. When the war was over, the parish school was reopened, this time to answer the town's felt need for a secondary school. By 1947, the school opened its doors to high school students and came out with its first batch of graduates in 1950.
It was largely through the efforts of Fr. John Ruyter of the Missionary of the Sacred Heart Congregation that the primary school was founded and through the efforts of Fr. Adriano Steejer, MSC, the high school. For the first five years of its operation, the principalship was held by Mr. Jose D. Cuyos with Fr. Martin Weistende, MSC, as the director. After Mr. Cuyos, the RVM sisters managed the school with Sr. Sofia Alaan as the principal. 
When the sisters left after five years, the running of the day to day school activities was given to Mr. Nestorio Cloribel as the principal, with Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, Fr. Jose Van den Berg and Fr. Andres Gysberts as directors – during the years of his incumbency as principal – 1956–1971. In 1971, there was a change of principal, with Fr. Andres Gysberts still as the director and Mrs. Necita Radaza-Lim principal. In 1976 the Filipinization Act was passed banning foreign nationals to run schools and business. Thus in June 1976 Mrs Necita R. Lim was appointed Directress by Bishop Carmelo Morelos D.D. while at the same time serving still as Principal of the school up to her retirement in 2005. On June 2005, Bishop Juan de Dios Pueblos appointed a new Director in the person of Rev. Fr. Loven E. Tutas, the young and energetic parish priest of Buenavista and an alumnus of St. James High School and a native of Buenavista. On June 2006, Ms. Aida K. Kuizon was appointed by the Bishop as the new principal upon the recommendation of the new parish priest.
From a modest building of light materials, to its present concrete one, St. James High School has come a long way. It is now the proud alma mater of the countless professionals, town officials, and respected leaders and members of the community of Buenavista and its surrounding barangays. 
It can now boast of its complete school plant – laboratories, mini-gym, canteen and students study court. After the painting of the school in 2002, with fund source coming from alumni and parents, the school is now working for its PAASCU accreditation. It is hoped that the parents, alumni, teachers and students will cooperate in this venture which will be their source of pride in the future. The school is very grateful to its founding fathers – the MSC priests namely: Fr. John Ruyter, Fr. Adriano Steejer, Fr. Martin Weistende, Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, Fr. Jose Van den Berg, Fr. Andres Gysberts.
They all have the welfare of the school at heart, from providing material help, to the spiritual and moral shaping of the students, teachers and the community of Buenavista who send their children to St. James High School and believe in the capabilities of the faculty in giving their children the best secondary education.
School seal.
69 years of operation meant St. James High School has revised its logo several times, considering its shift from primary to secondary school. 
At present, the institution fashions a logo with the "book", which represents knowledge, and the school's motto, "Vir sapiens fortis est" which in English means "A wise man's power is his knowledge".
School programs and campaigns.
Alay-Bigay sa Pasko.
St. James High School students made it a tradition to give alms and donations to the less fortunate during the season of Christmas by formulating an outreach program covering the entire Caraga region. They named it Alay-Bigay sa Pasko ("Gift-giving in Christmas") and has pursued the program for 8 years now. 
Each offering include: 
The outreach program has reached the remote villages and communities of southern Agusan del Sur and the towns of northern Agusan del Norte. This 2008, the program went to the Agusan del Norte Provincial Hospital where hundreds of patients received early Christmas presents.

Happy Ever Afters

Happy Ever Afters is an Irish film written and directed by Stephen Burke. The film was first shown at the Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea on 10 October and released on 21 October 2009 in France.
Synopsis.
Two weddings collide when both receptions are held at one hotel.
Plot.
The film opens with us being introduced to the four main characters, Maura a down on her luck single mother, Molly her daughter as well as Freddie and his soon to be bride Sophie. Freddie is remarrying Sophie after a recent divorce . The reason for the divorce is not initially disclosed. Meanwhile Maura is shown to be marrying an illegal immigrant Wilson for which she will receive €9,000. Both weddings afters are being held in the same hotel where all 4 of the characters interact.
Maura is shown to be in debt and facing eviction from her house which lead her to the rash decision to marry Wilson. While her daughter Molly is unaware of the scam and believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and she is getting a new father. Freddie is shown to be a nice guy who has OCD esque habits while his bride Sophie is very image conscious and selfish. 
Throughout the film Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters two immigration officers arrive to the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson.
Due to continually seeing Freddie and Maura, Sophie believes her suspicions of an affair to be true and flees the wedding. Sophie's dad a selfish bully, loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie believing him to be at fault for his daughter's sudden disappearance. Meanwhile Sophie is shown to be in Dublin in a pub with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous villain. Sophie gets drunk with her new friend while Freddie is frantically trying to find her.
Freddie at the same time is trying to keep his marriage afloat. Throughout the film it is insinuated that one of the reasons for the marriage breakdown originally was the bride's mental health. However, it is revealed that Freddie had a nervous breakdown as he couldn't deal with Sophie. Facing ruin and a pending divorce Freddie tries to kill himself by throwing himself off the top floor of the hotel. However just as he is about to jump, Maura steps in and talks him down from the ledge of the hotel roof. When he returns to the wedding both wedding parties have joined together and he meets a drunken returning Sophie.
They finally talk together and realise that their marriage is over and agree to part amicably. Freddie realises he has feelings for Maura and chases after her. Maura has left the hotel with Wilson and Molly. Maura believes that Freddie has reunited with Sophie when he appears and convinces her otherwise. They unite and kiss. Maura then manages to convince the immigration detectives that her marriage to Wilson is real. Wilson gives Maura her €9,000 euro and then leaves with his African girlfriend.
The film ends with Freddie uniting with Maura as Sophie leaves happily. Sophie's bully father is taken away in a straight jacket for trying to kill Freddie with an axe. Freddie and Maura decide to take Freddie's honeymoon together with Molly as the film ends.
Box office.
This film grossed €63,847 as announced on 17 January 2010.

Nine Mile Ride

Nine Mile Ride is a length of the B3430 road in the English county of Berkshire, running from the south of Bracknell to Finchampstead, in the Borough of Wokingham. 
Character.
The road connects several residential areas in east Berkshire, providing a scenic route between the M3 and M4 motorways. The straightness of the road has made it popular with motorcyclists. Authorities have imposed a number of traffic calming measures in response. Today, Nine Mile Ride is largely suburban in character, and includes a small selection of shops, pubs and restaurants. In recent years, a number of the older properties along the road have been either renovated and extended, or replaced. A large Romany Gypsy community exists along the Crowthorne section of the road.
History.
Despite its straightness, the Nine Mile Ride is not a Roman road but was built for King George III as part of an expansion programme to the rides built for Queen Anne to more easily facilitate hunting in Windsor Forest. It begins at the site of Swinley Lodge, the home of the Royal Buckhounds. The road lies almost parallel to the Devil's Highway, a Roman road running from London to Silchester.

Yunnan–Burma Railway

The Yunnan–Burma Railway (alternatively: Burma-Yunnan Railway) was a failed British project to connect far south-west China's Yunnan province with the recently established rail network in British-ruled Burma.
History and Politics.
The British project was working against the background of the successful French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway that had been established on the nearby Hanoi to Kunming route from 1904–1910, some 30 years earlier. To secure the rights to construction, Britain referred to Article IV of the Anglo-French Siam Convention for 'mutual privileges'.
Planning and surveying.
Maria Bugrova's article The British expeditions to China in XIX century discusses the question of a railway to Yunnan from Burma.
There are references in the 1898 British "Hansard" regarding possible construction of the line.
Archibald John Little's 1905 book "The Far East" mentioned the proposed route on page 124:
In 1911, Leo Borgholz, the US Consul General in Canton, published a trade report entitled 'Yunnan Trade Districts and Routes', in which he mentions that the British appeared to have shelved the project for lack of financial viability.
In 1938, Edward Michael Law-Yone travelled to Yunnan from his native Burma to see the proposed route.
Construction.
By 1938 construction had begun. In 1941 25 (meter-gauge) 2-8-8-2 mallet-type articulated engines were ordered from the American ALCO company, and American promised to supply steel for the construction effort.
An article by Royal Arch Gunnison published in the "San Francisco Chronicle" on Thursday, November 27, 1941 stated that American Engineers still expected "12 to 15 months to complete" the railway and described a Dr. Victor Haas of the United States Public Health Service as in charge of sanitation and malaria prevention.
Additional American personnel such as Paul Stevenson accepted commissions with the United States Public Health Service and were sent to assist with malaria control during the construction effort.
Abandonment.
Unfortunately, it seems that construction of the line was abandoned due to Japanese advances, and was never resumed. Burma's limited trading value to China and its internal political and military instability have probably been two major contributing factors.
Legacy.
Today the Yunnan side of the line lies in ruin. Though signs here and there attest to its presence, there is little actual rail left, and the line has all but vanished from local history and barely graces itineraries of all but the most determined travellers.
One such sign can be glimpsed opposite the ferry to Baodian, slightly south of Manwan in the far north-eastern section of Lincang prefecture. The sign records a tunnel from the construction, but the entry has long been covered over and there is no visual hint to the line's presence whatsoever.

This lead him to make up his own colours with earth, vegetables and other natural substances as his other compatriot, Armando Reverón, used to do.
Salazar was arts teacher at the Pedro Gual high school, at the Simón Rodríguez schoon and at the School of Plastic Arts Arturo Michelena. He also was the head of the Art Workshop at the Department of Humanities in the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Carabobo.
He obtained the National Prize of Plastic Arts of Venezuela in 1976. He won the Arturo Michelena Prize, the most prestigious arts prize in Venezuela, in 1948 and 1963. 
The Museum of Modern Arts of Valencia is named after him.

Jacquesson

Jacquesson & Fils is a Champagne producer based in the Dizy region of Champagne. The house was founded in Châlons-sur-Marne in 1798 by Memmie Jacquesson. The house makes the claim it is the oldest independent Champagne house.
The fame of the house grew following the rumour that it was a favourite of Napoleon, who bestowed upon the house a gold medal for its fine cellars. The Champagne house Juglar was absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829. By 1867 annual sales of Jacquesson bottles had reached 1,000,000, but a period of decline followed the death of Adolphe Jacquesson, inventor of the muselet, when the descendants ceased to continue the family business, and ownership changed hands over several decades, until in 1974 when it was bought by Jean Chiquet.
Today it is directed with brothers Jean-Hervé and Laurent Chiquet. Methods have changed to be organic, fermentation in oak is increased, new vineyards are bought in, but production still is limited to app. 350.000 bottles/year. "Le Classement" (Les Meilleurs Vin de France) awarded the house three stars (*** out of 3) in its 2010 edition 
Jacquesson vineyards are located in the "Grand Cru" villages of Aÿ, Avize and Oiry and in the "Premier Cru" villages of Dizy, Hautvillers and Mareuil-sur-Aÿ, with approximately 15% of the fruit sourced from growers in these villages as well as the "Grand Cru" village of Chouilly and the "Premier Cru" village Cumières.
The main wine is a numbered cuvée, for example Cuvée 733, which is a blend of 2005 vintage with 30-40% older reserve wines. Other wines are vintages, the best known from Avize Grand Cru and single vineyard wines from Ay, Dizy and Avize. All wines are characterized by elegance and minerality, due to an extremely low dosage (usually 2-5 grams per liter). On backlabel are indicated number of bottles produced, month of disgorging and dosage.
In July 2010, 168 bottles of champagne were found on board a shipwreck near the Åland islands in the Baltic Sea by Finnish diver Christian Ekström. Initial analyses indicated there were at least two types of bottle from two different houses: Veuve Clicquot in Reims and the long-defunct Champagne house Juglar, absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829.

Petar Gligorovski

Petar Gligorovski (Cyrillic: Петар Глигоровски; born: Perica Gligorović, Cyrillic: Перица Глигоровић; 1938–1995, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia) was a Yugoslav and Macedonian academic painter and an animated movies director.
Education and Career.
After receiving an education on Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade and specialization of animation in Zagreb, he started authoring animated films for TV Skopje from 1963-1968. He was the author of the first Macedonian animated film titled "embryo No.M". He was a leading representative of contemporary Macedonian animation, which is awarded at festivals in Berlin, Oberhausen, New York. 
Prior to his shift cinema, he was one of the pioneers of Yugoslav comics in the 1950s and a technical animator mostly working within the prestigious Zagreb-centered circle of animators. He created several movies, a number of technique-experimental unaccounted footage and left two unfinished projects designed under auspices of the production house "Vardar Film". 
The hallmarks of his movies, all of which are technically authored with polychromatic, predominantly biomorph shapes in recurring and subdued patterns, constituted a unique and recognizable style. Thematically the movies express universal combined mythical themes (birth, fall of man, apocalypse, phoenix), through broad ranges of visual allegories and metaphors. In some of authors works, documentary sequences were embedded, in line with symbolic augmentation of script's leitmotiv, rather than for reasons of visual appeal or exploration of technical limits.
Artistic Works.
Among his main works are:
-Na Vrhu, 1969 (art director, with Ante Šamanić)

Star boys' singing procession

The Star boys' singing procession, also known as "Epiphany singers", has children and young people walking about with a movable star on a rod and often wearing crowns and dressed in clothes to resemble the Three Magi (variously also known as Three Kings, Three Wise Man). The singing procession and the folk drama had its roots in an old medieval ecclesiastical play, centred on the Biblical Magi of the Christmas story in the Gospel of Matthew (Mt 2,1-28), appropriate to Epiphany.
The liturgical drama developed from the 16th century on, as it was performed by cathedral schoolboys, to become a more secular mystery drama, containing also some ordinary Christmas songs and carols.
The singing procession and play was usually observed each year during the period between 27 December and 6 January (the feast of the Epiphany).
History.
After the Reformation in the 16th century, pupils of the cathedral schools in Protestant nations conducted these processions to raise funds to replace the church support that had disappeared. The traditional practice developed differently in the north and the south of Europe.
Since then the Star boys' singing procession has become common in many parts of Europe (both in Catholic and Protestant areas) and in Russia.
The importance of the Twelfth Day and the feat of the Epiphany grew with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar as the day, according to the earlier Julian calendar, is also the Old Christmas Day. The custom passed further on to the general populace as a kind of narrative folk drama, but seems to have declined in its original form since the late 19th century.
Traditions of the Epiphany.
Epiphany singing.
The Star boys walk about from house to house "singing at the doors, with a star on a pole". The dramatic part is introduced by one of the Wise Men knocking on someone's door asking: "May the star come in?" If the offer is accepted, they are all invited inside. Then the whole procession will enter the home singing a special Christmas carol. Then the play begins.
In the performance, the Three Wise Men, Gaspar, Melchior and Balthazar, are first confronted by Joseph, who tries to protect the newborn baby Jesus (a doll) and his wife Mary from the intruders with a wooden axe. The three magi are however most welcome inside after saying that they have brought with them presents for the child. The Wise Men also have to mislead King Herod, who is also trying to find the new born 'prince' in the stable. Both Gaspar and Melchior fight the king and his men with swords, together with Joseph who uses his broad axe, while Mary nurses her son and Balthazar takes care of the shining star.
After the performance Judas comes to collect money or other gifts from the audience in a large bag. The young boys are usually treated to strong drinks and cakes afterwards. Then the Star boys leave the house for their next visit to somewhere in the neighbourhood, singing a song containing a farewell and many thanks for the received gifts.
Costumes.
The teams of Star boys, aged about ten to fifteen, are dressed in long white shirts and pointed brown or white paper hats,in imitation of a well-known picture of the Biblical Magi as Babylonians Balthazar carries the star and Gaspar and Melchior are armed with wooden swords. The other characters usually do not disguise themselves but also dress in long shirts, often in brown, green or grey colours and conical hats. Joseph has got a cylindrical paper hat and a wooden timber or broad axe. King Herod wears a crowns and he and his soldiers carry wooden swords. In the crowd there may also be shepherds with long shirts and sticks and some angels with white shirts and wings.
Star on a pole.
The star itself is made anew each year, using transparent paper on a constructed frame built of wooden lists and with one to three candles placed inside. The star on the rod has to be movable and turned around all the time, so that the paper does not get overheated and does not go up in flame.
England and Scotland.
At a synod in Konstanz in Germany at Christmas in 1417 the British clergies performed the Star boy drama for the rest of the participants at the meeting. They wore expensive costumes and had a large shining star. The performance was a huge success at the church conference and could have been one of the main reasons for growing popularity of the drama in post-medieval Europe.
The Star boys' singing procession in England seems later to have been mixed together with several other kinds of carol singers at Christmas. They do not go from house to house, but visit two or three local pubs to receive free beer. Nowadays they are not carrying the shining star anymore, but just a quadrangular paraffin wax on a long stick or even a candle lamp with an ordinary handle. Whereas religious folk plays are the norm in the rest of Europe, the British folk drama is absolutely secular, even if they are mostly taking place on the Christian festival days.
"Stjernespill" in Scandinavia and Finland.
In the Nordic countries the Star boys' singing procession is known all along the coast, though not often in inland communities. At the end of the 1880s many objected to this Catholic form of organized begging, and officials began forbidding the practice. By the 1900s it had largely disappeared, and there are now just a few places where the original play of the Star boys can be counted as an unbroken linear tradition, for instance the islands Amager in Denmark, and Haram and Vigra on the west coast of Norway, but the most famous one is probably the Star boys' singing procession in the small town of Grimstad on the south coast of Norway. 
Sweden.
In 19th century Sweden the Star boys started to join in with horse riding on St. Stephen's Day, December 26. Today they are only to be seen bringing up the rear together with bridesmaids and elves as a part of the Lucia procession on December 13. Recently school teachers, nursery nurses and Christian clergymen have tried to revitalize the play for small children, inviting their parents to come to the schools, the kindergartens or the churches to see it performed. But the popular and more humorous folkloristic elements of the play are often left out.
Finland.
In Finland, a version of the Star boys' procession originating in the city of Oulu, a musical play known as "Tiernapojat", has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide. The "Tiernapojat" show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as king Herod vanquishing the "king of the Moors", and a short song of praise to Tsar Alexander.
Central Europe.
In Germany and Austria the Star boys' singing is performed at or close to Epiphany (January 6) and has developed into a nationwide custom, where the children call on every door and are given sweets and money for charity projects of Caritas or Kindermissionswerk - mostly in aid of poorer children in other countries. 
A tradition in most of Central Europe involves writing a blessing above the main door of the home. For instance if the year is 2014, it would be "20 * C + M + B + 14". The initials was in earlier folkloristic literature interpreted as the names of the Three Wise Men (Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar). However, they officially refer to the Latin phrase "Christus mansionem benedicat" (= May Christ bless this house). In Catholic parts of Germany and in Austria, this is done by the Star boys, called "Sternsinger" (literally "Star singers"). After having sung their songs, recited a poem, and collected donations for children in poorer parts of the world, they will chalk the blessing on the top of the door frame.
In Kashubia the Star boys' ("Trzej królowie") singing is a custom as well.

See You in September

"See You in September" is a song written by Sid Wayne and Sherman Edwards. The song was first recorded by the Pittsburgh vocal group The Tempos. This first version peaked at #23 in the summer of 1959. The most popular version of "See You In September" was the version by The Happenings in 1966, when it reached #3.
Background.
Sid Wayne would recall the song's inception: "I was in the habit of going from my home on Long Island every day to Brill Building, on Tin Pan Alley meet with different songwriters there. We'd eat at Jack Dempsey's or The Turf Restaurant and then we'd go up to one of the publishers' offices and work in the piano room. We'd sit around saying to each other, 'What do you want to write today? A hit or a standard?'" At 11 a.m. on a Friday in June 1959 Wayne thus met up with Sherman Edwards: "he said, 'What do you want to write?' 'I'd like to write a song called See You in September,"' I said. We talked it back and forth and I think I may have contributed part of the opening music, but with Sherman it didn't matter, because he could throw me back half the lyric — that's how he worked. I think probably by two in the afternoon we got the song finished. It needed to be written; it was like boiling inside of us." 
By 4:30 p.m. that day Wayne and Edwards had reworked their composition, simplifying it so as to appeal to the teen demographic, and proceeded to make the rounds of publishers to pitch the song which, after one rejection, met with an enthusiastic reception from Jack Gold, owner of the local Paris label, who by 8 p.m. had telephoned the Tempos1 in their hometown of Pittsburgh. The group had been flown into New York City by the next day: Saturday. Sid Wayne — "By Monday the record was cut the Billy Mure orchestra, test pressings were Thursday, and by Friday the song was played on WNEW in New York. The thing took off like wildfire...Five hundred dollars to split between the two of us Wayne & Edwards...was a damn good week's pay in
1961." [http://old.dmagazine.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=5C1933F1D01C4247A724BAB13C6E670B&nm=test&type=MultiPublishing&mod=PublishingTitles&mid=7155F7796F354F21B1183937D847D6DF&AudId=29CB3DCAC7E94A08B642EC371FE6E70B&tier=4&id=233CD445200E41BFA4503C8F913DAA83]
In fact the Tempos' "See You in September" failed to become a hit in the New York City area and despite breaking in San Francisco in June 1959, the single did not reach the national charts until that July. Despite a subsequent swift ascent of the "Billboard" Hot 100, the single's momentum fell sharply at the end of August 1959 with a resultant #23 peak. Although overshadowed by the Happenings' #3 remake, the Tempos' version of "See You in September" did gain considerable currency in 1973 by virtue of its inclusion on the "American Graffiti soundtrack".
The Happenings version.
Bob Miranda of the Happenings recalls that he and the other members of the group considered the original version of "See You in September", which was "sort of a slow Cha-Cha be a great song and kind of a shitty record. We always looked for that. If you want to revise something and put your own sound to it, I think you should look for a great song that was not a great record."[http://www.classicbands.com/HappeningsInterview.html] Recorded in the spring of 1966, the Happenings" version of "See You in September" was produced by Bob Crewe for the B.T. Puppy label. The song's arrangement — by Herb Bernstein — recalled both the recordings of the Tokens (who owned B. T. Puppy) and the Four Seasons. Breaking out in Boston, where the track reached the Top Ten that June, "See You in September" accrued enough national support to enter the "Billboard" Hot 100 that July to reach that chart's Top Ten the second week of August 1966. Despite peaking at #3 the first week of September 1966, the single had enough staying power to remain in the Top Ten throughout the rest of the month.
That December, the Happenings were awarded a Gold disc for "See You in September"'s selling a million units. The single became a hit in Brazil, appearing at #1 on the chart for Rio de Janeiro in January 1967. In June 1967 the Happenings were invited to participate in the Sanremo Music Festival, where they performed it in Italian as "Aria de settembre".

Other versions.
During the period between the original recording of "See You in September" by the Tempos in 1959 and the #3 hit version by the Happenings in 1966, the song was remade in classic doo-wop style by the Quotations in April 1962; according to Quotations member Harvey Hersh: "Verve group's label released the record in August which pretty much destroyed any chance of air play."[http://www.thequotations.com/aboutthe.htm]
1962 also saw a cover of "See You in September" on the album "The Things We Did Last Summer" by Shelley Fabares.
In 1963 Bobby Rydell recorded "See You in September" for his album "Wild (Wood) Days". Also in 1963
the Chiffons recorded a version of "See You in September" for their "He's So Fine" album; the track was reprised on their 1966 "Sweet Talkin' Guy" album.
Mike Clifford had a September 1964 single release of "See You in September" but as the B-side of the non-charter "One By One The Roses Died".
In the UK, where the Happenings' single was released on Fontana Records in August 1966 and fell short of UK Singles Chart, "See You in September" was recorded the same month by The Symbols, a male quartet from East London signed by Edward Kassner of President Records specifically to cover the Happenings' hit. Featuring Keith Mansfield on orchestral arrangement/conducting duties, the Symbols' version of "See You in September" reached #19 on the Radio London Fab 40, without ranking on the UK Singles Chart. Distribution problems reportedly also factoring into its lack of chart impact, although the Symbols remained with President providing the label with successful covers of older American hits "Bye Bye Baby" and "The Best Part of Breaking Up"; and their guitarist, Mick Clarke, would be a founding member of The Rubettes. "See You in September" was also recorded by Gerry and the Pacemakers.
In 1966, in Hong Kong, this song was covered by local pop group Teddy Robin and the Playboys on their LP album "Not All Lies!".
In 1972 a remake of "See You in September" by the Mike Curb Congregation reached #15 on "Billboard"'s Easy Listening chart. Julie Budd also remade the song that year, with her version successful enough in Argentina to justify a South American tour in the spring of 1973.
In August 1979 a version of "See You in September" by Debby Boone was issued as a single to coincide with the release of the "Debby Boone" album (which did not feature "See You in September"). This version charted at #41 C&W and #45 Adult Contemporary. Also in 1979 Cisse (fi) remade "See You in September for his "Summer Party" album.
In November 1966, Olivier Despax (fr) recorded a French-language version of "See You in September" in London for release on Barclay Records. That same year the Spanish rendering "Te veré en septiembre" was recorded by both Marta Baizán and Kinita, while 1967 saw the release of an alternate Spanish rendering: "Setembre Está Lonxe", recorded by Jacinta.

Elchin Musaoglu

Elchin Musaoglu (Elchin Musa Guliyev; born Baku, Azerbaijan 11 July 1966) is a filmmaker. He spent his youth in the villages of Azerbaijan where he made theatrical performances with other youths. He accepted fruit as payment for tickets. The most favorite performance was the operetta "Arshin Mal Alan" by Uzeyir Hajibeyov.
His father Musa Guliyev was a professor of historical sciences and he was eager to see Elchin become a historian. However, Elchin has been dedicated to cinema and his father accepted that and never hindered him.
When 17 years old, in 1983, he entered Azerbaijan State Institute of Arts and Culture, the faculty of theatre directors. As soon as he completed the 2nd course he was drafted to the Soviet Army in Ukraine, where he spent two years. After coming back from the army he continued his education both in Azerbaijan and Moscow. The last year of university he spent at the Lunacharsky State Institute for Theatre Arts in the workshop of Mark Zakharov.
In 1990 he was hired by Azerbaijanfilm as an assistant film director. The first film he produced was "Leyli and Majnun" based on the poem by Nizami Ganjavi (1990). He worked in Azertelefilm from 1994 to 2004 as a film director and produced more than 30 documentaries and short films.
In 2004 he established RITM Production Company together with his co-workers. The company produced documentaries, short films and "The 40th Door", which was the first full length feature film in the history of RITM Production Company as well as the film director and script writer Elchin Musaoglu.
Peter Debruge from "Variety" said: "'The 40th Door' is no Hollywood-style rags-to-riches tale, offering instead a stripped-down neorealist fable in the vein of Vittorio De Sica and the strong Iranian films of a decade ago. There may be something overly familiar about such stories by now, and yet this one feels fresh and free from cliche, a touching portrait with the potential for modest arthouse returns.”
Elchin Musaoglu is a member Union of the Azerbaijan Cinematographers and the Union of Turkish Documentary Cinematographers, and a founder of the Society for Support of the Development of Documentary Films and Authorial Programs.

Health action process approach

Health behavior change refers to a replacement of health-compromising behaviors (such as sedentary behavior) by health-enhancing behaviors (such as physical exercise). To describe, predict, and explain such processes, theories or models are being developed. Health behavioural change theories are designed to examine a set of psychological constructs that jointly aim at explaining what motivates people to change and how they take preventive action. The health action process approach (HAPA) is a psychological theory of health behavior change. It has been developed by Ralf Schwarzer, Professor of Psychology at the Freie University of Berlin, Germany. It is an open framework of various motivational and volitional constructs that are assumed to explain and predict individual changes in health behaviors such as quitting smoking or drinking, and improving physical activity levels, dental hygiene, seat belt use, breast self-examination, or dietary behaviors. HAPA suggests that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors should be conceived of as a structured process including a motivation phase and a volition phase. The former describes the intention formation while the latter refers to planning, and action (initiative, maintenance, recovery). The model emphasizes the particular role of perceived self-efficacy at different stages of health behavior change.
Background.
Models that describe health behavior change can be distinguished in terms of the assumption whether they are continuum-based or stage-based. A continuum (mediator) model claims that change is a continuous process that leads from lack of motivation via action readiness either to successful change or final disengagement. Research on such mediator models are reflected by path diagrams that include distal and proximal predictors of the target behavior. On the other hand, the stage approach assumes that change is non-linear and consists of several qualitative steps that reflect different mindsets of people. A two-layer framework that can be applied either as a continuum or as a stage model is HAPA. It includes self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk perception as distal predictors, intention as a middle-level mediator, and volitional factors (such as action planning) as the most proximal predictors of behavior. "See Self-efficacy."
Good intentions are more likely to be translated into action when people plan when, where, and how to perform the desired behavior. Intentions foster planning, which in turn facilitates behavior change. Planning was found to mediate the intention-behavior relation. A distinction has been made between action planning and coping planning. Coping planning takes place when people imagine scenarios that hinder them to perform their intended behavior, and they develop one or more plans to cope with such a challenging situation.
HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Thus, one can superimpose these three phases (stages) on the continuum (mediator) model as a second layer, and regard the stages as moderators. This two-layer architecture allows to switch between the continuum model and the stage model, depending on the given research question.
Five principles of the health action process approach.
HAPA has five major principles that make it distinct from other models.
"Principle 1: Motivation and volition". The first principle suggests that one should divide the health behavior change process into two phases. There is a switch of mindsets when people move from deliberation to action. First comes the motivation phase in which people develop their intentions. Afterwards, they enter the volition phase. 
"Principle 2: Two volitional phases". In the volition phase there are two groups of individuals: those who have not yet translated their intentions into action, and those who have. There are inactive as well as active persons in this phase. In other words, in the volitional phase one finds intenders as well as actors who are characterized by different psychological states. Thus, in addition to health behavior change as a continuous process, one can also create three categories of people with different mindsets depending on their current point of residence within the course of health behavior change: preintenders, intenders, and actors. The assessment of stages is done by behavior-specific stage algorithms.
"Principle 3: Postintentional planning". Intenders who are in the volitional preactional stage are motivated to change, but do not act because they might lack the right skills to translate their intention into action. Planning is a key strategy at this point. Planning serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behavior. 
"Principle 4: Two kinds of mental simulation". Planning can be divided into action planning and coping planning. Action planning pertains to the when, where, and how of intended action. Coping planning includes the anticipation of barriers and the design of alternative actions that help to attain one's goals in spite of the impediments. The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, action planning and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction. Action planning seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well. 
"Principle 5: Phase-specific self-efficacy". Perceived self-efficacy is required throughout the entire process. However, the nature of self-efficacy differs from phase to phase. This difference relates to the fact that there are different challenges as people progress from one phase to the next one. Goal setting, planning, initiation, action, and maintenance pose challenges that are not of the same nature. Therefore, one should distinguish between preactional self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy. Sometimes the terms task self-efficacy instead of preaction self-efficacy, and maintenance self-efficacy instead of coping and recovery self-efficacy are preferred.
Psychological interventions based on the health action process approach.
When it comes to the design of interventions, one can consider identifying individuals who reside either at the motivational stage or the volitional stage. Then, each group becomes the target of a specific treatment that is tailored to this group. Moreover, it is theoretically meaningful and has been found useful to subdivide further the volitional group into those who perform and those who only intend to perform. In the postintentional preactional stage, individuals are labeled "intenders", whereas in the actional stage they are labeled "actors". Thus, a suitable subdivision within the health behavior change process yields three groups: nonintenders, intenders, and actors. The term "stage" in this context was chosen to allude to the stage theories, but not in the strict definition that includes irreversibility and invariance. The terms "phase" or "mindset" may be equally suitable for this distinction. The basic idea is that individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change. Thus, interventions may be most efficient when tailored to these particular mindsets. For example, nonintenders are supposed to benefit from confrontation with outcome expectancies and some level of risk communication. They need to learn that the new behavior (e.g., becoming physically active) has positive outcomes (e.g., well-being, weight loss, fun) as opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current (sedentary) behavior (such as developing an illness or being unattractive). In contrast, intenders should not benefit from such a treatment because, after setting a goal, they have already moved beyond this mindset. Rather, they should benefit from planning to translate their intentions into action. Finally, actors do not need any treatment at all unless one wants to improve their relapse prevention skills. Then, they should be prepared for particular high-risk situations in which lapses are imminent. Preparation can be exercised by teaching them to anticipate such situations and by acquiring the necessary levels of perceived recovery self-efficacy.
There are quite a few randomized controlled trials that have examined the notion of stage-matched interventions based on HAPA, for example in the context of dietary behaviors, physical activity,
and dental hygiene.

Heinz Knoke (24 March 1921 – 18 May 1993) was a World War II "Luftwaffe" flying ace. He is credited with 33 confirmed aerial victories, all claimed over the Western theatre of operations, and claimed a further 19 unconfirmed kills in over 2000 flights. His total included 19 heavy bombers of the USAAF.
Early life.
Born the son of a policeman on 24 March 1921 in Hamelin. On 6 July 1938, whilst watching an air display Knoke made his first flight, a fifteen-minute joy ride in an old transport aircraft and took the preliminary exam for entry into the Luftwaffe. On 15 November 1939 Knoke underwent flight training at No. 11 Flying Training Regiment Schonwald, nr. Berlin and in August 1940 attended Jagdfliegerschule 1 (Werneuchen) under instructor Flight Sergeant Kuhl, an experienced operational pilot who had already seen action in both the invasions of Poland and France.
War career 1941-42.
In early 1941 Knoke received his first combat posting, joining Jagdgeschwader 52. Posted to II Gruppe under "Hauptmann" Erich Woitke, his comrades included future aces Gerhard Barkhorn, Günther Rall and Walter Krupinski. After initial operations during the invasion of Soviet Russia in June 1941, Knoke was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) in July 1941. On 28 August 1941 Heinz married Elisabeth "Lilo" Makowski in Schieratz.
In February 1942, Knoke participated with 3./JG 1 in Operation "Donnerkeil", the Channel Dash of the German battleships and and heavy cruiser .
On 14 February 1942 Knoke was detached to Jagdgruppe "Losigkeit" (Fritz Losigkeit), charged with the air protection of these boats over the Norway coast. He returned to JG 1 in March 1942. On 5 March 1942 he shared in shooting down a Spitfire of No. 1 Photo Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), RAF. Its pilot, F/L ADM Gunn, was taken prisoner. In October 1942 Knoke became Commanding officer of 2nd "Staffel", JG 1. He claimed his solo first kill on 31 October, an Royal Air Force (RAF) Bristol Blenheim.
Against the USAAF 1943-44.
As the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) daylight bomber offensive increased steadily in intensity through 1943, so operations by the defending JG 1 and JG 11 grew in proportion. Knoke destroyed his first 'heavy' on his 164th operation, "Maisie", a B-24 of the 44th Bombardment Group, shot down over Zwischenahn on 26 February 1943. Two of the crew survived.
The problem of attacking heavily armed bombers effectively occupied the minds of the Luftwaffe in early 1943. "Oberleutnant" Heinz Knoke and his friend, "Leutnant" Dieter Gerhardt (killed in action against B-24s on 18 March 1943), developed the idea of aerial bombing as a means to break up the tight combat boxes, thereby compromising the defensively strong USAAF bomber formations.
Knoke claimed his fifth victory, a B-24 of the 93rd Bomb Group on 18 March over Helgoland. On 22 March, Knoke successfully downed B-17 "Liberty Bell", of the 91st Bombardment Group, with a 250 kg bomb, intercepting its return flight from bombing Wilhelmshaven. The B-17 fell into the North Sea west of Helgoland. He thus became the first of very few fighter pilots in aviation history to down an enemy aircraft with a bomb. All the crew were killed. However, the practice was soon curtailed, as the carriage of 250 kg bombs severely affected the high altitude performance of the Bf 109-G and also made the fighter bombers vulnerable to any escorting fighters.
In April 1943 I./JG 1 became II gruppe of the newly formed Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG 11), Knoke's 2 "Staffel" becoming 5./JG 11.
During 1943 Knoke claimed some 17 kills, the majority B-17 and B-24 'heavies' of the USAAF. 
Another B-17 (of the 95th Bomb Group) was downed on 11 June 1943. On 25 June 1943 Knoke was wounded in the hand by return fire from a bomber, resulting in the amputation of part of his thumb.
On 17 August 1943 while intercepting the raid on Regensburg he was wounded by shrapnel fragments and his aircraft damaged by bomber return fire. Knoke belly landed near Bonn, his Bf 109 G-6 written off.
On 27 September 1943 Knoke shot down a B-17, "Elusive Elcy", of the 94th Bomb group using "Werfer-Granate 21" unguided rockets launched from modified mortar tubes. Encountering the USAAF escort fighters for the first time, he also shot down a P-47 of the 56th Fighter Group flown by Lt. H.P Dugas, who was killed. Knoke was then shot down by other P-47s and had to bail out.
Knoke was shot down again on 4 October 1943. After downing a B-24 of the 397th Bombardment Group in a frontal attack, he was hit by the dorsal gunner's fire and Knoke bailed out of his damaged fighter into the bitterly cold North Sea. Covered by aircraft of his unit, Knoke managed to climb into an inflatable raft dropped by a Focke-Wulf "Weihe". He was rescued two hours later by a lifeboat.
Knoke claimed his 18th victory on 10 October 1943, a B-17, although his 109-G was hit by P-47s and 75% damaged, force landing at Twente.
Knoke was again shot down on 4 January 1944. 
On 10 February 1944 "Gruppenkommandeur" Günther Specht was wounded and Knoke became acting commander of II./JG 11.
On 4 March Knoke was leading II./JG 11, and was involved in the decimation of the 363rd Fighter Group. In a surprise attack on some 60 Mustangs over Hamburg, the USAAF lost 12 P-51's in a single combat, Knoke claiming one himself.
From 15 to 20 April 1944 Knoke was attached to the Experimental Station at Lechfeld, where he flew for the first time the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.
On 28 April 1944 Knoke was promoted to the rank of "Hauptmann", for "bravery in the face of the enemy", and made "Gruppenkommandeur" of II./ JG 11. At 23 years of age Knoke was, at the time, the youngest "Gruppenkommandeur" in the Luftwaffe.
Knoke was shot down on 29 April in action against the P-47 of Capt. James Cannon of the 354th Fighter Group and was hospitalised until August 1944 with severe concussion. Before he bailed out, Knoke managed in turn to shoot down the overshooting P-47 piloted by Capt. Cannon, who was taken prisoner.
Normandy 1944.
Still recovering from his wounds, Knoke was then transferred on 13 August 1944 to command III./ JG 1. Operating over the Normandy front, Knoke claimed a P-47 over Rânes, southeast of Argentan on 14 August,(of the 358th Fighter Group, piloted by 2/Lt.S.A. Giamalva, killed) and another the next day. On 16 August he claimed a Spitfire near Étampes. A P-38 of the 31st Photo Squadron (1/Lt.T.L.Wood KIA) was shot down on the 17th, followed by an unconfirmed B-26 later the same day. Two P-51s were claimed on 18 August.
On 25 August another P-51 of the 354th Fighter Group was claimed but Knoke was shot down during the engagement. Bailing out behind the fluidly moving front lines, Knoke was almost captured by French Maquis forces. Shooting his way clear, Knoke managed to regain German lines and returned safely to his unit.
By the end of August 1944 III./ JG 1 had been almost wiped out in the air battles over the Western front, and Knoke was ordered to move the unit to Fels am Wagram, prior to transfer back to Germany for reinforcement and re-equipment.
Given orders to then transfer III./JG 1 to Vienna, during a car journey near Prague on 9 October 1944, Hauptmann Knoke was seriously injured in the legs by a Partisan-planted land mine.
In March 1945, while still on crutches, Knoke became the officer commanding at Jever air base. He also oversaw the work on defensive fortifications around Wilhelmshaven.
On 27 April 1945 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ("Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes").
In September 1945 Heinz Knoke returned to civilian life.
Political career.
In 1951 Heinz Knoke was elected to the legislature of Lower Saxony as member of the Socialist Reich Party. Although the Supreme Court of Federal Republic of Germany declared this party illegal in 1952, Knoke remained in politics as a member of the parish council of the Gemeinde Schortens (Gemeindeparlament) from April 1954.
For several years he also worked as a Manager with the Jever Pilsener Brauhaus. 
He was member of the Freie Demokratische Partei (FDP, Liberal Democratic Party), and was elected for the community parliament/parish parliament at the elections of October 1956, and was returned to office in the March 1961, September 1964, and September 1968 elections.
He retired in October 1972 and in the mid 1980s joined Osnabrück University to study literature and philosophy.
War time writings.
During the 1950s Knoke wrote a book about his wartime career entitled "I Flew for the Führer" published by C. Boesendahl in 1952 (an English version was initially published in 1953). The book became an aviation classic, as one of the first quality narratives to appear in the West as told by one of the Luftwaffe aces.

Hen 2-47

Hen 2-47 is a young planetary nebula that lies about 6600 light years away from Earth in the southern constellation of Carina, the keel.
Hen 2-47 contains six lobes of gas and dust that suggest that the central star of the nebula ejected material at least three times in three different directions. During each ejection, the star fired off a narrow pair jets of gas pointed in opposite directions, eventually giving the nebula the shape it has at present.

Brownsnout spookfish

The brownsnout spookfish, "Dolichopteryx longipes", is a species of barreleye in the family Opisthoproctidae. It is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror, as opposed to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes. This species probably has a worldwide tropical and temperate distribution; in the Atlantic Ocean it is known from Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Pacific Ocean it is known from the California Current region and the South China Sea. It is found in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones at a depth of 500-2,400 meters (1,600-7,900 ft), but usually occurs below 1,000 meters (3,300 ft). In the Gulf of Mexico it is found shallower, at 310–460 meters (1,000-1,500 ft).
Description.
The body of "D. longipes" is slender, the depth 12.6-14.3% of the standard length. The head comprises 29-32.4% of the standard length, with a long, pointed snout. The eyes are cylindrical and face upward, with an accessory outgrowth to the side, and are covered with a silvery layer called the "argentea" for camouflage. The upper jaw is toothless, and there is a single row of small teeth in the lower jaw. There are 13 fin rays in the pectoral fins, 10-11 ray in the dorsal fin, 8-9 rays in the pelvic fins, and 8-9 rays in the anal fin. The pelvic fins are elongated, and there may be an adipose fin. The body is transparent, covered by thin scales. There are four pairs of blotches on the peritoneal cavity beneath the gut, a line of chromatophores below the lateral line to the position of dorsal fin, and two blotches on the base of the tail. The snout is dusky in color. The maximum known length is 18 cm (7.1 in).
Biology and ecology.
The diet of "D. longipes" consists primarily of copepods and other small crustaceans, though as food is scarce in the deep sea it may take anything it can catch. Reproduction is oviparous, with pelagic eggs and larvae. The larvoid juveniles and adults are covered in a gelatinous sheath. Flexion (the curvature of the notochord in the formation of the caudal fin) occurs at around a standard length of 13 mm (0.5 in), and metamorphosis at a standard length of 30 mm (1.2 in). The pectoral and pelvic fins form early, as does the stomach on the left side. Adult "D. longipes" exhibit paedomorphic characteristics found in the juveniles of other opisthoproctids, such as poorly developed muscles (for example the lack of ventral muscles, meaning the gut is enclosed only by the peritoneum and the skin), rudimentary scales and coloration, and the placement of the pectoral and pelvic fins on peduncles that are not connected to the body by muscles. Developed gonads have been observed in a 36 mm (1.4 in) male and a 40 mm (1.6 in) female. Their lifespan is 5 years.
Eyes.
"D. longipes" is unusual in that it utilizes both refractive and reflective optics in sight. The main tubular eye contains a lateral ovoid swelling called a "diverticulum", largely separated from the eye by a septum. The retina lines most of the interior of the eye, and there are two corneal openings, one directed up and the other down, that allow light into the main eye and the diverticulum respectively. The main eye employs a lens to focus its image, as in other fishes. However, inside the diverticulum the light is reflected and focused onto the retina by a curved composite mirror derived from the retinal tapetum, composed of many layers of small reflective plates possibly made of guanine crystals. The split structure of the "D. longipes" eye allows the fish to see both up and down at the same time. In addition, the mirror system is superior to a lens in gathering light. It is likely that the main eye serves to detect objects silhouetted against the sunlight, while the diverticulum serves to detect bioluminescent flashes from the sides and below.

Special needs dentistry

Special needs dentistry, also known as special care dentistry, is a specialty of dentistry concerned with the oral health of people who have intellectual disability, or who are affected by other medical, physical, or psychiatric issues.
Special needs dentists require an extra three years of postgraduate training after attaining their dental degree. They are then eligible for Board Certification by the American Board of Special Care Dentistry (Diplomate ABSCD) or Fellowship with the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (FRACDS (SND)).
Patients who require special needs dentistry form a diverse group, and may be found living at home, in hospital, in secure units, in residential or nursing homes, or they may be homeless or vulnerably housed. Their additional needs may be due directly to their impairment or disability, or to some aspect of their medical history that affects their oral health, or because their social, environmental or cultural context disables them with reference to their oral health.
In the UK.
Special Care Dentistry (SCD) is the thirteenth and most recent dental specialty to be approved by the UK General Dental Council (GDC). To date there are 73 specialists on the GDC specialist list. NHS consultant posts in Special Care Dentistry have been set up in some areas of the UK.
UK specialists in SCD, and dentists with a special interest in SCD, may work in NHS or private general practice, NHS community/salaried dental services or hospital dental services. People with impairments or disabilities who require Special Care Dentistry may seek a special care dentist by contacting their local healthcare provider (e.g. Primary Care Trust) or by obtaining a referral from, for example, their general medical or dental practitioner. Most SCD services have referral criteria which specify which groups of people they will accept for dental treatment.
Specialist training programmes are currently being introduced across the UK to provide training in SCD leading to admission onto the GDC specialist list. Postgraduate qualifications in SCD are available from institutions such as the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and King’s College London Dental Institute. There are also post-qualification courses available in SCD for Dental Care Professionals such as dental nurses, hygienists and therapists.

Friedrich Ritter von Röth

Oberleutnant Friedrich Ritter von Röth (29 September 1893 – 31 December 1918) was a German World War I fighter ace with 28 victories. He was the most successful German pilot at shooting down enemy observation balloons; 20 of his triumphs were against them.
Early service.
Friedrich Röth served originally in an artillery regiment. He was seriously wounded early in the war. Once he was again fit for duty, he was commissioned, in May 1915. He transferred to the aerial service, only to be severely injured in a crash. Because of his extended recuperation, he did not win his wings until early 1917. His initial assignment was to a Bavarian artillery spotting unit, FA(A) 296. At some point, he served in Jagdstaffel 34, but did not down any enemies until he was assigned to Jagdstaffel 23.
Balloon busting ace.
Röth did not enjoy any success as a fighter pilot until he decided to concentrate his effort on observation balloons. He was a poor shot, and took up firing upon balloons because they were a large target. He also loaded his guns to maximize his effectiveness against balloons; his left-hand machine gun would be loaded with 80 percent incendiaries and 20 percent armor piercing, and the right-hand gun vice-versa. His decision meant he took upon himself one of the most hazardous duties of World War I fighter aviation. Because balloons flew at a known altitude, antiaircraft guns ringing them were extremely accurate. The balloons were low enough that an attacker was exposed to small arms fire as well. Protective fighters also lurked in the vicinity. The balloons were so well defended because they were an important part of the artillery fire direction systems of World War I. 
On 25 January 1918, as a member of Jasta 23, Röth scored his first victories, downing three balloons in eight minutes. He shot down a British observation plane on 26 February and downed another pair of balloons on 21 March. On 1 April, he downed four balloons in ten minutes, to become an Überkanone.
Command.
Röth was assigned to command Jagdstaffel 16 on 8 April 1918, just four days after the previous Jastaführer, Heinrich Geigl, died in a midair collision with a Sopwith Camel. During this assignment, he established a reputation as a modest idealist, pious and courageous. On 29 May 1918, Röth became the only World War I pilot to down five balloons without assistance; there was only one other instance of it happening at all. The attack took 15 minutes.
He would go on to bag three balloons each on 13 August and 10 October, along with seven enemy airplanes on various dates. His most notable victory was over 16-kill Irish ace Sgt. John Cowell, whose 20 Squadron Bristol F.2b he shot down on 30 July 1918, killing Cowell in the process. Röth was also honored with Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Pour le Mérite, on 8 September 1918. Röth's last victory was on 14 October 1918.
Post-war death.
On 31 December 1918, Röth shot himself to death. He was reportedly depressed by Germany's defeat and the subsequent ongoing revolution, as well as troubled by his killings during the war. He was buried in Saint Johannis Friedhof in Nuremberg. His family refused to mark his grave because his suicide was considered a sin.
In 1919, Röth was posthumously awarded the Military Order of Max Joseph. This award knighted him, thus changing his name to Friedrich Ritter von Röth; it also entitled him to a lifetime pension. There is a street named after him in his native city.

Joža Karas

Josef "Joža" Karas (May 3, 1926 – November 28, 2008) was a Polish-born, Czech-American musician and teacher who located and made public music composed by inmates who worked at the Nazi concentration camp Theresienstadt during World War II.
Musical career.
Born to Christian parents in Warsaw, Karas emigrated to the United States in 1948 via Colombia and Canada. A violinist and music historian by vocation, he taught at the Hartt School of Music for more than 50 years. He also performed with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra until his retirement in 2006. He spent years searching for the WWII era musical compositions made by Jews in the Nazi concentration camps. 
In 1970 he read that some musical compositions and fragments had been found at the Terezin concentration camp and been donated to Prague's Jewish State Museum, including a version of Hans Krasa's children's opera, "Brundibar", which was performed at Terezin many times between September 1943 and October 1944. He conducted the North American premiere of "Brundibar" in Czech in 1975 and the English language premiere in 1977 after he and his first wife, the former Milada Javora (died 1974), translated the opera into English. In 1993 Channel Classics recorded his version as part of its "Composers From Theresienstadt" series.
Death.
Joža Karas died in Bloomfield, Connecticut on November 28, 2008, aged 82. He was survived by his second wife (Anne Killackey Karas), six children (Francis, Henry, Michael, Joseph, Alexander, and Joan K. Carrasquillo); seven grandchildren, and three siblings.

Metallo-beta-lactamase protein fold

The metallo-beta-lactamase protein fold is a protein domain contained in class B beta-lactamases and a number of other proteins
These proteins include thiolesterases, members of the glyoxalase II family, that catalyse the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid and a competence protein that is essential for natural transformation in "Neisseria gonorrhoeae" and could be a transporter involved in DNA uptake. Except for the competence protein these proteins bind two zinc ions per molecule as cofactor.
Metallo-beta-lactamases are important enzymes because they are involved in the breakdown of antibiotics by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Zurab Adeishvili

Zurab Adeishvili () (born July 27, 1972) is a Georgian lawyer and politician, serving as the Minister of Justice of Georgia from November 2008 to October 2012.
Early life.
Adeishvili was born in the village of Mtisdziri in Qvareli district, then-Soviet Georgia. He graduated from the Faculty of Law, Tbilisi State University in 1994 and continued his training as a jurist at the Institute of State and Law in Tbilisi, Georgia and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He served as the leading specialist on constitutional law for the Parliament of Georgia from 1996 and 1999. He then worked in the NGO sector (such as the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association and the Liberty Institute) and briefly practised law until becoming a Member of Parliament on President Eduard Shevardnadze-led Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG) party ticket in November 1999.
Political career.
Adeishvili was a member of an influential and vocal minority group of the UCG faction, dubbed as "reformers", which was led by Zurab Zhvania and Mikheil Saakashvili and called for more radical and Western-oriented political reforms.
At the end of 2001, when the CUG was in the process of collapse, Adeishvili joined Saakashvili's New National Movement and became a member of its parliamentary affiliate, the Faction for Democratic Reforms, which were in opposition to Shevardnadze's government.
After the bloodless "Rose Revolution" in November 2003 toppled down Shevardnadze and swept the "reformers" to power, Adeishvili served successively as Minister of Justice (December 2003 – February 2004), Minister for State Security (February–June 2004), Prosecutor General (June 2004 – January 2008), and Head of Administration of President of Georgia (January–November 2008). As an influential member in the government and a close ally of President Saakashvili, Adeishvili has become a subject of criticism from Georgian opposition, especially during his tenure as Prosecutor General. In the October 2008 cabinet reshuffle, Adeishvili was again put in charge of Ministry of Justice which had recently been merged with the Prosecutor General's Office. In his new capacity, Adeishvili said liberalization of the criminal code would be one of his priorities. After the defeat of Saakashvili's United National Movement in the 2012 parliamentary election, Adeishvili was succeeded, on October 25, 2012, by Tea Tsulukiani, a member of the Georgian Dream coalition.
Soon after elections, the new Government began to implement its campaign promise to “restore justice” by launching criminal prosecutions against officials of Saakashvili Government. Those prosecutions were largely met critically by international community due to a concern for what appeared to be a selective justice, political retribution and intimidation of opposition. After his meeting with the new Prime Minister Ivanishvili on November 12th, 2013, President of European Commission José Manuel Barroso noted, that “situations of selective justice should be avoided as they could harm the country’s image abroad and weaken the rule of law.”

<doc id="20854492" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20854492" title="Neosymbolism">
Neosymbolism

Neosymbolism is a movement current in the visual arts genre. Active in the movement are artists in the USA, in Denmark, and in the Czech Republic. 
History.
The Symbolist movement in art was first proposed by the poet, Jean Moreas, in a manifesto published in 1886. The resulting wave of influence had an impact on all the arts and ultimately impacted the development of Expressionism, of Fauvism, of Italian Futurism, and of most of the lineage of modern art as we know it, even though the movement itself lived a life of only around thirty years.
Philosophy.
The core philosophy of neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor, is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. 
The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Oddly, artists like Norman Rockwell could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and convey it in terms of the cultural cliche'; the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries communicate an existent reality. 
Neosymbolism is fairly well hidden within the culture with few references and almost no broad based visibility. In 1988 A_Demos,Nick published a book in an edition of two. This was the first visible sign of the idea underlying this philosophy.Nick A_Demos developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings.Nick A_Demos was the first to coin the word Neosymbolism as evidenced by neosymbolism.com as the first use of this word and documented by the domain name, see link to this site. NEOSYMBOLISM.com
There has also been a separate group using the neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art that is the foundation of the ideas associated with the term in its original and essential sense, as opposed to the "non-sense" of individual philosophies which deviate from the preservation of the core philosophy as it has evolved since the late nineteenth century.
The neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. 
Many groups use words 
but do not want to be limited to only that discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement by 
- Using Iconic language in their expressions
- Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world 
- Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
- Examining the underlying meaning of life
- Using media in conscious and innovative ways
http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&id=614394&side=&webside=4222305
An international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition.
- exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st 
through the use of symbols both personal and universal.
From this perspective the neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave the artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Words, ancient symbols of ideas, can be a powerful tool of expression but the neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to their use alone.
The exhibition history of this group, including their collaborations with the Danish Neosymbolist collective, 
are documented in the reviews in these periodicals.

Danielle Strickland

Danielle Jayne Strickland (born September 14, 1972 in Canada) is a Canadian Officer in The Salvation Army, and is currently serving as a Corps Officer at the Edmonton Crossroads Community Church in The Salvation Army, Canada & Bermuda Territory.
Biography.
Previous to offering for service in The Salvation Army, Danielle lived in Toronto, Canada, and was involved with both crime and drugs. After experiencing the Holy Spirit and accepting the forgiveness of Jesus Christ her world-view changed dramatically, and she began to live a life under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
Danielle is married, and is the mother of three boys (Zion, Judah and Moses). She serves The Salvation Army in several ways, and is internationally recognised in her capacity as a leader, speaker, writer, justice advocate, mission developer, worship leader and church planter.
Danielle was commissioned as a Salvation Army Officer in 1995, in the Canada and Bermuda Territory. She has served primarily as a Corps Officer, and is experienced in church planting; so far pioneering several Congregations, Outposts and Corps during her Officership.
Danielle's Officership has also taken her in other directions. She has been active in ecumenism, serving on ministerial associations, participating on boards of reference, preaching at denominational and inter-denominational events in more than fifteen countries, and leading multi-denominational initiatives. Danielle is a regular guest at Spring Harvest and Roots, and was a special guest speaker at The Salvation Army's World Youth Convention in June, July 2010.
Strickland is also a featured worship leader and has contributed to several worship albums with a number of original songs.
The Salvation Army.
The Salvation Army War College.
Danielle, along with her husband Major Stephen Court, and pioneers Ruth and Ian Gillingham, founded The War College in 2003 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2006, a campus was opened in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA by Alumni of the Vancouver campus, in 2008 a campus was opened in Chicago, Illinois, USA, and in 2010 another was opened in Bamako, Mali.
Strickland and Court still serve on the Board of Reference for the college, and Danielle has contributed as a visiting lecturer.
JustSalvos.
In her role as Social Justice Director in the Australia Southern Territory, Danielle developed JustSalvos, a brand that has allowed for the extensive development of the Social Justice Department in the Territory. The campaigns of the department include JustLose – a self-denial weight loss project, JustGifts – an international fundraising project, JustPray – directives involving prayers for social justice, JustLive – a network of Corps-planters and many other networked projects and campaigns. Teams of social justice representatives have also been established in each of the Divisions in the Territory.
Fair Trade.
In August 2009, Danielle, on behalf of JustSalvos and The Salvation Army welcomed the announcement of Cadbury Australia that their Dairy Milk Chocolate Bar would carry the Fair Trade certification by April, 2010. Danielle's work with the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand through her role as the Australian Coordinator for the Stop the Traffik movement was instrumental in Cadbury Australia's decision.
Sexpo.
In November 2009, JustSalvos paved the way for The Salvation Army to have a presence at the Melbourne Sexpo for the first time. The team distributed information on human trafficking through the international Stop the Traffik campaign, material about the sexualisation of young girls, as well as Jesus Loves Porn Stars New Testaments made especially for those who are searching for meaning through the sex trade.
In an interview with "The War Cry", Strickland said, "We want to leave judgment aside and ask God for a way to communicate with grace and truth that liberates and sets all people free." When the Melbourne Herald Sun ran a story on the Salvation Army presence at the exhibition, many of the online comments about The Salvation Army's presence were positive.
International Social Justice Commission.
The commencement of Danielle's appointment as the Territorial Social Justice Director in 2007, coincided with the launch of The Salvation Army's International Social Justice Commission. This Commission is "The Salvation Army's strategic voice to advocate for human dignity and social justice with the world's poor and oppressed." Danielle's work in support of this Commission, along with Commissioner M. Christine MacMillan and Social Justice Representatives from other Territories has been a catalyst for the gathering of momentum surrounding the Social Justice conversation especially within The Salvation Army, but also within its many spheres of influence.
In March 2009, Danielle attended the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women as one of nine representative delegates from The Salvation Army. The Salvation Army was strategically involved in many aspects of the conference including the formation of the break-out sessions (specifically the session titled "Women and Poverty") and in deciding what discussions would take place during the consultation day at New York University. Specifically, Danielle and Nikki Capp, also of Australia Southern Territory, hosted a parallel event titled 'Partnership with The Salvation Army: Building Capacity and Resources within the Developed and Developing World'.
Surrender Conference & Community.
Danielle, along with Gen Peterson, is listed as a Founding Partner of the Surrender Conference and Community based in Melbourne, Victoria. Surrender is a movement and conference that invites and encourages Christians in discipleship. "It's an invitation to follow Jesus among the poor, to influence the broader climate of church opinion and sow seeds for the future of incarnational mission".
Surrender is auspiced by The Salvation Army, organised by a small part-time project team and governed by the Surrender Council that is made up of representatives from Just Salvos, Djaywunti, Concern Australia, TEAR Australia, Urban Neighbours of Hope (UNOH), Urban Seed, and VCCE, as well as five ex-officio members.
Books.
Danielle is the author of several best-selling books on Christianity and social justice. Her honest and vivid writing style have seen her receive widespread acclaim from Christian Media.
The Liberating Truth (2010).
Danielle contends that women everywhere remain subjugated by cultural norms that tell them to conform, hold back, and turn aside from God’s call upon their lives. Consequently many women fail to play a full part in the healing and restoration of society. In this prophetic book Danielle observes: “We should be the ones who model an alternative approach to leadership. We are the ones with the Bible and the witness of the Holy Spirit who through Scripture, reason, tradition and experience has shown, over and over again His heart for the release of women to exercise their gifts.” The book covers: The current situation (exploitation or subjugation); the historical situation (feminism and the Christian tradition); key biblical material; justice (the feminization of poverty); what does the future offer, and what should the church do?
Challenging Evil (2010).
Challenging Evil is full of grassroots stories from the core of The Salvation Army's mission. Co-written with S. Carvosso Gauntlett, the book is also accompanied by discussion guides around old fashion evils in modern day wrapping.
JUST IMAGINE: The Social Justice Agenda (2009).
Co-written with Campbell Roberts, JUST IMAGINE is a reminder of the world-changers who shaped Christian heritage and equipped Christians with the tools they need to follow in their footsteps. The book is divided into three sections containing chapters on various subjects, excerpts of speeches and articles intended to aid discussion, together with a concluding prayer.
Chaotic Order (2006).
Chaotic Order prophetically challenges us to face and embrace the seeming chaos of Post-Modern thought. Danielle tries to make sense of the endless demands for order, and suggests the only way to triumph is to embrace the chaos, allowing it to reveal its own beauty in the joy of relationships. Chaotic Order was well received, with Dr Caryn Wilson describing it as "Brilliant and beautiful".
Education / Qualifications.
Master of Arts in Leadership, Trinity Western University, 2006.

Cataldo 'ndrina

The Cataldo 'ndrina is a clan of the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal and mafia-type organisation in Calabria, Italy. This particular 'ndrina is based in Locri, a hotbed of 'Ndrangheta activity. The clan allied, with the Marafioti family, is involved in a long blood feud with the Cordì 'ndrina, from the same town, since the end of the 1960s.
Feud with Cordì clan.
The feud started when historical boss of the clan, Domenico Cordì, was killed in Locri on June 23, 1967, in the so-called Piazza Mercato massacre. Two years after the killing, the Cordì clan hit back, killing Giuseppe and Domenico Marafioti, respectively the brother and son of Bruno Marafioti, boss of the clan and allied with the Cataldos. A series of hostilities continued until 1975 when the adversaries, weakened by losses on both sides, agreed to a truce.
The truce fell apart, due a bomb attack on July 4, 1993, against the boss of the Cataldo clan, Giuseppe Cataldo. He was the target of a bomb which was thrown at the car driven by his wife. The car was completely destroyed, but Cataldo and his wife miraculously survived. Hostilities between the two clans resumed.
Important 'Ndrangheta clan.
In the 1970s, the Cataldos allied themselves with the De Stefano 'ndrina from Reggio Calabria. Giuseppe Cataldo became a member of "La Provincia", a provincial commission of the 'Ndrangheta, formed at the end of the Second 'Ndrangheta war in September 1991, to avoid further internal conflicts.
Recent developments.
On December 27, 2005, Francesco Cataldo, who is considered to be the acting boss of the clan since the imprisonment of Giuseppe Cataldo, was arrested alone in a deserted house and unarmed. He was charged with commanding the killing of Salvatore Cordì on May 31, 2005, the leader of the opposing clan. The killing of Salvatore Cordì was a retribution for the killing of the younger Giuseppe Cataldo, the namesake nephew of the clan's boss, three months earlier, on February 15, 2005.
On December 18, 2008, police arrested Antonio Cataldo for ordering the killing of Cordì, jointly with three of the material killers. Ten days earlier, his cousin and namesake, had been arrested. He was convicted to 30 years imprisonment for drug trafficking.
In May 2008, 48 arrest warrants were issued against members of the Cataldo, Sergi and Marando 'ndrine for drug trafficking. The Sergi-Marando clan imported cocaine from Colombia and hashish from Morocco, while the Cataldos distributed the drugs to Lombardy, Piemonte, Veneto and Emilia Romagna through affiliates of the clan in northern Italy.
In 2010, police investigations based on intercepted conversations and government witnesses revealed that the Cordì and Cataldo clans signed a peace after a bitter feud that lasted for 40 years causing dozens of deaths. They formed a strong alliance aimed at a joint management of the crime business in the area, in particular in obtaining public work contracts and the exortortion industry.
