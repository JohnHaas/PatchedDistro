KYKN

KYKN (1430 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve Keizer, Oregon, USA. The station, established in 1951, is currently owned by the Willamette Broadcasting Company.
Programming.
KYKN broadcasts a news/talk radio format to the Salem, Oregon, area that includes select programming from Premiere Radio Networks and Westwood One. KYKN programs include the locally produced "The Bill Post Show" plus syndicated conservative-leaning talk shows hosted by Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Hugh Hewitt, and Dennis Prager.
In addition to its regularly scheduled news and talk programming, KYKN also broadcasts University of Oregon Ducks football and men's basketball as a member of the Oregon Sports Network. The station also airs National Basketball Association games as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers radio network.
History.
Launch as KGAE.
This station began broadcasting in 1951 as KGAE with 1,000 watts of power, daytime-only, on a frequency of 1430 kHz. The station, licensed to serve the city of Salem, Oregon, was owned by a partnership known as Allen, Truhan, & Clark with partner W. Gordon serving as president and general manager. This partnership would be soon dissolved leading to a now-oft cited court case that went all the way to the Oregon Supreme Court. As a result, Allen took control of the stations in 1952 with the broadcast license transferred to a new company called KGAE, Inc. Allen remained president but Hal Davis took over the general manager duties.
Change to KGAY.
In 1956, the station's call sign was changed to KGAY and the name of the license holding company was changed to KGAY, Inc., with W. Gordon Allen still in control. That same year, KGAY was authorized to increase the power of its broadcast signal to 5,000 watts although it was still restricted to daytime operation.
After a succession of station managers through the 1950s, W. Gordon Allen resumed the general manager duties in 1959. By this time Allen, who owned a two-third interest in flagship KGAY, had also acquired a 70% interest in KGAL in Lebanon, Oregon, and a 48% interest in KMAT in Winnsboro, Louisiana, as part of his W. Gordon Allen Stations group.
After nearly a decade of ownership, W. Gordon Allen and KGAY, Inc., agreed to sell the station to a company known as Radio Wonderful Willametteland, Inc. The deal was consummated on July 1, 1961. Glen M. Stadler took the title of general manager while Robert Bruce was named station manager. Stadler owned a one-third interest in KGAY, as did his partners Harry Rubenstein and Alex Dreier. The three men also owned equal shares in KGAL in Lebanon, Oregon. Stadler was the sole owner of KEED and KEED-FM in the Springfield-Eugene, Oregon, area. By the end of the 1960s, KGAY, Inc., was wholly owned by Glen Stadler and his wife, Helen N. Stadler, who also served as vice president of the company.
In 1968, the Stadlers announced their intention to retire from radio to "enter the academic field" and so they put KGAY up for sale. They contracted to sell the station to Capitol Equities, Inc., for a reported cash price of $175,000. The deal closed on August 15, 1968, and Donald H. Cushing took over as president of the company with Leslie J. Manning as general manager. By 1970, the station was airing a pure country & western music format. They would maintain this focus on country music throughout the 1970s.
KYKN today.
In April 1985, the station applied to the Federal Communications Commission to make major changes to their licensed operation: add nighttime service with 5,000 watts of power, add a directional antenna array to the new nighttime signal, and change the legal community of license from Salem to nearby Keizer, Oregon. The FCC granted a new construction permit to authorize these changes on September 18, 1985, and, after one extension, the station received its license to cover these changes on January 16, 1987.
While these changes were underway, the station was assigned the KYKN call sign by the FCC on May 15, 1986.
In April 1991, Capitol Equities Corporation reached an agreement to sell this station to Willamette Broadcasting Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 1, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on September 18, 1991.
KYKN broadcast every game of the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of minor league baseball's Northwest League from the team's launch in 1997 through the end of the 2007 season. The station formerly broadcast the Major League Baseball games of the Seattle Mariners as part of the Seattle Mariners Radio Network but dropped that affiliation after the 2008 season.

Before 1978, all trial courts except the Land Court were county or local courts funded through the counties. The Massachusetts Trial Court was created by Chapter 478 of the Acts of 1978 that reorganized the courts into seven Trial Court Departments. Administrative Justices became responsible for the administration of each court department and as part of the overhaul, all judges became state judges with the same salary and benefits.
A second court reorganization in 1992 greatly expanded the Juvenile Court Department and ended trial de novo in the District Court Department. It also replaced Administrative Justices with Chief Justices and created a central office headed by the Chief Justice for Administration and Management. 
, there are 9 Chief Justices and 401 Associate Justices positions authorized by statute in the system with trial judges sitting in more than one 130 locations across the state.

Early case assessment

Early case assessment refers to estimating risk (cost of time and money) to prosecute or defend a legal case. Global organizations deal with legal discovery and disclosure requests for electronically stored information "ESI" and paper documents on a regular basis.
Over 90% of all cases settle prior to trial. Often an organization will spend significant time and money on a case only to find they want to settle for whatever reason. Legal discovery costs are usually the most burdensome financially to both plaintiff and defendant. Often, and during cases in the United States, an opposing party will strategize on how to make it as difficult as possible for you to comply with the discovery process, including time and cost to respond to discovery requests. Because of this, organizations have a continued need to conduct early case assessment to determine their risks and benefits of taking a case to trial without painful settlement discussions.
Many service organizations, law firms, and corporations refer to early case assessment differently. Consultants hired by the corporation or law firm on a case manage cases on a risk basis. There also exist a number of software tools that assist in and help facilitate the process of early case assessment. Effective early case assessment might require the combination of professional expertise and software. This pairing, depending on the professional and tools used can provide various degrees of early case assessment review. Early case assessment, as a managed process, often requires customization to each case and the client involved.
The early case assessment lifecycle will typically include all of the following:
Early case assessment software is typically used by attorneys, corporate legal departments, risk managers, forensics teams, IT professionals and independent consultants to help them analyze unstructured electronically stored information.
The software approach to early case assessment typically includes the following:

<doc id="20789915" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20789915" title="Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance">
Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance

The Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance, (UNDO) (, "Ukrayin'ske Natsional'no-Demokratichne Obyednannia", ) was the largest Ukrainian political party in the Second Polish Republic, active in territory that is currently Western Ukraine. It dominated the mainstream political life of the Ukrainian minority in Poland, which with almost 14% of Poland's population was the largest minority within that country. UNDO was founded in 1925 and dissolved during the Soviet annexation of western Ukraine in 1939. Throughout the interwar years, UNDO enjoyed both German and Soviet financial support in their struggle against Poland. 
Political programme.
UNDO like other western Ukrainian political parties considered Polish rule over current western Ukraine to be illegitimate, advocating the independence of western Ukraine. It sought to promote Ukrainians' well-being within the Polish state until independence could be achieved, and in so doing opposed the terrorism and violence of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists because such actions resulted in negative repercussions on the Ukrainian population. UNDO was essentially democratic in nature, guided by varying amounts of Catholic, liberal, and socialist ideology. UNDO supported constitutional democracy and the "organic development" of Ukrainian society that would prepare it for independence once the opportunity arose. The approach of "organic development" focused on building up Ukrainian institutions, promoting Ukrainian education, and fostering Ukrainian self-reliance organizations that could operate independently from the Polish authorities. In so doing, UNDO hoped to achieve through peaceful means that which was not attained through war. UNDO supported agrarian reform and the development and expansion of the Ukrainian cooperative movement, particularly agricultural and financial cooperatives. UNDO also maintained close relations with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Ukrainian women's organizations actively participated in UNDO, which sent a woman representative to the Ukrainian parliament where she attained the position of party spokesperson. 
UNDO pursued a dual policy with respect to Poland's next largest minority, the Jews. UNDO protested acts of antisemitism and cooperated with Jewish representatives in the Polish parliament. It supported Jewish civil rights and fought against Polish attempts to limit Jewish cultural practices. For example, UNDO's representatives in the Polish parliament joined their Jewish colleagues in voting against an attempt to limit kosher slaughtering. UNDO's support for the Jews was largely driven by the belief that actions against Jews would set a precedent for future discrimination against Ukrainians. Following a Polish pogrom against Jews in 1936, an UNDO leader published an article called "After the Jews Will Come Our Turn." Despite its rejection of violence and discrimination against Jews, UNDO also engaged in an economic struggle against them by supporting Ukrainian cooperatives through boycotting non-Ukrainian (and thus, often, Jewish) businesses. While rejecting Polish offers of cooperation against Jews, UNDO spokesmen also blamed Jews for spreading Communism in Ukrainian villages.
Seeing Poland as the main enemy, in the 1920s while Soviet Ukraine was experiencing a cultural revival, a significant segment of the UNDO leadership had a pro-Soviet orientation. Dmytro Levytsky, party leader, wrote in 1925, "We are firmly convinced that, much like abstract communism, the Soviet form of government is alien to the mindset of the Ukrainian nation. But as we register facts, we cannot make note of certain facts while ignoring others. Therefore, we state the well-known and unquestionable fact that the national idea is growing, strengthening, and developing in Soviet Ukraine." After Ukrainization ended, and news of Soviet crimes devastating Ukrainian society in the 1930s (such as the Holodomor) filtered into western Ukraine, UNDO radically altered its position towards the Soviet Union, coming to consider it the principal enemy of Ukraine. With this in mind, UNDO's programme evolved into seeking a new understanding with Poland. This alienated some of its supporters and brought it into conflict with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.
History.
UNDO was founded at a party congress in 1925 through the merger of three western Ukrainian political parties, under the leadership of Dmytro Levytsky. It was the direct descendant of the prewar Ukrainian National Democratic Party, which had been the leading western Ukrainian political party during Austrian rule through western Ukraine's failed war of independence against Poland. The vast majority of western Ukraine's intelligentsia and clergy were members of UNDO. Prominent figures in the party included Kost Levytsky, former head of the government of the West Ukrainian National Republic, Dmytro Levytsky, who led the party for ten years, and Vasyl Mudry, who would become the speaker of Poland's parliament (the Sejm). UNDO's members controlled many of the region's Ukrainian financial, cooperative, and cultural institutions, including the principal western Ukrainian newspaper "Dilo." During the elections, it obtained approximately 600,000 votes and a large majority of the Ukrainian seats in the Polish parliament. Its main competitor within the Ukrainian community, the socialist Ukrainian Radical Party, received 280,000 votes.
In 1930, in response to terrorist activities of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Poland initiated a policy referred to as "Pacification", which involved mass arrests and beatings of Ukrainian activists, burning down of Ukrainian reading rooms and cooperatives, and closing of Ukrainian private schools. UNDO's representatives in the Polish parliament led the Ukrainian delegation in sponsoring a motion condemning these acts. After the motion's rejection, the Ukrainian parliamentarians appealed to the League of Nations, which reprimanded the Polish government. During the parliamentary elections of that year, the Polish government tried to deter the Ukrainian people from voting for Ukrainian parties. UNDO formed a temporary coalition with the other Ukrainian parties that won 21 seats in the House of deputies (17 of which were held by UNDO) and four seats in the Senate (3 of which were held by UNDO). Despite UNDO's presence in the parliament, anti-Ukrainian actions by the Polish state accelerated. Laws were passed which stipulated that only people who could speak and write Polish could serve as county or city officials, and four fifths of Ukrainian judges were removed from their positions or transferred to Central and Western Poland. 
By 1932, the relentless Polish pressure combined with the perception, based in part on the Holodomor and other Soviet atrocities affecting the Ukrainian population, that the Soviet Union not Poland was Ukraine's principal enemy, induced many of UNDO's leaders to seek some sort of accommodation with the Polish government. In March 1935, UNDO reached a compromise with the Polish government known as "Normalization." In exchange for UNDO agreeing to work with the Polish government, Ukrainians were guaranteed nineteen seats total in both houses of the Polish parliament, as well as the position of vice-marshal (speaker) of the Polish parliament, many Ukrainian political prisoners were amnestied, and credits were given to Ukrainian cooperatives. Russophile representation was also eliminated, and the status quo in Ukrainian schooling was maintained. 
UNDO's efforts to reach an agreement with the Polish government led to fractures within the party. In 1933 a group of UNDO members led by Dmytro Paliiv left UNDO to form another party that was uncompromisingly opposed to both Poland as well as the Soviet Union. Although this new party was more nationalistic and authoritarian, it was legal and continued UNDO's opposition to the terrorism of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Because the Poles were only willing to apply concessions to Galicia, and not to Volhynia, UNDO's leader Dmytro Levytsky resigned from his post as head of the party. While not resigning from the party itself, he went into internal opposition. Levytsky was supported by many of UNDO's members and by the editorial board of the newspaper "Dilo." This split incapacitated the party. Levytsky was replaced as head of the party by Vasyl Mudry, who became speaker of the Polish parliament.
During Normalization, UNDO pressed the Polish government for more substantial changes, such as cultural autonomy in western Ukraine, improvement in elementary and secondary education, a Ukrainian university, self-government, elimination of Polish colonization of Ukrainian lands, more access to administrative positions within the Polish state, and others. These demands were generally ignored by the Polish authorities, which led to a loss of credibility for Normalization among many Ukrainians. As a result, in 1938 UNDO proclaimed that Normalization had failed and that Poland opposed Ukrainian political life; it once again demanded autonomy for Poland's Ukrainian minority. At the same time, Germany's puppet government in Czechoslovakia granted autonomy to Slovakia's ethnic Ukrainian region, Carpatho-Ukraine. When in December 1938 articles began to appear in the German press supporting a Ukrainian state that would include parts of Poland, UNDO's leader informed the German ambassador in Warsaw that he saw no hopes for Polish-Ukrainian cooperation and that he hoped for German support. As a result, Poland pressed Germany to allow Hungary to annex Carpatho-Ukraine and when Hungary did so in 1939 Poland exploited Ukrainian disappointment in order to improve relations, and once again promised autonomy.
When Germany invaded Poland, UNDO declared its loyalty to the Polish state. After the Soviets annexed Eastern Poland, UNDO's former leader, Dr. Dmytro Levitsky, who had once been chief of the Ukrainian delegation in the pre-war Polish parliament, as well as many of his colleagues, were arrested, deported to Moscow, and never heard from again. UNDO along with all other legal Ukrainian political parties was forced by the Soviet authorities to disband. As a result, the extremist Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which already had an underground structure dating to its time of conflict with the Polish authorities, was left as the sole functioning, independent, political organization in western Ukraine.

Honeymoon rhinitis

Honeymoon rhinitis is a condition in which the sufferer experiences nasal congestion during sexual intercourse. 
The condition appears to be genetically determined, and caused by the presence in the nose of erectile tissue which may become engorged during sexual arousal as a side effect of the signals from the autonomic nervous system that trigger changes in the genitals of both men and women. 
A related (but very rare) condition called Sexually induced sneezing also exists, where people sneeze, sometimes uncontrollably, when engaging in or even thinking about sexual activity.
A phenomenon presumably related to 'honeymoon rhinitis' is the occurrence of nasal congestion as a reported side effect of Viagra use.

Battle of Al Rumaythah

The Battle of Al Rumaythah (26 September 2006) was fought during the morning in the Iraqi town of Al Rumaythah in Al Muthanna province between Australian forces of the Overwatch Battle Group (West) and unidentified Iraqi insurgents. The Australians had entered the town to hold discussions at the Iraqi Army barracks when they were engaged by a large number of insurgents in an intense exchange of fire during which a number of insurgents were killed. The incident lasted almost an hour and although a number of insurgents were killed it was considered to have been a well coordinated attack. The Australians then withdrew in good order without loss of life, injury or serious damage to equipment. Although a small incident with few tactical—and no strategic—consequences, it was significant as being a rare contact involving Australian forces in Iraq after the end of major combat operations in 2003. The incident was also the first time that the Australians were directly targeted by anti-Iraqi insurgents.
Prelude.
At 09:00 on 26 September 2006 an Australian force consisting of a 60-man element from OBG(W) arrived at the Iraqi Army barracks in Al Rumaythah to conduct a meeting with local stakeholders and to co-ordinate the training of Iraqi police and the reconstruction of the barracks itself. The group comprised infantry from 2RAR mounted in Bushmaster PMVs and cavalry from 2/14 LHR (QMI) mounted in ASLAVs, and was under the command of Major Andrew Stevens. In 2006 Al Rumaythah was a city of 75,000 people and had a reputation for violence and given the threat the Australians deployed snipers in over-watch positions around the barracks, as well as an infantry platoon. Nearby two cavalry ready-reaction groups were on standby.
Battle.
As the meeting commenced small groups of armed men were observed conducting surveillance of the Australian positions. During the next hour insurgents gathered throughout the town and soon after 1100 a rocket-propelled grenade was fired. The insurgents were moving in small groups through the town and appeared to be trying to encircle the barracks in order to conduct a deliberate assault and destroy the Australian force. For the next hour the barracks were attacked with grenades and small arms fire from ranges between to .
In response the Australian snipers engaged the insurgents whilst the platoon to the west of the barracks held its ground. Support from USAF F-16s was requested and they were used to fly low and fast over the insurgents in an attempt to distract them. Covered by the infantry Major Steven's party subsequently left the barracks in Bushmasters, still under heavy fire. Although attempting to prevent the Australian withdrawal the insurgents failed to flank the barracks to the north and south and by 12:15 the Australians had successfully broken contact and left Al Rumaythah.
During the fighting the Australians used their standard suite of infantry weapons including the F-88 Austeyr and F-89 Minimi LSW, well as MAG-58 MGs and sniper rifles. The ASLAV and Bushmaster vehicles played a crucial role in protecting the soldiers and allowing them to break contact safely. Indirect fires and Close Air Support had been available during the contact, however the decision was made not to escalate the situation due to the proximity of civilians. Following the incident Australian commanders claimed that their soldiers had withdrawn in a disciplined manner and had put themselves at considerable risk to ensure the safety of civilians, whilst applying their fire in a careful and controlled manner.
Aftermath.
The Australians suffered no casualties, while insurgent casualties were difficult to determine. A number of insurgents were observed to have been hit by Australian fire, and at least one source claims that five were killed. Up to 30 insurgents were believed to have been involved in the battle, however their identity—for example whether they were Sunnis or Shia religious groups, or al-Qaida—was unable to be determined. The balaclava-clad insurgents were dressed mainly in black and armed with AK-47s and grenade launchers. Regardless they were said to have fought in a well coordinated manner and had used considerable firepower against the Australians. After the battle it was claimed that the insurgents had used civilians as a shield from Australian fire. Despite this there were no reports of civilian casualties after the incident.

Linda May Bartoshuk (born 1938) is an American psychologist. She is a Presidential Endowed Professor of Community Dentistry and Behavioral Science at the University of Florida. She is an internationally known researcher specializing in the chemical senses of taste and smell.
Biography.
Bartoshuk grew up in Aberdeen, South Dakota. She received her B.A. from Carleton College and her PhD from Brown University.
Her research explores the genetic variations in taste perception and how taste perception affects overall health. Bartoshuk was the first to discover that burning mouth syndrome, a condition predominantly experienced by postmenopausal women, is caused by damage to the taste buds at the front of the tongue and is not a psychosomatic condition. She was employed at Yale University prior to accepting a position at the University of Florida in 2005. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995. In 2003, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

From 1995 to 1996, Dykes coached at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. In 1995, he coached the running backs as Navarro posted an 8–2 record. In 1996, he served as the quarterbacks and receivers coach and the passing game coordinator as Navarro finished 7–4 while reaching the Texas junior college championship game. At Navarro, Dykes coached Leroy Fields, who led the nation in receiving and was selected in the seventh-round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos.
In 1998, Dykes served as the wide receivers coach at Northeast Louisiana. Under Dykes' guidance, wide receiver Marty Booker broke all of NLU's single-season and career receiving records and was named first-team All-Independent. Booker played in the Blue-Gray and East-West Shrine all-star games and was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third-round of the 1999 NFL Draft.
Kentucky.
In 1997, Sonny Dykes served as a graduate assistant and tight ends coach at Kentucky under head coach Hal Mumme. The season highlight was a win over #20 Alabama, a team Kentucky had not beaten since 1922. Led by sophomore quarterback Tim Couch, Kentucky's offense set multiple school, SEC, and NCAA records.
Dykes returned to Kentucky in 1999 to serve on Mumme's staff as wide receivers coach and special teams coordinator. The season highlights were a victory over #20 Arkansas and a trip to the Music City Bowl.

Two of Dykes' players, Derek Smith and Brad Pyatt, signed as undrafted free agents with the Indianapolis Colts in 2002 and 2003, respectively.
Texas Tech.
In 2000, Sonny Dykes joined Mike Leach's staff at Texas Tech as the wide receivers coach. In his five seasons as receivers coach, Texas Tech wide receivers set numerous individual school and conference receiving records. Dykes coached wide receiver Carlos Francis who finished his career at Texas Tech with the second-most career touchdowns and third-most career receiving yards, and Francis was selected in the fourth-round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. In addition to Francis, Dykes also coached receivers Wes Welker and Derek Dorris who signed free agent contracts with the San Diego Chargers and New York Giants, respectively. During his tenure as the Texas Tech receivers coach, the Red Raiders participated in a bowl game in each of his five years including the 2000 Galleryfurniture.com Bowl, 2001 Alamo Bowl, 2002 Tangerine Bowl, 2003 Houston Bowl, and 2004 Holiday Bowl. Texas Tech finished the 2004 season ranked 17th in the final Coaches Poll, which was the first time the Red Raiders were ranked in a final poll since joining the Big 12 Conference.
After five seasons as the Texas Tech wide receivers coach, Dykes was promoted to co-offensive coordinator alongside Dana Holgorsen in 2005. Texas Tech opened their 2005 season with a 6–0 record, the program's best start since 1998, and defeated Oklahoma for the first time under Mike Leach. In 2005, the Red Raiders were trailing Kansas State, 13–10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59–20. Also in 2005, Texas Tech had a halftime lead of 14–10 over Texas A&M. By the end of the game, Texas Tech increased the margin to 56–17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old rivalry. Under Dykes' direction in 2005, Cody Hodges led the nation in passing yardage per game. The 2005 season culminated in a trip to the Cotton Bowl Classic and a ranking of 19th in the final Coaches Poll.
In Dykes' second season as co-offensive coordinator, Texas Tech ranked third in passing with 370 passing yards per game and sixth in total offense averaging nearly 450 total yards per game throughout the 2006 season. That season Dykes directed an offense that scored 32 points per game, and two receivers ranked top three in the nation in receptions per game and a third receiver ranked in the top twenty. Dykes helped develop Joel Filani into a two-time first team All-Big 12 honoree and a sixth-round selection in the 2007 NFL draft by the Tennessee Titans. In 2006, receiver Jarrett Hicks caught 13 touchdown passes to set the school's single-season record and signed as a free agent with the San Diego Chargers in 2007. Dykes also worked with quarterback Graham Harrell who completed 412 passes for 4,555 yards and 38 touchdowns in 2006.

Despite coaching his team to a losing record, Dykes was one of only four of the nation's 22 new head coaches to improve a team's conference record from the year before. LA Tech's offense improved in several areas of the NCAA statistical ranks including passing offense (91st in 2009 to 62nd in 2010) and total offense (66th to 52nd) while the team's average offensive national rank improved from 65th in 2009 to 54th in 2010.
Despite a 1–4 start in 2011, Dykes' Dawgs rallied to win seven consecutive games to cap off the regular season with the program's first WAC football title since 2001 and an appearance the Poinsettia Bowl.

Kanao Inouye

Kanao Inouye (1916 – August 27, 1947) was a Canadian citizen convicted of high treason and war crimes for his actions during World War II. Known as the "Kamloops Kid," he served as an interpreter and prison camp guard for the Imperial Japanese Army and the political police, or Kempeitai.
Early life in Canada.
A Nisei (second-generation Japanese-Canadian), Kanao Inouye was born to immigrant parents in Kamloops, British Columbia. His father, Tadashi Inouye, had emigrated to British Columbia from Tokyo, and had been a decorated Canadian soldier during World War I. Although his father died in 1926, Inouye at his first trial described his life in Canada as happy. His family nevertheless maintained close ties to Japan, where his grandfather, Chotahara Inouye, was a Member of Parliament and the House of Peers. After he graduated from Vancouver Technical School, Inouye's family urged him to go to Japan to continue his education. He did so in 1938 and was still there when World War II began.
War years.
In 1942, Inouye was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army as an interpreter. Made a sergeant, he was assigned to Sham Shui Po prison camp in Hong Kong, which housed Canadian prisoners of war from the Hong Kong Garrison. Inouye was noted for his unusual brutality. He beat prisoners at random, claiming it was in retaliation for discrimination he had received in Canada. In contrast to his later trial testimony about his childhood, he allegedly told them: “When I was in Canada I took all kinds of abuse. ... They called me a "little yellow bastard." "Now where is your so-called superiority, you dirty scum?” 
Inouye was discharged from the army the following year, but in 1944 he was conscripted as an interpreter for the notorious Kempeitai military police in Hong Kong. Trial testimony stated he had been an enthusiastic torturer of suspected spies and traitors. Former POWs would later testify that Inouye was responsible for the torture and death of at least eight Canadian POWs.
Conviction and execution.
After the Japanese capitulation in August 1945, Inouye was arrested in Kowloon and tried for war crimes by a military tribunal. He was convicted and was sentenced to death. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal, since as a Canadian citizen, he could not be prosecuted for war crimes committed by an enemy army.
In April 1947, Inouye was tried on the criminal charge of treason, was again found guilty and sentenced to death. Subsequently, on August 27, 1947, he was executed by hanging on the gallows at Hong Kong's Stanley Prison. His last word was "Banzai!"
Legacy.
Inouye is a rare counterexample to the overall loyalty of Japanese-Canadians during World War II. He was one of only two Canadians in history to have faced prosecution for war crimes (the second being Omar Khadr, who in 2010 pleaded guilty to war crimes in Afghanistan while on trial by the Guantanamo military commission).

Sediment (wine)

Sediment is the solid material which settles to the bottom of any wine container, such as a bottle, vat, tank, cask, or barrel. Sediment is a highly heterogeneous mixture which at the start of wine-making consists of primarily dead yeast cells (Lees (fermentation) the insoluble fragments of grape pulp and skin, and the seeds that settle out of new wine. At subsequent stages, it consists of Tartrates, and from red wines Phenolic polymers as well as any insoluble material added to assist clarification.
Sediments in bottled wines are relatively rare, and usually signal a fine wine that has already spent some years in the bottle. So unaccustomed have modern consumers become that many (erroneously) view it as a fault. Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time. Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of tartrates, and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented tannins. Winemakers deliberately leave more tartrates and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle so that they are able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet. A bottle of wine containing sediment requires special care before serving.

La Siberia

La Siberia is a comarca in the northeastern portion of the province of Badajoz in the autonomous community of Extremadura, Spain. Its capital is the municipality of Herrera del Duque. The comarca is bordered on the north by the provinces of Cáceres and Toledo, on the west by Las Vegas Altas comarca, on the south by La Serena comarca, and on the east by the province of Ciudad Real. The district contains 18 municipalities with a combined area of and a population of 29,214 people.

History.
La Siberia dates back to prehistory, when inhabitants were hunters and gatherers, semi-nomadic in nature. Rupestrian (made of rock) cave paintings and stone tools have been found from this era. The most prolific paintings in the area (though not in La Siberia itself) are those in the Maltravieso Cave from the Aurignacian era. Human remains and ceramics have also been found in the cave.
Geography.
La Siberia is a land of varying terrain. The foothills of the Montes de Toledo dominate the north, and the flatter Sierra Morena runs through the south. Two major rivers flow through the region, creating vast peneplains in the less mountainous areas. Poor soil as a result of erosion in the peneplains makes the region poorly suited for agriculture, so most of the population relies on livestock as their principal economic activity. The Guadiana River flows the entire length of the comarca from northeast to southwest, going on to form most of the southern portion of the border between Spain and Portugal. The region's inhabitants have created several reservoirs along the Guadiana, providing locals with ample water resources. The largest of the reservoirs are the Cijara, the García de Sola, and the Orellana. Also, in the southern portion of La Siberia flows the Zujar River, which contains two large reservoirs - the Zujar and the La Serena, the latter being the largest in Spain and the second largest in Europe. The combined maximum capacity of these five reservoirs is approximately 6.395×109 m3 (2.258×1011 cu ft), or about 12% of Spain's water resources; La Serena alone holds 6% of the country's water. The region is well known for its abundant water resources; because of all the reservoirs, La Siberia contains the longest inland coastline of any region of Spain and also the largest amount of freshwater in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula.
Flora and fauna.
With a population density of just under , much lower than Spain's average of , the area's landscape is dominated by a very diverse collection of trees, the most dominant being the oak. Other types of trees include quercus faginea, chestnut, ash, willow, eucalyptus, and pine.
Almost all of the region has been declared a Special Protection Area (SPA) for birds because of the large populations of endangered species such as Eurasian Black Vultures and owls. Large populations of partridges, pigeons, doves, and many other species of birds also inhabit the area.
Hunting small game is a common pastime in La Siberia; the most-prized animal being the red-legged partridge. Other small game includes phasianidae, quail, columbidae, rabbits, hares, and foxes. Larger game is also hunted in the region, the most frequent being deer, wild boar, mouflon, and ibexen.
Fishing is also popular in the comarca. Fish native to the area include Common Barbel, Iberian Nase, tench, and brown trout. Species that have been introduced by locals include carp, black bass, and pumpkinseed.
Climate.
La Siberia lies between two climate zones - a continental climate to the north and a Mediterranean climate to the south - making this area a transition zone. Most of the area lies in the Mediterranean zone, but the far north has a continental climate. Summers are long and hot while winters are short and moderately cold.
La Siberia has an average high of and an average low of . The hottest month is July with an average high/low of /, and the coldest month is January with an average high/low of /.
The region only receives per year, lower than Spain's average, . The wettest month of the year is December, receiving of precipitation, and the driest month is July, receiving only .

The Slav Epic

The Slav Epic (in Czech: "Slovanská epopej") is a cycle of 20 large canvases painted by Czech Art Nouveau painter Alfons Mucha between 1910 and 1928. The cycle depicts the history of Czechs and other Slavic peoples. In 1928, after finishing his monumental work, Mucha bestowed the cycle to the city of Prague on condition that the city built a special pavilion for it. As of 2010, the work was a part of the permanent exhibition at the chateau in the town of Moravský Krumlov in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic.
As of July 2012, all 20 works are displayed together on the ground floor of the "Veletržní Palace", in an exhibition organized by the National Gallery in Prague (exhibition catalogue: Alfons Mucha - Slovanská epopej).
Background.
Mucha spent many years working on "The Slav Epic" cycle, which he considered his life's fine art masterpiece. He had dreamed of completing a series such as this, a celebration of Slavic history, since the turn of the 19th century, however, his plans were limited by financial constraints. In 1909, he managed to obtain grants by an American philanthropist and a keen admirer of the Slavic culture, Charles Richard Crane. He began by visiting the places which he intended to depict in the cycle, such as Russia, Poland and the Balkans, including the Orthodox monasteries of Mount Athos. Additionally, he consulted historians about the details of historical events in order to ensure an accurate depiction. In 1910, he rented a part of the castle in Zbiroh and began working on the series.
Mucha continued working on the cycle for 18 years. He gradually handed over the finished paintings to the city of Prague. In 1919, the first part of the series, comprising eleven canvases, was displayed in the Prague's Clementinum. In 1921, five of the paintings were shown in New York and Chicago to the great acclaim of the audience.
After finishing the work in 1928, the complete cycle was displayed in the Trade Fair Palace in Prague. It was the first exhibition of the work in the Czechoslovak capital. 
Alfons Mucha died in July, 1939. Shortly before his death he was interrogated by Gestapo as an important exponent of public life in Czechoslovakia. During World War II, the "Slav Epic" was wrapped and hidden away to prevent seizure by the Nazis. 
Following the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 and subsequent communist takeover of the country, Mucha was considered a decadent and bourgeois artist, estranged from the ideas of socialist realism. The building of a special pavilion for the exposition of the cycle became irrelevant and unimportant for the new regime. After the war, the paintings were moved to Moravský Krumlov by a group of local patriots. The cycle went on display in the chateau in 1963.
Controversy.
The city of Prague has waged a decade-long legal battle over the work which intensified in early 2010. Much consideration was given to the idea of relocating The Slav Epic from Moravský Krumlov, (where it has been displayed for about 45 years), to Prague. It was thought that Prague, a city frequented by countless thousands of tourists, would be able to attract increased attention to and interest in the series of paintings. However, there is no suitable space for the work in Prague's galleries. Therefore, some of the Czech state institutions, such as the Office of the President of the Czech Republic, found it preferable to keep the paintings in their existing location since there have been few problems with the space at which they are currently displayed. Nevertheless, in early 2010, the city of Prague requested the return of the Slav Epic for restoration works and subsequent display. However, the Mucha Foundation, run by the artist's grandson John Mucha and his mother Geraldine, blocked the move as it would simply be a provisional measure. The City of Prague argued that not Alfons Mucha but Charles R. Crane was the owner of the paintings and that he has donated the cycle to the City of Prague. According to the newspaper Mladá fronta DNES, the information was proved by contracts found in the city archive. The Foundation is in talks with the City of Prague for the construction of a permanent home for the work.
On 25 July 2010, over a thousand people gathered in Moravský Krumlov to protest against the planned move of "The Slav Epic" from the town.
After a two-year dispute over Alfons Mucha's Slav Epic between Prague and the Moravian town of Moravský Krumlov, the renowned cycle of 20 monumental canvases was, in an move protested by conservationists and art historians, taken for display at the National Gallery's Veletržní Palace in 2012 and will be there for the next two years.
List of paintings.
The work consists of 20 paintings, up to six metres tall and eight metres wide.

History of smallpox

The history of smallpox extends into pre-history; the disease likely emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC. The earliest credible evidence of smallpox is found in the Egyptian mummies of a disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year, including five reigning monarchs, and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Between 20 and 60% of all those infected—and over 80% of infected children—died from the disease.
During the 20th century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300–500 million deaths. In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year. As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year. After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in December 1979. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated.
Eurasian epidemics.
It has been suggested that smallpox was a major component of the Plague of Athens that occurred in 430 BCE, during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was described by Thucydides. A recent analysis of the description of clinical features provided by Galen during the Antonine Plague that swept through the Roman Empire and Italy in 165–180, indicate that it was probably caused by smallpox. Although some historians believe that many historical epidemics and pandemics were early outbreaks of smallpox, contemporary records are not detailed enough to make a definite diagnosis. In the 2nd century, returning soldiers brought the disease home with them to Syria and Italy, where it raged for fifteen years and greatly weakened the Roman empire, killing up to one-third of the population in some areas. Total deaths have been estimated at 5 million. A second major outbreak of disease in the Roman Empire, known as the Plague of Cyprian (251–266), was also either smallpox or measles
Most of the details about the epidemics are lost, probably due to the scarcity of surviving written records from the Early Middle Ages. The first incontrovertible description of smallpox in Western Europe occurred in 581, when Bishop Gregory of Tours provided an eyewitness account describing the characteristic symptoms of smallpox. Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations. The establishment of the disease in Europe was of special importance, for this served as the endemic reservoir from which smallpox spread to other parts of the world, as an accompaniment of successive waves of European exploration and colonization.
Around 400 AD, an Indian medical book recorded a disease marked by pustules and boils, saying "the pustules are red, yellow, and white and they are accompanied by burning pain … the skin seems studded with grains of rice." The Indian epidemic was thought to be punishment from a god, and the survivors created a goddess, Sitala, as the anthropomorphic personification of the disease. Smallpox was thus regarded as possession by Sitala. In Hinduism the goddess Sitala both causes and cures high fever, rashes, hot flashes and pustules. All of these are symptoms of smallpox.
The clearest description of smallpox from pre-modern times was given in the 9th century by the Persian physician, Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi, known in the West as "Rhazes", who was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his "Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah" ("The Book of Smallpox and Measles").
Smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century. Every seventh child born in Russia died from smallpox. It killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year in the 18th century, including five reigning European monarchs. Most people became infected during their lifetimes, and about 30% of people infected with smallpox died from the disease, presenting a severe selection pressure on the resistant survivors.
In northern Japan, Ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century, due in large part to infectious diseases like smallpox brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido.
The Franco-Prussian War triggered a smallpox pandemic of 1870–1875 that claimed 500,000 lives.
In 1849 nearly 13% of all Calcutta deaths were due to smallpox. Between 1868 and 1907, there were approximately 4.7 million deaths from smallpox in India. Between 1926 and 1930, there were 979,738 cases of smallpox with a mortality of 42.3%.
African epidemics.
One of the earliest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the elephant war circa AD 568 when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.
The slave trade continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of slaves. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to board or on board ships.
Smallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the white population suffered, and whole clans of the Hottentot tribe were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the white population and the Hottentots. The Hottentots spread the disease further among their tribes, and completely eradicating several tribes, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Hottentots and Bantu tribes, but the whites settlers, having practiced variolation, were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks. Continued slaving operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the Griqua tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811–1813, 1838–1839, 1865–1866, 1878–1879, 1885–1887, and 1889–1890.
Epidemics in the Americas.
After first contacts with Europeans and Africans, some believe that the death of 90–95% of the native population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases. It is suspected that smallpox was the chief culprit and responsible for killing nearly all of the native inhabitants of the Americas. For more than 200 years, this disease affected all new world populations, mostly without intentional European transmission, from contact in the early 16th century to until possibly as late as the French and Indian Wars (1754–1767).
In 1519 Hernán Cortés landed on the shores of what is now Mexico and was then the Aztec empire. In 1520 another group of Spanish arrived in Mexico from Hispaniola, bringing with them the smallpox which had already been ravaging that island for two years. When Cortés heard about the other group, he went and defeated them. In this contact, one of Cortés's men contracted the disease. When Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan, he brought the disease with him.
Soon, the Aztecs rose up in rebellion against Cortés and his men. Outnumbered, the Spanish were forced to flee. In the fighting, the Spanish soldier carrying smallpox died. After the battle, the Aztecs contracted the virus from the invaders' bodies. Cortés would not return to the capital until August 1521. In the meantime smallpox devastated the Aztec population. It killed most of the Aztec army and 25% of the overall population. The Spanish Franciscan Motolinia left this description: "As the Indians did not know the remedy of the disease…they died in heaps, like bedbugs. In many places it happened that everyone in a house died and, as it was impossible to bury the great number of dead, they pulled down the houses over them so that their homes become their tombs." On Cortés's return, he found the Aztec army’s chain of command in ruins. The soldiers who still lived were weak from the disease. Cortés then easily defeated the Aztecs and entered Tenochtitlán. The Spaniards said that they could not walk through the streets without stepping on the bodies of smallpox victims.
The effects of smallpox on Tahuantinsuyu (or the Inca empire) were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Within months, the disease had killed the Incan Emperor Huayna Capac, his successor, and most of the other leaders. Two of his surviving sons warred for power and, after a bloody and costly war, Atahualpa become the new emperor. As Atahualpa was returning to the capital Cuzco, Francisco Pizarro arrived and through a series of deceits captured the young leader and his best general. Within a few years smallpox claimed between 60% and 90% of the Inca population, with other waves of European disease weakening them further. A handful of historians argue that a disease called Bartonellosis might have been responsible for some outbreaks of illness, but this opinion is in the scholarly minority. The effects of Bartonellosis were depicted in the ceramics of the Moche people of ancient Peru.
Even after the two largest empires of the Americas were defeated by the virus and disease, smallpox continued its march of death. In 1561, smallpox reached Chile by sea, when a ship carrying the new governor Francisco de Villagra landed at La Serena. Chile had previously been isolated by the Atacama Desert and Andes Mountains from Peru, but at the end of 1561 and in early 1562, it ravaged the Chilean native population. Chronicles and records of the time left no accurate data on mortality but more recent estimates are that the natives lost 20 to 25 percent of their population. The Spanish historian Marmolejo said that gold mines had to shut down when all their Indian labor died. Mapuche fighting Spain in Araucanía regarded the epidemic as a magical attempt by Francisco de Villagra to exterminate them because he could not defeat them in the Arauco War.
In 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Native Americans were struck by the virus. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population groups of Native Americans. It reached Mohawks in 1634, the Lake Ontario area in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679. During the 1770s, smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans. The smallpox epidemic of 1780–1782 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians. This epidemic is a classic instance of European immunity and non-European vulnerability. It is probable that the Indians contracted the disease from the ‘Snake Indians’ on the Mississippi. From there it spread eastward and northward to the Saskatchewan River. According to David Thompson’s account, the first to hear of the disease were fur traders from the Hudson’s House on October 15, 1781. A week later, reports were made to William Walker and William Tomison, who were in charge of the Hudson and Cumberland Hudson’s Bay Company posts. By February, the disease spread as far as the Basquia Tribe. Smallpox attacked whole tribes and left few survivors. E. E. Rich described the epidemic by saying that “Families lay unburied in their tents while the few survivors fled, to spread the disease.” After reading Tomison’s journals, Houston and Houston calculated that, of the Indians who traded at the Hudson and Cumberland houses, 95% died of smallpox. Paul Hackett adds to the mortality numbers suggesting that perhaps up to one half to three quarters of the Ojibway situated west of the Grand Portage died from the disease. The Cree also suffered a casualty rate of approximately 75% with similar effects found in the Lowland Cree. By 1785 the Sioux Indians of the great plains had also been affected. Not only did smallpox devastate the Indian population, it did so in an unforgiving way. William Walker described the epidemic stating that “the Indians all Dying by this Distemper … lying Dead about the Barren Ground like a rotten sheep, their Tents left standing & the Wild beast Devouring them.”
A particularly virulent sequence of smallpox outbreaks took place in Boston, Massachusetts. From 1636 to 1698, Boston endured six epidemics. In 1721, the most severe epidemic occurred. The entire population fled the city, bringing the virus to the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.
In the late 1770s, during the American Revolutionary War, smallpox returned once more and killed an estimated 125,000 people. Peter Kalm in his "Travels in North America", described how in that period, the dying Indian villages became overrun with wolves feasting on the corpses and weakened survivors.
By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans.
In 1900 starting in New York City, smallpox reared its head once again and started a sociopolitical battle with lines drawn between the rich and poor, white and black. In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil. This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action. Despite the general acceptance of the germ theory of disease, pioneered by John Snow in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a "filth" disease, and therefore would only affected the "lower classes".
In Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.
Australasian epidemics.
In 1789, near Sydney, smallpox devastated the Aboriginal population of coastal New South Wales (NSW). The extent of this outbreak is disputed, but some sources claim that it killed about 50% of all indigenous Australians.
Controversy has long surrounded a popular theory that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers. The hypothesis was tentatively put forward in 1914 by the Director of the Australian Quarantine Service, Dr. J. H. L. Cumpston, and most forcefully stated by the economic historian, Noel Butlin, in 1983. It was reiterated by David Day in his 2001 book "Claiming a Continent A New History of Australia", which suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of Royal Marines may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789. In 2002, John Connor stated that Day's theory was "unsustainable". That same year, theories that smallpox was introduced with settlers, deliberately or otherwise, were contested by Judy Campbell's full length book "Invisible Invaders" (2002). In particular, Campbell argued that scientific evidence concerning the viability of variolous matter (used for inoculation) did not support the possibility of the disease being brought to Australia on the long voyage from Europe. Campbell also noted that there was no evidence of Aborigines ever having been exposed to the variolous matter, merely speculation that they may have been. Later authors such as Christopher Warren and Craig Mear continued to argue that smallpox emanated from the importation of variolous matter on the First Fleet. Warren (2007) suggested that Campbell had erred in assuming that high temperatures would necessarily have sterilised the British supply of smallpox. H. A. Willis (2010), in a survey of the literature discussed above, reiterated Campbell's argument. In response, Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the World Health Organization. In reply, Willis (2011) reiterated that his position was supported by a closer reading of Frank Fenner’s report to the World Health Organization (1988) and invited readers to consult that report online.
Campbell's suggestion that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land, expanded upon the opinion of C. C. Macknight (1986) an authority on the interaction between indigenous Australians and the Macassans. Citing the scientific opinion of Fenner (who wrote the foreword to her book) and historical documents, Campbell argued that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by Macassans, from where it spread overland. Nevertheless, Michael Bennett in a 2009 article in "Bulletin of the History of Medicine", argued that imported "variolous matter," may have been the source of the 1789 epidemic in Australia. In 2011, Macknight re-entered the debate, declaring: “The overwhelming probability must be that it was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Macassan trepangers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.” Warren (2013) disputed this, on the grounds that: there was no suitable smallpox in Macassar before 1789; there were no trade routes suitable for transmission to Port Jackson; the theory of a Macassan source for smallpox in 1789 was contradicted by Aboriginal oral tradition, and; the earliest point at which there was evidence of smallpox entering Australia with Macassan visitors was around 1824.
Another major outbreak was observed in 1828–30, near Bathurst, New South Wales. A third epidemic occurred in the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia in the mid-1860s.
Elsewhere in the Pacific, smallpox killed many indigenous Polynesians. Nevertheless, Alfred Crosby, in his major work, "" (1986) showed that in 1840 a ship with smallpox on it was successfully quarantined, preventing an epidemic amongst Māori of New Zealand. The only major outbreak in New Zealand was a 1913 epidemic, which affected Māori in northern New Zealand and nearly wiped out the Rapa Nui of Easter Island ("Rapa Nui"), was reported by Te Rangi Hiroa (Dr Peter Buck) to a medical congress in Melbourne in 1914.
Eradication.
Early in history, it was observed that those who had contracted smallpox once were never struck by the disease again. Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as variolation, was first practiced in China in the 10th century. Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of cowpox against the smallpox virus in 1798. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.
Variolation.
The word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation. The term is used to define insertion of smallpox matter, and distinguishes this procedure from vaccination, where cowpox matter was used to obtain a much milder reaction among patients.
Asia.
The practice of variolation (also known as inoculation) first came out of the orient. First writings documenting variolation in China appear around 1500. Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox. Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used quicker in hot weather (15–20 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of "Uvularia grandiflora" in a mortar. The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls. A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice. Variolation spread further from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.
Europe.
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.
When the practice of variolation set off local epidemics and caused death in two cases, public reaction was severe. Minister Edmund Massey, in 1772, called variolation dangerous and sinful, saying that people should handle the disease as the biblical figure Job did with his own tribulations, without interfering with God's test for mankind. Lady Mary still worked at promoting variolation but its practice waned until 1743.
Robert and Daniel Sutton further revived the practice of variolation in England by advertising their perfect variolation record, maintained by selecting patients who were healthy when variolated and were cared for during the procedure in the Sutton's own hygienic hospital. Other changes that the Suttons made to carrying out the variolation process include reducing and later abolishing the preparatory period before variolation was carried out, making more shallow incisions to distribute the smallpox matter, using smallpox matter collected on the fourth day of the disease, where the pus taken was still clear, and recommending that those inoculated get fresh air during recovery. The introduction of the shallower incision reduced both complications associated with the procedure and the severity of the reaction. The prescription of fresh air caused controversy about Sutton's method and how effective it was in reality when those inoculated could walk about and spread the disease to those that had never before experienced smallpox. It was the Suttons who introduced the idea of mass variolation of an area when an epidemic broke out as means of protection to the inhabitants in that location.
News of variolation spread to the royal families of Europe. Several royal families had themselves variolated by English physicians claiming to be specialists. Recipients include the family of Louis XV following his own death of smallpox, and Catherine the Great, whose husband had been horribly disfigured by the disease. Catherine the Great was variolated by Thomas Dimsdale, who followed Sutton's method of inoculation.
In France, the practice was sanctioned until an epidemic was traced back to an inoculation. After this instance, variolation was banned within city limits. These conditions caused physicians to move just outside the cities and continue to practice variolation in the suburbs.
Edward Jenner.
Edward Jenner was variolated in 1756 at age eight in an inoculation barn in Wooton, England. At this time, in preparation for variolation children were bled repeatedly and were given very little to eat and only given a diet drink made to sweeten their blood. This greatly weakened the children before the actual procedure was given. Jenner's own inoculation was administered by a Mr. Holbrow, an apothecary. The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several smallpox scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.
At the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in Sodbury with Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762–1770 who had a strong sense of cleanliness which Jenner learned from him. During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting cowpox, the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life. However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true.
After learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with John Hunter in London from 1770–1773. Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlow’s, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.
After two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of Berkeley, where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician. It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox. He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area. During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.
Through his study, he incorrectly deduced that grease, smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796. Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.
On May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named James Phipps. Phipps recovered as expected. Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated about many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.
When the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful except on his own son Robert. Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the Royal Society (of whom Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings. Jenner then rode to London and had his book published by Sampson Low’s firm in June 1798 The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.
Knowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named Benjamin Jesty successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox. However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials. Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using experimentation.
United States of America.
Benjamin Franklin, who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. William Heberden, a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.
An American physician, John Kirkpatrick, upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1738, where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred. His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.

Clan Kinninmont

Clan Kinninmont is a Scottish clan. The clan does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Kinninmont is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. The original chiefly line died out when an heiress married into another family. 
History.
The clan name "Kinninmont" is derived from the lands of Kinninmonth in Fife, Scotland. In the years between 1189 and 1199, Odo, seneschal to the Bishop of St Andrews, received a charter for these lands from William I of Scotland. An 1841 publication dealing with the charters on the archbishopric of St Andrews states that the charter granted by John, son of Adam, son of Odo is not recorded. The publication also states that John's "original deed of consent, executed at the same time, and before the same witnesses with the charter of his father, is still extanct; and on his seal we find the family name for the first time: "S’Iohannis de Kinimmund"". William de Kynemuthe's name appears on the Ragman Roll, which records the names of Scots nobles who submitted to Edward I of England in 1296. In 1329 Alexander de Kininmund became Bishop of Aberdeen. Another Alexander de Kininmund became Archdeacon of Aberdeen in 1352. James Kynimond of that Ilk asserted his hereditary right to the offices of baillie, steward and marischal of St Andrews, in 1438. The direct line of Kininmonts of that Ilk (the chiefly line) came to an end with the marriage of the one heiress to Murray of Melgund.
Clan symbols.
The crest badge suitable for members of the clan is derived from the arms of Kinninmont of that Ilk. The crest is blazoned as "an oak tree Vert" and the motto is "STABO", meaning "i shall stand".

Maxwell House Show Boat

Maxwell House Show Boat was the top radio show in the United States from 1933 to 1935. The program was sponsored by Maxwell House coffee, and it aired on NBC Radio Thursday nights, 9 pm. The first show was broadcast in 1931.
"Maxwell House Show Boat" was inspired by the success of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II musical "Show Boat", which was based on the novel of the same name by Edna Ferber. It became an instant classic when it opened in 1927 on Broadway. The radio program starred Charles Winninger as Captain Henry, a role directly inspired by Winninger's stage performance as Cap'n Andy Hawks, owner of the showboat "Cotton Blossom" in the Kern-Hammerstein musical. (Otherwise, the Maxwell House program and the stage "Show Boat" had nothing to do with each other besides the fact that both had a Mississippi showboat as a setting for the action.) In 1932, the year before "Maxwell House Show Boat" premiered, Winninger reprised his role as Cap'n Andy in the first stage revival of Kern and Hammerstein's "Show Boat", a role he would once again play in the 1936 film version of the musical.

Big Sister (radio)

Big Sister was a daytime radio drama series created by Lillian Laugerty and broadcast on CBS from September 14, 1936 to December 26, 1952. It was sponsored by Lever Brothers (Rinso) until 1946 when Procter & Gamble became the sponsor.
Set in the fictional town of Glen Falls, the program dramatized the life of Ruth Evans who sacrificed her own happiness to care for her younger sister Sue and their crippled brother Neddie. After Sue married reporter Jerry Miller, Ruth continued to care for Neddie. She fell in love with Neddie's doctor, John Wayne, who cured Neddie. Ruth and John married on October 19, 1939, but during World War II, John was held in a Japanese prison camp. He returned to Glen Falls suffering from shell-shock.
The actresses who portrayed Ruth over the decades were Alice Frost, Nancy Marshall, Marjorie Anderson and Mercedes McCambridge. Sue was played by Haila Stoddard, Dorothy McGuire, Peggy Conklin and Fran Carlon. Michael O'Day was heard in the role of little Neddie Evans.
The program was so popular that when characters Ruth Evans and Dr. John Wayne were married in 1940, listeners sent truckloads of wedding presents to the CBS building on Madison Avenue in New York City. Its popularity led to a spin-off radio series, "Bright Horizon", which CBS began broadcasting in 1941. To assure its success, Alice Frost appeared on "Bright Horizon" for a short while in her role of Ruth Evans Wayne.
The program was written by Robert Newman and Julian Funt. Announcers for the program were Fred Uttal, Jim Ameche and Hugh Conover. Organist Richard Leibert furnished the background music and the opening theme, "Valse Bluette".

The is a railway line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by Seibu Railway.
The line is part of the Seibu Shinjuku group of railway lines and connects suburban areas of western Tokyo to Seibu and JR main lines that run to central Tokyo. The line passes through the cities of Higashimurayama, Kodaira, and Kokubunji. 
Operations.
Seibu 101 series, 2000 series, and 3000 series EMUs are used on this line. These trains are painted in Seibu Railway's distinctive yellow livery. All trains are local services and stop at all stations. Trains take 12 minutes to complete the 7.8 km journey.
The line is mostly single track between and , but with double track sections at each station. Track between and is double track for the first 1.2 km and single track the last 0.9 km before Kokubunji station. The track changes from double to single at . The 1.2 km double-track section allows 8 trains per hour to operate in each direction during peak. At Kokubunji Station, trains use only a single platform (platform 5) at the terminus.
History.
The line was opened in 1894 as part of the Kawagoe Railway linking and . At this time, was the only intermediate station on the Higashi-Murayama to Kokubunji section. In 1927, the Kawagoe railway was diverted at Higashi-murayama to a new section of track to and so the Kokubunji line was formed from the orphaned section. The line was electrified in 1948. Two additional intermediate stations were later opened between Ogawa and Kokubunji: Takanodai opened in 1948, and Koigakubo opened in 1955. Setting up of Hanesawa and to double track from Koigakubo to Hanesawa is in 1968. Since July 2008, recorded announcements on trains have been provided in English in addition to Japanese.

Mayer serves on the Board of Editors of Real Estate Economics and the Journal of Urban Economics and is a Fellow of the Homer Hoyt Institute. He also works as part-time research director and member of the Board of Directors of Oak Hill REIT Management, a REIT hedge fund. Mayer previously held positions at the Wharton School, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Home Mortgage Interest Rate Proposal.
In October 2008, Mayer introduced a proposal with colleague Glenn Hubbard to ameliorate the effects of the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 by offering home owners the opportunity to refinance their home mortgage at an interest rate of 5.25%. (By December, they had adjusted the proposed rate down to 4.5%.)
Mayer and Hubbard argued that the opportunity to refinance household debt at a low rate would improve both household and financial institution balance sheets which would then result in increased investment and consumer spending, mitigating the extent of the financial crisis. The proposal was subsequently debated in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, NPR, and Bloomberg News. On December 12, 2008, Bloomberg News reported that President-Elect Barack Obama's economic team had expressed interest in the plan and White House economic chief Lawrence Summers had attempted to flesh out the details of the plan with Mayer and Hubbard.

All Japan Regional Football Promotion League Series

The All Japan Regional Promotion League Series (全国地域サッカーリーグ決勝大会, "Zenkoku Chiiki Sakkā Rīgu Kesshō Taikai") is a play-off tournament meant as a transition for Japanese football (soccer) clubs competing in regional leagues to the bottom national tier (as of 1999, the Japan Football League).
History.
Until 1976, the main entrance route for regional clubs to the Japan Soccer League was the All Japan Senior Football Championship, a cup competition. In 1977, to test clubs in a league environment before entrance to the league, the Japan Football Association devised this tournament.
In 1984 and 1985 more promotion places were added due to the JSL, expanding its divisions. In 1992 it began promoting clubs to the former JFL's second division and, from 1994 to 1998, to its single division. In 1999 and 2000 it added extra promotion places due to the formation and expansion of the new JFL.
Yamaha Motors (Júbilo Iwata) are, thus far, the only Regional Series champions to later become First Division champions. They are also the only club to retain the title, as they failed to be promoted in their first attempt due to losing a playoff series. Since 1980 every champion has been automatically promoted, exceptions being made at the champion's request in 1993 (Nippon Denso/FC Kariya) and 2002 (Ain Foods) as they lacked the resources to compete at the national level.
Qualification.
Until 2009, the number of places in the tournament was 16, distributed as follows:
As of 2010, the regional league runner-ups are no longer eligible and the university association is no longer allowed to make recommendations, reducing the number of places to 12.
Format.
Preliminary round.
The clubs are grouped in round-robin groups of 4, playing at a single city per group (no home-and-away format is followed). Only 3 matches are played per club, since the match location is the same. The winners of each group qualify for the final round.
Final round.
As of 2010, the three group winners plus the highest-scoring runner-up are grouped in a final group in a single locale, with three matches played per club. The top two places are guaranteed promotion and the third place must play a promotion/relegation series against one of the three bottom JFL clubs (subject to JFL place availability).
Round-robin rules.
The usual 3-1-0 system is used; however, in case of a draw, a penalty shootout is added and the winner gets one extra point.
Winners.
Teams in bold were promoted. 
Wins by region.
Clubs in bold compete in the J. League (any division) as of 2014 season. Clubs in "italics" no longer exist. A dagger (†) indicates clubs that moved away from the region after winning the title.

USC&amp;GS Pioneer (OSS 31)

USC&GS "Pioneer" (OSS 31) was a survey ship that served in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1946 to 1966. She was the third ship of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to bear the name.
Construction and United States Navy service.
"Pioneer" was laid down as the United States Navy seaplane tender USS "Mobjack" (AVP‑27), by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, on 25 February 1942 and launched on 2 August 1942. "Mobjack" was reclassified as a motor torpedo boat tender and redesignated AGP‑7 on 11 March 1943 and commissioned as such on 17 October 1943.
During World War II, "Mobjack" served in the Solomon Islands, in the Treasury Islands, in the New Guinea campaign, at Morotai, in the Philippines campaign, and off Borneo. After the war, she served in the Philippine Islands before decommissioning on 21 August 1946.
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey career.
The U.S. Navy transferred "Mobjack" to the U.S. Department of Commerce on 21 August 1946, the same day the Navy had decommissioned her. Disarmed, modified, and renamed USC&GS "Pioneer" (OSS 31), she entered service as a survey ship in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey that year.
"Pioneer" spent her Coast and Geodetic Survey career on duties in the Pacific Ocean. In August 1955, she received the first marine magnetometer, a towed magnetometer which Victor Vacquier of Scripps Institution of Oceanography had developed while conducting surveys for the U.S. Navy off the coast of California. She employed this magnetometer on a survey from Point Conception, California, to Cape Flattery, Washington, which went down in history as “The "Pioneer" Survey.” Her work with the magnetometer led to the collection of data which allowed the discovery of magnetic striping on the floor of the Pacific, and this proved to be a major discovery in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.
In 1964, "Pioneer" became the first U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey vessel to operate in the Indian Ocean when she participated in the International Indian Ocean Expedition.
Final disposition.
"Pioneer" was sold for scrap on 4 May 1966 to National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California.
Commemoration.
Two geographic features on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, the Pioneer Fracture Zone and Pioneer Ridge, are named for "Pioneer".

Web Sheriff

Web Sheriff is an anti-piracy company based in the United Kingdom that provides intellectual property, copyright and privacy rights protection services for clients that include record labels, musical artists, film studios, news media organizations, and celebrities. The company monitors various websites that host links to downloads of music and film. Web Sheriff has been in operation since 2000, with two offices in the UK.
The company was founded by intellectual property lawyer John Giacobbi, who acts as its managing director. Web Sheriff sends legal take-down notice to BitTorrent and other file sharing sites, and also engages with blogs and fansites, negotiating for copyrighted music to be removed, offering fans free official promotional tracks and clips from the artist as replacement for the leaked material. According to the "Los Angeles Times", Web Sheriff is a "leading advocate of the soft sell" in the anti-piracy industry.
Description.
As an internet copyright protection firm, Web Sheriff performs a wide range of online rights security and anti-piracy services. These include protection from copyright infringement, libel, cyber-bullying, identity theft privacy issues of social media, stock market share price protection, policing trading sites and recovery of fraudulently registered domain names. It also furnishes online security for concert tours. In addition to online rights protection, the company designs, builds and maintains websites and YouTube channels and provides editing and filming for them. It manufactures watermarked CDs and DVDs and provides security for new album release for clients by sending individually watermarked digital streams of audio and video to journalists.
The most predominate work it performs is copyright protection services for record labels, music artists and film companies when releasing new material. Major corporate record labels, independent record labels and American film production companies use the company's services. The company reports that most of its clients are located in the US.
Operating methods.
Web Sheriff uses proprietary software and web-crawler programs to search the Internet, using human auditing to determine the type of site that is posting its clients' copyrighted material. It relies heavily on phone calls and relationship building and when locating unauthorized links it targets the persons running the sites. The supposed offending party is sent a take-down notice before further action is taken. Some Torrent sites and file sharing sites such as Mediafire and Rapidshare provide access to the anti-piracy company to remove infringing content itself.
The "Los Angeles Times" described the company's approach as representing "a sharp turn in the recording industry's life-and-death struggle with piracy, one driven largely by performers and their managers rather than the record companies." When it contracts to protect new music releases, the company encourages the artists it represents to give fans several tracks ahead of the release. The company then prepares for the "virtually inevitable" pre-release leak, and when it does occur, fans on blogs are approached with a polite request for copyrighted material to be removed, while providing the fans with the free official tracks and clips from the artist and record label.
History.
Web Sheriff was founded in 2000 by former music attorney and industry consultant John Giacobbi, who acts as president, managing director, and is referred to in the press as the "Web Sheriff". Prior to forming Web Sheriff, Giacobbi had been an independent consultant to record labels and artists including Village People. Giacobbi has said that the formation of the company evolved from his desire to help Village People retain their rights on the internet, as copyright infringements and the selling of bootleg CDs by "fake bands, fake sites or fake names" had become a major problem for the band at that time.
In 2005, the company was directly responsible for the removal of the Ken Bigley execution footage videos posted on a terrorist website after Bigley's beheading. Web Sheriff related that it was approached by "The Mail on Sunday" after authorities had refused to intervene citing a lack of power. The video was hosted on a website entitled "headlessamericans.com" and the ISP initially refused to take it down by saying it was protected by "freedom of speech", but complied finally after 48 hours of argument. In the same year, in work done for "The Mail on Sunday", the company spokesman, writing in that newspaper, disclosed that Web Sheriff also closed down the extreme pornographic strangulation sites at the center of the notorious Jane Longhurst murder case.
Web Sheriff first came to international notoriety when it was hired by Prince in September 2007 to "disappear entirely from the internet." The star's spokesman related that "Prince believes strongly that as an artist the music rights must remain with the artist and thus copyrights should be protected across the board." "Very few artists have ever taken this kind of action over their rights." Web Sheriff announced it would launch lawsuits against YouTube, eBay and The Pirate Bay on behalf of Prince if they refused compliance in removing links to his unauthorized photos, videos, and music. Peter Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay, dismissed the threats, stating that American law was not applicable in Sweden. YouTube complied by removing over 2,000 videos from their site and eBay removed more than 300 auctions. In November 2007, three fans sites were given notice to remove all images of the singer, his lyrics and "anything linked to Prince's likeness". Some of the Prince fans fought back, formed their own organization called "Prince Fans United" and hired an attorney. Multiple unauthorized overseas online sites selling merchandise featuring Prince were shut down.
Village People used Web Sheriff's services in 2007 to send 500 "take down" notices to YouTube relating to a video with footage of Hitler and other prominent Nazis dancing and singing to their song, "Y.M.C.A.". Web Sheriff's comment about the video was: "It's highly inappropriate. Consider that the song's composers were both Jewish." In February 2008, the company announced that Village People was suing The Pirate Bay for millions of dollars for enabling illegal downloads of "Y.M.C.A.".
Nick Bracegirdle with Chicane hired Web Sheriff in 2007 to prevent leaks from his album, "Somersault", after self-financing it by selling his Ferrari and mortgaging his home. This followed Chicane's 2003 album, "Easy to Assemble" being so widely pirated by a Russian counterfeiter alone, selling thousands of copies with a sleeve from a previous album with the title digitally removed, that it was never officially released.
In 2007, when Bloc Party's album "A Weekend in the City" leaked three months previous to release, their record label, V2 Records, hired the anti-piracy company to stop the leakage as the album was intended to make the band popular on an international basis. Web Sheriff at first appealed to fan sites to not post links to the album out of respect for the band. Whenever this approach did not work, widespread uploaders were tracked down and sent letters that referred to possible prosecution. Said to face a possible one million illegal MP3 files downloaded, according to V2, the leakage was reduced to an insignificant amount.
When Qtrax introduced their new file sharing site in January 2008, Web Sheriff notified the site on behalf of Prince, Van Morrison and The Black Crowes that regardless of whether the music companies supported the service, individual artists would have to give their approval.
In 2008, Van Morrison hired the company to contact fan sites and demand that photos, lyrics and other copyrighted material be removed from fan sites. His manager stated that posting the photos were an invasion of Morrison's privacy. Through the wishes of the artist, all related videos on YouTube and elsewhere were removed promptly from the Internet. The two most popular fan sites closed down soon after they were notified.
Bryan Adams used Web Sheriff's services to remove thousands of low quality bootleg video clips from YouTube and replace them with official videos on his own channel. The company has stated that the new channel was a success and had 187 million views one and one-half years later.
When "Brother Sport", the first song from Animal Collective's album "Merriweather Post Pavilion" leaked in November 2008, Web Sheriff posted to Grizzly Bear's blog that they were the "global-leak-source of the track" and asked for an apology to be posted on the blog for a week to Domino Records, Animal Collective and Web Sheriff. Grizzly Bear band member Ed Droste complied and apologized stating "The Web Sheriff is just doing his job, and we're all aware of the damage internet file sharing is doing to album sales." The album leaked a month early and while Web Sheriff said it was "virtually impossible to completely put an album back in the box after a leak", the company was able to remove 90% or 10,000 of the links.
Bob Dylan used the company's services pro bono to protect his charity Christmas album, "Christmas in the Heart" following its leak in October 2009. Web Sheriff also removed unauthorized videos of Dylan from YouTube, replacing them with official ones on Dylan's channel. fans were offered official material such as tracks and videos in return for not posting copies of it on sites. Web Sheriff reported that when a mailbox was set up for reporting leaks, tens of thousands of fans responded and sent in links to copies due to the fans' loyalty and bond to the artist.
In July 2011, Web Sheriff announced that it was taking legal action against a Russian website that has copied the Web Sheriff trademark and also purports to offer the same services as the British anti-piracy company. American and Russian litigators were retained for the "intercontinental legal attack" against the Russian site.
In February 2012, Twitter released a disclosure of two years of DMCA take-down notices, with an article in "The Huffington Post" noting Web Sheriff's work for Magnolia Pictures was responsible for a third of the 4,000 messages Twitter received to remove links to unauthorized posting of movies and songs. Web Sheriff's "aggressive activity" at Twitter for Magnolia Pictures was also the feature of an article in "The Hollywood Reporter".
In March 2012, Noel Edmonds revealed to the "Daily Mail" how after being informed of a page on Facebook entitled 'Somebody please kill Noel Edmonds' and being unable to convince Facebook to take it off, he hired Web Sheriff to trace the source. Through contact with Facebook headquarters, the firm was able to connect it to a Ph.D. university student and Edmonds resolved the matter in a face to face meeting with the student instead of reporting it to the police.
Reception.
Music fans and bloggers often initially respond angrily when first approached by Web Sheriff on its clients' official and unofficial forums. According to the "Evening Standard", "Music blogging sites are littered with comments with the Sheriff's contact details at the top, thanking bloggers for obeying the rules." Fans sometimes interpret this as Web Sheriff saying, "I've got my eye on you." The anti-piracy company reports that eventually most of the fans tend to respect the wishes of their favored artists by cooperating. As related by "The Guardian", The Prodigy fans on the brainkiller forum engaged with Web Sheriff on a thread that lasted through 18 pages. Some of the fans who had been hostile at the beginning, then asked what they could do to help the band.
Andrew Daniels with "Men's Health", in an introduction to an interview with him, referred to John Giacobbi, 'alias, the Web Sheriff' as "the most hated man on the internet" and "the scorn of bloggers, pirates, and regular Joes all over the world".
Gary Fung, the founder of IsoHunt a BitTorrent site, has spoken of Web Sheriff as "the white hat of antipiracy companies" while further noting that "Web Sheriff, in my book, are the good guys. What they do is send takedown notices for copyright owners, which is perfectly legitimate."
Joe Reinartz with Pollstar wrote that "To some, like artists and record labels, John Giacobbi and his Web Sheriff company are godsends. To others, like those who upload new album releases to YouTube, Giacobbi and Web Sheriff are probably not on their Christmas list."
Web Sheriff's method of using a "velvet glove approach" to appeal to fans has been said by Randy Lewis with the "Los Angeles Times" to have notable successes, including Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" and Adele's "21". This journalist also notes that despite these examples of success of the "diplomatic strategy", the company's gentle approach still has skeptics, with some critics calling it naive: Brad Buckles, an executive in anti-piracy with RIAA, was quoted as saying: "It's certainly well-intended and may work in some cases. The problem is in many, many cases, you're dealing with people who have no respect whatsoever for the intellectual property of record labels or the artists themselves." A "Billboard" journalist concludes that to appeal to sites that post links to pirated music and engaging with fans and redirecting them to authorized content by the artist is a "strategy with a future, if implemented properly."

<doc id="20790452" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20790452" title="Comet vintages">
Comet vintages

'Comet vintages' are years during which an astronomical event, involving generally a "Great Comet", occurs prior to harvest. Throughout the history of wine, winemakers have attributed successful vintages and ideal weather conditions to the unexplained effects caused by the comets. Some of the most heralded vintages in the last couple of centuries—such as the 1811, 1826, 1839, 1845, 1852, 1858, 1861, 1985 & 1989 vintages—have coincided with a notable appearance of a comet. The term "comet wine" is sometimes used in the wine world to describe a wine of exceptional quality in reference to the high reputation that comet vintages have. The 1811 comet vintage, coinciding with the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811, is perhaps the most famous. The 1811 Château d'Yquem has exhibited what wine experts like Robert Parker have described as exceptional longevity with Parker scoring the wine a perfect 100 points when tasted in 1996. The 1811 vintage of Veuve Clicquot is theorized to have been the first truly "modern" Champagne due to the advancements in the "méthode champenoise" which Veuve Clicquot pioneered through the technique of "remuage". 
Effects of the comets.
There is no accepted viticultural impact of comets on grapevines, and there have been many successful vintages throughout the world in years where there were no noticeable comet sightings. Over centuries a great number of events and phenomena have been attributed to the appearances of comets in the sky—such as devastating earthquakes, a 1668 epidemic among cats in Westphalia, or an increase in the birth of twins in a particular area. While many of the phenomena associated with comets tend to be negative, the association of comets and wine has almost always been held as beneficial by viticulturists and oenologists.
1811 vintage.
The 1811 comet vintage has had the most lasting notoriety. The comet that year was the Flaugergues comet, named after Honoré Flaugergues who first spotted the comet in March. The comet was visible for most of the growing season, which saw optimal conditions for many of the world's major growing regions, but particularly for France. After a string of bad vintages at the start of the 19th century, the 1811 vintage was a reversal of fortune in regions like Bordeaux, Cognac, Champagne and Sauternes. For Cognac, the vintage was considered one of the greatest in history, with many producers today including images of stars on their labels as an homage to the 1811 vintage. Notable wines from this include the 1811 Château d'Yquem, which received a perfect 100-point wine rating by wine critic Robert Parker at a 1996 tasting over one hundred and eighty years after it was bottled. In Germany, the 1811 vintage was so successful that producers along the Rhine would label their wines as "comet hock". 
The 1811 bottling of vintage Champagne from the Champagne house of Veuve Clicquot has been theorized to have been the first truly "modern" Champagne. The wine was one of the first to be described as "limpid" or sediment-free. This was due to the new technique of "remuage" or riddling developed by Veuve Cliquot that tackled the historical problem of how to remove the ill tasting and unpleasant looking sediments from the sparkling wine without losing the carbon-dioxide gas that makes it bubble. The development of riddling was a hallmark moment in the evolution of the modern Champagne industry. In the early 19th century, Veuve Clicquot tried to keep their techniques a secret, but the clarity and limpidity of their Champagne captured worldwide attention and eventually their secret escaped. In the summer of 1812, following Napoleon's invasion of Russia, despite a decree from Tsar Alexander I of Russia banning the importation of French wine in bottles, Louis Bohne, lead sales agent for Veuve Clicquot, was able to smuggle a large quantity of the 1811 "Cuvée de la Comète" into Königsberg. As word of the wine's quality spread, Bohne found eager customers among the Russian elite with even the Tsar himself seeking out the wine.
Literary references.
There have been several references in literature to the 1811 vintage which was often described as the "Year of the Comet". Ernst Jünger's 1939 novel "On the Marble Cliffs" has central characters drinking wine from the "year of the comet". In "The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk" by Arthur Conan Doyle, Dr. Watson describes Sherlock Holmes, upon being told the clerk's story, as being pleased, "" like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a comet vintage."" In the 1992 romantic comedy "Year of the Comet", a bottle of 1811 Château Lafite is central to the story line.
Other notable comet vintages.
The 1858 comet vintage attributed to the Donati Comet was widely praised for the quality of Bordeaux claret that came out of that vintage. The 1874 comet vintage was considered especially favorable for the German wine regions of the Mosel and Rheingau.

If You're Ever Down in Texas, Look Me Up

"If You're Ever Down In Texas, Look Me Up" is an American folk song first released in the 1940s.
The lyrics of the song tell of a traveler from Texas singing about the vast wealth and natural beauty of his home, inviting the audience to "look me up" during their next visit to Texas.
Lyrics
"If you're ever down in Texas look me up
"Look us up!
If you're ever down in Texas look me up
Drop around!
Where the men are men and love it,
And the girls are sure glad of it,
If you're ever down in Texas look me up"
"Everybody's gonna holler, Howdy doody!
Howdy doody!
Everybody there's gonna ask, how are you?
How ya all?
We raise corn for hot samalies,
And grow dollies for the trollies,
If you're ever down in Texas look me up
Ask anyone there for Rusty,
Everyone there knows me,
They'll tell you where I'm ridin' for,
If A, B, C, or D
"
If you're ever down in Texas look me up
Come on down!
We've got everything in Texas lookin' up
Lookin' fine!
Every cowboy is a dandy,
Though his legs are bowed and bandy,
If you're ever down in Texas look me up
"
My little partner Dusty,
Always rides the range with me,
His smile is as homey,
As a Texas melodee"
"If you're ever down in Texas look me up
Hiya All!
We've got everything in Texas lookin' up
Oh ya!
Bronco Bustin' takes some practice,
Or you'll end up on a cactus,
If you're ever down in Texas look me up"

Patrulleros de Zona Marítima

The Patrulleros de Zona Marítima (PZM) ( ) are a series of offshore patrol vessels being built for the Navies of Chile, Argentina and Colombia.
History.
The design of the PZM was developed by Fassmer GmbH & Co. KG, a Germany company to meet the Chilean Navy's requirements under the Danubio IV project. The contract for ASMAR to build the PZMs was signed on May 20, 2005, with Northrop Grumman, Sisdef (a consortium of BAE Systems and shipbuilder ASMAR (Chilean Navy)) and Rohde & Schwarz participating as main subcontractors at a cost of US$54 million to be commissioned by 2012. The vessels will be operated by the Coast Guard Service of the Chilean Navy and they will conduct patrol missions in Chile’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The design of the Proyecto Patrulleros de Zona Marítima is being promoted by Chile as a common platform for South American Navies through the Proyecto Patrullero de Alta Mar Regional or Regional Offshore Patrol Vessel committee. 
On 2008, Argentina have ordered up to five PZM at a cost of US$120 million as part of its own Patrulleros de Alta Mar (PAM) programme to be constructed at its Río Santiago Shipyard. Finally on 2010 the Argentine Government launched the construction of the first four in the Tandanor Shipyard.
Colombian have ordered two vessel to be built at its Cartagena de COTECMAR shipyard by 2012.

William Lobb

William Lobb (1809 – 3 May 1864) was a Cornish plant collector, employed by Veitch Nurseries of Exeter, who was responsible for the commercial introduction to England of "Araucaria araucana" (the ""Monkey-Puzzle"" tree) from Chile and the massive "Sequoiadendron giganteum" (""Wellingtonia"") from North America.
He and his brother, Thomas Lobb, were the first collectors to be sent out by the Veitch nursery business, with the primary commercial aim of obtaining new species and large quantities of seed. His introductions of the Monkey-Puzzle tree, ""Wellingtonia"" and many other conifers to Europe earned him the sobriquet ""messenger of the big tree"". In addition to his arboreal introductions, he also introduced many garden shrubs and greenhouse plants to Victorian Europe, including "Desfontainia spinosa" and "Berberis darwinii", which are still grown today.
Early life.
Lobb was born in 1809 at Perranarworthal, between Truro and Falmouth, Cornwall and spent his early life at Egloshayle, near Wadebridge. His father, John Lobb, was the estate carpenter at nearby Pencarrow where a notable garden had been developed by Sir William Molesworth. John developed a love of gardening and, after losing his place at Pencarrow, he took up employment at Carclew House, near Falmouth, the home of Sir Charles Lemon. Sir Charles would later be amongst the first people in England to receive and grow rhododendron seed from Sir Joseph Hooker, who had sent seed directly to Sir Charles from his Himalayan expedition of 1848–1850.
William, along with his younger brother Thomas, worked in the stove-houses at Carclew where Sir Charles encouraged the Lobb boys in their study of horticulture and botany. In 1837, William was engaged by Mr Stephen Davey of Redruth, where he helped establish a ""thoroughly efficient"" horticultural establishment. From there, he moved on to become gardener to the Williams family at Scorrier House, near Falmouth. He gained a reputation as a keen amateur botanist and assembled a fine collection of dried specimens of British plants, particularly Cornish ferns, but had an increasing desire to travel abroad and to discover unknown ""vegetation"".
By the late 1830s, James Veitch had established his plant nursery at Mount Radford, Exeter and was looking for ways to extend the range of plants on offer, thus improving the profitability of the business. After correspondence with the eminent botanist Sir William Hooker about the most suitable destination, Veitch decided to employ his own plant hunter to gather exotic plants from South America exclusively for his nursery. William's brother Thomas had been employed by Veitch since 1830 and recommended William to Veitch. Veitch was impressed by William's keen manner and horticultural knowledge; according to the account in Hortus Veitchii, William:"was quick of observation, ready in resources, and practical in their application; he had devoted much of his leisure to the study of botany, in which considerable proficiency had been acquired."
Veitch decided that William, despite not being a trained botanist, would prove a steady, industrious and dependable collector. He therefore booked him a passage on HM Packet "Seagull", which was to set sail from Falmouth on 7 November 1840, bound for Rio de Janeiro and Lobb thus became the first of a long line of plant collectors to be sent out by the Veitch family to all corners of the world. James Veitch was anxious to ensure that Lobb should not be ""cramped for funds"" and arranged for an annual allowance of £400 to be made available to draw on in the large cities along his planned itinerary.
Before his departure, Lobb visited Kew Gardens where he was taught how to make herbarium specimens by placing plant material between special papers.
South America (1840–1844).
Brazil and Argentina.
Lobb took with him seeds of the early "Rhododendron" hybrid "Cornish Early Red" ("R. arboreum" x "R. ponticum") as a gift from Veitch to the new emperor of Brazil, Pedro II. The seeds were planted in the gardens of the Imperial Palace at Petrópolis where they are still growing today.
Following his arrival at Rio de Janeiro, Lobb spent 1841 exploring the Serra dos Órgãos (Organ Mountains) to the north-east of the port where he discovered several orchids including the swan orchid, "Cycnoches pentadactylon", as well as "Begonia coccinea" and "Passiflora actinia". His first shipment of discoveries, which arrived at Topsham dock in March 1841, also included a new species of "alstroemeria", an "oncidium", "O. curtum" (with yellow flowers and cinnamon-brown markings), and a new red "salvia". There were also several species of the beautiful pink-flowered climber "mandevilla", including "M. splendens", which would become highly sought after for cultivation in England, and the small shrub "Hindsia violacea", with its clusters of ultramarine flowers, which quickly became popular in Victorian greenhouses. The next shipment arrived at Topsham in May but had been delayed at Rio de Janeiro and, as a result, many of the plants failed to survive the journey, arriving dead or ""vegetated"".
Later in 1841, Lobb travelled by boat to Argentina, where he spent the winter exploring the area around Buenos Aires. In January 1842, he sent back five cases of plants, seeds and dried specimens, but unfortunately the ship was unable to dock at Exeter as expected and continued on to Leith in Scotland, from where the packages eventually reached Exeter.
Lobb then travelled overland to Chile via Mendoza and the Uspallata Pass over the Andes, thus avoiding the perilous sea voyage around Cape Horn. Lobb found the journey through the mountains gruelling, having to travel though snow that he described as ""five feet deep, frozen so hard that the mules made no impression and the cold was intense"", causing him to collapse ill with fever on several occasions.
Chile.
James Veitch's instructions to Lobb included a request to locate and bring back seeds of the ""Chile pine"" (more popularly known as the "Monkey-Puzzle Tree") ("Araucaria araucana") which had originally been introduced to Britain by Archibald Menzies in 1795. Veitch had seen a young specimen at Kew Gardens grown from seed brought back by the Horticultural Society's collector James McRae in 1826, and was convinced that this tree would be hugely popular as an ornamental plant.
Once Lobb had recovered from the ordeal of his Andean crossing he left Valparaíso and travelled south by steamship to Concepción from where he set off to the forests of the Araucanía Region. At 5,250 feet, he reached his destination where the sought-after "Araucaria araucana" was growing on the exposed ridges below the snow-capped volcanic peaks of the southern Andes. Lobb collected over 3,000 seeds by shooting cones from the trees while his porters gathered fallen nuts from the ground. Lobb then returned to Valparaíso with the sacks containing the seeds and personally saw them onto a ship bound for England. The shipment arrived safely at Exeter and by 1843 Veitch was offering seedlings for sale at £10 per 100.
Unknown to his employers, Lobb also sent seeds back to his former employers, Sir Charles Lemon at Carclew and John Williams of Scorrier House, where a plantation of Monkey-Puzzle trees was grown.
During 1842, Lobb collected from the Valparaíso area and sent back seeds of a purple nasturtium climber, "Tropaeolum azureum", which he located at ""Cuesta Dormeda, about sixteen leagues (50 miles) from Valparaíso"". He also sent the pale-blue mallow, "Abutilon vitifolium", and the white, rosemary–scented "Calceolaria alba", which was the forerunner of many "calceolarias" which were to become popular as summer bedding plants.
Lobb then travelled by steamship to Talcahuano and then to Los Ángeles, from where he went inland towards the mountains following the Laja River upstream to the Antuco volcano. He then followed the Andes to Santa Bárbara regularly making excursions up to the snow line. Lobb found this expedition exhausting and the eventual shipment back to England was disappointing with only one significant new discovery, a magenta flowering perennial "Calandrinia umbellata".
Lobb's travels then continued through northern Chile, where he discovered "Desfontainia spinosa", before moving on through Peru to Ecuador.
Peru, Ecuador and Panama.
En route, he collected the Passion flower, "Passiflora mollissima" (now "P. tripartita var. mollissima"), which became popular in greenhouses, and the delicate "Calceolaria amplexicaulis".
In the spring of 1843, he took four cases of plants, which he had collected on the slopes of the Peruvian Andes, by sea to the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil. While he was there, an epidemic of yellow fever broke out and, along with other European residents, he was forced to move to Puná Island until the epidemic was over, leaving his cases with a shipping agent to send to England. On leaving Puná, Lobb hired mules and a guide and travelled inland to Quito and on into southwestern Colombia.
He eventually reached the port of Tumaco, with a further collection of plants, from where he sailed for Panama intending to travel on with his latest finds back to England. On arriving at Panama City however, he received news from James Veitch that the cases of plants left in Guayaquil had never arrived. Lobb therefore despatched his latest collection from Panama (which arrived safely at Exeter) and awaited instructions from Veitch.
Amongst the shipments from Panama were several orchids including "Oncidium ampliatum" collected near Panama City, described by Veitch in a letter to Hooker as arriving ""quite fresh but others are rotten"", a blue-azure "clitoria" and a ""lobelia"", "Centropogon coccineus", which he found growing ""in shady places on the banks of the Chagres River"" as well as seeds of several "fuchsias" and "tropaeolum".
While waiting in Panama, Lobb continued to seek out new plants despite suffering from an attack of dysentery. Once he had recovered, he returned to Guayaquil where he discovered all his cases rotting in a corner of a warehouse, with much of the contents destroyed by ants. The agent explained that the cases had ""quite escaped his notice"". Lobb was able to rescue some of the seeds, bulbs and dried specimens which he sent to Exeter. Veitch replied by sending back a supply of glass to make new shipping cases and insisting that Lobb endeavour to replace everything that was lost.
Despite being exhausted from his travels and repeated attacks of ill health, Lobb returned to the interior of Peru for a further four months, finally arriving back in England in May 1844. On Lobb's return to Exeter, Veitch wrote to Hooker:"I was disappointed at hearing William Lobb had left Peru, but pleased to hear of his safe arrival in England with many plants and seeds in good order. He reached Exeter with his plants on Saturday and is now gone to his friends."
Amongst the dried samples sent back to England was one of "Solanum lobbianum" which was sent to Kew Gardens where it was labelled as ""Lobb Columbia"". It was named after its discoverer by Georg Bitter (1873–1927), the German expert on "Solanum", based on the single specimen at Kew. For a long time there was some doubt about the actual location of the plant's discovery until it was re-discovered in Ecuador by an American expedition in the 1990s.
South America (1845–1848).
After a period of rest and recuperation, Lobb returned to work in the Exeter glasshouses planting out and nurturing his introductions. By April 1845, his health had fully recovered and he was again despatched to South America with instructions to collect hardy and half-hardy trees and shrubs. After sending home from Rio Janeiro a consignment of plants collected in southern Brazil, he travelled by sea to Valparaíso in Chile from where he initially visited the montane forests of the Colombian Andes before visiting the extreme south of Chile from the shores of Tierra del Fuego to the southern coastal islands.
From the Valdivian temperate rain forests of Chile, Lobb brought back the Chilean firebush ("Embothrium coccineum"), the Chilean bellflower ("Lapageria rosea") (the national flower of Chile), the Flame nasturtium ("Tropaeolum speciosum") and the Chilean Lantern Tree ("Crinodendron hookerianum"). He also collected seeds of three species of myrtle tree, "Luma apiculata", "Ugni molinae" and "Luma chequen" as well as ""four most interesting Conifers for this country ... that South America produces"" – the Guaitecas cypress ("Pilgerodendron uviferum"), the Patagonian Cypress ("Fitzroya cupressoides"), "Prince Albert's Yew" ("Saxegothaea conspicua") and "Podocarpus nubigenus" as well as seeds of the hardy "Antarctic Beech" ("Nothofagus antarctica") and several other shrubs including "Escallonia macrantha".
From a visit to Chiloé Island, Lobb introduced "Berberis darwinii" which had been discovered in 1835 by Charles Darwin during the voyage of HMS "Beagle". According to the Gardeners' Chronicle:"If Messrs. Veitch had done nothing else towards beautifying our gardens, the introduction of this single species would be enough to earn the gratitude of the whole gardening world."
Lobb's finds were despatched to England where they were grown in Veitch's Exeter nursery before being sold to eager gardeners. Many of his discoveries have endured and remain popular garden shrubs today. One glasshouse at the Exeter nursery was reserved exclusively for William Lobb's discoveries, where James Veitch would tend the new plants and identify those that would become a commercial success and those that would be merely of botanical interest. Amongst the plants sent back by Lobb were two species of "Cantua" which he found growing in Bolivia, Chile and the Peruvian Andes; "C. buxifolia" (the ""Magic-flower"") which was the first to flower in May 1848 and the bushy "C. bicolor", with its large golden-red trumpet flowers.
There were also other species of nasturtium, including "Tropaeolum umbellatum" from Ecuador, with its orange-tipped red flowers, and what was thought to be an unknown species which was named "Tropaeolum lobbianum" by Hooker after its discoverer, although this was later found to be a synonym for "T. peltophorum" previously discovered by Karl Theodor Hartweg.
At the beginning of 1848, William Lobb arrived back in England and was re-united with his brother Thomas for the first time since setting off for Brazil in November 1840. Thomas in the meantime had also been despatched by Veitch to collect plants in Malaysia and Indonesia and had returned a few months earlier.
North America (1849–1853).
In 1849, Veitch decided to send William Lobb to collect in the cooler climate of North America in order to find conifers and hardy shrubs in Oregon, Nevada and California, ""with a view of obtaining seeds of all the most important kinds known, and, if possible, discover others."" Lobb reached San Francisco in the summer of 1849, at the height of the California Gold Rush; when he arrived the harbour was choked with hundreds of ships, abandoned by their crews who had joined the hopeful prospectors afflicted with ""gold fever"". Lobb soon left the lawless port and set off in search of ""horticultural gold"" in Southern California.
He spent the autumn of 1849 through to early 1851 in the Monterey area, including the Santa Lucia Mountains, where he soon found the striking Santa Lucia Fir ("Abies bracteata"), later described by Hooker as ""among the most remarkable of all true pines"". The cones sent back by Lobb were full of seed which were capable of being propagated by Veitch. In 1849, he visited Cone Peak, in Los Padres National Forest where he collected a new species of Lupin, "Lupinus cervinus" (Deer Lupine) which he sold to the California Academy of Sciences. In 1862, Dr Albert Kellogg recognized this as a taxon hitherto unknown to science. Kellogg noted that this was ""a very marked fine [attractive, robust species, worthy of cultivation"".
In the Monterey area Lobb also found "Rhododendron occidentale", one of only two deciduous "Rhododendron" species native to western North America which was to become the parent of many hybrid Rhododendrons, and a small Horse Chestnut, the California Buckeye ("Aesculus californica"). He also sent back seeds of various other conifers, including the Monterey Pine ("Pinus radiata"), the Bishop Pine ("P. muricata"), the Gray Pine ("P. sabiniana"), the Coulter Pine ("P. coulteri"), and the Knobcone Pine ("P. attenuata"); and also of many shrubs and flowering plants, most quite new to British gardens.
In the autumn of 1851, he moved north collecting large quantities of seed from the Sugar Pine ("Pinus lambertiana"), and the Western White Pine ("Pinus monticola"); he also collected sackfuls of seed from the world's tallest tree, the California Redwood ("Sequoia sempervirens"), which had been first introduced to Britain in 1843.
The following year, he moved further north into the regions explored by David Douglas in the 1820s, including the mountains of Oregon and the Columbia River. On this expedition he collected seeds of the Noble Fir ("Abies procera") and the Douglas Fir ("Pseudotsuga menziesii") as well as three conifers that had been overlooked by Douglas, the Colorado White Fir ("Abies concolor"), the Red Fir ("Abies magnifica") and the Western Red Cedar ("Thuja plicata"). On his way back to San Francisco at the end of 1852, he collected seed from the Grand Fir ("Abies grandis") and the Ponderosa Pine ("Pinus ponderosa") and another new discovery, the California Juniper ("Juniperus californica").
Lobb was the first collector to gather seed in bulk from trees that were still rare in England; the amount of viable seed he sent to Exeter enabled Veitch & Sons to grow thousands of seedling trees.
As well as the large number of conifers, Lobb discovered various shrubs including the red "Delphinium cardinale", the yellow "Fremontodendron californicum", a flowering currant "Ribes lobbii" (named after him) and a collection of Ceanothus including two natural hybrids, "C. x lobbianus" and "C. x veitchianus" which he found on the dry slopes and ridges of the high Californian chapparal.
Wellingtonia.
In 1853, Lobb was in San Francisco packing his collection of seeds to prepare them for shipment back to England when he received an invitation to a meeting of the newly formed California Academy of Science. At the meeting, Dr Albert Kellogg (the academy's founder and a keen amateur botanist) introduced a hunter named Augustus T. Dowd who had brought to him a story of a "Big Tree". Dowd told the audience that in the spring of 1852 he was employed as a hunter by the Union Water Company, of Murphy's Camp, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Calaveras County, to supply the workmen, who were engaged in the construction of a canal, with fresh meat. He had been out chasing a large Grizzly Bear; the long, hard chase led Dowd into a strange part of the forested hills where he followed the bear into a grove of gigantic trees. Dowd soon lost interest in the chase and wandered around in amazement at the sheer size of the trees surrounding him. On returning to his camp, Dowd told his story to his companions, most of whom did not believe him and accused him of being drunk; a week later, however, he was able to persuade some of the less sceptical to be led to the grove, where they were equally astonished by the monstrous trees.
Lobb immediately realised the impact such a tree would have on British gardens and the importance that his employers would attach to being the first nursery to offer it for sale. After the meeting, he quickly headed to Calaveras Grove where he had the good luck to find a recently fallen tree, which he measured as ""about 300 feet in length, 29 feet 2 inches, at 5 feet above the ground..."". In his notebooks, Lobb recorded: ""From 80 to 90 trees exist all within circuit of a mile, from 250ft. to 320ft. in height, 10–12ft. in diameter."" He collected as many seeds, cones, vegetative shoots and seedlings as he could carry back to San Francisco, including two small living trees. He then returned to England on the first available boat arriving back in Exeter on 15 December 1853, a year earlier than expected. Lobb had taken a gamble cutting short his contract, knowing that, at the risk of angering his employer, he had to get the seeds to England before anyone else could get back first. The gamble paid off as Veitch was delighted, abandoning all other projects to concentrate on raising the seedlings in commercial quantities. According to Hortus Veitchii, the two sapling trees ""survived but three or four years, nor was there at any time much hope of their living.""
On Christmas Eve 1853, an editorial in "The Gardeners' Chronicle" announced that Veitch & Son ""had received branches and cones of a remarkable tree from their collector in California, William Lobb"" who had described it as ""the monarch of the Californian forest"". James Veitch had immediately given specimens of the giant tree to John Lindley, professor of botany at the University of London and invited him to name the tree. In the Gardeners' Chronicle article, Lindley named the species "Wellingtonia gigantea" as a memorial to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington who had died in September the previous year. The ""giant amongst trees"" was considered an appropriate memorial for such an important British historical figure.
Six months later, the "Chronicle" reported that Veitch was offering seedlings of the tree at 2 guineas each or 12 guineas a dozen. Lobb could not claim to be first to introduce the tree to Britain, as a Scot, John Matthew, had taken some seed to Scotland four months earlier although he only distributed the seed among a few friends.
The Victorians fell in love with the tree in much the same way as they had with the Monkey-Puzzle tree a few years earlier, using it as a specimen tree and often planting it to form avenues, including James Bateman who planted an avenue at Biddulph Grange, alternating "Wellingtonia" with Monkey-Puzzle trees.
Unfortunately, the name "Wellingtonia gigantea" was invalid under the botanical code as the name "Wellingtonia" had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant ("Wellingtonia arnottiana" in the family "Sabiaceae"). Eventually in 1939, after several attempts to find an acceptable name, the tree was given the name "Sequoiadendron giganteum" by John Buchholz. In Britain, however, the tree remains known popularly as ""Wellingtonia"".
Later career and death.
By the middle of 1854, James Veitch and his son, James Veitch, Jr. (who had acquired premises in Kings Road, Chelsea, London in 1853), decided that it was time for William and his brother, Thomas, to be sent off again to collect fresh seed and search for yet more new plants. Thomas was sent back to the far East, to Java and North Borneo in search of "Nepenthes" pitcher plants.
William had been suffering from persistent ill-health for some time – James Veitch remarked that there was ""a sort of restlessness about him"" – and was exhibiting the symptoms of syphilis, probably contracted in the ports of South America. In a letter to Sir William Hooker, James Veitch noticed:"He seems taken with a sort of monomania, which it is difficult to describe and which he could not explain himself, a sort of excitability and want of confidence." Despite his concerns, in the autumn of 1854, Veitch sent Lobb back to California on another three–year contract. Lobb was unable to make any further new discoveries, but sent back consignments of plants and seeds from time to time until the end of 1856. In January 1857, Veitch wrote to Hooker: ""We hear Lobb has been ill, his writing appears shaky and I am inclined to think it is probable he will soon return.""
In the event, Lobb did not return to England and after the expiry of his contract in 1858 he remained in California. He sent back a small number of seeds to private collectors and to the Low nursery at Clapton, including a new variety of White Fir ("Abies concolor" subsp. "lowiana") (popularly known as ""Low's White Fir"" after them) and the rare Torrey Pine ("Pinus torreyana"). James Veitch complained to Lobb that he still had obligations to fulfill but Lobb was undeterred and caused Veitch further embarrassment by sending herbarium specimens and live plants direct to Sir William Hooker at Kew Gardens.
Communications from Lobb gradually ceased, to the alarm of both his family and Veitch, who wrote to Hooker: ""We thought he had given up collecting plants, for Californian gold."" His last communication to his family was in 1860.
On 3 May 1864, Lobb died forgotten and alone at St Mary's Hospital in San Francisco. The cause of death was recorded as ""paralysis"", but was probably as a result of syphilis. He had no mourners at his burial (on 5 May) in a public plot in Lone Mountain cemetery. In 1927, his headstone was moved to South Ridge Lawn and in 1940 to a crypt at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park under the care of the California Academy of Sciences.
A small memorial plaque can be found in Devoran church, Cornwall where his brother Thomas Lobb was buried in 1894.

In "Hortus Veitchii", the history of the Veitch family, Lobb's contribution to modern gardening is described thus:"The singular success which rewarded his researches is, perhaps, unparalleled in the history of botanical discovery; the labours of David Douglas not even forming an exception."
In her history of the Veitch family, "Seeds of Fortune – A Gardening Dynasty", Sue Shephard adds:"William was arguably one of the finest but least–known of collectors who gave gardeners some of the most remarkable trees and loveliest plants ever grown."
Legacy.
The old Garden Moss rose, ""William Lobb"" was named after Lobb by its French breeder, Jean Laffay (1795–1878), in 1855. It has deep purple flowers between three and four inches across with a strong scent.
Amongst the many other plants named after William Lobb are:

2009 Bulldogs RLFC season

The 2009 Bulldogs RLFC season was the 75th in the club's history. They competed in the NRL's 2009 Telstra Premiership, finishing the regular season 2nd (out of 16), a vast improvement on the previous season, when they came last. The Bulldogs came within one match of the grand final but were knocked out by the Parramatta Eels.
Season summary.
After an extremely disappointing 2008 season, in which the club finished with the wooden spoon, 2009 will be a season of rebuilding for the Bulldogs. A number of high-profile new recruits, including Brett Kimmorley, Josh Morris, Michael Ennis, David Stagg and Ben Hannant along with mid-season signing of Greg Eastwood will join the club.
Fixtures.
During the regular season, the Bulldogs will play most home games at ANZ Stadium in Homebush. ANZ Stadium is also the home ground of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and one of the home grounds of the Parramatta Eels, so Bulldogs away matches against these two teams will also be played at this venue. Two Bulldogs home games will be played away from Homebush: the Round 11 match against Melbourne will be played at Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford, and the Round 19 match against the Gold Coast will be played at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.

Franciszek Karpiński

Franciszek Karpiński (4 October 1741 – 16 September 1825) was the leading sentimental Polish poet of the Age of Enlightenment. He is particularly remembered for his religious works later rendered as hymns and carols. He is also considered one of the most original Polish writers of the early partitions. In his native Poland he was cherished during the Polish Romantic Period of the early 19th century.
Life.
Karpiński was born in 1741 in Hołosków near Kolomyia and educated at Stanisławów (then the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine). He attended university in Lwow, obtaining the title of Doctor of Philosophy. He spent a further eighteen months in Vienna, where he studied foreign languages. His first employment was as tutor in the magnate courts.
In 1780, his first volume of poetry came to the attention of the powerful Czartoryski family. Under their patronage, he travelled to Warsaw to become secretary to Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. He wrote three books of poetry, which saw great popularity, but after a few years he became disillusioned by the hypocrisy prevalent in the capital, and retired back to the Ukrainian countryside, by then under the Austrian partition.
Between 1785 and 1818 he worked as a tutor to the Branicki family in Białystok. There he wrote some of his most famous works, including "Bóg się rodzi, moc truchleje" ("God is Born, Power Trembles") and "Kiedy ranne wstają zorze" ("When the Morning Lights Arise"). It was primarily those religious and patriotic songs, hymns and carols that would be sung by later generations and immortalize his works in Poland. In 1800 he became a member of the newly formed Society of Friends of Science.
Several of his poems make romantic references to one "Justina"; for this he was known as "Justina's lover" during his lifetime. Some speculate he nicknamed all of his loves Justina, and that he referred to at least three different women by this name.
In 1818, he retired to a manor near Vawkavysk (now in Belarus), where he wrote his memoirs. He died on 16 September 1825.

Ward Prentice

Warden Selby Prentice (30 July 1886 – 26 February 1969) was an Australian sportsman who captained Australia at rugby union and New South Wales at first-class cricket and also played first-grade rugby league for the Western Suburbs Magpies.
Rugby union career.
Ward Prentice and four of his brothers played first grade rugby union in Sydney at various times and two others played in the lower grades. Ward and two of his brothers later played first grade rugby league. Ward's club career started with the his local Western Suburbs RUFC and he made his representative debut in 1908 for New South Wales against a touring Anglo-Welsh side.
In 1908 he was selected in the 31 man squad for the 1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of the British Isles and France. Chris McKivat was the standout incumbent five-eighth even though McKivat had greater career success at half-back. The selectors generally opted for Fred Wood, the tour vice-captain at half, with McKivat at fly-half. Prentice made a handful of tour match appearances at centre and at five-eighth and the Howell reference quotes Pollard ""he distinguished himself by his unselfish team play and clever-cross-kicking for his loose forwards and wingers...and was an astute cover-defender who on numerous occasions saved certain tries by launching himself at opposition wingers when they were set to score"." In the tour match before the first Test Prentice scored the try of the match stepping through the whole team before touching down in the corner 
Prentice made his Test debut against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park on 12 December 1908 at five-eighth and paired with McKivat. He set up the Wallabies' first try scored by Tom Richards though Australia lost the Test 6-9. Prentice had to leave the field twice for treatment after being kicked in the mouth and his injury caused him to miss the next five tour matches. In January he earned his second cap in the Test against England. He played at centre in the 9-3 win. By the end of the tour which also took in Canada and the USA, Prentice had played in 13 of the 35 matches.
In 1910 he represented for Australia in three internationals against New Zealand. His representative career highlight came in 1912 when he was selected as touring captain of the Wallabies squad for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the USA. The tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two California University sides and three Canadian provincial sides. They rose to the occasion for the sole Test of the tour against the United States where Prentice earned his final cap and kicked a penalty goal to score his only international career points. All told Ward Prentice played for Australia on thirty-two occasions including six Tests, one as captain.
Cricket career.
His first-class cricket debut came in 1913 when he kept wicket for Victor Trumper's New South Wales side, against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Although he fell for a duck in his only innings, he took the catches of both Queensland opening batsmen. Prentice had to wait until 1921 for his second and final first-class appearance when he captained New South Wales against the same opponents and on the same ground. Again playing as a wicket-keeper, Prentice made another duck and didn't take a catch.
Rugby league career.
In 1920, Prentice joined his brother Clarrie a Western Suburbs rugby league stalwart who played 115 games with the club in a war-interrupted career over nine years. Ward played five first grade games for the Magpies in the New South Wales Rugby League in season 1920. Their older brother Archie had also played for the club (27 games) in 1915-16.

Greeks in Denmark

There is a small community of Greeks in Denmark. , Statistics Denmark recorded 1,180 people of Greek origin living in Denmark, with 954 in Zealand, 177 in Jutland, 48 in Funen, and 1 in Bornholm.
History.
Unskilled migrants began coming from Evros and Kastoria to Denmark in the 1960s; they worked primarily in the fur trade. Most of those initial migrants have returned to Greece as this sector became economically depressed. Political refugees fleeing the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 were numerically minor, but evoked a great deal of sympathy from the politically liberal Danish population. The number of Greek international students choosing Denmark as their destination showed an uptick after 1981, when Greece became a member of the European Economic Community.
Gender issues.
Many migrants consist of Greek men in international marriages with Danish women. The number of Greek women married to Danish men is smaller. Either way, such relationships have an unusually high rate of divorce. Spouses typically return to Greece if they separate from their Danish partner.

Dublin quays

The Dublin quays refers to the two roadways and quays that run along the north and south banks of the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. The stretches of the two continuous streets have several different names, however all but three of the names (Swift's Row, Bachelors Walk and Usher's Island) share the same "Quay" designation. The quays have played an important part in Dublin's history. 
Much of the southern roadway and a portion of the north roadway is part of the N4 road while another portion of the north roadway is part of the N1 road.
Routes descriptions.
The name designations of the north roadway are (from west to east): Wolfe Tone Quay, Sarsfield Quay, Ellis Quay, Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Upper Ormond Quay, Lower Ormond Quay, Bachelors Walk, Eden Quay, Custom House Quay and North Wall Quay.
The name designations of the south roadway are (from west to east): Victoria Quay, Usher's Island, Usher's Quay, Merchant's Quay, Wood Quay, Essex Quay, Wellington Quay, Crampton Quay, Aston Quay, Burgh Quay, George's Quay, City Quay, Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Britain Quay.
A majority of the roadways in the city centre are one-way with the north roadway being eastward and the south being westward.
History.
Norman Vikings were the first settlers in Dublin and many Viking artifacts were found at what is now Wood Quay. The quays were first developed during the time of King John in the early 13th Century when the monarch licensed citizens to erect buildings on the River Liffey. They became the center of the Irish shipping trade until the 1800s when the river in this section was considered too shallow for the more modern heavy ships. 
The Custom House, one of Dublin's major landmarks on Custom House Quay, was completed in 1791. The quay takes its namesake from the building. Later, the Four Courts on Inns Quay was completed in 1802 and is currently home to the Supreme Court of Ireland and the High Court. Both were designed by renowned architect James Gandon.
Burgh Quay is named after Elizabeth Burgh, wife of Anthony Foster whose son was Rt. Hon. John Foster last speaker of the Irish House of Commons. ( Now the Bank of Ireland, College Green.)
Burgh Quay was once the site of the Tivoli Theatre.
The Corn Exchange Building designed by George Halpin in 1815 was approved by the Wide Streets Commissioners in 1816 and work commenced on this building soon afterward. Its granite facade still remains on Burgh Quay.
Shipping came as far upstream as Burgh Quay until 1879 when Butt Bridge was constructed.
Many of the buildings on Burgh Quay including No. 8 still retain remnants of the shopfronts designed for the Wide Streets commissioners. 
Recent years have brought much development to the quays. One controversial development was at Wood Quay by the Dublin Corporation in late 1970s when there were many archeological Viking finds. This led to a very public and unsuccessful campaign to halt the development.
In 2006, local politicians proposed renaming some of the quays. MEP Gay Mitchell proposed renaming George's Quay or Victoria Quay to Joyce Quay or Behan Quay, named for the iconic Irish writers James Joyce and Brendan Behan.
The Dublin quays in culture.
Many artists have found inspirations in and from the quays. Irish novelist James Joyce had many of his stories take place at the Dublin quays, including "An Encounter" and "Eveline". Joyce biographer Michael H. Begnal wrote, "Joyce associated the Liffey Quays with the desire for escape."
Artist Jack Butler Yeats painted "Dublin Quays" in 1916.
Author Frances A. Gerard described the Dublin quays in 1898 as follows: "Much of the picturesque appearance of Dublin is due to the Quays which intersect the City and the Bridges which span the Liffey; they impart to it a foreign air resembling the Quays of Paris."
Ushers Island was the name of a competitor in the 1994 Grand National at Aintree, falling at the third fence.
The Dead (1987 film) adapted from Joyce's story, was filmed by John Huston at Usher's Island. In the story "The Dead," the sisters Kate and Julia Morkan host their annual dance at their "dark gaunt house on Usher's Island."

Marina Smilets of Bulgaria

Marina Smilets () (before 1292 – 7 April 1355) was the eldest daughter of tsar Smilets of Bulgaria and his Byzantine wife, tentatively called Smiltsena Palaiologina.
Family.
The date and the place of Marina's birth are unknown, but she was born before her father's ascension on the Bulgarian throne in 1292, maybe in his official residence in Kran. Her mother was the daughter of sebastocrator Constantine Palaiologos and niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos. In the histories she was called just Smiltsena (Bulgarian: Смилцена; "the wife of Smilets"), without a name being given. Marina was the elder sister of tsar Ivan II of Bulgaria and Theodora, queen-consort of Serbia. Marina Smilets was maternal aunt of King - and later, Emperor - Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia.
Despina of Kran.
Tsar Smilets died in 1298 and Ivan II of Bulgaria succeeded him as emperor in Tarnovo. The new tsar was a child, and the government was in the hands of the widowed empress Smiltsena. Marina's mother apparently defeated Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil, who sought refuge in the Byzantine Empire and entered into Byzantine service. To meet this threat and the invasion of the Mongol prince Chaka, Smiltsena sought an alliance with Aldimir (Eltimir), the brother of the former ruler George Terter I. Aldimir was accordingly married to Marina and, if this had not happened earlier, was given the title of despotēs and invested with an extensive landholding around Kran. As his wife, Marina was granted the title of "despina of Kran".
Despina Marina gave birth to a son, called Ivan Dragushin.
The regents of Ivan II were unable to strengthen their position, and abandoned Tarnovo to Chaka, who installed himself as emperor in 1299. Smiltsena and Ivan II settled in the possessions of Aldimir and Marina, where they may have remained until the accession of Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav to the throne in 1300. Aldimir entered into an alliance with Theodore Svetoslav and his own possessions around Kran were enlarged. Аs result Aldemir maybe asked Marina's family to leave Kran and they fled to Constantinople.
Exile.
In 1305 Aldemir appears to have entered into negotiations with the Byzantines, and Theodore annexed his uncle's lands. Marina may have had a strong influence over the policy of her husband and, after Aldimir's subjugation by the Tsar, she and Ivan Dragushin fled to Constantinople.
After 1321 despina Marina and her son relocated in the Kingdom of Serbia, where the power was seized by King Stefan Dečanski, who was married Marina's sister Theodora. Marina was threatened with high respect by Dečanski and his son, Stefan Dušan, who was her nephew. In Serbia, Marina and her son were granted with an extensive landholding in Macedonia (region). Later she retired to a monastery under the monastic name Maria.
Marina was portrayed along with a boy, а grandson of her, in the church of Kavadarci in Pološko Monastery.
Marina Smilets survived her son and died on 7 April 1355. She was buried in Skopie.

Edgewood Manor

Edgewood Manor is located in Clarksburg, West Virginia on the east side of US Route 19 and State Route 20 North just one-fourth of a mile off of the West Pike Street Exit off Route 50. The structure was commissioned by Haze Morgan as a residence, who named it Edgewood Manor because it was constructed by day labor at the edge of the woods. The manor was designed by architect Steven Warder Ford, completed in 1914. Edgewood Manor is a buff brick 2½ story Craftsman home capped by a medium tiled hip roof with one hipped-roof dormer on the west side with three chimneys extending above the roofline. Edgewood Manor is eligible for listing in the National Register under Criterion C: Architecture as an outstanding example of an architect-designed Craftsman-style residence. The period of significance is 1914, which was the year construction was complete. Edgewood Manor has managed to maintain all of its original character and design elements with only minor changes having been made.
Grounds.
There are many trees dating from the 1920s which include Pin Oaks, Butternuts, several Species of Pines, Hawthornes, Beech, large rhododendron, one native American chestnut that is a grand specimen from the days before blight. Two of these trees are registered state and national champions. There is also a Koi pond.
Morgan Family.
Haze Morgan is a direct relative to the well-known Morgan family who has a long rich history with western Virginia and West Virginia. Haze Morgan had two famous great uncles, Colonel Morgan Morgan, first known white settler in what became West Virginia, and General Zackquill Morgan, founder of Morgantown in 1766. Zackquill’s great-grandson, Francis Harrison Pierpont was governor of both Virginia and West Virginia and is widely known as the “Father of West Virginia.” Haze Morgan was a lawyer in the Clarksburg area. He practiced law with John W. Davis, the only West Virginian to successfully enter the race for President of the United States.

Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi

Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi (in original orthography "Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roy") were a famous five-part string orchestra at the French royal court, existing from 1626 to 1761. 
History.
"Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi" (Engl. "The King's 24 Violins") were founded 1626 under Louis XIII. As part of the "Musique de la Chambre" they played an important role in the musical accompaniment of festivities and official events at the Versailles court. If needed they were reinforced by the wind instruments of the "Grande Ecurie", an ensemble that was primarily responsible for open-air and military occasions, or they performed together with the orchestra of the opera. Members of the "Vingt-quatre Violons" had to have an impeccable reputation and had to be Roman Catholic. Their privileges included tax exemption and the right to carry a rapier. Among the members of the ensemble were Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Féry Rebel, his son François Rebel and Jacques Aubert.
In 1656, under Louis XIV, the "Vingt-quatre Violons" were supplemented by an orchestra consisting of 16, later 21 strings. The new ensemble was called "La petite bande", the "Vingt-quatre Violons" were dubbed "La grande bande". In 1761, the orchestra was disbanded, mainly for financial reasons, and was merged with the "Chapelle Royale", then responsible solely for religious festivities.
Instrumentation.
The five-part instrumentation of the "Vingt-quatre Violons" consisted of the following string instruments:
The three middle parts were played by violas of identical tuning, but different sizes (body lengths 37.5 cm, 45 cm and 52.5 cm), resulting in different timbres and volumes. The basses de violon were tuned a whole step lower than a modern cello but were roughly the same size and shape. The group could be further augmented by the addition of violones doubling the basses de violon. Sometimes a bass viol could be substituted for a basse de violon; the Petite Bande also included several viol players. The instrumentation of the "Vingt-quatre Violons" greatly influenced the five-part string writing that prevailed in 17th and 18th century France, especially the early-18th-century French orchestral symphonies of Jean-Féry Rebel, etc.

Annals of the Twenty-Ninth Century

Annals of the Twenty-Ninth Century: or, The Autobiography of the Tenth President of the World-Republic is a science fiction novel written by Andrew Blair, and published anonymously in 1874.
Blair's work is one of a group of early science fiction novels that are now little known, but were influential in their own time — a group that includes Edward Maitland's "By and By" (1873), Percy Greg's "Across the Zodiac" (1880), and John Jacob Astor IV's "A Journey in Other Worlds" (1894). Blair tells an extravagant tale of a future age in which the peoples of the Earth have been united in a Christian "Mundo-Lunar Republic," and other planets in the solar system have been reached and their native inhabitants encountered.
One modern critic has called Blair's book "a hodge-podge of interplanetary travel and super-scientific inventions" but also "a speculation of Stapledonian magnitude." In the view of another, Blair portrays "the union of science and religion...under the sign of a positivist Deism mixed up with various utopian socialisms, and progressing from one technological wonder to another."

Simeto

The Simeto (; Sicilian: Simetu ; Greek Σύμαιθος) is a 113 km long river in Sicily, southern Italy. It is the second longest river on the island after the Salso (also known as Southern Imera), but the most important in terms of watershed and for the population of the nearby areas. All of its course is included in the province of Catania.
Its source is located near Bronte, from the union of several streams of the Nebrodi Mountains. After receiving its first affluence, the Troina, the river starts running southwards into a spectacular canyon of lava from eruptions of Mount Etna. Near Adrano, Simeto constitutes the boundary between the province of Catania and that of Enna, and receives the Salso, then flows near Paternò.
Simeto's final course is slower and twisting, being all included in the plain of Catania; its last confluences are with the Dittaino and the Gornalunga, before flowing into the Ionian Sea south to the metropolitan area of Catania.

Baby (Thorup novel)

Baby is a 1973 novel by Danish author Kirsten Thorup. It deals with the disadvantaged members of society, those who have failed to make a mark.
The novel traces the movements of a selection of losers as they leave a cheap Copenhagen nightclub. There is Mark, a car salesman heavily in debt who ultimately separates from his pretty wife, Suzie who goes off to Sweden on a drunken escape, Leni who translates porno rather than the book she would like to complete, and many others. The losers are contrasted with Eddy, a loan shark, who causes increasing distress among his clients.
The overall message seems to be that nothing really matters, everything is reduced to the same low common denominator. The book is written in a simple style that is easy to read—whether as a novel or as an ambitious experiment.
The novel was awarded the Pegasus Prize for Literature in 1979.

Kirkcaldie &amp; Stains

Kirkcaldie & Stains is a mid-sized department store in Wellington, New Zealand. It was established in 1863 by John Kirkcaldie and Robert Stains with a capital of £700. The first store was opened on Lambton Quay. A new store was built in 1864. In 1868 Kirkcaldie & Staines moved to their current location at the corner of Lambton Quay and Brandon Street, expanding several times. They also had a branch in Napier from 1897 until 1917.
There was also a branch on Cuba street for 7 years. French luxury skincare brand Sisley is exclusive to the store in New Zealand.
Brief History
1863 - Business founded by Scotsman John Kirkcaldie, who had been apprenticed as a draper; and Englishman Robert Stains, who had a retail trade background. The men met in Sydney, Australia, and decided to pool their capital to establish a business in New Zealand. They settled on Wellington as the place, and their first store was the hulk of a wrecked ship, at Lambton Quay. Kirkcaldie & Stains opened for business in 'Waterloo House' on Wednesday 9th December 1863.
1864 - As the business grew a new two storey store was built in the same location.
1868 - Moved to new premises on land reclaimed from the harbour, corner of Lambton Quay and Brandon Streets. This site is part of the block of land still occupied by the business today.
1871 - 1876 - Branch store on the corner of Ghuznee and Cuba Streets, Wellington
1886 - Robert Stains returns to England and the partnership was dissolved. The business remained in the hands of the Kirkcaldie family until the 1930s.
1897 & 1908 - Extensions to the 1868 premises. 1908 extensions give the business the façade for which it is still famous today.
1897 - 1917 - Branch store in Napier, New Zealand. Since this branch was closed Kirkcaldie and Stains has been a single location business.
1931 - Business sold by the Kirkcaldie family to British Overseas Stores, an organisation with retail stores around the world.
1985 - Business bought by Renouf Corporation (later Hellaby Holdings). Significant redevelopment of premises, including construction of two 14 storey business towers at rear of block, completed 1989.
1994 - Hellaby Holdings sells business, stock bought primarily by people of Wellington, including staff and customers.
According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek: ""The company, through its subsidiary, Kirkcaldie & Stains Properties Limited, owns the Harbour City Centre consisting of two levels of retail shops with six floors of commercial office space and associated car parking in the district of Wellington."" This represents the redevelopment of part of the real estate which was at one time occupied by the department store.

Digendra Kumar

Digendra Kumar (born 3 July, 1969) is a former member of the 2nd Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles regiment of the Indian army. He was awarded the Mahavir Chakra on 15 August, 1999, for his acts of bravery in the Kargil War. He retired from the army on 31 July, 2005.
Family.
Kumar was born into the Jat family of Shivdan Singh Paraswal and lived in the village of Jhalara, Tehsil Neem-Ka-Thana, in the Sikar District in Rajasthan, India. His mother's name was Rajkaur. Shivdan Singh was a strong follower of Arya Samaj, who joined the Indian army and was badly wounded in Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
Army career.
Kumar joined the 2nd Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles on 3 September, 1985. After training was complete, his battalion was posted to Kashmir. In 1987 he was selected for the Indian Peace Keeping Force and took part in Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka.
Operation Pawan.
Operation Pawan was the code name assigned to operations by the Indian Peace Keeping Force to take control of Jaffna from the LTTE in late 1987, enforcing the disarmament of the LTTE as a part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. After fighting that lasted for about three weeks, the IPKF took control of the Jaffna Peninsula from the LTTE, something that the Sri Lankan army had attempted and failed to achieve for several years. Supported by Indian army tanks, helicopter gunships, and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE, although they lost 214 soldiers in the process.
Kumar and his group were assigned to patrol dominant areas in Tamil. Five Tamil militants fired and killed five soldiers from Kumar's squad. In return, Kumar and the remaining soldiers of his squad followed the militants into the house of an MLA. However, the MLA opposed the action, and in the ensuing firefight the MLA, along with the five Tamil militants, was killed. This caused some controversy, and Kumar was penalised and remanded.
Meanwhile, 36 soldiers of the 10th Parachute Regiment were captured and held by the LTTE. Lt. Gen. A.S. Kalkat assigned the task of freeing them to Kumar. Kumar took with him 50 kg ammunition and some biscuits and sailed up the river. Kumar saved the soldiers (who had been held in the forest for 72 hours), destroyed an important ammunition depot, and killed 39 militants.
Role in the Kargil war.
Major Vivek Gupta, of the 2nd Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles and his company were given the task of recapturing Point 4590 on Tololing Hill in the Dras sector. The objective was to capture the enemy post, located at high altitude (15,000 feet). 
Kumar commanded the Light Machine Gun Group during his company's assault. Besides Kumar, the commando team included Major Vivek Gupta, Subedar Bhanwar Lal Bhakar, Subedar Surendra Singh Rathor, Lance Naik Jasvir Singh, Naik Surendra, Naik Chaman Singh Tewatia, Lans Naik Bachchan Singh, CMH Jashvir Singh, and Havaldar Sultan Singh Narwar.
The Pakistani army had made 11 bunkers on the Tololing hilltop. Kumar was to target the first and the last bunkers. The other commandos were to target the remaining 9 bunkers.
On 13 June, 1999, while nearing its objective, the Assault Group came under enemy fire and took casualties. Subedar Bhanwar Lal Bhakar, Lance Naik Jasvir Singh, Naik Surendra, and Naik Chaman Singh were all killed. Major Vivek Gupta himself was killed by a bullet wound to the head.
Although Kumar was hit by a bullet in his left arm, he kept firing on the enemy with his light machine gun. His fire facilitated his men's advancement, allowing them to physically assault the enemy position and clear the area after a hand-to-hand fight.
Medals and awards.
Mahavir Chakra.
The nation's second-highest wartime gallantry award, the Mahavir Chakra, was awarded to Kumar on 15 August, 1999, for daring actions and service to his country during the Kargil War, specifically by occupying Tololing Hill.
Other awards.
Kumar was awarded the Sena Medal in 1993 for his anti-terrorist operations in the Kupwara area of Jammu-Kashmir. In 1994 his services were appreciated for recapturing the Hazratbal Shrine from terrorists.
Movie.
The 2003 Bollywood war film "LOC Kargil" is based on the Kargil War. It was written and directed by J. P. Dutta. Actor Avtar Gill played the role of Digendra Kumar.

<doc id="20791072" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20791072" title="Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs">
Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs

The "Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs" was a speech delivered on November 25, 1969, by U.S. President Richard Nixon. In the speech, Nixon announced the end of the U.S. offensive biological weapons program and reaffirmed a no-first-use policy for chemical weapons. The statement excluded toxins, herbicides and riot-control agents as they were not chemical and biological weapons, though herbicides and toxins were both later banned. The decision to ban biological weapons was influenced by a number of domestic and international issues.
Push for a U.S. ban.
When Richard Nixon selected Melvin Laird as his Secretary of Defense in early 1969, Laird directed the Department of Defense to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. biological warfare (BW) programs. Laird's push for a review of both the chemical and biological programs arose when Congress attempted to push the Pentagon for open, joint Congressional hearings on chemical-biological warfare (CBW). The Pentagon balked and the result was Laird's memo to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger urging a review of those weapons programs.
Laird hoped to eliminate the U.S. BW program. He saw two reasons to kill the BW program. The first was political—eliminating the program could deflect growing protests over Vietnam. The second was budgetary: As a U.S. Representative, Laird had watched Pentagon BW budgets balloon during the Kennedy and Johnson years. With Laird's impetus, and the concurrence of the National Security Council staff, in late May 1969 Kissinger directed key administration officials to begin a review of CBW "policies, programs and operational concepts" with a report to be issued no later than September.
Surprisingly, Laird found the Joint Chiefs of Staff receptive to BW elimination as well. In twice weekly meetings with the Joint Chiefs during 1969 Laird found none of the officers opposed to ending the U.S. BW program. They found the weapons ineffective and militarily useless, especially when compared to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Joint Chiefs made two demands, one was to continue defensive germ warfare research and the other was that they be allowed to maintain the U.S. chemical arsenal as a deterrent to the Soviet Union.
In June 1969 Kissinger asked a former Harvard colleague, Matthew Meselson to prepare a position paper on U.S. chemical and biological weapons programs. Meselson and Paul Doty then organized a private conference to discuss policy issues. The result was a September 1969 paper that not only urged U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol but an end to U.S. BW programs. Meselson and his colleagues argued that a biological attack would likely inflict a great toll on civilian populations while remaining largely militarily ineffective.
Executive action on BW was followed by congressional action on chemical warfare (CW). In August 1969 the Senate passed an amendment to the Military Procurement Bill which unilaterally renounced first-use of chemical weapons. The Senate action also issued a moratorium on the acquisition of new chemical weapons as well as de-emphasizing the need for CW readiness. The bill passed 91-0, although some senators expressed reservations about the CW provisions.
Statement.
Nixon issued his "Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs" on November 25, 1969 in a speech from Fort Detrick. The same day he gave a speech from the Roosevelt Room at the White House further outlining his earlier statement. The statement ended, unconditionally, all U.S. offensive biological weapons programs. Nixon noted that biological weapons were unreliable and stated: The United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents and weapons, and all other methods of biological warfare. The United States will confine its biological research to defensive measures such as immunization and safety measures.
In his speech Nixon called his move "unprecedented"; and it was in fact the first review of the U.S. BW program since 1954. Despite the lack of review, the BW program had increased in cost and size since 1961; when Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually. Nixon's statement confined all biological weapons research to defensive-only and ordered the destruction of the existing U.S. biological arsenal.
The Nixon statement also addressed the topics of chemical warfare and U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol, which, at the time, the nation had yet to ratify. On chemical warfare Nixon reaffirmed no-first-use of chemical weapons by the United States. He also announced that the United States would reconsider ratification of the Geneva Protocol, which Nixon recommended to the Senate that year.
Omissions.
The presidential statement purposely omitted certain agents, while others were simply overlooked. In an exception to the no-first-use policy, which his statement reaffirmed, Nixon made a deference for riot-control agents and herbicides. Both were in use in Vietnam and both had been lightning rods for criticism. Nixon promised later memorandums concerning abolition of both types of agents; herbicide use in Vietnam was discontinued in 1970 but riot-control agent use continued.
The other major omission from Nixon's statement were toxins. His statement did not specifically address toxins, such as ricin, which tend to blur the line between chemical and biological weapons. As debate within the Army raged over whether toxins were considered chemical or biological weapons concerning the president's order, work on them continued at Fort Detrick, the "hub" of U.S. biological weapons programs. For several months following the November order, the Army continued working on staphylococcus enterotoxin type B (SEB). On February 20, 1970 Nixon added toxins, regardless of their means of production - be it chemical or biological, to the U.S. ban on biological weapons.
Results and legacy.
The statement immediately led to National Security Decision Memorandum 35 from Nixon, which was also dated November 25, 1969. The memorandum also stated that the U.S. government renounced all "lethal methods" and "all other methods" of biological warfare, it also stated that the U.S. would only conduct BW research and development for defensive purposes.
U.S. biological weapons stocks were destroyed over the next few years. A $12 million disposal plan was undertaken at Pine Bluff Arsenal, where all U.S. anti-personnel biological agents were stored. That plan was completed in May 1972 and included decontamination of facilities at Pine Bluff. Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as wheat stem rust, were stored at Beale Air Force Base and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. These anti-crop agents, along with agents at Fort Detrick used for research purposes were destroyed in March 1973.
Nixon closed his statement, "Mankind already carries in its own hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction. By the examples we set today, we hope to contribute to an atmosphere of peace and understanding between nations and among men." Shortly after Nixon's statement the United States and the Soviet Union began the SALT arms control talks, which eventually resulted in nuclear arms controls as well as the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The U.S. commitment to end BW programs helped provide the lead for ongoing talks led by the United Kingdom in Geneva. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing biological warfare.
Nixon's renunciation is often overlooked in discussions about his presidency and his presidential legacy. Books about Nixon devote little space to the act and those centered on the topic of arms-control, even less. The abandonment of an entire class of weapons remains unrepeated in U.S. history. In addition, Melvin Laird's role in the elimination of offensive U.S. biological capabilities has been largely overlooked.
Nixon's motivation.
Scholars and critics have argued that Nixon's decision to ban biological weapons was purely politically motivated. This move was seen as a way to placate national, Congressional, and international concerns. It was also seen as a way to progress arms-control talks, additionally it could have stymied the outcry over the use of non-lethal chemical agents in Vietnam. In reality, the issue was much more complex than even those reasons suggest.
Meselson and others had argued that biological weapons amounted to little more than a cheap version of a nuclear weapon, and were easily attainable. Biological weapons represented a significant threat in the hands of less-well-armed, poorer nations, and Nixon surely recognized this "asymmetrical" threat. The administration eventually came to the conclusion that any biological threat could be easily countered with the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
Nixon recognized that the BW program was unpopular and decided that there was no real reason to continue these programs. While there were some political considerations involved in Nixon's decision, the end result brought the topic into international forums for years following his declaration. The media characterized Nixon's decision as a sudden awareness of the horrific nature of chemical-biological warfare.
Nixon hoped that the move would bolster both the image of his administration and the United States as a whole. He also wanted to score points with the Democratic majority in Congress and he had chosen to do this through various arms control measures. Nixon knew Democrats could not afford to oppose his renunciation of BW programs in light of rising opposition to the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam and other events such as the Skull Valley sheep kill in Utah. Thus, the idealistic language Nixon used in his November statement was only part of the story. Besides the issue of proliferation raised by Meselson, the specter of growing dissent over Vietnam loomed large, as did the fact that the U.S. had never ratified the Geneva Protocol. In the end, Nixon was motivated to ban biological weapons in the United States by a host of issues.

Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany

Between 1851 and 1860, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, an independent Italian state until 1859 when it joined the United Provinces of Central Italy, produced two postage stamp issues which are among the most prized classic stamp issues of the world, and include the most valuable Italian stamp.
Tuscany's modern history.
The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was an independent Italian state from 1569 to 1859, but was occupied by France from 1808 to 1814. The Duchy comprised most of the present area of Tuscany, and its capital was Florence. In December 1859, the Grand Duchy officially ceased to exist, being joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia a few months later in March 1860.
In 1862 it became part of Italy.
Pre stamp letters.
Tuscany's mail service may be traced to private letter services operating between 1300 and 1400. In 1704, Gian Gastone de' Medici issued a decree converting the postal service to a state operation and regulating the posting, transport and delivery of letters in detail. The original service ran only between Florence, Pisa and Livorno.
Prior to the introduction of postage stamps in 1851, letters typically were sent postage due, with various postal markings added to the letter. Postal markings were originally hand written on the letters, and in about 1767, postal markings began to be added by rubber stamp, indicating the town of origin. In 1839, postal markings were introduced indicating the date the letter was mailed. Tuscany's pre-stamp letters and postal markings have received extensive philatelic study. The primary study of them is Paolo Vollmeier's "I Bolli Postali Toscani del Periodo Prefilatelico fino al 1851," Florence, 1974.
Postal treaties.
On December 31, 1838, Tuscany signed a postal agreement with the Kingdom of Sardinia and on April 8, 1839, it signed a similar agreement with Austria. These agreements regulated postal rates and procedures for transporting mail between the countries.
Another postal convention between Tuscany and Austria was signed on December 1850, which addressed the exchange of mail between the countries and contemplated the introduction of adhesive stamps. Postal conventions with Sardinia and France were entered into in 1851.
Tuscany's adhesive stamps.
Il Marzocco.
On April 1, 1851, Tuscany issued its first adhesive postage stamps. The stamps depict a crowned lion resting a paw on a shield with the fleur-de-lis. The image is based on the Renaissance sculpture by Donatello of a lion called the "Marzocco" which was originally commissioned for Pope Martin V and moved in 1812 to the Piazza della Signoria in Florence where it became a symbol of Florentine liberties. The stamps shared a common design, differing only in color and denomination. The stamps were initially issued in denominations of 1 and 2 soldi, and 2, 4 and 6 crazie. In July 1851, 1 and 9 crazie stamps were issued and in 1852, Tuscany introduced a 1 quattrino for mailing newspapers and a 60 crazie stamp for international use. The Tuscan lira was divided into 12 crazie, or 20 soldi or 60 quattrini.
These stamps were printed by typography by F. Cambiagi at the Grand Ducal Printing Office in Florence. The stamps were engraved by Giuseppe Niderost from which electrotypes were prepared by M. Alessandri of Florence. The stamps were imperforate and were printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each. The paper was lightly toned blue or gray and was watermarked with rows of the Crown of Tuscany between parallel lines.
Between 1857 and 1859, the stamps, other than the 2 soldi and 60 crazie values, were reissued in the same or similar colors, but printed on white paper with a watermark with intersecting curved lozenges and the words "II E RR POSTE TOSCANE". These, like the prior issue, were typographed, imperforate and printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each.
Arms of Savoy.
Grand Duke Leopold II abdicated on July 21, 1859, and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand IV, who was deposed after 27 days. Tuscany briefly became part of the United Provinces of Central Italy, a short-lived client state of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, which resulted in Sardinian currency being introduced in which one lira was divided into 100 centesimi. On 7 November 1859, the United Provinces elected Eugenio Emanuele di Savoia-Carignano as their regent. A new series of provisional stamps was issued on January 1, 1860, using the same border, but the lion was replaced with the arms of the House of Savoy. Like the prior two issues, these stamps were typographed, imperforate and printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each. In March 1860, Tuscany was annexed to Sardinia, after which Tuscany used the stamps of Sardinia, and in 1862, Italy.
Tuscany's postage stamps are among the most highly prized and collected classic stamps and have been extensively studied by philatelists. The primary study on them is F. Bargagli Petrucci's "I Bolli Postali Toscani del Periodo Filatelico dal 1851" (1976). The three lire stamp of the 1860 issue in mint condition is the most valuable Italian stamp.
Forgeries.
Tuscany's postage stamps have been forged numerous times for the philatelic market. Fernand Serrane stated in 1927 that "a small book would be needed to describe in detail the more than 100 or so counterfeits of the first two Tuscany issues."

Castello Normanno (Paternò)

The Castello Normanno ("Norman Castle") is a castle in Paternò, Sicily, southern Italy.
History.
The castle was built in 1072 by Count Roger I of Sicily to protect the Simeto valley from Islamic raids. The first nucleus of the fortress was soon enlarged, and it subsequently lost its original military functions. Under Henry VI it was made the seat of the Count of Paternò, assigned to his fellow Swabian Bartholomew of Luci. Later the castle housed kings and queens, such as Henry's son Emperor Frederick II, Eleanor of Anjou and Blanche I of Navarre, as the castle had been included in the so-called "Camera Reginale" estates ("Queen's Chamber") by King Frederick III of Sicily.
The Chamber was abolished in the 15th century, and in 1431 the castle was acquired by the Special family; until 1456 it was owned by the Moncada. Used as a jail, in the following centuries it became increasingly decayed, until restorations work begun in the 19th century brought it back to its ancient prominence.
Description.
The castle has a rectangular plan, on three floors, with a height of 34 m. Originally, it had Ghibelline-style merlons, of which today only remains can be seen. Notable is the colour effect created by the dark shade of the stones and the frames of the Gothic-style mullioned windows, in white limestone.
The first-storey houses several service chambers and the Chapel of St. John, decorated with precious 13th-century frescoes. The piano nobile houses a large Weapons Hall. The king's residence was located in the upper floor.

BETT

BETT or The BETT show (formerly known as the British Educational Training and Technology Show) is an annual trade show in the United Kingdom that showcases the use of information technology in education. Founded in 1985, it has expanded to fill both the National and Grand Halls at the Olympia exhibition centre in London, England, with the result that from 2013 it will move to the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands. BETT celebrated its 25th anniversary at the 2009 show.
The show was first held in January 1985 as the “Hi Technology and Computers in Education Exhibition” at the Barbican Centre, central London, in association with the British Educational Equipment Association. As the use of technology in education increased, so did the show, and had outgrown the Barbican by 1993, when the move to Olympia was made.
The show has also expanded from being a purely technology show, and whilst there are stands for companies ranging from multinationals Microsoft and Apple Inc. to small single-product firms, others attending include the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and teaching unions such as the NASUWT and National Union of Teachers.
BETT attracts around 30,000 visitors from over 100 different countries including school leaders and practitioners as well as ICT Frontline staff with an average annual budget of £46,238. Around 700 technology companies who market to schools, colleges and education establishments exhibit at the show.
A large number of seminars from well-known providers are held at BETT, which offer training (Continuing Professional Development) opportunities for education professionals.
Criticised in the past for perhaps marginalising teachers due to the increasing business nature of the show, the producers (EMAP) have introduced a number of teacher friendly events such as TeachMeet to tackle this.
Awards.
The BETT Awards are an annual celebration for the highest levels of achievement by companies that exhibit at the BETT show and supply Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for education.

Jean Dominique Adam

Jean Dominique Adam (b.1795 - d. 1842) was an illustrious French Archetier / Bowmaker. Son of, Jean Adam (b.1767; d. 1849), who was also a bowmaker (and started a family dynasty that lasted three generations).
Born in Mirecourt December 29, 1795 Jean started under the tutelage of his father. His ability soon surpassed that of his teacher, as he drew his inspiration from Etienne Pajeot and Tourte T.
With his position in this family of bowmakers, certainly he was a big influence to the up-and-coming makers, as was his own work also affected by those returning from Paris.
His son Jean “Grand Adam” bettered his father’s skills but decided to move on to Paris, while Jean stayed his entire life in Mirecourt. -died October 6, 1842.
Consensus seems to articulate that his octagonal bows are very much in demand and that only his best bows are stamped.
"François Tourte possessed not only the ingenuity to bring the bow to perfection, but also the skill to make bows of unsurpassed quality which are still sought after by players and emulated by makers."
"Both Jean Dominique and his son "Grand" Adam seemed to favor François Tourte's design (octagonal sticks) and thus produced a great many octagonal bows." - Gennady Filimonov

Erhard Kroeger

Erhard Kroeger or “Kröger” (24 March 1905, Riga - 28 September 1987) was a Latvian-born Baltic German SS officer involved in the resettlement of Baltic Germans before World War II, and later attached to General Andrey Vlasov and the German sponsored Russian Liberation Army of World War II.
Early years.
Erhard Kroeger grew up in Riga, Latvia, a member of the historic Baltic German minority there. In his youth he played ice hockey with Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt. Kroeger made his name as an SS activist challenging the conservative Baltic German leadership of Wilhelm von Rüdiger and trying to Nazify the Latvian German minority before 1939.
“In July 1937 the new VOMI chief ordered Eric Mundel, who in 1935 had replaced Rüdiger as the leader of the Volksgemeinschaft German minority association, to bring Kröger into the leadership.”
Germany.
At the height of the Sudetenland crisis and Hitler’s guarantees that he had no further territorial interests in Europe: “Kröger.…without authorization from Berlin, assured his followers that the Fuhrer had not abandoned them, implying that revision remained a possibility.”
SS Sturmbannführer Kroeger was admonished by his SS and VOMI superiors and visited Berlin in September 1939 where he was secretly advised of the Nazi plans to trade Latvia and Estonia to Joseph Stalin. In a post-war document he related:
“The only thing that rushed through my mind was the salvation of an essential and closely linked ethnic group which, it seemed to me, was at this moment already threatened with certain destruction without even knowing it.”
At a meeting with Heinrich Himmler Kroeger stressed the serious hostility and animosity of the Communists to the Baltic Germans following the Russian civil war.
“The next day Himmler received him for a second time. He had spoken to Hitler, and he told Kroeger that “the Fuhrer agreed with the evacuation of the Baltic German community as a whole, but stipulated that this should be done with the approval of the Soviet government.” Himmler also reported that the Baltic Germans were to be settled in those parts of Poland annexed to the Reich, including Posen and West Prussia.”
Erhard Kroeger then worked extremely hard to ensure as many as 60,000 Baltic Germans were allowed to leave Estonia and Latvia over the autumn of 1939 to be settled in Germany.
Einsatzkommando.
Following the Nazi attack on Soviet Union SS-Sturmbannführer Erhard Kroeger was engaged in security details between June and November 1941, as part of an Einsatzgruppen.
From June to November 1941 commanded Einsatzkommando 6 of Einsatzgruppe C. Was decorated with the Iron Cross while commander of the Einsatzkommando. SS-Oberführer. Head of Sonderkommando Ost which was set up by the SD. In 1943 was enlisted in Division SS "Hohenstaufen". Also Head of the Russian desk in Leitstelle Ost under Arlt from July 1944.
Vlasov.
In 1944 the SS took an interest in General Andrey Vlasov and his Russian Liberation Movement and in summer the head of the SS main leadership office, SS Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger, specifically appointed Kroeger as a formal liaison officer between Vlasov and the SS.
Postwar.
Until 1962 he lived under assumed names in the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland and in Bologna. After the District Court of Wuppertal on 10 January 1962 had an arrest warrant on suspicion Kroeger, during the war have been involved in massacres to be issued, he was on 31 Steinmaur Sünikon-December 1965 in the canton of Zurich arrested. The Land of North Rhine-Westphalia then made a formal extradition request. Kroeger argued that the killings were politically motivated and would therefore form after the Swiss law does not auslieferungswürdigen event. The Swiss Federal Court rejected this argument, however, from and agreed to his extradition. After the extradition to Germany and the issuance of a second arrest warrant on 22 February 1966 was Kroeger, 17 May 1966 until 5 October 1967 held in custody. On 31 Kroeger was sentenced in July 1969 by the District Court of Tuebingen to three years and four months in prison. [3 The method was the subject of the mass killing of Jews in Western Ukraine between June 1941 and February 1942.

Dragon kill points

Dragon kill points or DKP are a semi-formal score-keeping system (loot system) used by guilds in massively multiplayer online games. Players in these games are faced with large scale challenges, or raids, which may only be surmounted through the concerted effort of dozens of players at a time. While many players may be involved in defeating a boss, the boss will reward the group with only a small number of items desired by the players. Faced with this scarcity, some system of fairly distributing the items must be established. Used originally in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game "Everquest", dragon kill points are points that are awarded to players for defeating bosses and redeemed for items that those bosses would 'drop'. At the time most of the bosses faced by the players were dragons, hence the name.
While not transferable outside of a particular guild, DKP are often treated in a manner similar to currency by guilds. They are paid out at a specified rate and redeemed in modified first or second price auctions, although these are not the only methods by which DKP may be redeemed or awarded. However, Dragon kill points are distinct from the virtual currencies in each game world which are designed by the game developers—DKP systems vary from guild to guild and the points themselves only have value in regards to the dispersal of boss 'loot'.
Origin and motivation.
DKP systems were first designed for "Everquest" in 1999 by Thott as part of the creation of a guild called "Afterlife" and named for two dragons, Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen. Since then, it has been adapted for use in other similar online games, in World of Warcraft for example an Avatar named Dragonkiller started its popular use and other programmers designed applications so that the system could work in game as an application to track data for achievements made. Unlike pen and paper or more traditional role-playing video games, massively multiplayer online games could present challenges so significant that the number of players required to defeat them would greatly exceed the number of items awarded to the raid following the boss kill—a raid of 25 individuals may only see two or three items 'drop'. The actual number of players required to defeat a specific boss varies from game to game, but the person-hours invested are non-trivial. Raid encounters may involve "10-200 players organized to achieve a common goal over a period of typically around 3-6 continuous hours" and demand teamwork and competence from all raid members.
As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts. Since these items appear, or "drop", in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary. At the "endgame", new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player. As such, individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items. Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games. As the number of players expands, rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member. Games and dungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems. Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications, including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill.
Mechanics of a DKP system.
The basic concepts of most DKP systems are simple. Players are given points for participating in raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item. A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future. These points, while earned and spent like currency, are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world. The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players. Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless. These measures vary considerably in usage. Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses. Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding. A few common variations are described below.
Zero-sum DKP.
Zero-sum DKP systems are designed to ensure the net change in points among the raid is zero for each item dropped, as the name might suggest. When the item drops, each player who is interested in it indicates as much to a guild leader. The player who has the highest DKP total receives the item for its specified price and the same number of points are divided evenly among the rest of the raid and given out, resulting in no net change to the raid total. As a result, the raid would only be rewarded DKP if at least one player desired the item dropped by the boss. Since over time guilds will revisit the same boss multiple times, some zero-sum DKP systems are modified to introduce a "dummy" character which may be awarded DKP for the boss 'kill' even though no player in the guild received an item. This is purely an accounting measure and allows the guild to reward players for defeating a boss if they are using an automated point tracking system.
Simple DKP.
The simplest DKP variation is one where every item has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid. Like zero-sum systems, the player with the most points recorded actually received the item, paying the specified price. Unlike zero-sum, a simple DKP system does not compensate the rest of the raid based in the value of the items received.
Auction systems.
Setting "prices" in DKP for specific items can be difficult, as analysis of a particular item can be subjective and laborious. In order to avoid this quandary, guilds may establish an auction system for items. Points are awarded to the player at some specified rate and when the items are awarded to the raid group, players bid DKP for the item of their choice. Auctions may be conducted in an open ascending fashion or through sealed bids over private messages to guild leaders. While this process results in relatively efficient allocation of items to players willing to part with DKP, it presents the social consequence that perceived selfish bidding could result in an item being awarded to a character who would not make the best use of it.
GDKP (Gold DKP).
Gold DKP (GDKP) is a system developed for pick up groups (PUG). This system was introduced to support those individuals that have no large guild to support raids for difficult bosses/zones. In GDKP, when a boss is killed, each item dropped is put up for auction with a minimum value (1 handed weapons 15g, 2 handed weapons 30g, armor 10g jewelry 15g etc.). Players then bid above the minimum amount and the item goes to the highest bidder. The winner of the item gives the loot master the amount of gold he/she bid. At the end of the raid and after all loot has been purchased. Each participant of the raid is rewarded with their fair share of the gold paid to the loot master. for example if 20 members were in the raid and 500g was spent on items, each raid participent would receive 25g.
DKP as virtual capital.
Since the intention of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members, they can be understood in the context of virtual capital. Players "earn" and "spend" DKP, bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them. DKP are referred to as "currency" a guild leader pays his "employees". Despite these analogies, DKP remain a kind of "private money system", allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline. The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself; they are tracked on external websites. In contrast, the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation. Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild, parlaying of economic capital for DKP (paying real world currency in exchange for DKP) is almost unheard of. Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what Torill Mortensen refers to as a "social stabilizer"; players who attend raids more frequently or play by the rules reap the rewards while more "casual" gamers do not. This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system (the guild) longer than they might otherwise.
Within the guild, DKP may stand in for competence—high level items (Krista-Lee Malone mentions a specific item from "World of Warcraft", the "Cold Snap" wand) are forms of cultural capital themselves. Since the items are "bound" to the player who first receives them, the only way to wield a desired item is to be involved in the raid that defeated the boss which rewards it. As such, a "Cold Snap" represents a signal to other players that the bearer has defeated a particular high-level monster and therefore mastered the skills needed to do so. The points themselves represent a mélange of cultural and material capital. The language of material capital is used: "price", "bid", and "currency", but these terms belie a unit of account that "crosses the line between material and symbolic".

North Dakota State University Gold Star Marching Band

The Gold Star Marching Band or also known as "The Pride of North Dakota" is the marching band of North Dakota State University. It is a non-auditioned band (with the exception of the battery section), open to all majors. With approximately 220 members, the band is one of the largest organizations on campus.
About the GSMB.
The GSMB does pregame and halftime performances for the NDSU Bison Football team in the Fargodome. The band usually plays seven shows a year including all home football games and usually one away game, marches the homecoming parade, and does a handful of other performances at NDSU and the Fargo-Moorhead area.
Rehearsal.
The GSMB practices Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 4:00-5:45pm, and Saturday morning rehearsals on game days. The band practices indoors in the music building of the Reineke Fine Arts Center. Outdoors, the band practices either on the football practice field, or Dacotah Field, which in 2009 was updated with brand new field turf. Despite starting band camp with warm temperatures, the band sometimes ends up practicing with snow on the field at the end of the season. The GSMB usually does not regularly practice in the Fargodome, only on game day mornings and days when the dome does not have a prior event.
Game Day.
Game Day for the band starts with morning rehearsal at the Fargodome. After morning rehearsal the band has a later call time to be in the band room of the music building. At call, all sections are accounted for and uniforms inspected. The band then goes outside to start the march over. The march over is a seven or so block parade-style march from the music building, through the NDSU campus, up to the Fargodome.
Once at the dome, the band performs pregame consisting of a field entrance, On Bison fanfare to different sides of the stadium, On Bison while marching down the field, a patriotic song (Grand Old Flag or Battle Hymn of the Republic), and an adaptation of the North Dakota state song while forming the shape of the star. The band plays the NDSU alma mater The Yellow and The Green and directly after the song the announcer proclaims "We ARE the Pride of North Dakota" the band then forms "NDSU" while playing Fight Song (We are the Pride) and forms "BISON" facing the student section side of the dome. The band marches towards the team entrance, forms a tunnel for the team to run out, and plays On Bison as the team runs out. When the lights come back on, the band plays the Star-Spangled Banner, and finally the exits the field.
The band sits in the south endzone directly next to the student section(s). The band then performs a show at halftime, and returns to the stands for the conclusion of the game.

History.
The Gold Star Band owes much of its existence to a personal tragedy. In spring 1903, Clarence Simeon Putnam, a local Fargo doctor, watched his downtown Fargo medical practice burn to the ground – five days after his insurance had lapsed. Essentially out of a job, Putnam landed a position teaching arithmetic at North Dakota Agricultural College. While the next set of events is not entirely clear, a need arose for leadership of NDAC’s ROTC band. Putnam, a cornetist, found himself in charge of 14 members known as the “Cadet Band” on April 14, 1903.
While the band regards the first full year of Doc Putnam’s association with the band (1904) as its “birthday,” student newspaper references indicate a band existed as early as 1901. In fall 1902, Claude Nugent, secretary of the college, and Harry M. Rudd, a local musician, purchased instruments from a local farmer with the intention of creating an NDAC band. Rudd directed the band in some capacity until April 1903 when C.S. Putnam took over.
Putnam’s leadership was quite dynamic and the band thrived under his direction. This peaked in 1923-24 when the band as an ROTC unit earned its third consecutive 100 percent inspecting rating, which entitled it to a presidential citation and a “Gold Star” rating. Putnam incorporated the moniker into the band’s name and the Gold Star Band was born. Following Putnam’s death in1944, the band’s numbers deteriorated until former Gold Star Band member William Euren became director in 1948. Euren restored the band’s pre-war numbers and worked toward expanding its persona beyond its military role.
Euren retired in 1968, and Roger Sorenson became director of bands for two years before leaving in 1970. During his brief tenure, Sorenson engendered a level of lasting loyalty among alumni who performed under his direction. Orville Eidem arrived in 1970 and was director of bands for the next 23 years. Besides the perpetuation of the marching band tradition, Eidem also had a great love of jazz and expanded the scope of NDSU’s program. The band also played a role in lobbying efforts for a new facility. Reineke Fine Arts Center replaced Putnam Hall and the old Festival Hall in 1981.
Several other names have been associated with the band. While C.S. Putnam was away from the band in 1914-17, Harold Bachman and B.A. Orr were directors. Edward D. Schroepfer directed the band following Putnam’s death. Roy Johnson also played a significant role in the band’s musical leadership during the Sorenson years.
Orville Eidem retired in 1993, at which time Wayne F. Dorothy became the new director. Dorothy was previously Assistant Director of Bands under Eidem. Then in 1999, Dorothy retired and was replaced by Warren Olfert as director of bands.
2007 was a year for changes when Dr. Sigurd Johnson was hired as the newly created Athletics Band director leading the marching band and pep band. For the 2008 season, the band received new uniforms, recovered gold drums, and the addition of a front ensemble (pit). The GSMB is currently growing and is evident in the growth of the band from 83 in 2007, to 163 in 2008, to 185 in 2009, and to 220 in 2010.
Traditions.
March Over.
The march over is a parade-like march through the NDSU campus. It starts from the music building, up Albrecht Boulevard through campus, and around the front entrance to the Fargodome. Once at the dome, the band splits into three bands and performs for tailgators in the west dome lot, for the president's reception, and for fans in front of the Fargodome. The band joins together and enters the Fargodome from the north ramp of the dome. The march over is known for its various hijinks including chants, random line follow the leader, section swapping of instruments, dances, and stop-sign slapping. In the past there used to be a night march over every year in which the band would wear glow sticks and lights in the twilight of a fall game night.
In Heaven.
After a Bison victory in a football, basketball, or volleyball game; the band performs the traditional playing and singing of all 5 verses of "In Heaven there is no Beer".
The Yellow and the Green.
Every time the Gold Star Marching Band has a group meal together, the president of the band will ask the band to stand and sing the NDSU alma mater, the "Yellow and the Green". Rookies are required to learn the SATB parts quickly, or they will have to sing it by themselves at the ending band banquet.
Band Banquet and Concert.

Cameron Bridge

Cameron Bridge is a village in the conurbation of Levenmouth in Fife, Scotland. It is near to the village of Windygates and only 2 miles west of the town of Leven. A distillery was established in the 19th century by the Haig family, which is now part of Diageo. The distillery produces Scotch whisky.
History and locality.
It is a settlement at a bridge over the River Leven, which replaced a ford here. When Leven was flooded it was the first upstream crossing. In 1870, an earlier bridge was replaced with a new one. Another river is located nearby, the River Ore.
The Cameronbridge Grain Distillery.
In 1824 the Haig distillery was opened. In 1826 it became the first distillery to produce Grain whisky using the Column still method invented by Robert Stein. In 1877 John Haig & Co merged with 5 other whisky companies to form the Distillers Company, with John Haig & Co coming under DCL's full ownership in 1919. Cameron Bridge produced both grain and malt whisky using a combination of pot stills and column stills until 1929, when it shifted exclusively to grain whisky production.
For a period between 1941 to 1947, the distillery closed due to World War II. The current Column still house was constructed during the 1960s, and two of its three stills are more than 30 years old. The third was transferred from Carsebridge distillery in Alloa when it was closed by United Distillers in 1983. Major renovations at Cameron Bridge occurred in 1989-1992 as well as up to 2000 when the distillery produced up to of spirit annually.
In 1989 Cameronbridge also changed from being solely a large-scale grain whisky distillery into a ‘dual-purpose’ site, when United Distillers’ Grain Neutral Spirit operation was transferred to Fife from Wandsworth in London. Now GNS for white spirits and ‘sweetened products’ such as Archers, Pimm's, Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Gordon's Gin are also produced alongside grain spirit used in the Johnnie Walker, J&B, Bell's, Black & White, Vat 69, Haig and White Horse blended whisky brands owned by Diageo.
It is currently the largest of the remaining grain distilleries in Scotland and is owned by Diageo.
Future transport.
A railway station could be located in Cameron Bridge in the future, which would also serve as at Park and Ride site. Rail freight provisions could also be provided to serve the distillery. This is as part of the Levenmouth rail link.

The Century of Self

The Century of Self is the sixth album by ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead.
Production and release.
This is the first full-length release from Trail of Dead after their Interscope contract. It is also a departure from their studio production style:
"On the last two albums, we were really meticulous recording to click-tracks and doing overdubs...This time, we threw all that out. We learned the songs and all tracked live."
To promote the album, a music video for the radio edit of "Isis Unveiled" was released in April 2009.
It is the last studio album to feature co-founder and guitarist Kevin Allen.
Design.
Album art for "The Century of Self" was done entirely in blue ballpoint pen by singer Conrad Keely.
Critical reaction.
On Metacritic, "The Century of Self" has been given a score of 68 out of 100 based on "generally favorable reviews." Clashmusic.com, the online arm of "Clash" magazine, gave it a positive review and commented:
""The Century of Self" is an album with an accomplished sense of completion – a rolling score of disparate tracks segueing into a focused, poignant collective. And for all its scintillating, visceral energy, it’s an album that remains poised and impending, balanced by majestic composition and a patient anticipation for demolishing everything it builds."
"The Fly" magazine, meanwhile, awarded the record February's Album of the Month and gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that ""The Century of Self" underlines why they remain one of the world's most vital, daring and ambitious rock bands." Conrad Keely provided an exclusive illustration to go with "The Fly"'s review, as well as an exclusive track-by-track analysis of the album in "The Skinny" ahead of its release. "The Skinny" also gave it four stars out of five and called it "an album that may not get a perfect score, but reaffirms Trail of Dead’s role as rock’s dark trailblazers." Gigwise.com gave the album all five stars and said, "It has masterpiece written all over it."
Other reviews are positive: "Alternative Press" gave the album four stars out of five and said it "finds the pride of Austin, Texas, continuing to push baroque prog-rock to orchestral new heights." "Billboard" gave it a favorable review and stated: "This Texas rock combo returns to form on The Century of Self, with producer Chris Coady stepping in for longtime collaborator Mike McCarthy." "The Boston Globe" also gave it a favorable review and stated, "After releasing two albums that bored even its most ardent fans, . . . And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead is back to blowing minds with "The Century of Self"." Yahoo! Music gave it seven stars out of ten and said, "The feeling persists that "The Century Of Self" marks an important moment for ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead--one in which they began to weave together their diverging paths and one that, after all, should be hailed as a victory." musicOMH gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the album ultimately "won't trouble the charts and Trail Of Dead's status as a cult act will be assured. But there's enough here to keep their small group of followers very happy indeed." "Paste" gave it 6.8 out of ten and said, "Conrad Keely’s vocals remain scabby and untreated and there’s still a bit much sonic compression, but the relative rawness adds a subtle flair to this record." "The Phoenix" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four and said that TOD "settle into a nice groove somewhere between the two".
Other reviews are average, mixed, or negative: "The Austin Chronicle" gave the album three stars out of five and said it "may be the Austin institution's most conceptually complete work to date, a post-prog cathedral of mythical mini-epics, though it's by no means the band's masterpiece." No Ripcord gave it six stars out of ten and said the album "suffers from careless sequencing, its tempos haphazardly spooned together and flung like high school portions of mashed potatoes and gravy, slopped into sections of the tray with no real purpose or benefit." Drowned in Sound gave it a score of six out of ten and said, "No other band could legitimately produce this record without being accused of extreme plagiarism, and perhaps that goes some way to explaining why, despite its shortcomings, it is still likeable." "Uncut" gave it three stars out of five and stated, "A familiar sound predominates: an impressive fanfare for a royal procession that never quite arrives." "Q" also gave it three stars out of five and stated that TOD "have kept faith with their traditional mix of prog pomp and grunge power". "Dusted Magazine" gave the album a mixed review and said of the band, "The good news is that this is, in fact, a throwback to their earlier work. The bad news is that it’s not throwback enough." The now defunct "Blender" criticized the direction of the band and the album's sound, saying: "There was a time, about six years ago, when this hyperdramatic Texas band seemed like their apocalyptic noise-rock had something meaningful to communicate. That time is long gone." It received only 2 stars out of 5. "Under the Radar" gave it only three stars out of five and said, "Any way you slice it, band is a sad case in selling out."

The LSWR 330 class or "Saddlebacks" was a class of goods 0-6-0 saddle tank steam locomotives designed for the London and South Western Railway. Twenty were constructed by Beyer, Peacock and Company between 1876 and 1882.
W. G. Beattie ordered the Beyer, Peacock-designed 330 class for shunting work. Prior their arrival the LSWR had relagted old locomotive to shunting duties, a task they were unsuitable for and frequently caused delays. 
While the first members of the class were numbered in a solid block of new numbers from 330, some of the later locomotives re-used numbers of withdrawn or duplicated locomotives. 
All twenty locomotives were renumbered into the duplicate list by prefixing their existing number with a "0" between 1894 and 1911. Two locomotives, 0227 and 0228 were removed from the duplicate list in 1889, by renumbering them 316 and 328. They went back on the duplicated list in 1912 and 1911 respectively.
All passed to the Southern Railway at the grouping in 1923. Withdrawals started the following year, and buy the end of 1930, only five remained. Numbers 0128 and 0423 went in 1931, 0335 was sold to Kent and East Sussex Railway in 1932, and the last two, 0332 and 0334 being withdrawn by the Southern Railway in 1933, after 57 years of service.

Furlo Pass

The Furlo Pass (Italian: "Gola del Furlo" or "Passo del Furlo") is a gorge on the ancient Roman road Via Flaminia in the Marche region of central Italy, where it passes near the Candigliano river, a tributary of the Metauro.
The gorge was formed between the Pietralata (889 m) and Paganuccio (976 m) mountains by the river Candigliano, which, until it was dammed in 1922, coursed at speed through the district. Since 2001 it has been included in a State Natural Reserve of the same name.
The Roman emperor Vespasian had a tunnel built here to facilitate passage on the Via Flaminia at the narrowest point of the gorge (hence the name, from the Latina "forulum", meaning "small hole"); next to it is a similar but smaller tunnel dating from Etruscan times. The tunnel has a length of 38.30 meters and a height of 5.95 meters. During the Gothic Wars (6th century), the Ostrogoth King Totila had the pass fortified, but his troops were ousted by the Roman general Belisarius. The Lombards conquered the pass between 570 and 578, and destroyed the fortifications.
In the 1930, a profile of Benito Mussolini was sculpted on the slopes of Mount Pietralata, which was destroyed by partisans during World War II. In the 1980s, traffic in the Furlo tunnel was bypassed by the construction of two highway tunnels.

Job Throckmorton

Job Throckmorton (Throkmorton) (1545–1601) was an English religious pamphleteer and Member of Parliament. Possibly with John Penry and John Udall, he authored the Martin Marprelate anonymous anti-clerical satires; scholarly consensus now makes him the main author.
Life.
He was of the Warwickshire gentry, resident at Haseley, the son of a land-owning Member of Parliament, Clement Throckmorton, and nephew of the influential diplomat Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford, graduating in 1566.
He was elected as Member of Parliament for Warwick in 1572 and 1586.
In 1587 Throckmorton and Edward Dunn Lee presented to Parliament a petition of John Penry, on preaching in Wales. It caused Penry to be arrested by John Whitgift.
The seven Marprelate pamphlets appeared late in 1588. Leland Carlson has argued strongly for Throckmorton as the sole author.
Throckmorton's "Master some laid open in his colours" and "A Dialogue in which is plainely laid open the tyrannical dealing of the Lord Bishopps" were printed in La Rochelle in 1589. The former was a reply to Robert Some, author of "A Godly Treatise ... Touching the Ministerie, Sacraments, and the Church", who in 1589 became Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1590 Throckmorton was held on a treason charge, which he escaped narrowly.
He was attacked by Matthew Sutcliffe, Dean of Exeter in "An answere to a certaine libel supplicatorie" (1592), as a Marprelate author. His denial appeared in 1594 as "The Defence of Job Throkmorton, against the slaunders of Maister Sutcliffe", and the controversy continued. Towards the end of his life he was close to John Dod, and moved to Canons Ashby.

William 'Billy' Bowen (born 6 December 1897) was a Welsh dual code rugby player who played club rugby union for Swansea and rugby league for Leeds. Bowen was capped six times for Wales while playing under the union code.
Rugby career.
Bowen was first selected to play for Wales during the 1921 Five Nations Championship in a game against Scotland. Under the captaincy of Tommy Vile, Wales lost the match in a match that was nearly abandoned due to crowd problems, when the St Helen's spectators kept pushing onto the pitch. Bowen was re-selected for the next game of the tournament this time against France in a victory at the Cardiff Arms Park, though he lost his place for the final match in Ireland.
Bowen was reselected to represent his country for the entirety of the 1922 Five Nations Championship in which Wales won the tournament, winning three of the games and drawing against Scotland. Bowen scored two tries during the tournament; the first in the opening Welsh victory over England when Bowen was one of eight different players to score a try for Wales. His second was more important, as it allowed the draw with Scotland snatched by Wales when Islwyn Evans scored a drop goal in the last two minutes. 
Bowen may have been awarded more caps for Wales, but he 'Went North' in 1922, switching codes to professional rugby league, joining Leeds RLFC. Bowen made his début for Leeds against Bradford Northern at Headingley Stadium on Saturday 2 September 1922.

Swaledale cheese

Swaledale is a full fat hard cheese produced in the town of Richmond in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, England. The cheese is produced from cows’ milk, Swaledale sheep's milk and goats’ milk.
Description.
The cheeses are round in shape with an average weight for the cheese wheel of and are made with unpasteurized milk. The animals whose milk is used to make Swaledale cheese, all graze on land in Swaledale which makes their milk characteristic of the area as a particular mixture of herbs and grasses grow there due to its soil and climate and this give the cheese distinctive properties. The cheese has a moist medium firm texture and its flavour is described as having “the freshness of the misty Dales and wild bracken, with the sweet caramel undertone of ewes’ milk”.
Production.
Swaledale cheese is handmade to a recipe from Swaledale, the knowledge of which is limited to a few people. Milk from farms in Swaledale is collected and, in the first stage of the cheesemaking process, heated to 28 °C with microbiological culture. After being left for two hours rennet is added to the milk. The mixture is then left to curdle for an hour after which time the resulting curd is heated to 28 °C, cut up and stirred. It is then cut up again, drained and the resulting cubes stacked up, before the blocks are broken up and then put into moulds lined with muslin. The moulds are then lightly pressed during storage at 28 °C for 18 hours, and are turned once after four hours. Once the cheese has finished being pressed it is removed from the moulds and is soaked in a solution of 85% brine for 24 hours.
After being made Swaledale cheese is stored in humid cellars. While the cheese is maturing, if it is not covered in natural wax, a grey-blue mould grows on its rind. The cheese takes between three to four weeks to mature.

Legends about the Yorkshire Dales, the area that includes Swaledale, say the origin of cheese making lie with Cistercian monks from Normandy who settled in the area in the 11th century. Their techniques were passed on to local farmers in Swaledale who continued to produce cheese, although the monks left during the dissolution of the monasteries. In 18th century cheese was produced at farmhouses within Swaledale and sold fresh with a white colour or ripe once they had developed a blue colouration. These cheese’s high moisture content and open texture allowed them to blue easily when they were matured in damp conditions. Cheese making started to decline in Swaledale at the start of the 20th century and by 1980 only one farm in Swaledale, Harkerside above Reeth, was still making cheese. In the early 1980s this cheese stopped being produced as well, until Mrs. Longstaff gave the original recipe for Swaledale Cheese to David and Mandy Reeds who founded the Swaledale Cheese company in February 1987 to produce the cheese.
Awards.
In 1995 Swaledale Cheese and Swaledale Ewes Cheese were awarded European protected designation of origin (PDO) status. Swaledale cheeses have won a number of awards including three gold awards at the 2008 Great Taste Awards and three gold and two bronze medals at 2008 World Cheese Awards.

Election Working Group

The Election Working Group (EWG) is a non-partisan, 32-member network of civil society organizations. Established in 2006, EWG members share a common commitment to free and fair elections and good governance in Bangladesh.
The guiding objectives of the EWG are:
1. To support free and fair elections through pre-election, election day, and post-election observation
2. To conduct voter and civic education in key thematic areas that encourage the full participation of all segments of society in the electoral process
3. To promote electoral reform through public dialogue and advocacy
The National Secretariat of the EWG, headed by a Director, coordinates the day-to-day activities of the EWG on behalf of its members, with oversight from an elected Executive Committee.
Through its wide and varied membership, the EWG has outreach down to the village level throughout Bangladesh, making it an effective network through which to deliver voter information materials and to recruit both stationary and mobile election observers.
A national network, but international in reach, EWG members have participated in election observation missions in various countries, including Thailand and the Philippines.
EWG Programs.
The EWG has implemented several programs since its establishment. These include:
Preparation for the 2006 elections: the EWG planned to implement voter education and election observation activities for the cancelled January 2007. Using a multi-tier program delivery mechanism, the network had outreach to the sub-union level. By early January 2007, when the EWG pre-election program activities were suspended on the basis of a consensus decision of all members, the EWG secretariat and member organizations had recruited and trained 64 district coordinators, over 500 sub-district or thana coordinators, and more than 5,000 union coordinators to implement field activities. Over 165,000 stationary and mobile observers were prepared to act as election day observers.
EWG monthly public perception studies: Since February 2007, the EWG has conducted monthly national public perception studies on the political and economic environment under the state of emergency. The studies probe key aspects of public opinion such as citizen concerns about current policies, confidence in the Caretaker Government, perceptions of the economy, views on anti-corruption activities, and overall appraisal of current circumstances as compared to those under the past elected government. 
EWG support for the national voter registration process: Between August 2007 and August 2008 the EWG conducted a nationwide program of voter education designed to motivate eligible voters to complete registration for the milestone national electoral roll with photographs. This was carried out through a cooperative working relationship with the Bangladesh Election Commission. The EWG campaign had a strong focus on historically difficult to reach segments of the population including women, ethnic and religious minorities, disabled persons, and residents of geographically remote areas.
EWG city corporation election activities: the EWG was actively engaged in the August 4, 2008 city corporation and pourashava elections with a program consisting of election observation and voter education activities. The local government elections provided an opportunity to test coordinating mechanisms and program delivery and other systems and procedures that EWG will utilize on a larger scale in the upcoming national parliamentary and upazila elections.
2008 national parliamentary elections: the EWG has developed a comprehensive voter education and election observation plan for the 2008 election. Voter education activities will emphasize: creating a knowledgeable electorate; the need to vote for candidates with clear policies and; and citizen demand for greater accountability of elected representatives. These themes are evident in its array of public service announcements for television and radio broadcast, brochures, posters, and other printed materials, and locally organized activities such as town hall meetings and candidate debates. While voter education is designed to strengthen the content of the elections, EWG has a comprehensive election observation plan in which observers will be deployed to all polling booths throughout Bangladesh.
EWG Funding.
As a coalition of established organizations, the EWG serves as a cost-efficient mechanism for implementing election-related programs nationwide. All member organizations devote staff time and resources. Importantly, they can be mobilized in a short period of time to deliver programs. Since 2006, the EWG has received financial support and technical assistance from The Asia Foundation. The EWG is grateful for the generous financial support of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Royal Danish Embassy, the Royal Norwegian Embassy, the Swedish International Development Assistance (Sida), the Swiss Development Corporation, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Zinc–zinc oxide cycle

The zinc–zinc oxide cycle or Zn–ZnO cycle is a two step thermochemical cycle based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production with a typical efficiency around 40%.
Process description.
The thermochemical two-step water splitting process uses redox systems:
For the first endothermic step concentrating solar power is used in which zinc oxide is thermally dissociated at into zinc and oxygen. In the second non-solar exothermic step zinc reacts at with water and produces hydrogen and zinc oxide. The temperature level is realized by using a solar power tower and a set of heliostats to collect the solar thermal energy.

Futian Checkpoint Station () is a terminus of Shenzhen Metro Longhua Line. It started operations on 28 June 2007. It is located at the ground level of Futian Port Control Point () in Futian District, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, and it is the only ground station in Shenzhen Metro. Futian Port Control Point and Futian Checkpoint Station are connected to Hong Kong's Lok Ma Chau Station by a footbridge.
The station was called "Huanggang Station" () because its location is near Huanggang, which is also an immigration control point between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. But it has been renamed to "Futiankouan Station" since 15 August 2008 to avoid confusion between Futian Port and Huanggang Port. "Kouan" (口岸) means a (immigration) port. Starting from July 1, 2010, with MTR Shenzhen taking over the operations and management of Longhua Line, the English name Futian Checkpoint is now being used. 
Station layout.
There are a total of 4 levels in Futian Checkpoint Station. The 2nd and 3rd levels (above ground) are immigration facilities (being the arrivals hall and departures hall respectively), while the 1st level is the station concourse. The 2 side platforms and an island platform is located on the lowest level (ground floor), but only one island platform and 1 side platform is used in daily operations. Among them, the side platform serves as the unloading platform for trains arriving at the station, while the other island platform is used as the boarding platform for trains departing the station. This method is called the Spanish solution. 
Exits.
The station has 2 exits. In addition, the station is located in the Futian Port Control Point building, and passengers may proceed to MTR Lok Ma Chau Station in Hong Kong after undergoing immigration procedures.

The Bath Club was a sports-themed London gentlemen's club in the 20th century. It was established in 1894 at 34 Dover Street. Its swimming pool was a noted feature, and it is thought that the swimming pool of the fictional Drones Club (also on Dover Street) was based on this. Sir Henry "Chips" Channon was a member. Mark Twain stayed here when he visited London. 
The club was bombed during the Blitz, in 1941, and never wholly recovered. After the bombing, it was housed by the struggling Conservative Club at 74 St James's Street, which eventually agreed to a full merger in 1950 under the name of the Bath Club, retaining the Conservative Club's St James's Street club house until 1959.

Organization.
CCSTV and its New Year's Gala is organized by Beijing-based cameraman Shi Mengqi. In an interview with "Beijing Today", Shi criticized the CCTV New Year's Gala, saying that he had attended the CCTV New Year's Gala one year, but that it is "not designed for the ordinary viewer [...] The audience was nothing but high officials and rich people. 
Since the announcement of CCSTV, 10 volunteers have joined Shi to organize the program, assisting with items such as programming, auditing, and soliciting sponsors. 700 groups and individuals have sent Shi applicants to be considered for the three-hour program, and over 30 segments were scheduled for the program by the end of December 2008. Amongst the performers scheduled are the "Bike King of the East" Zhou Changchun (周长春), who will perform bicycle tricks.
Social Response.
National satellite station Guizhou TV initially offered venues and support for the CCSTV New Year's Gala, stating that they "just want to provide an alternative for people who cannot go home during Spring Festival." However, CCSTV decided to part with Guizhou TV, though there is a possibility for performers from the program to work with Guizhou TV after the Gala, and some parts of the Gala may be later broadcast on Guizhou TV. 
An online survey conducted by the popular Chinese forum Tianya found that over half of the 12,350 polled were tired of the CCTV New Year's Gala, and that 73% were looking forward to watch the shanzhai version.

Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound

The Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound was a large aero engine developed by Armstrong Siddeley between 1935 and 1941. An increased capacity variant known as the Boarhound was never flown, and a related, much larger design known as the Wolfhound existed on paper only. Development of these engines was interrupted in April 1941 when the company factory was bombed, and on 3 October 1941 the project was cancelled by the Air Ministry.
Design and development.
The Deerhound I was a triple-row, 21-cylinder, air-cooled radial engine design with the unusual feature of inline cylinder banks. Unlike earlier Armstrong Siddeley engines the Deerhound featured overhead camshafts to operate its poppet valves, using one camshaft for each row of three cylinders.
Flight testing began in 1938 using an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley II, serial number "K7243", during which cooling problems were encountered with the rear row of cylinders. This problem was solved by engineering a 'reversed-flow' cooling system with a large air duct at the rear of the cowling taking in air and directing it forward to exit behind the propeller. The project suffered a severe setback when the Whitley crashed on takeoff in March 1940, fatally injuring its crew. The accident was attributed to an incorrect elevator trim setting and was not related to the engines. A single prototype Deerhound III was built and ran, and survived until the late-1970s before being scrapped. Development work on the early engines was cancelled by the Air Ministry on 23 April 1941 with running of the Mk III being allowed to continue until 3 October 1941, at which point all records were ordered to be handed over to Rolls-Royce.
A projected increased capacity variant known as the Boarhound was planned but never built, and a related much larger design, the Wolfhound, existed on paper only. The latter engine featuring six banks of four cylinders, would have had a displacement of around 61 litres (3,733 cu in) and a projected takeoff power rating of .
Applications.
This engine's sole aircraft application was in a modified Armstrong Whitworth Whitley which was used as a testbed.

<doc id="20792060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20792060" title="We Murder Stella">
We Murder Stella

Wir töten Stella (We Murder Stella) is a novella by Austrian writer Marlen Haushofer first published in 1958 about the death of the eponymous heroine, a 19-year-old woman who has just begun to experience her awakening sexuality. Narrated by Anna, a 40 year-old mother of two in whose house Stella has spent her final months, "Wir töten Stella" provides an insight into the bourgeois society of post-war Austria and paints a picture of a deteriorating family whose overall ambition is to keep up appearances.
Plot introduction.
Set in the late 1950s, the novella takes the form of a written confession committed to paper in the course of a weekend shortly after Stella's death during which the narrator is alone at home, as her husband Richard and their two children have left the city to visit Richard's mother. Anna realizes that on the surface level everything is back to normal again now that Stella is no longer around: an intruder imposed on the family who was threatening to upset the equilibrium carefully, and tacitly, maintained by each family member has left again. However, Anna cannot but delve deeper into the matter: guilt-ridden, and unable to find any peace of mind, let alone happiness, she remembers many details of Stella's stay in the house, and starts relating the events that have led to the catastrophe of her death in chronological order.
Plot summary.
When Luise, Stella's mother, asks her old friend Anna if her family could put up her daughter for the duration of one schoolyear so that she can attend commercial school in the city, they unwillingly agree. Though a natural beauty, Stella is an unrefined country girl who wears neither make-up nor perfume and who dresses in nondescript clothes. Her diffident politeness does not endear her to her hosts and makes it easy for them not to integrate her into the family. Stella does not keep in touch with her mother either, who has gone to Italy on a months-long holiday spree with her lover.
Anna has known for many years that her husband is a womanizer but has always felt unable to confront him or do anything about his love affairs. A successful lawyer whose office is in the city centre, and a respectable pillar of society, Richard seemingly takes every chance that offers itself to betray his wife. Careless about leaving traces, he often comes home late at night, allegedly after a long day at the office, when his wife is already in bed pretending to be asleep, and time and again she can smell other women's perfume or detect smears of lipstick on his shirt. Annette, their daughter, who is of primary school age, is the only one in the family who does not sense what is going on whereas 15 year-old Wolfgang, their son, does but understand the importance of not bringing up that taboo topic: if he did, he would be one of the likely targets of his father's revenge.
It is Anna herself who triggers the subsequent events when she encourages Stella to wear trendier clothes and generally helps her metamorphose into a young lady. Only now seeing her beauty, Richard starts an affair with the sexually inexperienced young woman and, when she gets pregnant, procures an abortion for her performed by one of his old friends who is a gynaecologist. Mistaking sexual satisfaction for love, Stella keeps pursuing her lover long after she has been dropped by him, a situation complicated by the fact that, at least for the time being, both are living under the same roof. Eventually Stella realizes that Richard has embarked on yet another affair, and throws herself in front of a lorry. Her motives for committing suicide are never openly discussed; rather, the family say they suspect it must have been an accident.
Rediscovery.
Haushofer was awarded the Arthur Schnitzler Prize in 1963. In the 1970s and 80s, the feminist movement tried to claim Haushofer retrospectively as one of their own. Since then, the text has been continuously in print in its German original. An English translation is not available.
Stage adaptation.
A dramatized version of "Wir töten Stella" in the form of a monologue spoken by Anna was written and performed in Dutch by Natali Broods. Entitled "Het was zonder twijfel een ongeluk" ("It Was Without Doubt an Accident"), the play premiered in Antwerp, Belgium on September 27, 2007.

Irish Blue Cross

The Irish Blue Cross is an animal welfare charity formed in Ireland in 1945 by incorporating the welfare charity "Our Dumb Friends' League" into a new small animal and equine welfare organisation. The charity provides low-cost veterinary services to people on a low income in the greater Dublin area. 
Registered charity.
The Irish Blue Cross is a registered charity (CHY 5386).
Mobile veterinary clinics and partnerships.
The Irish Blue Cross put its first mobile veterinary clinic onto the streets of Dublin in 1953. Since its foundation, the charity has continued to develop the service whilst extending its support for needy pets through its small-animal clinic in Inchicore and its partnership with private veterinary practices. Since 1945, it has provided care to over 600,000 pets. 
Ten Blue Cross mobile veterinary clinics are in operation weekly throughout Dublin and are manned by a dedicated volunteer force of vets, drivers and helpers. 
Services.
The Irish Blue Cross provides low-cost veterinary services to pet owners on a low income in the greater Dublin area. In 2012, the charity carried out over 27,000 treatments, vaccinations, check-ups, x-rays, neutering and other operations to pets. These procedures were carried out at the charity’s Dublin based mobile clinics and at its small-animal clinic in Inchicore.
Support and grants.
The Irish Blue Cross relies on donations from the general public to cover the costs of carrying out its work. It has mane fundraising events throughout the year, such as its Easter Raffle, World Animal Week pens campaign, and its ever-popular Bark in the Park™ sponsored dog walks during the Summer. The Bark in the Park™ events involve a 4km walk through some of Dublin's finest parks, a raffle, music, goody bags and prizes for the dog with the Best Bark, Shiniest Coat, Happiest Smile and Waggiest Tail. 
The charity also receives some funding from the Irish Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Each year, Dublin City Council and other Local Authorities also give significant grant aid to the charity.
Horse ambulance services.
The Irish Blue Cross also operates a horse ambulance service that attends at all Irish racecourses, north and south. In an average year, the fleet of three ambulance units provides about 400 days of service. Experienced staff work closely with racecourse veterinary surgeons to assist racehorses ‘pulled up’ or injured during the course of racing. This service is not paid for by charity donations, rather it is funded by Horse Racing Ireland and other racing organizations. The Irish Blue Cross horse ambulances are also to be seen at the RDS Annual Horse Show, International Horse Trials in Ireland, and some Point-to-Points

The Dew Schools

Situated in Yaba, Lagos, Lagos State, Nigeria, The Dew Schools is a school that came as a result of a burden to see children of Nigeria taught and nurtured properly. The Proprietor/School Administrator, Mrs. Henrietta Chimezie Babajide, is an educationist who worked in the Federal Ministry of Education; Federal Government Girls College, Abuloma, Port Harcourt and Queen’s College, Yaba; an ex-WAEC examiner; member NERDC Senior Secondary curriculum review committee, 1999; Curriculum Organization of Nigeria (CON) and Science Teachers Association of Nigeria (STAN). On retirement from the Federal Civil Service, she worked in three private schools and the trend in the events in many schools left a lot to be desired. With increase in examination malpractice, students losing desire and determination for hard work, it was time to make a difference—hence, the creation of the school.

Ashford Hospital, Adelaide

Ashford Hospital is a private hospital, located in the Adelaide suburb of Ashford.
History.
Ashford Hospital (originally named "Ashford Community Hospital") was opened in 1950 as a joint venture between the Unley, Mitcham, West Torrens and Marion Councils and a group of local doctors. It was the second hospital opened on the same site with "Ashford Private Hospital" first opening in 1935, which was run by two nursing sisters who sold the hospital to Ashford Community Hospital in 1950.
In 1995, Ashford was the first private hospital in South Australia to open an emergency department which now attends to approximately 20,000 patients each year.
Location.
Ashford Hospital is located in the Adelaide suburb of Ashford, approximately two kilometres from the Adelaide CBD along Anzac Highway. It dominates the block between Marleston Avenue, Reid Avenue, Alexander Avenue and Anzac Highway.
ACHA Health.
The Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance (ACHA) was formed on 14 November 1999 with the merger of Ashford and Western Community Hospitals. Since then, ACHA has also incorporated the Memorial Hospital (in North Adelaide) and Finders Private (located next to Flinders Medical Centre) at Bedford Park. Both these mergers occurred in the year 2000. However, in 2004 due to a lack of profitability, the Western Community Hospital was sold and has since become an independent private hospital.

Richard Corfield

Richard Conyngham Corfield (27 April 1882 – 9 August 1913) was a British colonial police officer who saw service in South Africa, Nigeria, and Somalia in the early 20th century.
Early life.
Corfield was born in Heanor, Derbyshire, the eldest of three children of the rector of Heanor, Conyngham William George Corfield and Henrietta, née Edwards. Corfield was only six years old when his father died. He first attended a dame school. In 1892 he attended Spurlings Preparatory School and then in 1896 went to Marlborough College.
Early career.
After leaving school Corfield worked for a shipping company in Liverpool, the T. & J. Harrison Line, run by an uncle, Thomas Fenwick Harrison. Soon after starting work the Anglo-Boer war broke out in South Africa. Corfield immediately joined the Volunteers camped on Salisbury Plain, but later enlisted in the Baden Powell Police, sailing for Africa in December 1900. In June 1902 he was recommended for a commission, but this was rejected due to his youth.
In 1905 Corfield returned to England, applied for the post of Political Officer in Somalia, and became one of only six Europeans posted to the interior of the country. There Muhammad Abdullah, referred by the British as "the Mad Mullah", was inciting local people against the British. By 1910 he had been subdued but not beaten.
In May 1910 Corfield again returned to England, but by September he was on his way to Nigeria where the British were already in conflict with Musliminhabitants from the north part of the country. He saw action at Ganawari and other skirmishes.
Further trouble was brewing in Somalia, and a Somaliland Camel Constabulary was formed to serve as a police force in the interior. Horace Byatt, the Governor of British Somaliland, offered the command of the new Camel Constabulary to Corfield, who accepted the opportunity to return to the Horn of Africa.
Return to Somalia.
The Camel Constabulary took to the field in December 1912 and Corfield was authorised to punish those opposing British rule – however he was instructed to avoid a direct confrontation with Abdullah Hassan. By mid-1913 finding these instructions restrictive and irksome, on the afternoon of 8 August 1913 he decided to attack the Dervish army close to Dul Madoba.
Dul Madoba is a ridge some 25 miles SE of Burao in Somaliland. The battle took place on 9 August 1913 between 110 members of the Somaliland Camel Constabulary, reduced to 85 by the time action commenced, and some 2,750 well-armed Dervish followers of Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. Of the Constabulary, 36 including Richard Corfield were killed-in-action and 21 were wounded. On the Dervish side over 450 were killed or wounded. As a result of the action the British withdrew their protection of the local tribes to the area around the port of Berbera but Abdullah Hassan was unable to follow up his advantage immediately.

Gmelina leichhardtii

Gmelina leichhardtii, commonly known as the white beech is a rainforest tree of eastern Australia. Scattered individuals or small groups of trees naturally occur from the Illawarra district of New South Wales (34½° S) to near Proserpine in tropical Queensland. The white beech or grey teak is a fast growing tree, growing on volcanic and alluvial soils in areas of moderate to high rainfall. It also grows on poorer sedimentary soils in fire free areas. White beech may occasionally be seen in Australian rainforests, their status is considered "uncommon". Unlike the Australian red cedar, the white beech has not recovered particularly well after logging in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Taxonomy and naming.
Ferdinand von Mueller described the white beech as "Vitex leichhardtii" in 1862, from collections near Myall Creek by Ludwig Leichhardt and Clarence River by Dr Hermann Beckler. George Bentham reassigned it to the genus "Gmelina" in his 1870 "Flora Australiensis". The genus name honours German botanist Johann Georg Gmelin, while the species name honours Leichhardt, who explored and collected specimens from the country's east and north. White beech was previously classified in the Verbenaceae, but its genus and many others have been transferred into the mint family Lamiaceae. White beech is the standard trade name for the timber, as well as a common name for the species, due to the similarity of the wood to that of European beech. Other common names include grey teak.
Description.
Mature specimens of white beech reach 15 to 30 m (50–100 ft) tall, though exceptional individuals can reach 60 m (200 ft) tall, and live for centuries. The base of the largest trees exceeds two and a half metres in diameter, and the trunk is cylindrical with a flanged but not buttressed base. The flanging can extend up the bole. The bark varies from light to dark grey and has a scaled surface with vertical cracks marking sections of trunk. There can be burls. Considered by some to be a semi-deciduous species, losing part of the canopy in late spring. Green leaves are almost always found at the base of the tree, assisting with tree identification. Branchlets are thick, grey or brown and hairy, with easily visible leaf scars. The new shoots are densely covered in fine fur.
The mature leaves are pale green and ovate, 8 to 18 cm (2.5–7 in) long. Hairy and veiny on the underside. Midrib, lateral and net veins distinct on the upper surface, conspicuously raised and distinct beneath due to the covering of fawn hairs. Lateral veins eight to ten, straight and forking near the margin at 45 degrees to the midrib. Juvenile leaves are toothed. Purple, yellow and white flowers form in late spring and summer. The fruit are ripe from February to May.
Distribution and habitat.
The main range is from the Blackall Range and the vicinity of Maleny south through to the New South Wales south coast. The locality of Broughtonvale (34½° S), near Berry, New South Wales is considered by Anders Bofeldt as the southern limit of natural distribution. However, D.J. Boland considers the far more southerly Clyde River, New South Wales (35° S) near Batemans Bay to be the southern limit of distribution. There are isolated occurrences in central-northern Queensland in the Eungella Range and on Mt Elliot near Townsville.
North of Sydney, it was last recorded in the Wyong area in 1916.
White Beech is rare and endangered in the Illawarra region. It is likely that fewer than one hundred trees remain in some thirty different sites in the Illawarra. White Beech trees in the Illawarra may be seen by the Minnamurra Falls rainforest walk in Budderoo National Park, however, these trees are not signposted.
It is found on mountain slopes as well as alluvial soils along riverbanks. On Fraser Island it is even found on sand hills. The usual habitat is subtropical rainforest, where trees occur singly or in small stands of up to five individuals scattered through the forest, associated with such trees as yellow carabeen ("Sloanea woollsii"), red carabeen ("Geissois benthamiana"), Queensland kauri pine ("Agathis robusta"), golden sassafras ("Doryphora sassafras"), black booyong ("Argyrodendron actinophyllum") and white booyong ("A. trifoliolatum"), as well as members of the genus "Flindersia".
Ecology.
The fruit are consumed by the Topknot Pigeon and Wompoo Fruit Dove.
Germination.
Around Easter time, seeds mature within a fleshy bluish or purple drupe 2 to 3 centimetres in diameter. These are eaten by the Wompoo Fruit Dove, Paradise Riflebird, Topknot Pigeon and possibly other large fruit eating birds. The fruit contains a hard wooden capsule. The capsule contains four cells, each with a viable or non viable seed.
The fleshy aril needs to be removed, as it contains agents which inhibit seed germination. Regular watering and drying of the capsules seems to improve germination results. Germination is slow and unreliable, taking between six months and four years. Seedlings usually appear in late spring and summer.
A successful technique for germinating White Beech is to collect new purple fruit. Cut off the fleshy aril. Place the wooden "nut" in the sun for a few days. When cracks appear around the emerging seed compartments. Place it in a large container. Ensure the capsule receives adequate moisture and warmth in the cooler months. Trying to open the hard nut in the middle of the fruit, or hitting the capsule with a hammer has proven useless. The best technique appears to be the removal of the outer blue/purple flesh. Then exposing the inner capsule to sunlight and moisture. The sunlight cracks the outer covering of the capsule. The moisture seeps through the outer shell, affecting the inner seed. When the seed is germinated, it pushes open the cells of the capsule. The majority of capsules will not produce seedlings. A large quantity of capsules is advised for propagation.
Timber and uses.
The timber is durable and greyish without significant markings. However, it splits when nailed. It is prized for templates, pattern making, house construction, planking for boat hulls, flooring, carriage work, wood carving and cabinet work.
It weighs around 550 kg per cubic metre.
This tree is well suited to parks and large gardens. "Gmelina leichhardtii" is also seen as a shade tree in farms in former rainforest areas.

2009 Tour of Flanders

The 2009 Tour of Flanders cycle race is the 93rd edition of the monument classic and took place on 5 April. The course is 259.7 km long and goes from Brugge to Meerbeke. The weather during the race was sunny and warm at 12 °C. The race was the fifth event in the inaugural UCI World Ranking series.
Pre-race favorites included Filippo Pozzato (winner of the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen and a stage in the Three Days of De Panne), Tom Boonen (winner in 2005 and 2006), Stijn Devolder (winner in 2008), Nick Nuyens (2nd in 2008) and Heinrich Haussler (2nd in Milan – San Remo, 4th in Dwars door Vlaanderen, several other impressive results in 2009).
In a victory highly similar to the 2008 Tour of Flanders, Stijn Devolder powered away late to the win. With what pundits called the strongest team in the race behind him, the QuickStep rider was able to ride away, while other teams marked teammates Tom Boonen and Sylvain Chavanel. With riders such as favorite Pozzato watching Boonen, Devolder found the strength to solo to victory. Haussler, who was riding in support of Thor Hushovd planned not to contest the victory but said he was told by Hushovd to challenge Devolder. 
Following the race CNN reported: 
race was brought to life with 50km remaining when Italian Manuel Quinziato, Frenchman Sylvain Chavanel and three-time runner-up Leif Hoste led a six-rider breakaway. However, they were gradually caught by race favorites Devolder, compatriot and dual winner Tom Boonen and Italian Filippo Pozzato. Devolder made his decisive move over the crest of the penultimate climb, the Muur-Kapelmuur, and by the time he had reached the final climb, the Bosberg, he had an unassailable advantage. The rest of the breakaway riders were eventually caught by the peloton and German Haussler won the sprint for second place which was marred by a nasty crash on the final straight into Meerbeke. 
General standings.
Almost exactly one minute after Devolder crossed the line 29 other riders arrived, and all were awarded the same time. Beyond the top ten, these included: 11 Alexandre Pichot, 12 Johnny Hoogerland, 13 Roger Hammond, 14 Karsten Kroon, 15 Nick Nuyens, 16 Roy Sentjens, 17 Kevin Van Impe, 18 Frederik Willems, 19 Bert Scheirlinckx, 20 Tom Boonen, 21 Gerben Löwik, 22 Staf Scheirlinckx, 23 Serguei Ivanov, 24 Andreas Klier, 25 Preben Van Hecke, 26 Assan Bazayev, 27 Leif Hoste, 28 Paolo Longo Borghini, 29 Frédéric Guesdon, 30 Juan Antonio Flecha.
A crash during the group sprint for second place marred the finish of some riders in this group, including Thor Hushovd, George Hincapie, Bernhard Eisel, and Gregory Rast.
197 riders started the race.

Artillery in the Second Boer War

The Second Boer War saw attempted application of bombardment as an alternative to the use of ground forces. In most battles fought during the conflict this was proved not to be possible. There was competition from the other side’s ability to undertake evasive measures. The opponent was able to use cover to protect himself and hide his position. Nonetheless, the tactic of the creeping barrage, used at the relief of Ladysmith, has been described as “revolutionary”.
Battle of Magersfontein - 11 December 1899
The barrage involved twenty-four field guns, four howitzers, and a 4.7 inch naval gun, 
dubbed ‘Joe Chamberlain’, in honour of the British Colonial Secretary. “Onlookers were 
told by the naval gunners that Old Joey would kill every man within 150 yards of where 
his shells struck.” However, the bombardment that targeted the hill did not hit the Boers. The British had poor intelligence. The Boers were not hiding on the hill but in a line of trenches close by. It was to be another three months before the Boers finally evacuated, not because of bombardment, but because the British passed round them. 
Battle of Colenso - 15 December 1899
Here too, the British lacked intelligence about enemy positions. Before the battle, the 
Boers were hidden and their numbers or positions could not be estimated. In battle, 
smokeless fire meant that their positions were difficult to locate. Boer guns were 
also concealed behind emplacements, a practice that was new to late nineteenth warfare. 
Relief of Ladysmith - 14-28 February 1900
The British had success when they ceased using artillery by itself and used it in 
conjunction with infantry. British General Buller linked the use of artillery and the 
movement of infantry into continuous interlocking assaults upon each hill south of 
Ladysmith. As soon as shelling had finished in a location the infantry 
moved. The front collapsed on the 27th when use was made of a creeping curtain of shell 
fire sent over the heads of advancing infantry destroying everything 100 yards ahead of 
them. It was this tactic of the creeping barrage that has been described by Pakenham as “revolutionary”.

River Yeo (South Somerset)

The River Yeo, also known as the River Ivel, is a tributary of the River Parrett in north Dorset and south Somerset, England.

The river rises in Dorset, in the North Dorset Downs. It flows through Sherborne, and the Somerset towns of Yeovil, Yeovilton and Ilchester, and joins the River Parrett near Langport. For a few miles east of Yeovil, it forms the county boundary between Somerset and Dorset.
The river is navigable for light craft for from the Parrett to Ilchester.

After fighting a terrorist crisis in the Adirondack Mountains, the Fantastic Four feel that after long careers helping to defend humanity, that they should retire. However Reed Richards discovers some strange unusual events such as birds dying, disappearing desert oases, the evaporation of Earth's ozone layer, and unusual oceanic tides. The Watcher arrives to bid farewell to Reed, informing him that the Cosmic Tribunal has decided to destroy the warfare-prone humanity by unleashing a greater being known as the Adjudicator.
As the Adjudicator arrives on Earth, to announce his intentions, all of humanity is not convinced of the threat. Namor and his Atlantean army begin to attack New York City, under the mistaken belief that humanity has caused the oceanic disturbances, but Reed convinces him that it is the Adjudicator's doing. Namor attacks the Adjudicator, but the Adjudicator forces Namor and his armies to retreat, and also repels attacks from human armies and Doctor Doom, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the Inhumans.
Richards and the Silver Surfer attempt to use mindless robots called the Decimators to destroy the Cosmic Tribunal, but eventually abort their attack, rather than allow an entire race to be slaughtered. The Tribunal is grateful to the Fantastic Four, and to humanity. After the Fantastic Four is honored by the United Nations, they finally retire.

Jigen-ryū

Jigen-ryū (示現流 lit: "revealed reality") is a traditional school ("koryū") of Japanese martial arts founded in the late 16th century by Togo Chui (1561-1643) in Satsuma Province, now Kagoshima prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. It focuses mainly on the art of swordsmanship. The two different characters for "gen" (現/顕) are variants with the same meaning: "reality".
Jigen-ryū is known for its emphasis on the first strike: Jigen-ryū teachings state that a second strike is not even to be considered.
The basic technique is to hold the sword in a high version of hasso-no-kamae called tonbo-no-kamae (蜻蛉構 Dragonfly Stance), with the sword held vertically above the right shoulder. The attack is then done by running forward at your opponent and then cutting diagonally down on their neck. The kiai is a loud "Ei!".
Traditionally this is practised using a long wooden stick, and cutting against a vertical pole, or even a real tree. During a hard practice, the wood is said to give off the smell of smoke. During the Edo period, at the height of its popularity, adepts of Jigen-ryū were said to practice striking the pole 3,000 times in the morning, and another 8,000 times in the afternoon.
The style is still taught at the Jigen-ryū practice hall in the city of Kagoshima.

<doc id="20792463" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20792463" title="Avicennia alba">
Avicennia alba

Avicennia alba is a species of tropical mangrove in the family Acanthaceae. In the Malay language it is known as Api Api Putih, "api" meaning "fire", referring to the fact that this mangrove attracts fireflies, and "putih" meaning "white", referring to the pale-coloured underside of the leaves. It is found growing in coastal and estuarine locations in India, south east Asia, Australia and Oceania.
Description.
"Avicennia alba" forms a low, dense bushy crown often branching near the base of the trunk. The shrub does not grow more than about high. The roots are shallow and send up a large number of pencil-shaped pneumatophores. These aerial roots help with gas exchange and also play an important part in the exclusion of salt from the plant's vascular system. The trunk has smooth, greenish black bark which is finely fissured and does not flake. The dark green leaves, long and wide, have a silvery grey underside and grow in opposite pairs. The small, orange yellow flowers, borne in a racemose inflorescence, have 4 petals and a diameter of about when expanded. The fruits are greyish-green capsules and conical in shape with an elongated beak up to long. Each contains a single seed.
Distribution and habitat.
"Avicennia alba" is found in south and south east Asia, the islands of the south Pacific Ocean and Australia. It is common in the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in Singapore. It grows on tidal regions of riverbanks and on muddy portions of the seashore. It is a pioneering species being one of the first to colonise new ground. Its widespread root system with large numbers of pneumatophores helps to stabilise new deposits of sediment.
Biology.
Because it is difficult for seedlings to become established in tide-swept muddy habitats, "Avicennia alba" exhibits cryptovivipary. The embryos start to develop and break through the coat of the seeds before the fruits split open to shed the seeds. In some cases the plant also exhibits vivipary, with the developing shoot breaking through the fruit capsule while it is still growing on the bush. The seedlings have hooked hairs and are often seen growing in tangled groups.
Ecology.
A number of invertebrates are associated with "Avicennia alba". The larvae of certain small moths, "Euopoicillia spp.", feed on the flower buds and those of another moth, "Autoba alabastrata", feed on the fruits. The leaves are eaten by beetles, "Monolepta spp.". The greatest number of known species of marine fungi are found growing in mangrove swamps where "Avicennia alba" is one of a number of species colonised.
Status.
Mangrove habitats in general are threatened by human activities such as coastal development, agriculture and the creation of fish ponds. Rising sea levels due to global warming will also affect mangroves communities. "Avicennia alba" is affected by these threats but the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of least concern because it is a fast growing species, recovers readily from being cut, is widely distributed and is common over much of its range.
Uses.
"Avicennia alba" is a fast growing species and is sometimes planted, along with "Sonneratia" and "Rhizophora", to help prevent coastal erosion.
The timber from "Avicennia alba" does not make good firewood or charcoal but is used in the smoking of rubber and of fish. An extract of the heartwood is used in herbal medicine to make a tonic and the resin has been used in birth control. The seeds are boiled and eaten as a vegetable and are sometimes available in local markets.

Witness to the Future

Witness to the Future is a novel written by Danish author Klaus Rifbjerg in 1981.
It is about two young boys who are playing in the woods outside Copenhagen in occupied Denmark in the Second World War. They discover a cave with a tunnel that leads them from 1941 to 1981. When they crawl out near a motorway, they run up against angry farmers, biker gangs, heroin addicts, and rabid dogs in a world that is close to nuclear war. They become involved in car theft, police chases, and the massive helicopter explosion.
It is Rifbjerg's only work of science fiction. A review in Publishers Weekly called the book an “allegory of the chaos and emptiness of modern times that conveys admiration for a simpler past.” 
The book was translated into English from the Danish original "De hellige aber" by Steve Murray in 1987.

Yamal project

Yamal project, also referred to as Yamal megaproject, is a long term plan to exploit and bring to the markets the vast natural gas reserves in the Yamal Peninsula, Russia. Administratively, the project is located in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The project is developed by Gazprom.
History.
Preparations for the Yamal's development started 1990s. According to the original plans, drilling work on the Bovanenkovo field was to have started in 1997. In January 2002, Gazprom identified the Yamal Peninsula as a region of Gazprom's strategic interest. Preparatory works started in 2007 with the construction of auxiliary infrastructures, such as staff buildings and transport facilities. In July 2008 Gazprom launched the construction of the Bovanenkovo–Ukhta gas trunkline at the submerged crossing via the Baydaratskaya Bay. The project was officially inaugurated on 3 December 2008.
Oil and gas fields.
On the Yamal Peninsula and its adjacent offshore areas have been discovered 11 gas fields and 15 oil, gas and condensate fields. They consists of 16 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of explored and provisionally evaluated gas reserves and nearly 22 tcm of in-place and forecast gas reserves. Condensate reserves are estimated to consists of 230.7 million tonnes and oil reserves to consists of 291.8 million tonnes. The largest gas fields, for which Gazprom owns the licenses, are Bovanenkovo, Kharasavey, Novoportovo, Kruzenshtern, Severo-Tambey, Zapadno-Tambey, Tasiy and Malygin fields.
Bovanenkovo gas field.
The Bovanenkovo gas field is the largest gas field on the Yamal Peninsula with estimated reserves of 4.9 tcm. It is expected to be put in operation by 2011 with the annual production of 8 billion cubic meters (bcm), which will increase to 75-115 bcm by 2015.
Trunk pipelines.
Several pipelines are envisaged for delivery of the Yamal gas. A joint project (Yamal-Europe pipeline) between gas transportation companies of Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany was agreed in 1993 and commissioned in 1999. After commissioning of the Bovanenkovo–Ukhta gas trunkline it will deliver Yamal's gas to Europe. Construction of this pipeline started in July 2008 and was officially launched on 3 December 2008. The gas pipeline is to connect the Bovanenkovo gas field with the Russian gas hub at Ukhta. First deliveries of over 15 bcm per year were originally expected to start by the end of 2011. Actual pipeline filling with natural gas started on June 15, 2012; operation is expected to start imminently.
Yamal LNG.
In November 2008, Gazprom announced that it prepares a list of potential partners for the Yamal LNG project. Although the list was not disclosed yet, Gazprom indicated that ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were included on the list. Also Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol YPF and Petro-Canada had been mentioned as potential partners.
Novatek in cooperation with Total S.A. and China National Petroleum Corporation develops a project with the same name.
